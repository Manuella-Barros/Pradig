The defence minister said that there was a move by the security forces to clean up the Valley of armed terrorists. He said the money received by terrorists and other such groups has been squeezed post-demonetisation and there has been the effect of the actions taken by the NIA against foreign funding allegedly used for subversive activities. \"Whenever there was an encounter (earlier), hundreds and thousands would come out to throw stones. Many a times, terrorists would escape under the protection of stone throwers. This is now becoming a history.\n\n\"Those who were coming in hundred and thousands, today their number is limited to 20, 30 and 50.

Their number is also declining. Security forces are dominating them ,\" he said. He said India has been by and large free from the threat of the ISIS. \"There may be some isolated or exceptional incidents but there has been no influence in India.\" The defence minister expressed concern over some instances of glorifying the acts of terrorists or Maoists.\n\nReferring to shouting of 'anti-India slogans by some in Jawaharlal Nehru University last year, he expressed concern over the association of mainstream political parties with those raising such slogans. Jaitley said a disturbing trend is coming up where efforts are being made to show the Indian state as helpless. To questions on India's defence production, Jaitley said his ministry was working out ways to boost domestic production for the defence sector. \"We want India to become a global power in defence manufacturing sector, and towards that end, we are encouraging private players to come forward.

Terrorists in the Kashmir Valley are now on the run and they cannot continue to terrorise the people for decades, Defence Minister Arun Jaitley said on Sunday, maintaining that the government's priority was to clean up the Kashmir Valley of armed militants.\n\nHe said the terrorists in Kashmir were \"now under great pressure\" and the financial crunch caused by demonetisation and the action taken by National Investigation Agency (NIA) on illegal foreign fundings have checked illegal activities in Jammu and Kashmir.\n\nJaitley, who was participating in a television programme, however, refrained from making any comment on the standoff between India and China in the Doklam area near the Bhutan trijunction, just saying \"let us have full faith on our security forces\".\n\n\"Today no big militant can dream of committing terror acts and continue to terrorise the Valley for decades, but today their life shelf has dwindled to a few months. I will specifically praise the Jammu & Kashmir police for working hard (towards eliminating terrorists),\" he said.\n\nJaitley said the country faced two serious threats -- one with respect to Jammu and Kashmir with maximum incidents happening from across the border, and second being the problem of Left-Wing Extremism in central parts of the country.\n\n\"Since independence, Pakistan has never agreed that Kashmir is an integral part of India. That has been their unfinished agenda. They tried conventional war. But India's capability was way ahead in the conventional war. The wars of 1965, 1971 and Kargil clearly proved this,\" he said.\n\nJaitley said in the 1990s, they started changing their strategies and resorted to encouraging terrorism inside the country.\n\n\"There is domination of our forces on the Line of Control (LoC) and the international border and it is difficult for terrorists to cross them,\" he said at the India TV Conclave 'Vande Mataram'.\n\nTo a question about beheading and mutilation of Indian security force personnel by Pakistan, Jaitley said \"what happened after that, has been seen by everyone\". He was apparently referring to the surgical strike inside the parts of Pakistan Occupied Kashmir after the incident.\n\nJaitley said the forces were dominating the border with the help of technological tools. \"After surgical strikes in September last year, our forces are liquidating militants,\" he said.\n\nThe defence minister said that there was a move by the security forces to clean up the Valley of armed terrorists.\n\nHe said the money received by terrorists and other such groups has been squeezed post-demonetisation and there has been the effect of the actions taken by the NIA against foreign funding allegedly used for subversive activities.\n\n\"Whenever there was an encounter (earlier), hundreds and thousands would come out to throw stones. Many a times, terrorists would escape under the protection of stone throwers. This is now becoming a history.\n\n\"Those who were coming in hundreds and thousands, today their number is limited to 20, 30 and 50. For the first time in the history, we have been they have started looting banks,\" he said.\n\nJaitley said the terrorists are under tremendous pressure. \"They are on the run. Their number is also declining. Security forces are dominating them ,\" he said.\n\nHe said India has been by and large free from the threat of the ISIS. \"There may be some isolated or exceptional incidents but there has been no influence in India.\"\n\nThe defence minister expressed concern over some instances of glorifying the acts of terrorists or Maoists.\n\nReferring to shouting of 'anti-India slogans by some in Jawaharlal Nehru University last year, he expressed concern over the association of mainstream political parties with those raising such slogans.\n\nJaitley said a disturbing trend is coming up where efforts are being made to show the Indian state as helpless.\n\nTo questions on India's defence production, Jaitley said his ministry was working out ways to boost domestic production for the defence sector.\n\n\"We want India to become a global power in defence manufacturing sector, and towards that end, we are encouraging private players to come forward. We will, of course, also continue to strengthen our ordnance factories and defence PSUs,\" the minister said.", "time": "13:00:00"}

decades, Defence Minister Arun Jaitley said today, maintaining that the government's priority was to clean up the Kashmir Valley of armed militants.\n\nHe said the terrorists in Kashmir were \"now under great pressure\" and the financial crunch caused by demonetisation and the action taken by National Investigation Agency (NIA) on illegal foreign fundings have checked illegal activities in Jammu and Kashmir in large scale.\n\nJaitley, who was participating in a television programme, however refrained from making any comment on the standoff between India and China in the Dokalam area near the Bhutan trijunction, just saying \"let us have full faith on our security forces\".\n\n\"Today no big militant can dream of committing terror acts and continue to terrorise the Valley for decades, but today their life shelf has dwindled to a few months. I will specifically praise the Jammu & Kashmir police for working hard (towards eliminating terrorists),\" he said.\n\nJaitley said the country faced two serious threats -- one with respect to Jammu and Kashmir with maximum incidents happening from across the border, and second being the problem of Left-Wing Extremism in central parts of the country.\n\n\"Since independence, Pakistan has never agreed that Kashmir is an integral part of India. That has been their unfinished agenda. They tried conventional war. But India's capability was way ahead in the conventional war. The wars of 1965, 1971 and Kargil clearly proved this,\" he said.\n\nJaitley said in the 1990s, they started changing their strategies and resorted to encouraging terrorism inside the country.\n\n\"There is domination of our forces on the Line of Control (LoC) and the international border and it is difficult for terrorists to cross them,\" he said at the India TV Conclave 'Vande Mataram'.\n\nTo a question about beheading and mutilation of Indian security force personnel by Pakistan, Jaitley said \"what happened after that, has been seen by everyone\". He was apparently referring to the surgical strike inside the parts of Pakistan Occupied Kashmir after the incident.\n\nJaitley said the forces were dominating the border with the help of technological tools. \"After surgical strikes in September last year, our forces are liquidating militants,\" he said.\n\nThe defence minister said that there was a move by the security forces to clean up the Valley of armed terrorists.\n\nHe said the money received by terrorists and other such groups has been squeezed post-demonetisation and there has been the effect of the actions taken by the NIA against foreign funding allegedly used for subversive activities.\n\n\"Whenever there was an encounter (earlier), hundreds and thousands would come out to throw stones.

permanent solution to the Kashmir issue without compromising on the identity of the people there, Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh on Sunday, alluding to fears that the attempts were being made to revoke the special status of the troubled state.\n\nAddressing India TV's conclave on anti-terrorism, he said that the door for talks with the separatist Hurriyat Conference were open though he did not elaborate on the measures being taken to permanently solve the decades-long Kashmir imbroglio.\n\nRajnath Singh also said there was no possibility of a dialogue with Pakistan till the neighbouring country stops aiding anti-India terror activities from its soil.\n\nHe said the Kashmir problem was too simple to be solved soon and would take a time to find a permanent solution.\n\n\"Whatever steps we are now taking in Kashmir is towards a permanent solution to the issue. I will not like to clarify much, and it would not be proper too... I cannot say that I will resolve the problem within few months but the efforts are on.\"\n\nIn remarks that are likely to bring tempers down in the Kashmir Valley over fears that any attempt at doing away with the special status of the state, Rajnath Singh said: \"Kashmir should maintain its identity.\"\n\nThe comments assume significance in the backdrop of a raging debate over the continuity of articles 370 and 35(A) of the Constitution that give Jammu and Kashmir, India's only Muslim-majority state, its special status.\n\nArticle 35(A) has been challenged by a Delhi-based NGO, We the Citizens, in the Supreme Court, where the central government said last month that there was a need for a \"larger debate\" on the issue of declaring the article unconstitutional.\n\nAdded to the Constitution by a Presidential Order in 1954, the article accords special rights and privileges to the people of Jammu and Kashmir and empowers its legislature to frame any law without attracting a legal challenge.\n\nThe provision prohibits all Indians - except people from Jammu and Kashmir - from purchasing immovable property in the state, getting government jobs and availing state-sponsored scholarships. The NGO contended that the 1954 order was supposed to be a temporary provision.\n\nThe Home Minister who met Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti here on Thursday reiterated that the central government had left its doors open for every individual or group for talks on how to bring peace in the Kashmir Valley and \"are still open\".\n\n\"My door is always open, we have never closed the path of talks. I never said no to a meeting. Whenever I visited Kashmir, I have an open invitation to all,\" Rajnath Singh said in response to a question over the possibility of talks with separatists in the valley.\n\nHe said the situation in the Kashmir Valley was improving and that there has been a decline in stone-pelting incidents. He said to stop youth from taking part in the violent street protests, the government was making efforts to provide employment opportunities to them.\n\n\"We are not satisfied with this (decline). Stone-pelting must stop altogether. We have to provide jobs to Kashmiri youths,\" Rajnath Singh said.\n\nHe said the state PDP-BJP coalition government led by Mufti was cooperating with the Centre in its efforts to bring peace in the state and eliminate militants.\n\n\"I can say emphatically that the state government is not obstructing our fight against terrorism. I salute the state police for its efforts to curb terrorism,\" he said.\n\nHe said the common agenda of governance between the PDP and the BJP is an \"experiment which is continuing\".\n\nThe Home Minister said talks with Pakistan have halted for now but the peace process could resume if the neighbouring country assures New Delhi that it will not let its soil used by terrorists to perpetrate attacks against India.\n\n\"Pakistan will have to change (its stance), if not today, tomorrow (Aaj nahin sudharega, toh kal sudharna padega),\" he said.\n\nAsked why India cannot carry out an Abbottabad-type operation in which Osama bin Laden was killed by US Marines, the Home Minister replied: \"India today is not weak. We are now stronger. It is a question of time as to what to do, then we will see.\"\n\nOn a possible return of migrant Kashmiri Pandits to the valley, the Home Minister said that during late Chief Minister Mufti Mohammad Sayeed's tenure, it was agreed that they would be rehabilitated.\n\n\"I have been told some land had been earmarked. Instead of setting up separate colonies, a certain percentage from other communities would have settled with them. The Centre had no objections. But conditions changed for the worse, and the implementation is getting delayed. I cannot say that this will happen in a year or six months.

is working towards a permanent solution to the Kashmir issue without compromising on the identity of the people there, Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh on Sunday, alluding to fears that the attempts were being made to revoke the special status of the troubled state.\n\nAddressing India TV's conclave on anti-terrorism, he said that the door for talks with the separatist Hurriyat Conference were open though he did not elaborate on the measures being taken to permanently solve the decades-long Kashmir imbroglio.\n\nRajnath Singh also said there was no possibility of a dialogue with Pakistan till the neighbouring country stops aiding anti-India terror activities from its soil.\n\nHe said the Kashmir problem was too simple to be solved soon and would take a time to find a permanent solution.\n\n\"Whatever steps we are now taking in Kashmir is towards a permanent solution to the issue. I will not like to clarify much, and it would not be proper too... I cannot say that I will resolve the problem within few months but the efforts are on.\"\n\nIn remarks that are likely to bring tempers down in the Kashmir Valley over fears that any attempt at doing away with the special status of the state, Rajnath Singh said: \"Kashmir should maintain its identity.\"\n\nThe comments assume significance in the backdrop of a raging debate over the continuity of articles 370 and 35(A) of the Constitution that give Jammu and Kashmir, India's only Muslim-majority state, its special status.\n\nArticle 35(A) has been challenged by a Delhi-based NGO, We the Citizens, in the Supreme Court, where the central government said last month that there was a need for a \"larger debate\" on the issue of declaring the article unconstitutional.\n\nAdded to the Constitution by a Presidential Order in 1954, the article accords special rights and privileges to the people of Jammu and Kashmir and empowers its legislature to frame any law without attracting a legal challenge.\n\nThe provision prohibits all Indians - except people from Jammu and Kashmir - from purchasing immovable property in the state, getting government jobs and availing state-sponsored scholarships. The NGO contended that the 1954 order was supposed to be a temporary provision.\n\nThe Home Minister who met Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti here on Thursday reiterated that the central government had left its doors open for every individual or group for talks on how to bring peace in the Kashmir Valley and \"are still open\".\n\n\"My door is always open, we have never closed the path of talks. I never said no to a meeting. Whenever I visited Kashmir, I have an open invitation to all,\" Rajnath Singh said in response to a question over the possibility of talks with separatists in the valley.\n\nHe said the situation in the Kashmir Valley was improving and that there has been a decline in stone-pelting incidents. He said to stop youth from taking part in the violent street protests, the government was making efforts to provide employment opportunities to them.\n\n\"We are not satisfied with this (decline). Stone-pelting must stop altogether. We have to provide jobs to Kashmiri youths,\" Rajnath Singh said.\n\nHe said the state PDP-BJP coalition government led by Mufti was cooperating with the Centre in its efforts to bring peace in the state and eliminate militants.\n\n\"I can say emphatically that the state government is not obstructing our fight against terrorism. I salute the state police for its efforts to curb terrorism,\" he said.\n\nHe said the common agenda of governance between the PDP and the BJP is an \"experiment which is continuing\".\n\nThe Home Minister said talks with Pakistan have halted for now but the peace process could resume if the neighbouring country assures New Delhi that it will not let its soil used by terrorists to perpetrate attacks against India.\n\n\"Pakistan will have to change (its stance), if not today, tomorrow (Aaj nahin sudharega, toh kal sudharna padega),\" he said.\n\nAsked why India cannot carry out an Abbottabad-type operation in which Osama bin Laden was killed by US Marines, the Home Minister replied: \"India today is not weak. We are now stronger. It is a question of time as to what to do, then we will see.\"\n\nOn a possible return of migrant Kashmiri Pandits to the valley, the Home Minister said that during late Chief Minister Mufti Mohammad Sayeed's tenure, it was agreed that they would be rehabilitated.\n\n\"I have been told some land had been earmarked. Instead of setting up separate colonies, a certain percentage from other communities would have settled with them. The Centre had no objections. But conditions changed for the worse, and the implementation is getting delayed. I cannot say that this will happen in a year or six months. It cannot be done in a hurry,\" he said.\n\n--IANS\n\nmak-sar/vd\n\nSEARCH", "time": "17:21:00"}

I will not like to clarify much, and it would not be proper too. Kashmir should maintain its identity,\" he said in his address at the India TV conclave 'Vande Mataram'.\n\nFile image of Rajnath Singh. AFP\n\nHe said that there has been a decline in stone pelting incidents in the Valley but they should totally stop.\n\n\"We are not satisfied with this. Stone pelting must stop altogether. We have to provide jobs to Kashmiri youth,\" he said.\n\nOn the PDP-BJP government in Kashmir, Rajnath Singh said that the common agenda of governance is an \"experiment which is continuing\".\n\n\"I can say emphatically that the state government is not obstructing our fight against terrorism. I salute the state police for its efforts to curb terrorism,\" he said.\n\nThe home minister reiterated that the Centre \"never closed the doors for talks\", even with Hurriyat leaders, and they are \"still open\".\n\nOn the return of Kashmiri Pandits to the Valley, he said that during the tenure of late chief minister Mufti Mohammad Sayeed, it was agreed that they would be rehabilitated.\n\n\"I have been told some land had been earmarked. Instead of setting up separate colonies, a certain percentage from other communities would have settled with them. The Centre had no objections. But conditions changed for the worse, and the implementation is getting delayed. I cannot say that this will happen in a year or six months. It cannot be done in a hurry,\" he said.\n\nAsked why India cannot carry out an Abbottabad-type operation in which US forces assassinated Al-Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden, Rajnath Singh replied: \"I would only say that today India is not weak. It is a question of time as to what to do, then we will see.\"\n\nHe said that talks with Pakistan have halted for now but if the neighbouring country assures India that it will not let its soil used by terrorists to perpetrate attacks against India, talks can resume.\n\n\"Pakistan will have to change (its stance), aaj nahin sudharega, toh kal sudharna padega (if not today, they will have to change tomorrow),\" he said.\n\nOn yoga guru Swami Ramdev's assertion that India should \"conquer\" Pakistan-administered Kashmir, the home minister said: \"We also occasionally think about this.

Their number is also declining. Security forces are dominating them,\" Jaitley said during a television programme.\n\nThe minister also mentioned that demonetisation has impacted terror funding significantly and that the action taken by the National Investigation Agency on illegal foreign fundings has checked subversive activities in militancy-hit state.\n\n\"Today no big militant can dream of committing terror acts and continue to terrorise the Valley for decades, but today their life shelf has dwindled to a few months. I will specifically praise the Jammu & Kashmir police for working hard (towards eliminating terrorists),\" Jaitley stated.\n\nHowever, he refrained from making any comment on the ongoing standoff between Indian and Chinese armies in the Sikkim sector near the Bhutan trijunction. He said, \"let us have full faith in our security forces\".\n\nJaitley asserted that Kashmir is an integral part of India, and said India has proved time and again of her military prowess in 1965, 1971 and Kargil war. \"Since independence, Pakistan has never agreed that Kashmir is an integral part of India. That has been their unfinished agenda. They tried conventional war. But India's capability was way ahead in the conventional war. The wars of 1965, 1971 and Kargil clearly proved this,\" he said.\n\nHe added that terrorists are finding it difficult to infiltrate into India due to the domination of Indian forces on the Line of Control and the international border.\n\nCommenting on India's defence production, Jaitley said his government was committed to bolstering domestic production for the defense sector. \"We want India to become a global power in defence manufacturing sector, and towards that end, we are encouraging private players to come forward. We will, of course, also continue to strengthen our ordnance factories and defence PSUs,\" the minister said.\n\nWith PTI inputs\n\nFor all the latest India News, download Indian Express App\n\nTags: Arun Jaitley Kashmir militancy", "time": "10:38:00"}

the neighbouring country stops aiding anti-India terror activities from its soil.(Mohd Zakir / HT file )\n\nThe government is working towards a permanent solution to the Kashmir issue without compromising on the identity of the people there, Union home minister Rajnath Singh on Sunday, alluding to fears that the attempts were being made to revoke the special status of the troubled state.\n\nAddressing India TV's conclave on anti-terrorism, he said the door for talks with the separatist Hurriyat Conference were open though he did not elaborate on the measures being taken to permanently solve the decades-long Kashmir imbroglio.\n\nSingh also said there was no possibility of a dialogue with Pakistan till the neighbouring country stops aiding anti-India terror activities from its soil.\n\nHe said the Kashmir problem was too simple to be solved soon and would take a time to find a permanent solution.\n\n\"Whatever steps we are now taking in Kashmir is towards a permanent solution to the issue. I will not like to clarify much, and it would not be proper too... I cannot say that I will resolve the problem within few months but the efforts are on.\"\n\nIn remarks that are likely to bring tempers down in the Kashmir Valley over fears that any attempt at doing away with the special status of the state, Singh said: \"Kashmir should maintain its identity.\"\n\nThe comments assume significance in the backdrop of a raging debate over the continuity of articles 370 and 35(A) of the Constitution that give Jammu and Kashmir, India's only Muslim-majority state, its special status.\n\nArticle 35(A) has been challenged by a Delhi-based NGO, We the Citizens, in the Supreme Court, where the central government said last month that there was a need for a \"larger debate\" on the issue of declaring the article unconstitutional.\n\nAdded to the Constitution by a Presidential Order in 1954, the article accords special rights and privileges to the people of Jammu and Kashmir and empowers its legislature to frame any law without attracting a legal challenge.\n\nThe provision prohibits all Indians -- except people from Jammu and Kashmir -- from purchasing immovable property in the state, getting government jobs and availing state-sponsored scholarships. The NGO contended that the 1954 order was supposed to be a temporary provision.\n\nThe home minister, who met chief minister Mehbooba Mufti, in New Delhi on Thursday reiterated that the central government had left its doors open for every individual or group for talks on how to bring peace in the Kashmir Valley and \"are still open\".\n\n\"My door is always open, we have never closed the path of talks. I never said no to a meeting. Whenever I visited Kashmir, I have an open invitation to all,\" Singh said in response to a question over the possibility of talks with separatists in the valley.\n\nHe said the situation in the Kashmir Valley was improving and that there has been a decline in stone-pelting incidents. He said to stop youth from taking part in the violent street protests, the government was making efforts to provide employment opportunities to them.\n\n\"We are not satisfied with this (decline). Stone-pelting must stop altogether. We have to provide jobs to Kashmiri youths,\" Rajnath Singh said.\n\nHe said the state PDP-BJP coalition government led by Mufti was cooperating with the Centre in its efforts to bring peace in the state and eliminate militants.\n\n\"I can say emphatically that the state government is not obstructing our fight against terrorism. I salute the state police for its efforts to curb terrorism,\" he said.\n\nHe said the common agenda of governance between the PDP and the BJP is an \"experiment which is continuing\".\n\nHe said talks with Pakistan have halted for now but the peace process could resume if the neighbouring country assures New Delhi that it will not let its soil used by terrorists to perpetrate attacks against India.\n\n\"Pakistan will have to change (its stance), if not today, tomorrow (Aaj nahin sudharega, toh kal sudharna padega),\" he said.\n\nAsked why India cannot carry out an Abbottabad-type operation in which Osama bin Laden was killed by US Marines, the home minister replied: \"India today is not weak. We are now stronger. It is a question of time as to what to do, then we will see.\"\n\nOn a possible return of migrant Kashmiri Pandits to the valley, the home minister said that during late chief minister Mufti Mohammad Sayeed's tenure, it was agreed that they would be rehabilitated.\n\n\"I have been told some land had been earmarked. Instead of setting up separate colonies, a certain percentage from other communities would have settled with them. The Centre had no objections. But conditions changed for the worse, and the implementation is getting delayed. I cannot say that this will happen in a year or six months. It cannot be done in a hurry,\" he said.", "timeCrawl": "17:49:00", "sim": 0.8980392217636108, "extractedDates": null, "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-13", "id": "8949053", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "id": 41, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "id": 161, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "id": 164, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial_Disputes", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial Disputes", "id": 773, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}], "page": 1, "pages": 26, "totalResults": 26}}}

Friday will mark the two-year anniversary of the shooting where a gunman killed 19 students and two teachers.\n\nBy Acacia Coronado and Jim Vertuno, Associated Press\n\nTuesday, May 21, 2024 | 10:37 p.m.\n\nUVALDE, Texas -- The families of 19 of the victims in the Uvalde elementary school shooting in Texas have scheduled a news conference Wednesday ahead of the upcoming two-year anniversary of one of the deadliest school shootings in U.S. history.\n\nThe attack at Robb Elementary School on May 24, 2022 killed 19 fourth-graders and two teachers when the teenage gunman burst into their classroom and began shooting.\n\nOne of the attorneys representing the Uvalde families, Josh Koskoff of Connecticut, helped families of the victims in the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting win a $1.4 billion defamation judgement against conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, and reach a $73 million settlement with gunmaker Remington, the company that made the rifle used at Sandy Hook.\n\nA number of lawsuits have already been filed over the Uvalde shooting. Several families of Uvalde victims did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nA December 2022 lawsuit against local and state police, the city and other school and law enforcement, seeks at least $27 billion and class-action status for survivors. And at least two lawsuits have been filed against Georgia-based gun manufacturer Daniel Defense, which made the AR-style rifle used by the gunman.\n\nThe police response to the mass shooting has been criticized and scrutinized by state and federal authorities.\n\nMore than 370 local, state and federal officers responded to the scene but waited for more than 70 minutes before confronting the shooter. Terrified students inside the classroom called 911 as agonized parents begged officers, some of whom could hear shots being fired while they stood in a hallway, to go in.\n\nA tactical team of officers eventually went into the classroom and killed the shooter.\n\nA 600-page Justice Department report in January catalogued a \"cascading failures\" in training, communication, leadership and technology problems that day.\n\nAnother report commissioned by the city also noted rippling missteps by law enforcement, but defended the actions of local police, which sparked anger from victim families.\n\nA criminal investigation into the police response by Uvalde District Attorney Christina Mitchell's office remains ongoing. A grand jury was summoned earlier this year and some law enforcement officials have already been called to testify.", "source": {"uri": "lasvegassun.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Las Vegas Sun"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@lasvegassun.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": true}, {"uri": "jim_vertuno@lasvegassun.com", "name": "Jim Vertuno", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "acacia_coronado@lasvegassun.com", "name": "Acacia Coronado", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uvalde,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Uvalde, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Uvalde, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robb_Elementary_School_shooting", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Robb Elementary School shooting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School_shooting", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "School shooting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandy_Hook_Elementary_School_shooting", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronado,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coronado, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Coronado, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Jones", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alex Jones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Settlement_(litigation)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Settlement (litigation)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remington_Arms", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Remington Arms"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "History of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defamation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Defamation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspiracy_theory", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Conspiracy theory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rifle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rifle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connecticut", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Connecticut"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Connecticut"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Defense", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Daniel Defense"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_shooting", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mass shooting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Class action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_jury", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Grand jury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "District attorney"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Violence_and_Abuse", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Violence and Abuse", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Research", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Research", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://media.lasvegassun.com/media/img/photos/2024/05/21/AP24142731018664_t1200.jpg?a58a258a4dac404905303588401680fdf3ee23e4", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9588611", "eventUri": "eng-9588611", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.4196078431372549, "wgt": 242, "relevance": 1}

Nineteen fourth-graders and two teachers were killed on May 24, 2022, when a teenage gunman burst into their classroom at Robb Elementary School and began shooting.\n\nThe lawsuit is the latest of several seeking accountability for the law enforcement response. More than 370 federal, state and local officers converged on the scene, but they waited more than 70 minutes before confronting the shooter.\n\nIt is the first lawsuit to come after a 600-page Justice Department report was released in January that cataloged \"cascading failures\" in training, communication, leadership and technology problems that day.\n\nThe lawsuit notes state troopers did not follow their active shooter training and responsibility to confront the shooter, even as the students and teachers inside were following their own lockdown protocols of turning off lights, locking doors and staying silent.\n\n\"The protocols trap teachers and students inside, leaving them fully reliant on law enforcement to respond quickly and effectively,\" the families and their attorneys said in a statement.\n\nTerrified students inside the classroom called 911 as agonized parents begged officers, some of whom could hear shots being fired while they stood in a hallway, to go in. A tactical team of officers eventually went into the classroom and killed the shooter.\n\n\"Law-enforcement's inaction that day was a complete and absolute betrayal of these families and the sons, daughters and mothers they lost,\" said Erin Rogiers, one of the attorneys for the families. \"TXDPS had the resources, training and firepower to respond appropriately, and they ignored all of it and failed on every level. These families have not only the right but also the responsibility to demand justice.\"\n\nA criminal investigation into the police response by Uvalde District Attorney Christina Mitchell's office remains ongoing. A grand jury was summoned this year, and some law enforcement officials have already been called to testify.\n\nThe lawsuit against 92 Texas Department of Public Safety officials and troopers also names the Uvalde School District, former Robb Elementary Principal Mandy Gutierrez and former Uvalde schools police Chief Peter Arredondo as defendants.\n\nAnother lawsuit filed in December 2022 against local and state police, the city, and other school and law enforcement, seeks at least $27 billion and class-action status for survivors. And at least two other lawsuits have been filed against Georgia-based gun manufacturer Daniel Defense, which made the AR-style rifle used by the gunman.\n\nThe settlement with the city was capped at $2 million because the families said they didn't want to bankrupt the city where they still live and to allow the community to continue to heal. The settlement will be paid from city's insurance coverage.\n\nUnder the settlement, the city agreed to a new \"fitness for duty\" standard and enhanced training for Uvalde police officers. It also establishes May 24 as an annual day of remembrance, a permanent memorial in the city plaza, and support for mental health services for the families and the greater Uvalde area.\n\nThe police response to the mass shooting has been criticized and scrutinized by state and federal authorities.\n\nAnother report commissioned by the city also noted rippling missteps by law enforcement but defended the actions of local police, which sparked anger from victims' families.\n\n\"For two long years, we have languished in pain and without any accountability from the law enforcement agencies and officers who allowed our families to be destroyed that day,\" said Veronica Luevanos, whose daughter Jailah and nephew Jayce were killed. \"This settlement reflects a first good faith effort, particularly by the City of Uvalde, to begin rebuilding trust in the systems that failed to protect us.\"", "source": {"uri": "10news.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KGTV"}, "authors": [],

Nineteen fourth-graders and two teachers were killed on May 24, 2022, when a teenage gunman burst into their classroom at Robb Elementary School and began shooting.\n\nThe lawsuit, seeking at least $500 million in damages, is the latest of several seeking accountability for the law enforcement response. More than 370 federal, state and local officers converged on the scene, but they waited more than 70 minutes before confronting the shooter.\n\nIt is the first lawsuit to be filed after a 600-page Justice Department report was released in January that catalogued \"cascading failures\" in training, communication, leadership and technology problems that day.\n\nThe lawsuit notes that state troopers did not follow their active shooter training or confront the shooter, even as the students and teachers inside were following their own lockdown protocols of turning off lights, locking doors and staying silent.\n\n\"The protocols trap teachers and students inside, leaving them fully reliant on law enforcement to respond quickly and effectively,\" the families and their attorneys said in a statement.\n\nTerrified students inside the classroom called 911 as agonized parents begged officers -- some of whom could hear shots being fired while they stood in a hallway -- to go in.

These families have not only the right but also the responsibility to demand justice.\"\n\nA criminal investigation into the police response by Uvalde District Attorney Christina Mitchell's office is ongoing.

A separate lawsuit filed by different plaintiffs in December 2022 against local and state police, the city, and other school and law enforcement, seeks at least $27 billion and class-action status for survivors. And at least two other lawsuits have been filed against Georgia-based gun manufacturer Daniel Defense, which made the AR-style rifle used by the gunman.\n\nThe families said the settlement with the city was capped at $2 million because they didn't want to bankrupt the city where they still live. The settlement will be paid from the city's insurance coverage.\n\n\"The last thing they want to do was inflict financial hardship on their friend and neighbors in this community. Their friends and neighbors didn't let them down,\" Josh Koskoff, one of the attorneys for the families, said during a news conference in Uvalde on Wednesday.\n\nBut Javier Cazares, the father of slain 9-year-old Jackie Cazares, noted that the announcement -- which was made in the same Uvalde Civic Center where the families gathered to be told their children were dead or wounded -- was sparsely attended.\n\n\"On the way over here, I saw the sticker, which I see everywhere, 'Uvalde Strong.' If that was the case, this room should be filled, and then some. Show your support. It's been an unbearable two years. ... No amount of money is worth the lives of our children. Justice and accountability has always been my main concern.\"\n\nUnder the settlement, the city agreed to a new \"fitness for duty\" standard and enhanced training for Uvalde police officers. It also establishes May 24 as an annual day of remembrance, a permanent memorial in the city plaza, and support for mental health services for the families and the greater Uvalde area.\n\nThe police response to the mass shooting has been criticized and scrutinized by state and federal authorities. A 600-page Justice Department report in January catalogued \"cascading failures\" in training, communication, leadership and technology problems that day,\n\nAnother report commissioned by the city also noted rippling missteps by law enforcement but defended the actions of local police, which sparked anger from victims' families.\n\n\"For two long years, we have languished in pain and without any accountability from the law enforcement agencies and officers who allowed our families to be destroyed that day,\" Veronica Luevanos, whose daughter Jailah and nephew Jayce were killed, said

The families say they also agreed a $2 million settlement with the city, under which city leaders promised higher standards and better training for local police. (AP Photo/Eric Gay)\n\nThe families of 19 of the victims in the Uvalde elementary school shooting in Texas on Wednesday announced a $500 million federal lawsuit against nearly 100 state police officers who were part of the botched law enforcement response to one of the deadliest school shootings in U.S. history.\n\nThe families said they also agreed to a $2 million settlement with the city, under which city leaders promised higher standards and better training for local police.\n\nThe announcement in Uvalde came two days before the two-year anniversary of the massacre. Nineteen fourth-graders and two teachers were killed on May 24, 2022, when a teenage gunman burst into their classroom at Robb Elementary School and began shooting.\n\nThe lawsuit, seeking at least $500 million in damages, is the latest of several seeking accountability for the law enforcement response. More than 370 federal, state and local officers converged on the scene, but they waited more than 70 minutes before confronting the shooter.\n\nIt is the first lawsuit to be filed after a 600-page Justice Department report was released in January that catalogued \"cascading failures\" in training, communication, leadership and technology problems that day.\n\nThe lawsuit notes that state troopers did not follow their active shooter training or confront the shooter, even as the students and teachers inside were following their own lockdown protocols of turning off lights, locking doors and staying silent.\n\n\"The protocols trap teachers and students inside, leaving them fully reliant on law enforcement to respond quickly and effectively,\" the families and their attorneys said in a statement.\n\nTerrified students inside the classroom called 911 as agonized parents begged officers -- some of whom could hear shots being fired while they stood in a hallway -- to go in. A tactical team of officers eventually went into the classroom and killed the shooter.\n\n\"Law enforcement's inaction that day was a complete and absolute betrayal of these families and the sons, daughters and mothers they lost,\" said Erin Rogiers, one of the attorneys for the families. \"TXDPS had the resources, training and firepower to respond appropriately, and they ignored all of it and failed on every level. These families have not only the right but also the responsibility to demand justice.\"\n\nA criminal investigation into the police response by Uvalde District Attorney Christina Mitchell's office is ongoing. A grand jury was summoned this year, and some law enforcement officials have already been called to testify.\n\nThe latest lawsuit against 92 Texas Department of Public Safety officials and troopers also names the Uvalde School District, former Robb Elementary Principal Mandy Gutierrez and former Uvalde schools police Chief Peter Arredondo as defendants. The state police response was second only to U.S. Border Patrol, which had nearly 150 agents respond.\n\nThe list of DPS officials named as defendants includes two troopers who were fired, another who left the agency and several more whom the agency said it investigated. The highest ranking DPS official among the defendants is South Texas Regional Director Victor Escalon.\n\nThe Texas DPS did not respond to efforts by The Associated Press seeking comment Wednesday.\n\nThe plaintiffs are the families of 17 children killed and two more who were wounded. A separate lawsuit filed by different plaintiffs in December 2022 against local and state police, the city, and other school and law enforcement, seeks at least $27 billion and class-action status for survivors. And at least two other lawsuits have been filed against Georgia-based gun manufacturer Daniel Defense, which made the AR-style rifle used by the gunman.\n\nThe families said the settlement with the city was capped at $2 million because they didn't want to bankrupt the city where they still live. The settlement will be paid from the city's insurance coverage.\n\n\"The last thing they want to do was inflict financial hardship on their friend and neighbors in this community.

Nineteen fourth-graders and two teachers were killed on May 24, 2022, when a teenage gunman burst into their classroom at Robb Elementary School and began shooting.\n\nThe lawsuit is the latest of several seeking accountability for the law enforcement response. More than 370 federal, state and local officers converged on the scene, but they waited more than 70 minutes before confronting the shooter.\n\nIt is the first lawsuit to come after a 600-page Justice Department report was released in January that cataloged \"cascading failures\" in training, communication, leadership and technology problems that day.\n\nThe lawsuit notes state troopers did not follow their active shooter training and responsibility to confront the shooter, even as the students and teachers inside were following their own lockdown protocols of turning off lights, locking doors and staying silent.\n\n\"The protocols trap teachers and students inside, leaving them fully reliant on law enforcement to respond quickly and effectively,\" the families and their attorneys said in a statement.\n\nTerrified students inside the classroom called 911 as agonized parents begged officers, some of whom could hear shots being fired while they stood in a hallway, to go in. A tactical team of officers eventually went into the classroom and killed the shooter.\n\n\"Law-enforcement's inaction that day was a complete and absolute betrayal of these families and the sons, daughters and mothers they lost,\" said Erin Rogiers, one of the attorneys for the families. \"TXDPS had the resources, training and firepower to respond appropriately, and they ignored all of it and failed on every level. These families have not only the right but also the responsibility to demand justice.\"\n\nA criminal investigation into the police response by Uvalde District Attorney Christina Mitchell's office remains ongoing. A grand jury was summoned this year, and some law enforcement officials have already been called to testify.\n\nThe lawsuit against 92 Texas Department of Public Safety officials and troopers also names the Uvalde School District, former Robb Elementary Principal Mandy Gutierrez and former Uvalde schools police Chief Peter Arredondo as defendants.\n\nAnother lawsuit filed in December 2022 against local and state police, the city, and other school and law enforcement, seeks at least $27 billion and class-action status for survivors. And at least two other lawsuits have been filed against Georgia-based gun manufacturer Daniel Defense, which made the AR-style rifle used by the gunman.\n\nThe settlement with the city was capped at $2 million because the families said they didn't want to bankrupt the city where they still live and to allow the community to continue to heal. The settlement will be paid from the city's insurance coverage.\n\nUnder the settlement, the city agreed to a new \"fitness for duty\" standard and enhanced training for Uvalde police officers. It also establishes May 24 as an annual day of remembrance, a permanent memorial in the city plaza, and support for mental health services for the families and the greater Uvalde area.\n\nAnother report commissioned by the city also noted rippling missteps by law enforcement but defended the actions of local police, which sparked anger from victims' families.\n\n\"For two long years, we have languished in pain and without any accountability from the law enforcement agencies and officers who allowed our families to be destroyed that day,\" said Veronica Luevanos, whose daughter Jailah and nephew Jayce were killed. \"This settlement reflects a first good faith effort, particularly by the City of Uvalde, to begin rebuilding trust in the systems that failed to protect us.\"", "source": {"uri": "voanews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "VOA Voice of America"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School_shooting", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "School shooting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_police", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "State police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uvalde,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Uvalde, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Uvalde, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robb_Elementary_School_shooting", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Robb Elementary School shooting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Settlement_(litigation)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Settlement (litigation)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "History of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lockdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Criminal investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_shooter", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Active shooter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accountability", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Accountability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "District attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Defense", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Daniel Defense"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Class action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_jury", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Grand jury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Department_of_Public_Safety", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Texas Department of Public Safety"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement_agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bankruptcy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bankruptcy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mental health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Insurance"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Violence_and_Abuse", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Violence and Abuse", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Research", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Research", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 54}], "image": "https://gdb.voanews.com/01000000-0aff-0242-6820-08dc7a84bef5_w1200_r1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9588611", "eventUri": "eng-9588611", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-24", "textStart": 3469, "textEnd": 3475}], "sentiment": -0.2313725490196078, "wgt": 220, "relevance": 1}

A separate lawsuit filed by different plaintiffs in December 2022 against local and state police, the city, and other school and law enforcement, seeks at least $27 billion and class-action status for survivors. And at least two other lawsuits have been filed against Georgia-based gun manufacturer Daniel Defense, which made the AR-style rifle used by the gunman.\n\nThe families said the settlement with the city was capped at $2 million because they didn't want to bankrupt the city where they still live. The settlement will be paid from the city's insurance coverage.\n\n\"The last thing they want to do was inflict financial hardship on their friend and neighbors in this community. Their friends and neighbors didn't let them down,\" Josh Koskoff, one of the attorneys for the families, said during a news conference in Uvalde on Wednesday.\n\nBut Javier Cazares, the father of slain 9-year-old Jackie Cazares, noted that the announcement -- which was made in the same Uvalde Civic Center where the families gathered to be told their children were dead or wounded -- was sparsely attended.\n\n\"On the way over here, I saw the sticker, which I see everywhere, 'Uvalde Strong.' If that was the case, this room should be filled, and then some. Show your support. It's been an unbearable two years. ... No amount of money is worth the lives of our children. Justice and accountability has always been my main concern.\"\n\nUnder the settlement, the city agreed to a new \"fitness for duty\" standard and enhanced training for Uvalde police officers. It also establishes May 24 as an annual day of remembrance, a permanent memorial in the city plaza, and support for mental health services for the families and the greater Uvalde area.\n\nThe police response to the mass shooting has been criticized and scrutinized by state and federal authorities.

It took 70 minutes for officers at the scene to confront the shooter while students and teachers huddled inside classrooms.\n\n\"Law-enforcement's inaction that day was a complete and absolute betrayal of these families and the sons, daughters and mothers they lost,\" said Erin Rogiers, an attorney for the families.\n\nThe police response has received heavy scrutiny and criticism with multiple failures documented in reports conducted by state and federal agencies.\n\n\"For two long years, we have languished in pain and without any accountability from the law enforcement agencies and officers who allowed our families to be destroyed that day. This settlement reflects a first good faith effort by the City of Uvalde to begin rebuilding trust in the systems that failed to protect us,\" Veronica Luevanos, whose daughter Jailah and nephew Jayce were killed, said in a statement.\n\n\"But it wasn't just Uvalde officers who failed us that day. Nearly 100 officers from the Texas Department of Public Safety have yet to face a shred of accountability for cowering in fear while my daughter and nephew bled to death in their classroom.\"\n\nIn the lawsuit, the families said state troopers did not follow active shooter training and responsibility to confront the shooter, even as the people inside the classroom were following their own protocol. Pete Arredondo, who was chief of the Uvalde public school police department at the time, and Mandy Gutierrez, who was principal of the school, are also named as defendants in the lawsuit.\n\n\"The protocols trap teachers and students inside, leaving them fully reliant on law enforcement to respond quickly and effectively,\" the families and their attorneys said in a statement.\n\nThere are several lawsuits that have already been filed over the response to the mass shooting, which had nearly 400 officers from all levels of government converge on the scene but wait more than an hour before confronting the shooter.

It will also require the city to create a permanent memorial and to make 24 May -- the day the shooting occurred -- an annual \"Day of Remembrance.\"\n\n\"For two long years, we have languished in pain and without any accountability from the law enforcement agencies and officers who allowed our families to be destroyed that day.

Law enforcement officials at the scene were also named in the suit, CNN reports.\n\nIn December 2022, the families of the survivors filed a $27bn class action lawsuit in federal court against multiple Texas law enforcement agencies.

The whole world saw that.\n\n\"No amount of money is worth the lives of our children. Justice and accountability has always been my main concern. We've been let down so many times, that time has come to do the right thing,\" he said.\n\nThe city confirmed the settlement in a statement.\n\n\"Today, we are thankful to join the victims' families in arriving at an agreement that will allow us to remember the Robb Elementary tragedy while moving forward together as a community to bring healing and restoration to all those affected,\" the city said. \"We will forever be grateful to the victims' families for working with us over the past year to cultivate an environment of community-wide healing that honors the lives and memories of those we tragically lost. May 24th is our community's greatest tragedy.\"\n\nCNN has reached out to the Texas Department of Public Safety, the DPS Officers Association, and the Uvalde Independent School District for response.\n\nThe announcement of the settlement and the latest legal action come just before the two-year anniversary of the mass shooting in which an 18-year-old stormed into the elementary school, killed 19 children and two teachers and barricaded himself in a classroom. A total of 376 law enforcement officers from across the region rushed to the school to respond, but ultimately none of them breached the door to the classroom to confront the shooter for 77 minutes.\n\nThe slow response was at odds with law enforcement active shooter protocols, widely accepted after the Columbine school shooting in 1999, to stop the threat immediately.\n\nAs part of the settlement, Uvalde will pay the families a total of $2 million from its insurance coverage, according to a statement from attorneys Josh Koskoff and Erin Rogiers.\n\nIn addition, the city pledged to institute several policy changes to the police department, such as a new \"fitness for duty\" standard for police officers. The city will also establish May 24 as an annual Day of Remembrance, will create a committee to coordinate designing a permanent memorial and will support mental health services for the families, survivors and community, the attorneys said.\n\nThe terms of the settlement were reached through a \"restorative justice process\" between impacted families and the city, the attorneys said. Pursuing further legal action against Uvalde could have bankrupted the city, a result that none of the families wanted, they added.\n\nIn a statement, Koskoff called the settlement a step in the healing process, and the mother of a student who was killed said it reflected a \"good faith effort.\"\n\n\"For two long years, we have languished in pain and without any accountability from the law enforcement agencies and officers who allowed our families to be destroyed that day. This settlement reflects a first good faith effort by the City of Uvalde to begin rebuilding trust in the systems that failed to protect us,\" Veronica Luevanos, whose daughter Jailah and nephew Jayce were killed, said in a statement.\n\n\"But it wasn't just Uvalde officers who failed us that day. Nearly 100 officers from the Texas Department of Public Safety have yet to face a shred of accountability for cowering in fear while my daughter and nephew bled to death in their classroom.\"\n\nAlso Wednesday, the attorneys announced they are suing 92 individual Texas DPS officers, the school district and several employees for their alleged failures responding to the shooting.\n\n\"Law enforcement's inaction that day was a complete and absolute betrayal of these families and the sons, daughters and mothers they lost,\" Rogiers said in the statement. \"TXDPS had the resources, training and firepower to respond appropriately, and they ignored all of it and failed on every level. These families have not only the right but also the responsibility to demand justice, both for their own loss and to prevent other families from suffering the same fate.\"\n\nThe disastrous police response has been criticized in a series of government investigative reports, although no one has faced criminal repercussions. A scathing US Department of Justice report in January blamed the failed response on \"cascading failures of leadership, decision-making, tactics, policy, and training\" on the part of law enforcement officials and said lives would have been saved if police had followed generally accepted practices.\n\nUvalde school district police chief Pete Arredondo was fired in August 2022 for his role in the failed response to the mass shooting. His replacement, Joshua Gutierrez, has submitted his resignation and his last day on the job is set for June, according to a school official's statement.\n\nThe lawsuit announced Wednesday is just the latest civil action related to the mass shooting.\n\nPreviously, the family of Eliahna Torres, a 10-year-old victim, filed a lawsuit in November 2022 against nearly two dozen people and entities, including the gun manufacturer and store that provided the rifle used in the attack and law enforcement officials who responded to the scene. In addition, survivors of the shooting filed a $27 billion class action lawsuit in federal court in December 2022 against multiple Texas law enforcement agencies. A trial date has not been set in either lawsuit.\n\nOfficials have said the shooter legally purchased the guns in the days after his 18th birthday. The carnage remains among the deadliest episodes in America's ongoing scourge of school shootings.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros. Discovery Company.

Law enforcement officers killed the gunman in a classroom after waiting more than an hour to confront him, which was heavily criticized in the wake of the shooting.\n\nIn the settlement announced Wednesday, the city of Uvalde will pay a total of $2 million to the families of 17 children killed in the shooting and two children who survived, according to a statement from the families' attorneys.\n\n\"Pursuing further legal action against the City could have plunged Uvalde into bankruptcy, something that none of the families were interested in as they look for the community to heal,\" the statement said.\n\nThe money will come from the city's insurance coverage, attorney Josh Koskoff told reporters at a news conference.\n\n\"These families could have pursued a lawsuit against the city, and there's certainly grounds for a lawsuit,\" Koskoff said. \"Let's face it, sadly, we all saw what we saw ... but instead of suing the city and jeopardizing the finances of anybody, the families have accepted simply the insurance.\"\n\nThe group was working on a separate settlement with Uvalde County, Koskoff said.\n\nThe settlement also includes the Uvalde Police Department committing to provide enhanced training for police officers and implement a new standard for officers to be developed in coordination with the U.S. Justice Department, according to the families' attorneys. The city also committed to supporting mental health services for the families, survivors and community members, creating a committee to coordinate with the families on a permanent memorial and establishing May 24 as an annual day of remembrance, in addition to taking other measures.\n\nThe families are also taking new legal action against 92 state Department of Public Safety officers and the school district, including former Robb Elementary School principal Mandy Gutierrez and Pete Arredondo, the school district's police chief who was fired months after the shooting.\n\n\"Law enforcement did not treat the incident as an active shooter situation, despite clear knowledge that there was an active shooter inside,\" Wednesday's statement said. \"... The shooter was able to continue the killing spree for over an hour while helpless families waited anxiously outside the school.\"\n\nA Justice Department report released in January called the police response a failure.\n\n\"Had the law enforcement agencies followed generally accepted practices ... lives would have been saved and people would have survived,\" Attorney General Merrick Garland told reporters at the time.\n\nAt Wednesday's news conference, Koskoff said the families would \"down the line\" be suing the federal government, noting that many federal law enforcement officers also responded to the shooting.", "source": {"uri": "cbsnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robb_Elementary_School_shooting", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Robb Elementary School shooting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Settlement_(litigation)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Settlement (litigation)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uvalde,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Uvalde, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Uvalde, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Department_of_Public_Safety", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Texas Department of Public Safety"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School_district", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "School district"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Insurance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uvalde_County,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Uvalde County, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Uvalde County, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merrick_Garland", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Merrick Garland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_shooter", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Active shooter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Attorney_General", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Attorney General"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_of_police", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief of police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement_agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mental health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal government of the United States"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law_Enforcement", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law Enforcement", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Violence_and_Abuse", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Violence and Abuse", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Research", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Research", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/05/22/db23e08e-fc22-4cdb-b4bd-79d67c44d925/thumbnail/1200x630/ba2e1d4ab8d16c2d3c5e301230754021/ap24143668339567.jpg?v=dac66bdad19d0be8e87f46552b582682", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9588611", "eventUri": "eng-9588611", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-24", "textStart": 1976, "textEnd": 1982}], "sentiment": -0.1529411764705882, "wgt": 198, "relevance": 1}

The agreement also includes several items aimed at improving the Uvalde police force and helping the community heal.\n\nAs part of the settlement, Uvalde officials said they would work to hire more qualified police officers, and implement new training procedures as well as a \"fitness for duty\" standard. The city said it would also fund a permanent memorial for the victims, provide mental health services for survivors and families, and designate May 24, the day of the shooting, as an official day of remembrance.\n\nThe $2 million settlement notably avoids a lawsuit, which the plaintiffs acknowledged could've been a long and expensive ordeal that might've bankrupted the city (\"something that none of the families were interested in as they look for the community to heal\" a statement announcing the settlement noted).\n\nVeronica Luevanos, whose daughter Jailah and nephew Jayce died in the shooting, said, \"For two long years, we have languished in pain and without any accountability from the law enforcement agencies and officers who allowed our families to be destroyed that day. This settlement reflects a first good faith effort, particularly by the City of Uvalde, to begin rebuilding trust in the systems that failed to protect us.\"\n\nThe response of law enforcement officials to the 2022 massacre has been described as a major failure following investigations by both the Department of Justice and the Texas House of Representatives. Officials infamously waited outside Robb Elementary for over an hour before finally entering and confronting the gunman, who was killed inside a classroom.\n\nAs such, the new lawsuit against 92 Texas Department of Public Safety officers accuses the officers of not doing enough to stop the gunman during the massacre. \"These officers were so terrified that they chose to abandon their burden to the Uvalde community: Put themselves between a very dangerous person and a child,\" said Josh Koskoff, a lawyer for the families (via The New York Times).\n\nThe lawsuit also names as defendants the Uvalde School District and several employees, including the principal and school district police chief at the time of the shooting. The families have alleged the school's lockdown procedures, such as turning off the lights and locking the doors, exacerbated the damage as it left them \"fully reliant on law enforcement to respond.\"\n\nKoskoff added that the families are planning to bring a lawsuit against the federal government, as over 150 federal officers were present during the shooting, as well.\n\n\"Justice and accountability has always been a main concern -- we've been let down so many times,\" said Javier Cazares, whose 9-year-old daughter, Jackie, was one of the victims. \"The time has come to do the right thing.\"", "source": {"uri": "rollingstone.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Rolling Stone"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jon_blistein@rollingstone.com", "name": "Jon Blistein", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uvalde,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Uvalde, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Uvalde, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massacre", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Massacre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robb_Elementary_School_shooting", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Robb Elementary School shooting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damages", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Damages"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_News", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ABC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement_agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accountability", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Accountability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mental health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plaintiff", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Plaintiff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Texas House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lockdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_of_police", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief of police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Department_of_Public_Safety", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Texas Department of Public Safety"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School_district", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "School district"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal government of the United States"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Violence_and_Abuse", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Violence and Abuse", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Research", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Research", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 81}], "image": "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-1492914715.jpg?w=1600&h=900&crop=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9588611", "eventUri": "eng-9588611", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-24", "textStart": 881, "textEnd": 887}], "sentiment": -0.1607843137254902, "wgt": 198, "relevance": 1}

Many times, referring to the nearly two dozen agencies on the scene -- but more often, referring to the miscommunications between officials and grieving families.\n\nRELATED: Uvalde DOJ report examines equipment for police to respond to active shooting incidents\n\nThe settlement also includes support in helping heal the Uvalde community, which includes:\n\nThe City of Uvalde will also pay $2 million to the families from its insurance coverage.\n\nThere is no risk more foreseeable to our children than classroom shootings. Until the corporate enablers of mass shootings start prioritizing our children above their profits, and until state and federal governments get serious about prevention, the immense burden of protecting children in schools will continue to fall on local communities like the City of Uvalde. For 77 minutes, 26 members of the Uvalde Police Department failed to confront an 18 year-old kid armed with an AR-15, and no disciplinary action has ever been taken -- no firings, no demotions, no transparency -- and the families remain eager for that to change. But the healing process must begin, and the commitments made today by the City are a step in that critical process,\" said Josh Koskoff, partner at Koskoff, Koskoff & Bieder and attorney for the families. \"The State of Texas and the school district, on the other hand, seem intent on causing these families even more hardship than the indescribable pain of losing a child. While there is nothing normal about living in a society where kids can easily get access to a military rifle, the reality is that these officers were so terrified that they chose to abandon their burden to the Uvalde community: put themselves between a very dangerous person and a child, and the families must hold them accountable.\n\nRELATED: Multiple officers to appear before special grand jury looking at Uvalde massacre response\n\nThe attorneys said in a statement the frustration felt by the families of the victims was made worse \"by the City's restrictions and maintenance issues at victims' gravesites at Hillcrest Memorial Cemetery, despite an influx of donated funds for that purpose.\"\n\nDue to those issues, the settlement said that the City will commit to regular maintenance of the Hillcrest Memorial Cemetery, creating two positions on the Cemetery Advisory Board to be filled by victim's families, and will reimburse families for the cost of repairs at the gravesites.\n\nUvalde is a city in need of healing, and this settlement, the terms of which were reached through open, difficult conversations, is an important step forward in that process. The families we represent have every right to be distrustful and angry. I am in awe that, despite that, they agreed to find a way forward so this community can start to heal,\" said Erin Rogiers, partner at Guerra LLP and another attorney for the families. \"Law-enforcement's inaction that day was a complete and absolute betrayal of these families and the sons, daughters and mothers they lost.

Pursuing further legal action against Uvalde could have bankrupted the city, a result that none of the families wanted, they added.\n\n\"For 77 minutes, 26 members of the Uvalde Police Department failed to confront an 18 year-old kid armed with an AR-15, and no disciplinary action has ever been taken -- no firings, no demotions, no transparency -- and the families remain eager for that to change,\" Koskoff said in a statement. \"But the healing process must begin, and the commitments made today by the City are a step in that critical process.\"\n\nDelayed law enforcement response widely criticized\n\nAlso Wednesday, the attorneys announced they are suing 92 individual Texas DPS officers, the school district and several employees for their alleged failures responding to the shooting.\n\n\"Law enforcement's inaction that day was a complete and absolute betrayal of these families and the sons, daughters and mothers they lost,\" Rogiers said in the statement. \"TXDPS had the resources, training and firepower to respond appropriately, and they ignored all of it and failed on every level. These families have not only the right but also the responsibility to demand justice, both for their own loss and to prevent other families from suffering the same fate.\"\n\nThe disastrous police response has been criticized in a series of government investigative reports, although no one has faced criminal repercussions. A scathing US Department of Justice report in January blamed the failed response on \"cascading failures of leadership, decision-making, tactics, policy, and training\" on the part of law enforcement officials and said lives would have been saved if police had followed generally accepted practices.\n\nUvalde school district police chief Pete Arredondo was fired in August 2022 for his role in the failed response to the mass shooting. His replacement, Joshua Gutierrez, has submitted his resignation and his last day on the job is set for June, according to a school official's statement.\n\nThe lawsuit announced Wednesday is just the latest civil action related to the mass shooting.\n\nPreviously, the family of Eliahna Torres, a 10-year-old victim, filed a lawsuit in November 2022 against nearly two dozen people and entities, including the gun manufacturer and store that provided the rifle used in the attack and law enforcement officials who responded to the scene. In addition, survivors of the shooting filed a $27 billion class action lawsuit in federal court in December 2022 against multiple Texas law enforcement agencies. A trial date has not been set in either lawsuit.\n\nOfficials have said the shooter legally purchased the guns in the days after his 18th birthday. The carnage remains among the deadliest episodes in America's ongoing scourge of school shootings.\n\nOwners enrolling dogs in groundbreaking study\n\nCan a new drug help dogs live longer, healthier

A scathing US Department of Justice report in January blamed the failed response on \"cascading failures of leadership, decision-making, tactics, policy, and training\" on the part of law enforcement officials and said lives would have been saved if police had followed generally accepted practices.\n\nUvalde school district police chief Pete Arredondo was fired in August 2022 for his role in the failed response to the mass shooting. His replacement, Joshua Gutierrez, has submitted his resignation and his last day on the job is set for June, according to a school official's statement.\n\nThe lawsuit announced Wednesday is just the latest civil action related to the mass shooting.\n\nPreviously, the family of Eliahna Torres, a 10-year-old victim, filed a lawsuit in November 2022 against nearly two dozen people and entities, including the gun manufacturer and store that provided the rifle used in the attack and law enforcement officials who responded to the scene. In addition, survivors of the shooting filed a $27 billion class action lawsuit in federal court in December 2022 against multiple Texas law enforcement agencies. A trial date has not been set in either lawsuit.\n\nOfficials have said the shooter legally purchased the guns in the days after his 18th birthday. The carnage remains among the deadliest episodes in America's ongoing scourge of school shootings.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros. Discovery Company.

Responding officers infuriated the public after it was revealed that they waited for more than an hour to enter the school and confront the gunman.\n\n\"Law enforcement did not treat the incident as an active shooter situation, despite clear knowledge that there was an active shooter inside,\" the attorneys representing the families said in a statement on Wednesday.\n\n\"The shooter was able to continue the killing spree for over an hour while helpless families waited anxiously outside the school.\"\n\nThe settlement requires the city of Uvalde to pay $2m to the families of 17 children who were killed and two children who were wounded in the attack, according to the statement.\n\nWhile the settlement is relatively low when compared to other settlements related to mass casualty events, the families' attorneys said their clients weren't interested in bankrupting the city, CBS News reports.\n\n\"Pursuing further legal action against the City could have plunged Uvalde into bankruptcy, something that none of the families were interested in as they look for the community to heal,\" the attorneys said.\n\nIn addition to the $2m payout, the settlement also requires the Uvalde police officers to attend trainings and for the city to provide mental health services to families of victims, to survivors and to the broader Uvalde community. It will also require the city to create a permanent memorial and to make 24 May -- the day the shooting occurred -- an annual \"Day of Remembrance.\"\n\n\"For two long years, we have languished in pain and without any accountability from the law enforcement agencies and officers who allowed our families to be destroyed that day. This settlement reflects a first good faith effort by the City of Uvalde to begin rebuilding trust in the systems that failed to protect us,\" Veronica Luevanos, whose daughter Jailah and nephew Jayce were killed, said.\n\nThe group said it also planned to file lawsuits against 92 Texas Department of Public Safety officers and Uvalde's school district.\n\n\"But it wasn't just Uvalde officers who failed us that day. Nearly 100 officers from the Texas Department of Public Safety have yet to face a shred of accountability for cowering in fear while my daughter and nephew bled to death in their classroom,\" Ms Luevanos said.\n\nErin Rogiers, an attorney representing the families, said in a statement that those who lost loved ones in the shooting had a right to demand justice from all of those involved in the botched response to the attack.\n\n\"Law enforcement's inaction that day was a complete and absolute betrayal of these families and the sons, daughters and mothers they lost,\" the attorney said. \"TXDPS had the resources, training and firepower to respond appropriately, and they ignored all of it and failed on every level. These families have not only the right but also the responsibility to demand justice, both for their own loss and to prevent other families from suffering the same fate.\"\n\nWednesday's settlement ends one of the numerous ongoing legal actions resulting from the mass shooting.\n\nIn November, the family of Eliahna Torres, a 10-year-old girl killed in the mass shooting, sued approximately two dozen people and organizations, including the company that manufactured the rifle used in the attack and the gun store that sold the weapon. Law enforcement officials at the scene were also named in the suit, CNN reports.\n\nIn December 2022, the families of the survivors filed a $27bn class action lawsuit in federal court against multiple Texas law enforcement agencies. Neither suit has a trial date at this time.\n\nA report from the Justice Department in January found that the overall police response to the mass shooting was a failure.\n\n\"Had the law enforcement agencies followed generally accepted practices ... lives would have been saved and people would have survived, Attorney General Merrick Garland told reporters after the report released.", "source": {"uri": "independent.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Independent"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robb_Elementary_School_shooting", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Robb Elementary School shooting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Settlement_(litigation)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Settlement (litigation)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uvalde,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Uvalde, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Uvalde, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_shooter", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Active shooter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bankruptcy", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bankruptcy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spree_killer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spree killer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS_News", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "CBS News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Department_of_Public_Safety", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Texas Department of Public Safety"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement_agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School_district", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "School district"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mental health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merrick_Garland", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Merrick Garland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_shooting", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mass shooting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Class action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Attorney_General", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Attorney General"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_district_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States district court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Violence_and_Abuse", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Violence and Abuse", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Research", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Research", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 55}], "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/03/07/05/Uvalde_School_Shooting_92321.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9588611", "eventUri": "eng-9588611", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-24", "textStart": 1788, "textEnd": 1794}], "sentiment": -0.4196078431372549, "wgt": 194, "relevance": 1}

Also on Wednesday, the families of 17 children who were killed and two who were injured filed a lawsuit against the Texas Department of Safety and the Uvalde school district.\n\nJosh Koskoff, an attorney representing the families, said Wednesday in a news conference, \"These were the last lines of defense for these children. But they were failed long before the shooting. They're failed. We're failing children.\"\n\nThe lawsuit, which seeks $500 million in damages, names 92 Texas DPS troopers, the Uvalde school district and Pete Arredondo, who was chief of police for the school district when a lone gunman killed 19 fourth-graders and two teachers inside the school. Mandy Gutierrez, who was principal of the school at the time is also named in the suit.\n\nAccording to the lawsuit, Texas state troopers were given active-shooter response training, which says that first responders' main priority is to \"stop the killing, then stop the dying and then evacuate the injured.\"\n\nVeronica Luevanos, whose daughter Jailah and nephew Jayce were killed in the mass shooting, said in a statement that the $2 million settlement shows a \"good faith effort\" by the city of Uvalde.\n\n\"But it wasn't just Uvalde officers who failed us that day,\" Luevanos said. \"Nearly 100 officers from the Texas Department of Public Safety have yet to face a shred of accountability for cowering in fear while my daughter and nephew bled to death in their classroom.\"\n\nKoskoff said on Wednesday that the state of Texas has done \"nothing at all\" but burden Uvalde before the shooting by not giving Uvalde police officers the resources they needed to stop the gunman.\n\n\"Blame the least well-trained, least-resourced and least-equipped officers for a problem you helped to create,\" he said.\n\nFriday marks the second anniversary of the mass shooting, which was carried out by an 18-year-old former Uvalde student. Nearly 400 police officers from multiple agencies arrived on campus that day, and it took 77 minutes for anyone to confront and kill the gunman. The response was called an \"abject failure\" by the head of the DPS.\n\nWhen asked by HuffPost for comment, the Texas DPS said it does not discuss pending litigation.\n\nIn a statement to HuffPost, the Uvalde Consolidated Independent School District said it would not comment \"the specifics of such actions to maintain the integrity of the legal process and ensure that all parties' rights are respected.\"\n\nAlong with the $2 million settlement, the city of Uvalde agreed to establish an annual day of remembrance for the victims and fund a memorial on the plaza in Uvalde. In a statement, the city of Uvalde said that was \"thankful\" for the agreement with the victims' families.\n\nJoshua Gutierrez, the Uvalde school district police chief who took over after Arredondo was fired in August 2022, didn't say why he was resigning. In a statement to HuffPost, the school district said the school board has to approve his resignation at a meeting on June 17.\n\n\"We thank Chief Gutierrez for his dedicated leadership and guidance in reestablishing the Uvalde CISD Police Department,\" the school district said. \"His contributions have been instrumental in enhancing the safety and well-being of our students, staff, and school community.

Nineteen fourth-graders and two teachers were killed on May 24, 2022, when a teenage gunman burst into their classroom at Robb Elementary School and began shooting.\n\nThe lawsuit is the latest of several seeking accountability for the law enforcement response. More than 370 federal, state and local officers converged on the scene, but they waited more than 70 minutes before confronting the shooter.\n\nIt is the first lawsuit to come after a 600-page Justice Department report was released in January that catalogued \"cascading failures\" in training, communication, leadership and technology problems that day.\n\nThe lawsuit notes state troopers did not follow their active shooter training and responsibility to confront the shooter, even as the students and teachers inside were following their own lockdown protocols of turning off lights, locking doors and staying silent.\n\n\"The protocols trap teachers and students inside, leaving them fully reliant on law enforcement to respond quickly and effectively,\" the families and their attorneys said in a statement.\n\nTerrified students inside the classroom called 911 as agonized parents begged officers, some of whom could hear shots being fired while they stood in a hallway, to go in. A tactical team of officers eventually went into the classroom and killed the shooter.\n\n\"Law-enforcement's inaction that day was a complete and absolute betrayal of these families and the sons, daughters and mothers they lost,\" said Erin Rogiers, one of the attorneys for the families. \"TXDPS had the resources, training and firepower to respond appropriately, and they ignored all of it and failed on every level. These families have not only the right but also the responsibility to demand justice.\"\n\nA criminal investigation into the police response by Uvalde District Attorney Christina Mitchell's office remains ongoing. A grand jury was summoned this year, and some law enforcement officials have already been called to testify.\n\nThe lawsuit against 92 Texas Department of Public Safety officials and troopers also names the Uvalde School District, former Robb Elementary Principal Mandy Gutierrez and former Uvalde schools police Chief Peter Arredondo as defendants.\n\nAnother lawsuit filed in December 2022 against local and state police, the city, and other school and law enforcement, seeks at least $27 billion and class-action status for survivors. And at least two other lawsuits have been filed against Georgia-based gun manufacturer Daniel Defense, which made the AR-style rifle used by the gunman.\n\nThe settlement with the city was capped at $2 million because the families said they didn't want to bankrupt the city where they still live and to allow the community to continue to heal. The settlement will be paid from city's insurance coverage.\n\nUnder the settlement, the city agreed to a new \"fitness for duty\" standard and enhanced training for Uvalde police officers. It also establishes May 24 as an annual day of remembrance, a permanent memorial in the city plaza, and support for mental health services for the families and the greater Uvalde area.\n\nThe police response to the mass shooting has been criticized and scrutinized by state and federal authorities. A 600-page Justice Department report in January catalogued \"cascading failures\" in training, communication, leadership and technology problems that day,\n\nAnother report commissioned by the city also noted rippling missteps by law enforcement but defended the actions of local police, which sparked anger from victims' families.\n\n\"For two long years, we have languished in pain and without any accountability from the law enforcement agencies and officers who allowed our families to be destroyed that day,\" said Veronica Luevanos, whose daughter Jailah and nephew Jayce were killed. \"This settlement reflects a first good faith effort, particularly by the City of Uvalde, to begin rebuilding trust in the systems that failed to protect us.\"", "source": {"uri": "wdtn.com",

The suit said the officers were trained to first prioritize stopping the killing, then stopping the dying, then evacuating those hurt.\n\n\"Nearly 100 officers from the Texas Department of Public Safety have yet to face a shred of accountability for cowering in fear while my daughter and nephew bled to death in their classroom,\" Luevanos said.\n\nThe lawsuit names the Uvalde School District and several of its employees as defendants, including the then-principal and then-school district police chief.\n\nThe families said the school's lockdown protocols -- to turn off the lights, lock the door and stay quiet -- trapped teachers and children inside, \"leaving them fully reliant on law enforcement to respond.\"\n\nThe families also plan to sue the federal government, Koskoff said, noting that over 150 federal officers were at the school and \"stood around until one or more breached the room at 77 minutes.\"", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Settlement_(litigation)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Settlement (litigation)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uvalde,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Uvalde, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Uvalde, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accountability", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Accountability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "County (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robb_Elementary_School_shooting", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Robb Elementary School shooting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_shooting", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mass shooting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Customs_and_Border_Protection", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Customs and Border Protection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massacre", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Massacre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Department_of_Public_Safety", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Texas Department of Public Safety"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement_agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lockdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_of_police", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief of police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bankruptcy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bankruptcy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mental health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal government of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Insurance"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law_Enforcement", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law Enforcement", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Violence_and_Abuse", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Violence and Abuse", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 80}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/dl7AZkFpoe3xt3q7GtdbRQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/us.abcnews.go.com/553a9d30dff70569ff629b57f35fd975", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9588611", "eventUri": "eng-9588611", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-24", "textStart": 2034, "textEnd": 2040}], "sentiment": -0.4196078431372549, "wgt": 192, "relevance": 1}

of the families of the victims of a mass shooting at an elementary school in Texas city, one of their lawyers has said.\n\nThe announcement on Wednesday came two days before the second anniversary of the massacre.\n\nIn one of the deadliest school shootings in US history, 19 children and two teachers were killed on May 24, 2022, when a gunman entered Robb Elementary School in Uvalde and barricaded himself inside adjoining classrooms with dozens of students.\n\nA US Department of Justice review found local police ignored accepted practices by failing to confront the attacker, instead waiting outside the classroom for more than an hour despite calls for help from the children.\n\n\"The city of Uvalde has agreed to pay its insurance of $2m, which is all that there was,\" Josh Koskoff, who represented families of the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, said at a briefing to announce the agreement.\n\nHe said the settlement involved the families of 17 of the children who were killed and two children who survived.\n\nAnother lawyer announced that the families of 19 of the victims launched a $500m federal lawsuit against nearly 100 state police officers who were part of the botched law enforcement response to one of the deadliest school shootings in United States history.\n\nFamilies are suing 92 Texas Department of Public Safety officers who were at the incident, said Erin Rogiers, partner at Guerra LLP, who is representing families together with Koskoff and Bieder PC, in a statement.\n\nState and federal officers made up the majority of the 376 law enforcement operatives who waited 77 minutes before confronting and killing the 18-year-old gunman, Koskoff said.\n\nThe lawsuit, seeking at least $500m in damages, is the latest of several seeking accountability for the law enforcement response.\n\nIt is the first lawsuit to be filed after a 600-page Justice Department report was released in January that catalogued \"cascading failures\" in training, communication, leadership and technology problems on the day of the shooting.\n\nThe lawsuit notes that state troopers did not follow their active shooter training or confront the shooter, even as the students and teachers inside were following their own lockdown protocols of turning off lights, locking doors and staying silent.\n\n\"The protocols trap teachers and students inside, leaving them fully reliant on law enforcement to respond quickly and effectively,\" the families and their lawyers said in a statement.\n\nFamilies of victims filed a separate lawsuit in December 2022 against local and state police, the city, and other school and law enforcement officials seeking at least $27bn and class-action status for survivors.", "source": {"uri": "aljazeera.com", "dataType": "news",

Donate today.\n\nUVALDE, Texas (Texas Tribune) -- Relatives of 17 children killed and two kids injured in Texas' deadliest school shooting are suing Texas Department of Public Safety officers who were among hundreds of law enforcement that waited 77 minutes to confront the gunman at Uvalde's Robb Elementary, lawyers announced Wednesday.\n\n\"Nearly 100 officers from the Texas Department of Public Safety have yet to face a shred of accountability for cowering in fear while my daughter and nephew bled to death in their classroom,\" Veronica Luevanos, whose daughter Jailah and nephew Jayce were killed, said in a statement.\n\nThe legal action against 92 DPS officers comes days before the two-year anniversary of the shooting in which an 18-year-old used an AR-15 to kill 19 students and two teachers in two adjoining fourth-grade classrooms.\n\nRelatives of most of those students killed and two who were injured also announced Wednesday that they are suing Mandy Gutierrez, who was the principal at Robb at the time, and Pedro \"Pete\" Arredondo, who was the school district police chief, for their \"inaction\" that day.\n\nIn addition to the lawsuit, the families announced the city of Uvalde will pay $2 million to the families as part of a separate settlement that also includes stipulations meant to prevent another tragedy like the 2022 shooting.\n\nHundreds of law enforcement officers from scores of local, state and federal agencies have been heavily criticized for waiting more than an hour to confront the gunman, which conflicted with training that instructs them to confront a shooter if there is reason to believe someone is hurt. The U.S. Justice Department's investigation of the massacre concluded that the delay likely caused some deaths and that failures in leadership and training contributed to law enforcement's ineffective response.\n\n\"While there is nothing normal about living in a society where kids can easily get access to a military rifle, the reality is that these officers were so terrified that they chose to abandon their burden to the Uvalde community: put themselves between a very dangerous person and a child, and the families must hold them accountable,\" said Josh Koskoff, attorney for the families.\n\nKoskoff has also represented the families of children killed in the 2012 Sandy Hook school shooting in Connecticut.\n\nIn the settlement with the city of Uvalde that families' lawyers announced Wednesday, local officials will implement a new \"fitness for duty\" standard for Uvalde police officers, to be developed in coordination with the Justice Department and provide enhanced training for current and future police officers.\n\nCity officials will also establish May 24 as an annual day of remembrance and work with victims' families to design a permanent memorial at the city plaza, among other things.\n\n\"For two long years, we have languished in pain and without any accountability from the law enforcement agencies and officers who allowed our families to be destroyed that day. This settlement reflects a first good faith effort, particularly by the City of Uvalde, to begin rebuilding trust in the systems that failed to protect us,\" Luevanos said.\n\nAn investigation by a Texas House committee found \"systemic failures and egregious poor decision making\" by nearly everyone involved in the response.\n\nThat panel's 77-page report revealed that a total of 376 law enforcement officers descended upon the school in an uncoordinated manner, disregarding their own active shooter training.\n\nThe majority of the responders were federal and state law enforcement -- 149 U.S. Border Patrol and 91 state police -- whose responsibilities include responding to \"mass attacks in public places.\" The other responders included 25 Uvalde police officers, 16 sheriff's deputies, and five police officers with the Uvalde Consolidated Independent School District as well as neighboring county law enforcement, U.S. marshals and federal Drug Enforcement Administration officers.\n\nThe myriad of law enforcement mistakes stemmed from an absence of leadership and effective communications, according to the report.\n\nA trove of recorded investigative interviews and body camera footage obtained by ProPublica, The Texas Tribune and FRONTLINE showed that officers failed to set up a clear command structure and spread incorrect information that caused them to treat the shooter as a barricaded suspect and not an active threat -- even as children and teachers inside the classrooms called 911 pleading for help. No single officer engaged the shooter for more than an hour despite training that says they should do so as quickly as possible if anyone is hurt.\n\nFollowing intense criticism of their response, several law enforcement officers resigned or were fired in the months following the shooting. Arredondo, the school district police chief at the time, was fired in August 2022.\n\nAbout 72% of the state and local officials who arrived at Robb Elementary before the gunman was killed received some form of active shooter training throughout their law enforcement careers. But of those who received training, most had taken it only once. After the shooting, Texas mandated that officers receive 16 hours of active shooter training every two years.\n\nDPS is fighting the release of its investigation into the shooting. A Uvalde County grand jury is currently considering potential criminal charges against responding officers.\n\nWe've got big things in store for you at The Texas Tribune Festival, happening Sept. 5-7 in downtown Austin.

In one of the deadliest school shootings in U.S. history, 19 children and two teachers were killed on May 24, 2022, when a gunman entered Robb Elementary School in Uvalde and barricaded himself inside adjoining classrooms with dozens of students.\n\nA U.S. Justice Department review found that local police had ignored accepted practices by failing to confront the gunman, instead waiting outside the classroom for more than an hour despite calls for help from the children. \"The city of Uvalde has agreed to pay its insurance of $2 million, which is all that there was,\" Josh Koskoff, who represented families of the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, said at a briefing to announce the agreement.\n\nHe said the settlement involved the families of 17 of the children who were killed and two children who survived. Under the settlement, families agreed not to sue the city, Koskoff said. But families would sue the state of Texas and the federal government over the response of their law enforcement officers to the massacre, he added. State and federal officers made up the majority of the 376 law enforcement operatives who waited 77 minutes before confronting and killing the 18-year-old gunman, Koskoff said.\n\nFamilies of the victims filed a lawsuit\n\nin December 2022 against local and state police, the city, and other school and law enforcement officials seeking at least $27 billion and class-action status for survivors over delays in confronting the attacker. It was not immediately clear how the settlement would affect the earlier lawsuit.\n\nAt least two lawsuits have been filed against Daniel Defense, the Georgia-based company that made the AR-style rifle used by the gunman. Families of the victims have called for criminal charges against officers involved in the stalled response.\n\nUvalde District Attorney Christina Mitchell has launched a criminal investigation into the incident and a grand jury was convened in January.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Settlement_(litigation)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Settlement (litigation)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uvalde,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Uvalde, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Uvalde, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robb_Elementary_School_shooting", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Robb Elementary School shooting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_shooting", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mass shooting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School_shooting", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "School shooting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massacre", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Massacre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_school", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "State school"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandy_Hook_Elementary_School_shooting", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal government of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Defense", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Daniel Defense"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Criminal investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Class action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_jury", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Grand jury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadcast_syndication", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Broadcast syndication"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_police", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "State police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "District attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rifle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rifle"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Violence_and_Abuse", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Violence and Abuse", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Research", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Research", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 46}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/imagegallery/01_04_2019_17_12_02_6631371.jpg?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9588611", "eventUri": "eng-9588611", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2235294117647059, "wgt": 187, "relevance": 1}

But law enforcement waited some 77 minutes before breaching a classroom and killing the gunman.\n\n\"For 77 minutes, 26 members of the Uvalde Police Department failed to confront an 18 year-old kid armed with an AR-15, and no disciplinary action has ever been taken -- no firings, no demotions, notransparency -- and the families remain eager for that to change,\" Josh Koskoff, an attorney for the families, said in a statement. \"But the healing process must begin, and the commitments made today by the City, in particular, are a step in that critical process.\"\n\nAs a part of the settlement with the city and county, the families said they were involved in the efforts to improve the Uvalde Police Department, with changes including enhanced officer training and a new \"fitness for duty\" standard for officers.\n\nThe families said the settlement also mandates ways the city should support the community as residents heal, including: establishing May 24 as an annual Day of Remembrance; creating a committee to design a permanent memorial funded by the city; and continuing to support mental health services.\n\nThe city will pay out a total of $2 million to the families from its insurance coverage and also, separately, the families agreed to accept the $2 million limit of the Uvalde County insurance policy, saying pursuing more money could have plunged the city into bankruptcy, \"something that none of the families were interested in as they look for the community to heal.\"\n\nThe families on Wednesday also announced lawsuits against 92 Texas Department of Public Safety officers. The suit said the officers were trained to first prioritize stopping the killing, then stopping the dying, then evacuating those hurt.\n\n\"Nearly 100 officers from the Texas Department of Public Safety have yet to face a shred of accountability for cowering in fear while my daughter and nephew bled to death in their classroom,\" Luevanos said.\n\nThe lawsuit names the Uvalde School District and several of its employees as defendants, including the then-principal and then-school district police chief.\n\nThe families said the school's lockdown protocols -- to turn off the lights, lock the door and stay quiet -- trapped teachers and children inside, \"leaving them fully reliant on law enforcement to respond.\"\n\nThis is a developing story.

Pete Arredondo, who was chief of the Uvalde public school police department at the time, and Mandy Gutierrez, who was principal of the school, are also named as defendants in the lawsuit.\n\n\"The protocols trap teachers and students inside, leaving them fully reliant on law enforcement to respond quickly and effectively,\" the families and their attorneys said in a statement.\n\nThere are several lawsuits that have already been filed over the response to the mass shooting, which had nearly 400 officers from all levels of government converge on the scene but wait more than an hour before confronting the shooter. Daniel Defense, which manufactures the assault-style rifle that was used by the gunman, is also targeted in a lawsuit.\n\nA 600-page report from the Department of Justice released in January found \"cascading failures\" in essentially all aspects of the response from training to communication to issues with technology. A criminal investigation into the police response by Uvalde's district attorney also remains ongoing with a grand jury being summoned this year and some law enforcement officials being summoned to testify.\n\nUnder the settlement with the city, Uvalde agreed to establish May 24 as an annual day of remembrance, to create a permanent memorial in the city plaza, and support for mental health services for victims' families and surrounding area. Families said they capped the monetary portion of the settlement at $2 million because they didn't want to cause financial problems for the area and community they still live in.", "source": {"uri": "abc7amarillo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KVII"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_police", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "State police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uvalde,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Uvalde, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Uvalde, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robb_Elementary_School_shooting", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Robb Elementary School shooting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Settlement_(litigation)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Settlement (litigation)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School_shooting", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "School shooting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austin,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Austin, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Austin, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orlando_nightclub_shooting", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Orlando nightclub shooting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_shooter", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Active shooter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Treaty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_school", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "State school"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal government of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Defense", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Daniel Defense"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_shooting", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mass shooting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_jury", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Grand jury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mental health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "District attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rifle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rifle"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Violence_and_Abuse", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Violence and Abuse", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Research", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Research", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://abc7amarillo.com/resources/media/5294c623-40e3-41fa-b3d0-ed8e04feb37a-large16x9_AP24142731012002.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9588611", "eventUri": "eng-9588611", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Austin, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-24", "textStart": 2346, "textEnd": 2352}], "sentiment": -0.4509803921568627, "wgt": 186, "relevance": 1}

$2 million payout to be shared among the families, Koskoff said the city has agreed to enhance training of police officers and provide continued mental health services to survivors and their

They also announced a lawsuit against the Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS).\n\nThe families are suing the 92 individual DPS officers who were there that day when hundreds of officers from local, state, and federal agencies waited for more than an hour to confront the gunman who killed 19 students and two teachers.\n\nJosh Koskoff is one of two attorneys representing the families of the shooting victims. He said there were several lawsuits forthcoming.\n\n\"Most immediately, against the state of Texas, which has done nothing at all but burden this town before the shooting by not giving them the resources they need. [They've] prevented these families from getting the information they need and then blaming the city as if they didn't have, how many police officers there? 98,\" he said.\n\nMeanwhile, the families reached a settlement with the city for $2 million and Uvalde County for $2 million -- both in the form of insurance payments. That lawsuit named the then Uvalde Consolidated Independent School District police chief Pete Arredondo -- who was supposed to be the incident commander that day -- and then-Robb Elementary School principal Mandy Gutierrez.\n\nThe settlement included efforts to rebuild the Uvalde Police Department, to establish May 24 as an annual day of remembrance, to design a permanent downtown memorial, and to continue mental health support services for the community.\n\n\"Uvalde is a city in need of healing, and this settlement, the terms of which were reached through open, difficult conversations, is an important step forward in that process. The families we represent have every right to be distrustful and angry. I am in awe that, despite that, they agreed to find a way forward so this community can start to heal,\" said Erin Rogiers, partner at Guerra LLP, an attorney for the families, along with Koskoff, Koskoff & Bieder PC.\n\nJavier Cazares is the father of Jackie Cazares, a 9-year-old who was killed in the shooting. He's among the 19 families pursuing litigation.\n\n\"We all know who took our children's lives,\" he said. \"But there was an obvious systemic failure out there. On May 24th, the whole world saw that. No amount of money is worth the lives and our children.\"\n\nThe recent legal developments followed a Department of Justice review that found lives would have been saved if not for unprecedented law enforcement failures.\n\n\"Law-enforcement's inaction that day was a complete and absolute betrayal of these families and the sons, daughters and mothers they lost. TXDPS had the resources, training and firepower to respond appropriately, and they ignored all of it and failed on every level,\" Rogiers said. \"These families have not only the right but also the responsibility to demand justice, both for their own loss and to prevent other families from suffering the same fate.\"", "source": {"uri": "houstonpublicmedia.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Houston Public Media"}, "authors": [{"uri": "dan_katz@houstonpublicmedia.org", "name": "Dan Katz", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Public_Radio", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Texas Public Radio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uvalde,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Uvalde, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Uvalde, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robb_Elementary_School_shooting", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Robb Elementary School shooting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Department_of_Public_Safety", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Texas Department of Public Safety"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "County (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal government of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uvalde_Consolidated_Independent_School_District", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Uvalde Consolidated Independent School District"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_of_police", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief of police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mental health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Insurance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uvalde_County,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Uvalde County, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Uvalde County, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constable", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Constable"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Violence_and_Abuse", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Violence and Abuse", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Children,_Youth_and_Family", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Children, Youth and Family", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Disabled/Family_Resources", "label": "dmoz/Society/Disabled/Family Resources", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Runaways", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Runaways", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 56}], "image": "https://cdn.houstonpublicmedia.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/22145257/img-7792-1500x968.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9588611", "eventUri": "eng-9588611", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-24", "textStart": 1463, "textEnd": 1469, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": -0.2705882352941177, "wgt": 184, "relevance": 1}

Law enforcement officers killed the gunman in a classroom after waiting more than an hour to confront him, which was heavily criticized in the wake of the shooting.\n\nIn the settlement announced Wednesday, the city of Uvalde will pay a total of $2 million to the families of 17 children killed in the shooting and two children who survived, according to a statement from the families' attorneys.\n\n\"Pursuing further legal action against the City could have plunged Uvalde into bankruptcy, something that none of the families were interested in as they look for the community to heal,\" the statement said.\n\nThe money will come from the city's insurance coverage, attorney Josh Koskoff told reporters at a news conference.\n\n\"These families could have pursued a lawsuit against the city, and there's certainly grounds for a lawsuit,\" Koskoff said. \"Let's face it, sadly, we all saw what we saw ... but instead of suing the city and jeopardizing the finances of anybody, the families have accepted simply the insurance.\"\n\nThe city said the settlement will allow people to remember the shooting while \"moving forward together as a community to bring healing and restoration to all those affected.\"\n\n\"We will forever be grateful to the victims' families for working with us over the past year to cultivate an environment of community-wide healing that honors the lives and memories of those we tragically lost,\" the city said in a statement. \"May 24th is our community's greatest tragedy.\"\n\nThe families were also working on a separate settlement with Uvalde County, Koskoff said.\n\nJavier Cazares, whose 9-year-old daughter Jackie Cazares was killed in the shooting, said the last two years have been unbearable.\n\n\"We all know who took our children's lives, but there was an obvious systemic failure out there on May 24,\" Cazares said. \"The whole world saw that. No amount of money is worth the lives of our children. Justice and accountability has always been my main concern. We've been let down so many times. The time has come to do the right thing.\"\n\nThe settlement also includes the Uvalde Police Department committing to provide enhanced training for police officers and implement a new standard for officers to be developed in coordination with the U.S. Justice Department, according to the families' attorneys. The city also committed to supporting mental health services for the families, survivors and community members, creating a committee to coordinate with the families on a permanent memorial and establishing May 24 as an annual day of remembrance, in addition to taking other measures.\n\nThe families are also taking new legal action against 92 state Department of Public Safety officers and the school district, including former Robb Elementary School principal Mandy Gutierrez and Pete Arredondo, the school district's police chief who was fired months after the shooting.\n\n\"Law enforcement did not treat the incident as an active shooter situation, despite clear knowledge that there was an active shooter inside,\" Wednesday's statement said. \"... The shooter was able to continue the killing spree for over an hour while helpless families waited anxiously outside the school.\"\n\nKoskoff said the state's officers on the scene could have done more to respond to the shooting. They acted \"as if they had nothing to do, as if they didn't know how to shoot somebody, as if they weren't heavily armed and the most well-trained,\" Koskoff said.\n\nA Justice Department report released in January called the police response a failure.\n\n\"Had the law enforcement agencies followed generally accepted practices ... lives would have been saved and people would have survived,\" Attorney General Merrick Garland told reporters at the time.\n\nAt Wednesday's news conference, Koskoff said the families would \"down the line\" be suing the federal government, noting that many federal law enforcement officers also responded to the shooting.\n\n\"You had over 150 some-odd federal officers there who also were there and stood around until one or more breached the room at 77

But law enforcement waited some 77 minutes before breaching a classroom and killing the gunman.\n\n\"For 77 minutes, 26 members of the Uvalde Police Department failed to confront an 18 year-old kid armed with an AR-15, and no disciplinary action has ever been taken -- no firings, no demotions, notransparency -- and the families remain eager for that to change,\" Josh Koskoff, an attorney for the families, said in a statement. \"But the healing process must begin, and the commitments made today by the City, in particular, are a step in that critical process.\"\n\nAs a part of the settlement with the city and county, the families said they were involved in the efforts to improve the Uvalde Police Department, with changes including enhanced officer training and a new \"fitness for duty\" standard for officers.\n\nThe families said the settlement also mandates ways the city should support the community as residents heal, including: establishing May 24 as an annual Day of Remembrance; creating a committee to design a permanent memorial funded by the city; and continuing to support mental health services.\n\nThe city will pay out a total of $2 million to the families from its insurance coverage and also, separately, the families agreed to accept the $2 million limit of the Uvalde County insurance policy, saying pursuing more money could have plunged the city into bankruptcy, \"something that none of the families were interested in as they look for the community to heal.\"\n\nThe families on Wednesday also announced lawsuits against 92 Texas Department of Public Safety officers. The suit said the officers were trained to first prioritize stopping the killing, then stopping the dying, then evacuating those hurt.\n\n\"Nearly 100 officers from the Texas Department of Public Safety have yet to face a shred of accountability for cowering in fear while my daughter and nephew bled to death in their classroom,\" Luevanos said.\n\nThe lawsuit names the Uvalde School District and several of its employees as defendants, including the then-principal and then-school district police chief.\n\nThe families said the school's lockdown protocols -- to turn off the lights, lock the door and stay quiet -- trapped teachers and children inside, \"leaving them fully reliant on law enforcement to respond.\"\n\nThis is a developing story.

A total of 376 law enforcement officers from across the region rushed to the school to respond, but ultimately none of them breached the door to the classroom to confront the shooter for 77 minutes. ...

The city will also establish May 24 as an annual Day of Remembrance, will create a committee to coordinate designing a permanent memorial and will support mental health services for the families, survivors and community, the attorneys said.\n\nThe terms of the settlement were reached through a \"restorative justice process\" between impacted families and the city, the attorneys said.

Ramos had previously killed his grandmother and taken her F-150 pickup. Once the shooting in the school started, law enforcement waited outside the school and even prevented parents from entering. Over an hour-and-a-half elapsed between the first shots Ramos fired and law enforcement's breaching of the building and engaging Ramos, killing him. Ramos, it was later determined, had legally purchased the rifle; he had never been evaluated or treated for any mental health issues despite having repeatedly threatened girls in the community, and having been known to have tortured and killed animals, all clear warning signs.\n\nThe incident remains one of the worst massacres of school children and educators in the nation's history.

The city of Uvalde has agreed to pay $2 million split across the families of 17 children killed in the shooting as well as to the families of two children who were injured, according to CBS News.\n\nA January Department of Justice report found that \"cascading failures of leadership\" occurred as Uvalde police were responding to the 2022 shooting. \"The most significant failure was that responding officers should have immediately recognized the incident as an active shooter situation, using the resources and equipment that were sufficient to push forward immediately and continuously toward the threat until entry was made into classrooms 111/112 and the threat was eliminated,\" the report reads.\n\nIt took responding officers 77 minutes to approach and kill the shooter after arriving at the scene.

The time has come to do the right thing,' Cazarez added at the press conference on Wednesday, while surrounded by other grieving families of victims.\n\nA separate $2 million settlement with Uvalde County is still being worked out, Attorney Josh Koskoff told reporters.\n\n'Yes, we are suing the state of Texas,' the lawyer added.\n\nOver 90 Texas Department of Public Safety officer responded to the shooting in Uvalde and went against their training, which tells them to stop the shooter before all else\n\nKoskoff also announced that a separate lawsuit against the federal government, who had the most cops in attendance, would be filed in the future.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uvalde,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Uvalde, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Uvalde, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agustin_Cazarez", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Agustin Cazarez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massacre", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Massacre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_police", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "State police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robb_Elementary_School_shooting", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Robb Elementary School shooting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal government of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Ramos_(footballer)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Ramos (footballer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Department_of_Public_Safety", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Texas Department of Public Safety"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uvalde_County,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Uvalde County, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Uvalde County, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvador,_Bahia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Salvador, Bahia"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Violence_and_Abuse", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Violence and Abuse", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/05/22/19/85215355-0-image-a-4_1716402804271.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9588611", "eventUri": "eng-9588611", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-24", "textStart": 535, "textEnd": 541}], "sentiment": -0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 175, "relevance": 1}

It is the last week of our Spring Member Drive, and our newsroom relies on readers like you who support independent Texas news. Donate today.\n\nRelatives of 17 children killed and two kids injured in Texas' deadliest school shooting are suing Texas Department of Public Safety officers who were among hundreds of law enforcement that waited 77 minutes to confront the gunman at Uvalde's Robb Elementary, lawyers announced Wednesday.\n\n\"Nearly 100 officers from the Texas Department of Public Safety have yet to face a shred of accountability for cowering in fear while my daughter and nephew bled to death in their classroom,\" Veronica Luevanos, whose daughter Jailah and nephew Jayce were killed, said in a statement.\n\nThe legal action against 92 DPS officers comes days before the two-year anniversary of the shooting in which an 18-year-old used an AR-15 to kill 19 students and two teachers in two adjoining fourth-grade classrooms.\n\nRelatives of most of those students killed and two who were injured also announced Wednesday that they are suing Mandy Gutierrez, who was the principal at Robb at the time, and Pedro \"Pete\" Arredondo, who was the school district police chief, for their \"inaction\" that day.\n\nIn addition to the lawsuit, the families announced the city of Uvalde will pay $2 million to the families as part of a separate settlement that also includes stipulations meant to prevent another tragedy like the 2022 shooting.\n\nHundreds of law enforcement officers from scores of local, state and federal agencies have been heavily criticized for waiting more than an hour to confront the gunman, which conflicted with training that instructs them to confront a shooter if there is reason to believe someone is hurt. The U.S. Justice Department's investigation of the massacre concluded that the delay likely caused some deaths and that failures in leadership and training contributed to law enforcement's ineffective response.\n\n\"While there is nothing normal about living in a society where kids can easily get access to a military rifle, the reality is that these officers were so terrified that they chose to abandon their burden to the Uvalde community: put themselves between a very dangerous person and a child, and the families must hold them accountable,\" said Josh Koskoff, attorney for the families.\n\nKoskoff has also represented the families of children killed in the 2012 Sandy Hook school shooting in Connecticut.\n\nIn the settlement with the city of Uvalde that families' lawyers announced Wednesday, local officials will implement a new \"fitness for duty\" standard for Uvalde police officers, to be developed in coordination with the Justice Department and provide enhanced training for current and future police officers.\n\nCity officials will also establish May 24 as an annual day of remembrance and work with victims' families to design a permanent memorial at the city plaza, among other things.\n\n\"For two long years, we have languished in pain and without any accountability from the law enforcement agencies and officers who allowed our families to be destroyed that day. This settlement reflects a first good faith effort, particularly by the City of Uvalde, to begin rebuilding trust in the systems that failed to protect us,\" Luevanos said.\n\nAn investigation by a Texas House committee found \"systemic failures and egregious poor decision making\" by nearly everyone involved in the response.\n\nThat panel's 77-page report revealed that a total of 376 law enforcement officers descended upon the school in an uncoordinated manner, disregarding their own active shooter training.\n\nThe majority of the responders were federal and state law enforcement -- 149 U.S. Border Patrol and 91 state police -- whose responsibilities include responding to \"mass attacks in public places.\" The other responders included 25 Uvalde police officers, 16 sheriff's deputies, and five police officers with the Uvalde Consolidated Independent School District as well as neighboring county law enforcement, U.S. marshals and federal Drug Enforcement Administration officers.\n\nThe myriad of law enforcement mistakes stemmed from an absence of leadership and effective communications, according to the report.\n\nA trove of recorded investigative interviews and body camera footage obtained by ProPublica, The Texas Tribune and FRONTLINE showed that officers failed to set up a clear command structure and spread incorrect information that caused them to treat the shooter as a barricaded suspect and not an active threat -- even as children and teachers inside the classrooms called 911 pleading for help. No single officer engaged the shooter for more than an hour despite training that says they should do so as quickly as possible if anyone is hurt.\n\nFollowing intense criticism of their response, several law enforcement officers resigned or were fired in the months following the shooting. Arredondo, the school district police chief at the time, was fired in August 2022.\n\nAbout 72% of the state and local officials who arrived at Robb Elementary before the gunman was killed received some form of active shooter training throughout their law enforcement careers. But of those who received training, most had taken it only once. After the shooting, Texas mandated that officers receive 16 hours of active shooter training every two years.\n\nDPS is fighting the release of its investigation into the shooting. A Uvalde County grand jury is currently considering potential criminal charges against responding officers.", "source": {"uri": "texastribune.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Texas Tribune"},

Nineteen students and two teachers were murdered in what the U.S. Justice Department described as top-to-bottom \"cascading failures\" by law enforcement that combined to make the shooting one of the worst in history.\n\nAs the families involved and the community reflect, people find ways to grieve. Many choose to use art.\n\nOver the last two years, groups in Uvalde and throughout Texas have created memorials to honor those victims.\n\nAbel Ortiz Acosta, a resident and educator in Uvalde, collaborated with Monica Maldonado, the founder of the Austin-based nonprofit MAS Cultura, to organize a three-month project incorporating storytelling into artwork. Together, they created 21 murals for the Healing Uvalde project, each commemorating a victim of the Robb Elementary shooting by telling their story.\n\n\"We know that art heals,\" Maldonado told the American-Statesman. \"We wanted to use that to help this community heal but also show solidarity and be in unity with Uvalde. There is no doubt in my mind that this is part of their healing journey, and for many families we hope this lets them know that their kids and teachers matter and they won't be forgotten.\"\n\n(Click menu icon at top left of map to see full list of murals)\n\nShortly after the May 2022 shooting, makeshift memorials were placed at Uvalde's town square and Robb Elementary School.\n\nAt the school are 22 crosses for each of the victims and Joe Garcia, the husband of slain teacher Irma Garcia, who died of a heart attack shortly after the shooting.\n\nCrosses with messages, photos, flowers and other keepsakes still sit around the fountain at the town square.\n\nThe Uvalde Love Project was founded by Austin art therapist Wanda Montemayor, fellow Austin art therapists and teachers from Uvalde. The project was designed to bring the healing community closer together after the tragedy, in what Montemayor and her team hoped would aid in the grieving process. Thousands of volunteers contributed handmade tiles to the project.\n\n\"That personal connection and that feeling of safety is where the healing begins, and it's the collectiveness,\" Montemayor told American-Statesman reporter Hannah Ortega. \"It's not that 'I'm alone in these feelings.' It's like 'I'm with you and you and you, and we're on the same feeling together' ... not being alone in your head with these feelings.\"\n\nGeorgia native Sean Peacock went through his own personal tragedies and found a way to grieve his loss after losing his sister. To merit the children who were killed in Uvalde, Peacock carved butterfly-shaped benches for the families of the victims, each featuring a child's image.\n\nAccording to 41NBC/WMGT, Peacock took a U-Haul to Texas to hand deliver the benches to families.\n\nIn Riviera, Texas, Lupe Aguilar -- a pastor of Community Baptist Church -- built a wall dedicated to the victims of Uvalde. Aguilar has no formal connection to Uvalde.\n\n\"It can happen in any community,\" Aguilar told KENS 5. \"In my mind, in my heart, I had a feeling something needed to be done. Something needed to be built for the children, in memory of the children in Uvalde and their parents.\"", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uvalde,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Uvalde, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Uvalde, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robb_Elementary_School_shooting", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Robb Elementary School shooting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_shooting", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mass shooting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mural", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mural"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teacher", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Teacher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Town_square", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Town square"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonprofit_organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nonprofit organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaysia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Malaysia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Malaysia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Irma", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hurricane Irma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fountain", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fountain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Icon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Icon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myocardial_infarction", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Myocardial infarction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austin,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Austin, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Austin, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peacock_(streaming_service)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Peacock (streaming service)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KENS", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "KENS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U-Haul", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "U-Haul"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tile", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baptists", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Baptists"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pastor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pastor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riviera,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Riviera, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Riviera, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Mental_Health/Grief,_Loss_and_Bereavement", "label": "dmoz/Health/Mental Health/Grief, Loss and Bereavement", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Runaways", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Runaways", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 49}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/zKvFJ0mWt8qT7LH1c1Gv7A--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/austin-american-statesman/42deefb5eba0b2d0fcda85f2e9c8e44d", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9588611", "eventUri": "eng-9588611", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.04313725490196074, "wgt": 166, "relevance": 1}

Is it legal?", "body": "The Uvalde Police Department previously allowed comments on its Facebook page, but turned them off after receiving backlash following the shooting.\n\nThe Uvalde Police Department has faced widespread criticism for its delayed response to the gunman who entered Robb Elementary School and killed 19 children and two teachers on May 24, 2022. That criticism extended to social media, where public outcry led to the department's decision to disable comments on its Facebook page that previously allowed public engagement.\n\n\"The Uvalde Police Department Facebook Page is an informational page only and does not allow comments,\" the department's page reads. A similar note appears on the city of Uvalde's Facebook page.\n\nAdditionally, beneath each post, a disclaimer from the social media platform states, \"Uvalde Police Department limited who can comment on this post.\"\n\nMany residents assert that prohibiting comments is a violation of free speech covered under the First Amendment, but this interpretation may not be accurate.\n\nMan sues the city of Uvalde, Uvalde Police Department for restricting comments on social media\n\nNew York resident Michael W. Palmer sued the city and Uvalde Police Department for $500,000 in April for their restriction on comments on their Facebook pages, according to the Uvalde Leader-News.\n\nThe lawsuit comes after a U.S. Supreme Court ruling in March clarified that public officials' online accounts may fall under state action criteria if they wield state authority and establish such authority on their posts, even if it's on their personal accounts. Although it did not specifically outline protocols for governmental agencies, the lawsuit alleges that the city of Uvalde and Uvalde Police Department's restrictions on Facebook do not comply with the recent high court's decision because government officials run the page.\n\n\"The city does not have a lawful right to block users comments or even the users, since the Facebook Page(s), is considered ran by government officials,\" the lawsuit reads.\n\nA decision has not yet been made.\n\nWhat did the Supreme Court ruling say about government official's social media accounts?\n\nIn Lindke v. Freed, James Freed, the city manager of Port Huron, Mich., posted about the COVID-19 pandemic on his personal Facebook page. Facebook user Kevin Lindke responded, expressing his displeasure with the city's response to the pandemic. Initially, Freed deleted the comments but later blocked Lindke from commenting. Because Freed identified himself as the city manager on his Facebook page, Lindke sued Freed, alleging that his First Amendment rights were violated, as he believed the page constituted a public forum.\n\nIn the Supreme Court opinion, Justice Amy Coney Barrett asserted that many government officials use social media for personal communication, and in cases in which officials have distinctly separated their personal social media posts and accounts from official business, they retain their rights as private citizens and have the capability to block users and comments.\n\n\"A close look is definitely necessary in the context of a public official using social media. There are approximately 20 million state and local government employees across the Nation, with an extraordinarily wide range of job descriptions -- from Governors, mayors, and police chiefs to teachers, healthcare professionals, and transportation workers,\" she wrote. \"Many use social media for personal communication, official communication, or both -- and the line between the two is often blurred.\"\n\nShe wrote that such officials \"may look like they are always on the clock\" and it could be \"tempting to characterize every encounter as part of the job,\" but they are \"also private citizens with their own constitutional rights.\"\n\nBut Freed's page was not designated either \"personal\" or \"official,\" and he often posted information related to his job.\n\nIn the official ruling, the Supreme Court established new guidelines and unanimously held that \"A public official who prevents someone from commenting on the official's social-media page engages in state action under \u00a71983 only if the official both (1) possessed actual authority to speak on the State's behalf on a particular matter, and (2) purported to exercise that authority when speaking in the relevant social-media posts.\"\n\nExclusive:Police who responded to Uvalde shooting ordered to testify before a grand jury\n\nWhat official government pages can and cannot do\n\nInformation from the American Civil Liberties Union of Indiana suggests the issue is more nuanced. According to the ACLU, official government pages cannot:\n\nBut the organization suggests that the associated page can limit other kinds of interactions.\n\n\"An official can also preclude all comments or in certain circumstances limit discussions to certain subjects,\" the website states. \"In other words, government officials may have no obligation to open the social media account up for public comment, but if they do, they cannot discriminate as to which views get to be expressed in those comments.\"", "source": {"uri": "statesman.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Austin American-Statesman"}, "authors": [{"uri": "brandi_d_addison@statesman.com", "name": "Brandi D.

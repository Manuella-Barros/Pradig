Vance for his prior statements against former President Donald Trump.\n\nOn the air with Bill Maher on Friday, Buttigieg implied that Vance is more of an opportunist than a reformed Trump-loyalist despite being in Trump's good graces since he won his Senate race in 2022.\n\nCiting their shared midwest roots, the former mayor of South Bend, Indiana, criticized Vance as a person \"who would say whatever they needed to to get ahead.\"\n\n\"Five years ago, that seemed like being the anti-Trump Republican, so that's what he talked about,\" Buttigieg said.\n\nThe 39-year-old senator from Ohio rose to national prominence in 2016 following the publication of his memoir Hillbilly Elegy,\" which had strong themes of the slow demise of Appalachian culture.\n\nIn the early stages of his political career, Vance was a strong critic of Trump, calling him a \"total fraud,\" a \"moral disaster,\" and \"America's Hitler.\"\n\nVance, during this period, also referred to Trump and the cult of personality surrounding the current Republican nominee as an \"opioid,\" a phrase on which Buttigieg pounced.\n\nButtigieg called the opioid comment from Vance \"kind of a weird thing to say about a person\" to uproarious laughter from Maher's audience.\n\n\"But I mean, for somebody whose identity is that they're connected to Appalachia, which has an opioid crisis, that really is the darkest thing you could possibly say about Donald Trump,\" said Buttigieg.\n\nAlthough not referenced by Buttigieg or Maher, Vance's personal history with his mother's drug addiction, a main thread in his memoir, also adds weight to the criticism.\n\nMaher also asked Vance about Vance's supporter and primary financial backer, the founder of PayPal, Peter Thiel.\n\nThiel, like Buttigieg, married his longtime partner, and Maher highlighted that Vance is opposed to gay marriage.\n\nButtigeig said Thiel's and other Silicon Valley billionaires's backing of a Trump-Vance ticket is \"not that complicated.\"\n\n\"These are very rich men who have decided to go back to the Republican Party that tends to do good things for very rich men,\" said Buttigieg. \"That's kind of what you're getting with J.D.\"\n\nButtigieg compared Vance's flip-flop to that of former Vice President Mike Pence, who Buttigieg characterized as compromising his Evangelical values to support Trump, \"who was mixed up with a port star.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nThe Transportation Secretary added that although Pence got his \"four glorious years\" as vice president, \"it ended on the west front of the Capitol with Trump supporters proposing that he be hanged for using the one shred of integrity he still had to stand up to an attempt to overthrow the government.\"\n\n\"So I guess maybe not as a politician, but as a human being. What I'll say is that I hope things work out a little bit better for J.D.

These are very rich men who have decided to back the Republican party that tends to do good things for very rich men.\"\n\nFollowing Trump's announcement at the Republican National Convention that Vance is officially moving forward as his pick for VP, publications like USA Today did some digging on Vance's financial backers and found that his ties to Thiel go all the way back to 2011, when Vance was a student at Yale Law School and Thiel was a venture capitalist, going on to donate $15 million to support Vance's campaign to win a seat in the U.S. Senate.\n\n\"I knew a lot of people like him,\" Buttigieg said of Vance, looking back at his own Ivy League days spent at Harvard. \"I found a lot of people like him who would say whatever they needed to, to get ahead. Five years ago that seemed like being the anti-Trump Republican, so that's what he was . . . Five years later, the way he gets ahead is that he's the greatest guy since sliced bread.\"\n\nUsing Mike Pence as another example of someone who he initially knew as having very different values than Trump, but embraced him in order to get power, only to be offered up as a sacrifice at the end when he held on to \"the last shred of integrity he still had\" during the events of Jan. 6, Buttigieg hopes for a better outcome for Vance's run as vice president, should his chosen team win.\n\n\"I hope things work out a little bit better for JD Vance than they did for Mike Pence,\" he says.", "source": {"uri": "salon.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Salon.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Buttigieg", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pete Buttigieg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_Transportation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Secretary of Transportation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Thiel", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Peter Thiel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Time_with_Bill_Maher", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Real Time with Bill Maher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juris_Doctor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Juris Doctor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coming_out", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coming out"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gay", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PayPal", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "PayPal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yale_Law_School", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Yale Law School"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_National_Convention", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Republican National Convention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Today", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "USA Today"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon_Valley", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Silicon Valley"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Capitalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Pence", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mike Pence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_University", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Harvard University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivy_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ivy League"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 76}], "image": "https://mediaproxy.salon.com/width/1200/https://media2.salon.com/2021/08/pete-butiigieg-0817211.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9749669", "eventUri": "eng-9749669", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-01-06", "textStart": 2033, "textEnd": 2039}], "sentiment": 0.223529411764706, "wgt": 198, "relevance": 1}

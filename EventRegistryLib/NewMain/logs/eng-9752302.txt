The person spoke on condition of anonymity because no official announcement has been made.\n\nThe deal will begin with the 2026 season and run through 2036, with it potentially evaluated after three years and potentially give the WNBA a chance to get even more money. The WNBA's deal was announced shortly after the NBA's.\n\n\"Partnering with Disney, Amazon and NBCU marks a monumental chapter in WNBA history and clearly demonstrates the significant rise in value and the historic level of interest in women\u00b4s basketball,\" said WNBA Commissioner Cathy Engelbert. \"These agreements allow the league to continue to build a long-term and sustainable growth model for the future of women\u00b4s basketball and sports which will benefit WNBA players, teams and fans.\"\n\nThe deal also will make the broadcast partners responsible for production and marketing commitments, meaning the roughly.$200 million a year is purely for media rights.\n\nThe league's current media deal is valued at about $60 million per year. The NBA, which owns about 60% of the WNBA, has negotiated the new deals.\n\nArike Ogunbowale, right, of Team WNBA, celebrates after her 3-point basket against Team USA with teammates Caitlin Clark, center, and Aliyah Boston, left, during the second half of a WNBA All-Star basketball game Saturday, July 20, 2024, in Phoenix. (AP Photo/Ross D. Franklin)\n\nUnder the new agreements, the partners will distribute more than 125 regular season and playoff games nationally each year. There will be 25 regular-season games on Disney platforms, 50 on NBC and 30 on Prime Video.\n\nThe playoffs will be split among the three groups. Disney, which owns ABC and ESPN, will broadcast two of the first-round series, and NBC and Prime Video will each get one. The semis and finals will rotate over the 11-year deal, with Disney having eight semis and five finals. Prime and NBC each will have seven of the semifinal series and three finals.\n\n\"We\u00b4re proud of our highly productive and collaborative partnership with the WNBA since the league\u00b4s inception in 1997,\" said ESPN Chairman Jimmy Pitaro. \"Through our marquee collection of rights, which includes the WNBA Finals, we will continue to play an important role in the league\u00b4s extraordinary growth trajectory while fueling ESPN\u00b4s digital future and super-serving fans as only we can.\"\n\nThe new revenue could greatly increase player salaries, which have been an issue for many years. Since the league was founded in 1997, players have gone overseas to supplement their incomes. The top base salary this year is $242,000, with players potentially earning over half a million through salary, marketing agreements and bonuses. Caitlin Clark makes $76,000 as the No. 1 pick in the draft.\n\nThe league has had a deal with Amazon Prime since 2021 and is showing 21 games this season on the streaming service.\n\nThe WNBA also has broadcast deals with ION and CBS that run through 2025 and could be renewed after they expire, potentially bringing in at least $60 million annually. The ION deal is worth $13 million a year right now.\n\nThe league has had incredible ratings over the past two seasons, including seeing the All-Star Game last weekend draw 3.4 million viewers, making it the third most-viewed event in the league's history. It was the 17th WNBA game this season that has had more than 1 million viewers, with Clark appearing in 15 of them.\n\nThe WNBA is expanding to 14 teams over the next two seasons, with the Golden State Valkyries starting play next year and a franchise in Toronto beginning in 2026.\n\nWhen news of the deal first came to light last week, the player's union had concerns that the league is being undervalued.\n\n\"We have wondered for months how the NBA would value the WNBA in its media rights deal,\" executive director of the union Terri Jackson said in a statement. \"With a reportedly $75 billion deal on the table, the league is in control of its own destiny. More precisely, the NBA controls the destiny of the WNBA.\"\n\n\"We look forward to learning how the NBA arrived at a $200 million valuation - if initial reports are accurate or even close. Neither the NBA nor the WNBA can deny that in the last few years, we have seen unprecedented growth across all metrics, the players continue to demonstrate their commitment to building the brand, and that the fans keep showing up. There is no excuse to undervalue the WNBA again.\"\n\nAP WNBA: https://apnews.com/hub/wnba-basketball\n\nCaitlin Clark, left, of Team WNBA, dribbles against Sabrina Ionescu (6), of Team USA, during the second half of a WNBA All-Star basketball game Saturday, July 20, 2024, in Phoenix.

While a dramatic increase over the league's current rights deal ($43 million/year, per multiple reports), the reaction from within the league has been less-than-enthusiastic. \"We look forward to learning how the NBA arrived at a $200 million valuation -- if initial reports are accurate or even close,\" WNBA players union leader Terri Jackson said in a statement, adding that there \"is no excuse to undervalue the WNBA again.\"\n\nCheryl Miller -- the USC great and former Mercury coach who returned to the sidelines for Saturday's All-Star Game -- was more blunt. \"Lowball. That's a lowball. Not enough, not even close. ... Two [billion]'s nice, an eight would be better.\" Is Miller's assessment correct? Is the WNBA on the verge of a bonanza or a raw deal?\n\nThe primary WNBA media rights deal is unusual in pro sports, as it is included as part of another league's larger, more expansive contract. Rights to the WNBA are included in the bundle of rights the NBA negotiates with its media partners and the league determines the fee allocated to the league. \"We have wondered for months how the NBA would value the WNBA in its media rights deal,\" Jackson said, noting that the league is not only in control of its own destiny, but that it \"controls the destiny of the WNBA.\" This arrangement was beneficial for the league during its lean years. It is unlikely that the WNBA would have secured anything close to its current $43 million/year on the open market when the expiring rights deal was negotiated in 2014, an era in which the league was an especially weak draw and barely on television.\n\nThe growth over the past decade had been incremental until this season, when a star-studded rookie class -- Caitlin Clark in particular -- arrived in the league. Viewership has soared to levels not seen since the league's early years, and in some cases ever before. In just the first half of the season, more games averaged a seven-figure audience (16) than any full season in league history. By contrast, not a single game managed even 900,000 viewers last season, even the clinching game of a highly-regarded WNBA Finals.\n\nBased on the first half of this season, it seems likely that the WNBA could hold its own on the open market. The NWSL, whose audience is in-line with the WNBA's pre-Clark norm, was able to negotiate a $60 million/year deal last year. Instead, the WNBA remains part of the NBA bundle, and subject not to the dictates of the market but instead to the bigger league's determination of its value -- and more importantly, the NBA's timeline.\n\nIt is not necessarily the case that $200 million per year is chump change or even a low-ball offer at this current juncture. It is still too early to know whether the WNBA can sustain the lofty figures that it has earned so far this season, and given the status quo that existed for nearly two decades prior to Clark's arrival -- when not a single game hit the million viewer mark for 16 years -- it is fair to want a sample size greater than half a season. The issue is that this deal does not go into effect until 2026 and then lasts through the 2036 season. In the event that the current growth is not only sustained into the second half of the season, but continues apace into future years, $200 million/year could look like a severe underpay even by the time the deal begins, to say nothing of how it might look in 2030 or 2035.\n\nIn 2011, the National Hockey League signed a ten-year deal with NBC Sports for the same $200 million/year, at the time the largest-ever television contract for a league that had gone years without a rights fee for its over-the-air package. In relatively short order, the deal proved to be a significant underpay. The issue was not the rights fee, as it is unlikely the NHL would have been in position to earn more from another bidder when the deal was negotiated. Instead, the issue was the deal term. Locking in that price for a full decade meant that when the NHL experienced a surge in popularity on the back of the dynastic Chicago Blackhawks, it was in no position to capitalize. It also meant that by the time a new deal was negotiated a decade later, the league was working from a modest base -- meaning that even with the massive increases in rights fees it earned from Disney and Warner Bros. Discovery, its U.S. rights are still going for less than $700 million per year, chump change for a \"Big Four\" league.\n\nThe primary issue facing the WNBA in this negotiation is that the league is operating on the NBA's timeline. For the NBA, locking in $7 billion a year for 11 years is the smart move, given the uncertainty about where the industry will be by the mid-2030s. There is no reason to expect a meaningful change in the NBA audience over the next 11 years, at least not one that would make $7 billion look like an underpay. If there is any point in the next 11 years in which $7 billion/year can be called a bargain, then the league will be in excellent shape, and the industry will have proven durable to what should be existential changes in the years ahead.\n\nFor the WNBA, locking in $200 million/year means 11 years of being paid like a fledgling league on the cusp of growth. Perhaps that is where the league will remain; there are, after all, no guarantees in this business. With that said, the widespread expectation is that the growth in the first half of this season is merely the beginning of something akin to the NBA's rise to prominence in the Magic and Bird era (if not at the same scale). That potential may never come to fruition, but it will be impossible for the league to capitalize if it does, at least not until Clark is a 34-year-old veteran.\n\nIt should be noted that the WNBA will still reserve the right to sell media rights deals separately from the NBA. Depending on the reporting, the league will have one or two additional packages to put up for market. The league already sells separate rights deals, having struck agreements with CBS Sports, Scripps (ION) and Amazon. Per a source, the value of these deals in a new agreement could add an additional $60-$100 million/year to the WNBA rights haul.\n\nYet it should also be noted that the main rights deal figures to make the additional contracts less appetizing. The NBA currently has two broadcast partners, Disney and Warner Bros. Discovery, of which only one (Disney) airs WNBA games. As a result, the CBS, ION and Amazon deals constitute the league's \"B,\" \"C\" and \"D\" packages, if one wanted to use that terminology. In the new NBA deal, WNBA games would air on all three of the NBA's partners -- Disney, Amazon and Comcast (NBC) -- meaning the additional packages would be for the \"D\" and \"E\" packages. At a certain point, there is not enough inventory to go around to justify being fifth on the depth chart. Even if the WNBA is able to secure two partners on relatively short-term deals, any rights fees would likely to be too constrained by limited inventory to maximize the league's earning potential.\n\nUltimately, the WNBA has benefited for years from operating under the aegis of the NBA, but eventually the league was going to reach the point where it would need to grow on its own. Perhaps it is has not quite reached that point yet, but if it that remains the case in 2036, it will have severely underachieved its potential in the Clark era. In the situation the league faces, a short-term deal of perhaps even as few as three years would seem to make the most sense -- with the league negotiating packages in advance of a U.S.-based 2028 Olympics that should feature Clark and the rest of the current rookie class. Perhaps the NBA deal will mimic that of the NFL and include an opt-out at the league's discretion, but even that would surely not go into effect until six or seven years down the line.\n\nPer a source, the WNBA deal does include a clause allowing for a revaluation of the media rights fee after the 2028 season. (Vorkunov also reported the revaluation clause.) The revaluation would be done at the discretion of the WNBA, not the NBA. This three-year look-in is not the same as an opt-out that would put the rights on the open market, but it does create an opening for the league and networks to increase the rights fee in the near-term.\n\nEven if the WNBA were to secure a larger rights fee in the current negotiation, that would not change the primary issue -- than an 11-year-deal for a league at the beginning of a growth cycle is simply too long to be responsive to shifts in popularity. As it stands now, the only way an 11-year-term will be beneficial for the league is if its popularity stalls or even reverses.", "source": {"uri": "sportsmediawatch.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Media Watch"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jon_lewis@sportsmediawatch.com", "name": "Jon Lewis", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Women's National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hockey_League", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National Hockey League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Athletic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Athletic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheryl_Miller", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cheryl Miller"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Walt_Disney_Company", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Walt Disney Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Southern_California", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "University of Southern California"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Bros._Discovery", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Warner Bros.

Here's the latest on the WNBA's next media rights deals and other, new possibilities and partnerships:\n\nAs part of the NBA's recent negotiations for it's 11-year, approximately $75 billion media rights deals with Disney, NBC and Amazon, the WNBA has secured a new national media rights package worth $2.2 billion across 11 years with the three companies, allowing the league to earn approximately $200 million per year beginning with the 2026 season.\n\nThe WNBA's current deals with Disney, Amazon, CBS and ION are worth around $50 million annually and will expire after the 2025 season. The next package could be expanded to include additional partners. According to The Athletic, the league expects to sell two more rights deals, which could result in around $60 million more annually. The prospect of the league bringing in approximately $260 million in rights fees per year far exceeds WNBA Commissioner Cathy Engelbert's stated desire to double to annual value of the current deal.\n\nHowever, the WNBPA is, rightfully, not simply satisfied with the announced new deals, desiring to ensure that they appropriately and fully value the WNBA. Terri Jackson, Executive Director of the WNBPA, asserted:\n\nWe have wondered for months how the NBA would value the WNBA in its media rights deal. With a reportedly $75 billion deal on the table, the league is in control of its own destiny. More precisely, the NBA controls the destiny of the WNBA. We look forward to learning how the NBA arrived at a $200 million valuation -- if initial reports are accurate or even close. Neither the NBA nor the WNBA can deny that in the last few years, we have seen unprecedented growth across all metrics, the players continue to demonstrate their commitment to building the brand, and that the fans keep showing up. There is no excuse to undervalue the WNBA again.\n\nAt WNBA All-Star 2024, Cheryl Miller, who served as head coach of Team WNBA, was more blunt with her dissatisfaction with the deal, insisting, \"That's a lowball.\" She continued, \"Not enough, not even close,\" implying that the value of the league as an entertainment product should approach $8 billion.\n\nAt a press conference before Saturday's WNBA All-Star Game, Commissioner Cathy Engelbert declined to elaborate on the details of the league's forthcoming media rights deals, simply saying:\n\nI think we're going to do something historic. I think once we're able to finalize those media deals, everybody is going to understand that this is a historic time for women's sports and the WNBA will be leading that ... our next round of media deals will allow us to continue to transform this league.\n\nHowever, she did share other information about the direction of the league, suggesting that the 2025 WNBA season could feature 44 games, the most allowed under the current collective bargaining agreement. Engelbert said:\n\nWe're looking at the footprint for next year. We don't have an international competition like the FIBA World Cup or the Olympics next year, so we'll be able to look at our footprint without any interruption or break, like we're breaking this year.\n\nThe league also is looking at expanding its reach by holding exhibition games in Europe, Asia, Mexico City and the Middle East. Engelbert additionally indicated that the expansion draft for the Golden State Valkyries likely will be held in December. She also reiterated that the league intends to expand to 16 teams by 2028.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Los Angeles Lakers announced that Lindsey Harding, the G League Coach of the Year with the Stockton Kings, will join head coach JJ Redick's staff. Harding overlapped at Duke with Redick before she became the No. 1 pick in the 2007 WNBA Draft.\n\nOn Thursday, the Phoenix Mercury officially opened the team's sparkling new practice facility. Mercury star Kahleah Copper, in attendance for the unveiling of the $100 million facility, shared her first impression with ESPN, saying, \"Oh, my jaw drop. Like, [be right back], about to go cry. How the heck did I fall into this? Is this like, am I dreaming? ... Get into just the details, it's crazy. We blessed.\"\n\nThe grand opening also included a ceremony celebrating the two practice courts named for franchise legend Diana Taurasi.\n\nBumble, the women-first dating app, has become the WNBA's first-ever official dating app partner, with the goal of creating spaces for women to forge meaningful connections over a shared love of the game.\n\nThe partnership launched on Thursday when Bumble served as the presenting partner of the Orange Carpet at WNBA Live, where All-Stars like the Seattle Storm's Nneka Ogwumike showed off their most fashionable fits.\n\nOn Tuesday, the WNBA and New Balance announced a multi-year partnership, with the sportswear brand becoming an official league marketing partner. Now able to feature WNBA logos and branding, New Balance intends to create original content around Los Angeles Sparks rookie, and New Balance athlete, Cameron Brink.\n\nBet on women. (But in this case, only if you have sufficient financial security and reside in a state with legal sports betting.)\n\nAnnounced on Thursday, the partnership between the WNBA and DraftKings, now the league's Official Sports Betting and Daily Fantasy Partner, is a reflection of the exponentially increasing popularity of women's basketball and sports betting.

The person spoke on condition of anonymity on Wednesday night because no official announcement has been made.\n\nThe deal was first reported by The Athletic.\n\nThe WNBA's current media deal, which is valued at about $60 million per year, is set to expire after the 2025 season. The NBA, which owns about 60% of the WNBA has negotiated the new deals.\n\nWNBA Commissioner Cathy Engelbert had said before the season that she hoped to at least double the league's annual rights revenue since the league has grown the last few years. This would more than triple it.\n\nThe WNBA players are expected to opt out of the current collective bargaining agreement after this season which would end that deal after next year.\n\nNew deal impact\n\nThe new revenue could greatly increase player salaries which has been an issue for many years. Since the league was founded in 1997 players have gone overseas to supplement their incomes. The top base salary this year is $242,000 with players potentially earning over half a million through salary, marketing agreements and bonuses. Right now Caitlin Clark makes $76,000 as the No. 1 pick in the draft.\n\nLeague's growth\n\nJackson feels the league could be undervalued with its popularity being at an all-time high. The WNBA has had strong growth the past few seasons, but really took off this year led by rookies Clark and Angel Reese. The WNBA has had record attendance and viewership this year heading into the Olympic break.\n\nWNBA ahead on streaming\n\nThe new NBA TV rights deal will put games on Amazon Prime for the first time. The WNBA has had games on Amazon Prime since 2021, including the annual Commissioner's Cup championship. The league is showing 21 games this season on the streaming service.\n\nOther media revenue\n\nThe league currently has deals to broadcast games on CBS and the ION network as well on ESPN and Amazon. The CBS and ION deals could be renewed after they expire which would add more money to the overall media deal package. The ION deal, worth $13 million a year, is scheduled to end after next season.\n\nLove 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I

The NBA's Board of Governors approved an 11-year, $76 billion deal with Disney, NBC, and Amazon Prime Video, with the WNBA set to receive about $200 million per year. However, Miller expressed her dissatisfaction with the deal, calling it a \"lowball\" offer that falls short of what the league deserves.\n\nAs a basketball legend and advocate for women's sports, Miller believes that the WNBA deserves a deal that reflects its value and potential. She emphasized the need for tough negotiators and visionaries to secure a better agreement for the league. Terri Jackson, the executive director of the WNBA players union, also raised concerns about the valuation of the league in the deal, questioning how the NBA arrived at the $200 million figure.\n\nDespite the criticisms, both Miller and Jackson are optimistic about the future of the WNBA and its growth potential. They believe that the league's players and fans have shown a strong commitment to building the brand and increasing its popularity. With the right negotiations and support, they hope to secure a more favorable deal for the WNBA in the future.\n\nOverall, the WNBA's media rights deal has sparked important conversations about the value of women's sports and the need for fair and equitable treatment.

The person spoke on condition of anonymity because no official announcement has been made.\n\nThe deal will begin with the 2026 season and run through 2036, with it potentially evaluated after three years and potentially give the WNBA a chance to get even more money. The WNBA's deal was announced shortly after the NBA's.\n\n\"Partnering with Disney, Amazon and NBCU marks a monumental chapter in WNBA history and clearly demonstrates the significant rise in value and the historic level of interest in women's basketball,\" said WNBA Commissioner Cathy Engelbert. \"These agreements allow the league to continue to build a long-term and sustainable growth model for the future of women's basketball and sports which will benefit WNBA players, teams and fans.\"\n\nThe deal also will make the broadcast partners responsible for production and marketing commitments, meaning the roughly.$200 million a year is purely for media rights.\n\nThe league's current media deal is valued at about $60 million per year. The NBA, which owns about 60% of the WNBA, has negotiated the new deals.\n\nUnder the new agreements, the partners will distribute more than 125 regular season and playoff games nationally each year. There will be 25 regular-season games on Disney platforms, 50 on NBC and 30 on Prime Video.\n\nThe playoffs will be split among the three groups. Disney, which owns ABC and ESPN, will broadcast two of the first-round series, and NBC and Prime Video will each get one. The semis and finals will rotate over the 11-year deal, with Disney having eight semis and five finals. Prime and NBC each will have seven of the semifinal series and three finals.\n\n\"We're proud of our highly productive and collaborative partnership with the WNBA since the league's inception in 1997,\" said ESPN Chairman Jimmy Pitaro. \"Through our marquee collection of rights, which includes the WNBA Finals, we will continue to play an important role in the league's extraordinary growth trajectory while fueling ESPN's digital future and super-serving fans as only we can.\"\n\nThe new revenue could greatly increase player salaries, which have been an issue for many years. Since the league was founded in 1997, players have gone overseas to supplement their incomes. The top base salary this year is $242,000, with players potentially earning over a half-million through salary, marketing agreements and bonuses. Caitlin Clark makes $76,000 as the No. 1 pick in the draft.\n\nThe league has had a deal with Amazon Prime since 2021 and is showing 21 games this season on the streaming service.\n\nThe WNBA also has broadcast deals with ION and CBS that run through 2025 and could be renewed after they expire, potentially bringing in at least $60 million annually. The ION deal is worth $13 million a year right now.\n\nThe league has had incredible ratings over the past two seasons, including seeing the All-Star Game last weekend draw 3.4 million viewers, making it the third most-viewed event in the league's history. It was the 17th WNBA game this season that has had more than 1 million viewers, with Clark appearing in 15 of them.\n\nThe WNBA is expanding to 14 teams over the next two seasons, with the Golden State Valkyries starting play next year and a franchise in Toronto beginning in 2026.\n\nWhen news of the deal first came to light last week, the player's union had concerns that the league is being undervalued.\n\n\"We have wondered for months how the NBA would value the WNBA in its media rights deal,\" executive director of the union Terri Jackson said in a statement. \"With a reportedly $75 billion deal on the table, the league is in control of its own destiny. More precisely, the NBA controls the destiny of the WNBA.\"\n\n\"We look forward to learning how the NBA arrived at a $200 million valuation -- if initial reports are accurate or even close.

Lowball,\" Miller said. \"Not enough. Not even close. Now, I'm not trying to inflate it a whole lot, but a two's nice. An eight would be better.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, reports surfaced that the WNBA would make $200 million annually over 11-year deals with ESPN, Amazon, and NBC, with the chance to make another $60 million with other partners. Miller, the weekend's Team WNBA coach (whose group soundly beat the Olympic squad in a highly competitive game) said women's basketball is in a great position, and will only continue to grow with the next group of college basketball stars and a strong performance in Paris this summer. To get that number, Miller said the league needs \"a bully behind the table.\"\n\n\"We need top and fair negotiators and visionaries, and we need a bully,\" Miller said. \"But there's a certain number bigger than two that we want.\"\n\nThe league currently has the NBA behind the table, which is a point of contention for WNBPA executive director Terri Jackson. In a statement to The Washington Post on Wednesday, Jackson made it clear that the players' association was not involved in the valuation or negotiating process, and did not agree with the number everyone landed on.\n\n\"We have wondered for months how the NBA would value the WNBA in its media rights deal,\" Jackson said. \"With a reportedly $75 billion deal on the table, the league is in control of its own destiny. More precisely, the NBA controls the destiny of the WNBA.\n\n\"We look forward to learning how the NBA arrived at a $200 million valuation -- if initial reports are accurate or even close. Neither the NBA nor the WNBA can deny that in the last few years, we have seen unprecedented growth across all metrics, the players continue to demonstrate their commitment to building the brand, and that the fans keep showing up. There is no excuse to undervalue the WNBA again.\"\n\nBuilt into the structure of the deal is the possibility to renegotiate with the partners three years in to determine if the league's rights have been undervalued. That's important for a growing league, because while the WNBA needs a cash injection fast, it wouldn't make sense to lock the skyrocketing league into 11-year terms like the NBA.\n\nBut with the deal not kicking in until the 2026 season, that would mean any renegotiations wouldn't happen until after the 2028 season. That's a long time to wait.", "source": {"uri": "frontofficesports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Front Office Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "margaret_fleming@frontofficesports.com", "name": "Margaret Fleming", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheryl_Miller", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cheryl Miller"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Women's National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Women's basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Amazon (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_All-Star_Weekend", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA All-Star Weekend"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackson,_Mississippi", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jackson, Mississippi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jackson, Mississippi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_National_Basketball_Players_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Women's National Basketball Players Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "College basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Washington_Post", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Washington Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball_positions", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Basketball positions"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 66}], "image": "https://frontofficesports.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/cherk-scaled.jpg?quality=100", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9752302", "eventUri": "eng-9752302", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "wgt": 197, "relevance": 1}

The person spoke on condition of anonymity because no official announcement has been made.\n\nThe deal will begin with the 2026 season and run through 2036, with it potentially evaluated after three years and potentially give the WNBA a chance to get even more money. The WNBA's deal was announced shortly after the NBA's.\n\n\"Partnering with Disney, Amazon and NBCU marks a monumental chapter in WNBA history and clearly demonstrates the significant rise in value and the historic level of interest in women's basketball,\" said WNBA Commissioner Cathy Engelbert. \"These agreements allow the league to continue to build a long-term and sustainable growth model for the future of women's basketball and sports which will benefit WNBA players, teams and fans.\"\n\nThe deal also will make the broadcast partners responsible for production and marketing commitments, meaning the roughly.$200 million a year is purely for media rights.\n\nThe league's current media deal is valued at about $60 million per year. The NBA, which owns about 60% of the WNBA, has negotiated the new deals.\n\nUnder the new agreements, the partners will distribute more than 125 regular season and playoff games nationally each year. There will be 25 regular-season games on Disney platforms, 50 on NBC and 30 on Prime Video.\n\nThe playoffs will be split among the three groups. Disney, which owns ABC and ESPN, will broadcast two of the first-round series, and NBC and Prime Video will each get one. The semis and finals will rotate over the 11-year deal, with Disney having eight semis and five finals. Prime and NBC each will have seven of the semifinal series and three finals.\n\n\"We're proud of our highly productive and collaborative partnership with the WNBA since the league's inception in 1997,\" said ESPN Chairman Jimmy Pitaro. \"Through our marquee collection of rights, which includes the WNBA Finals, we will continue to play an important role in the league's extraordinary growth trajectory while fueling ESPN's digital future and super-serving fans as only we can.\"\n\nThe new revenue could greatly increase player salaries, which have been an issue for many years. Since the league was founded in 1997, players have gone overseas to supplement their incomes. The top base salary this year is $242,000, with players potentially earning over half a million through salary, marketing agreements and bonuses. Caitlin Clark makes $76,000 as the No. 1 pick in the draft.\n\nThe league has had a deal with Amazon Prime since 2021 and is showing 21 games this season on the streaming service.\n\nThe WNBA also has broadcast deals with ION and CBS that run through 2025 and could be renewed after they expire. The ION deal is worth $13 million a year right now.\n\nThe league has had incredible ratings over the past two seasons, including seeing the All-Star Game last weekend draw 3.4 million viewers, making it the third most-viewed event in the league's history. It was the 17th WNBA game this season that has had more than 1 million viewers, with Clark appearing in 15 of them.\n\nThe WNBA is expanding to 14 teams over the next two seasons, with the Golden State Valkyries starting play next year and a franchise in Toronto beginning in 2026.\n\nWhen news of the deal first came to light last week, the player's union had concerns that the league is being undervalued.\n\n\"We have wondered for months how the NBA would value the WNBA in its media rights deal,\" executive director of the union Terri Jackson said in a statement. \"With a reportedly $75 billion deal on the table, the league is in control of its own destiny. More precisely, the NBA controls the destiny of the WNBA.\"\n\n\"We look forward to learning how the NBA arrived at a $200 million valuation -- if initial reports are accurate or even close.

Only the W's first two nationally-televised games back in 1997 drew a larger audience.\n\nFootprint Center was sold out with 16,407 fans in the building to watch the WNBA All-Star team defeat Team USA 117-109 in a highly competitive matchup before the Olympic team begins group play in Paris.\n\nNo WNBA All-Star Game before had ratings reach these metrics. The 2023 All-Star Game produced 850,000 viewers on ABC, while the previous record in 2003 had 1.44 million viewers.\n\nThe event also drew more eyes than any previous WNBA event on ESPN Networks, besting the 2024 WNBA Draft (2.45 million) when Caitlin Clark went first overall out of Iowa to the Indiana Fever.\n\nThis has been a significant season for the WNBA in terms of audience growth. The W saw its most attended first month in 26 years and most watched opening month in league history.\n\n\"To be a part of this, to see it grow, it's super special,\" Clark said. \"I'm happy for the players that have been in this league for a really long time to have moments like these and opportunities like these, because they deserve it.

Phoenix Mercury stars Diana Taurasi, Brittney Griner and Kahleah Copper also suited up for the Olympic squad.\n\n\"I think it's a combination of things,\" U.S. head coach Cheryl Reeve said of the All-Star Game spectacle. \"I think where the league is today, the attention it's getting, the players that are going to be on the court, the excitement that exists for not only the national team but the players on the All-Star team representing the W. All of that converging at once makes it incredibly exciting.\n\n\"I have to give Phoenix credit ... Phoenix has done an incredible job with this All-Star Game. And so hats off to Mat Ishbia and the way he values the WNBA that is on full display.\"\n\nThe broadcast of Friday's events, including the skills challenge and 3-point contests, drew 695,000 viewers on ESPN. That marked a 142% jump from 2023.\n\nTeam USA defeated Germany 84-57 on Tuesday in London, the Americans' final tune-up game before the Paris Games. The national team takes on Japan on Monday.", "source": {"uri": "arizonasports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Arizona Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "alex_weiner@arizonasports.com", "name": "Alex

Despite the jump, Terri Carmichael Jackson, executive director of the WNBA players' union, is concerned the league is being undervalued.\n\n\"We have wondered for months how the NBA would value the WNBA in its media rights deal,\" she provided in a statement to the Washington Post. \"With a reportedly $75 billion deal on the table, the league is in control of its own destiny. More precisely, the NBA controls the destiny of the WNBA.\"\n\nHall of Famer Cheryl Miller was even more succinct: \"That's a lowball.\"\n\n\"We need tough and fair negotiators and visionaries,\" Miller said. \"And we need a bully...behind the table that's willing to say, 'We'll break up the pieces and go from there.' But there's a certain number bigger than 2 that we want.\"\n\nThe WNBA. launched in 1996, is 60% owned by the NBA, which negotiated both the previous deal and the one on the horizon. The league's current media deal with Disney, Ion, CBS and Amazon, worth $50 million annually, expires after the 2025 season.\n\nThat deal was signed before the women's basketball fandom jumped to warp speed on the power of Caitlin Clark, Angel Reece and their generation of superstars. The 2024 WNBA Draft drew 2.45 million viewers, five times as many as the previous year. ESPN's broadcast of Clark's opening night game with the Indiana Fever against the Connecticut Sun had the highest viewership for a WNBA game on the network with an average of 2.1 million viewers.\n\nThe meteoric rise in women's sports has been seen across leagues and conferences, from college sports, to the new Professional Women's Hockey League, United Soccer League Super League, a professional women's volleyball league and greater equity for women in the Olympic games.\n\nThe financial firm Deloitte predicted at the end of 2023 that women's elite sports would generate global revenues of $1.28 billion in 2024, 300% higher than its 2021 valuation.\n\nrevenue jump seems dramatic, but critics point out it is dwarfed by the NBA media's rights, worth about $76 billion over 11 years. WNBA Commissioner Cathy Engelbert said despite the disparity, it's an advantage for the league to continue its partnership with the NBA, especially in the age of streaming and subscriptions.\n\n\"We and the NBA are maybe the only sports properties that can give 330 days of live programming -- almost the entire year,\" she said. \"That's hugely valuable to a subscription platform.\"", "source": {"uri": "forbes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Forbes"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Women's National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheryl_Miller", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cheryl Miller"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_Players_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball Players Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Women's basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackson,_Mississippi", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jackson, Mississippi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jackson, Mississippi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caitlin_Clark", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Caitlin Clark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion_Television", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ion Television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Amazon (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naismith_Memorial_Basketball_Hall_of_Fame", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "CBS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Walt_Disney_Company", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Walt Disney Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Washington_Post", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Washington Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathy_Engelbert", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cathy Engelbert"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connecticut_Sun", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Connecticut Sun"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Soccer_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Soccer League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Fever", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Fever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Super League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volleyball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Volleyball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deloitte", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Deloitte"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Youth_and_High_School", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Youth and High School", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 86}], "image": "https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/669ee1c2cf7d8be3eda79f95/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=600&width=1200&fit=bounds", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9752302", "eventUri": "eng-9752302", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 182, "relevance": 1}

This viewership surpasses the previous record set in 2003, when 1.441 million tuned in to watch a matchup at Madison Square Garden. The 2003 WNBA All-Star Game featured legends like Lisa Leslie, Sue Bird and Sheryl Swoopes.\n\nThe increased interest can be attributed to the star power of Caitlin Clark and Angel Reese, who played pivotal roles in leading Team WNBA to victory against the U.S. women's national team. Clark and Reese, two of the league's most prominent rookies, have consistently drawn large audiences this season. Clark has played in 15 of the 17 WNBA games that have topped 1 million viewers this year. Notably, the two most-watched regular-season games involved matchups between Clark's Indiana Fever and Reese's Chicago Sky, each attracting over 2 million viewers.\n\nHowever, it's not just the sheer number of viewers that has shifted; the demographics of the WNBA's audience have also changed. Every demographic category has seen at least a double-digit increase in viewership, with the biggest gains among young viewers, male viewers and white viewers.\n\nThe WNBA has also improved its television offerings, with more national broadcasts and consistent game schedules on platforms like Prime and Ion, making the games easier to find and follow. While many sports struggle to maintain young audiences, the WNBA has seen its numbers skyrocket. On ESPN networks, the viewership of girls aged 2-17 has surged by 181%, and viewers aged 18-34 are outpacing the league's total growth by 54 percentage points.\n\n\"This weekend's extraordinary viewership underscores women's sports' exponential growth, and ESPN is proud to showcase this incredible league and its exceptional athletes on such a grand stage,\" said Julie Sobieski, ESPN SVP of League Programming and Acquisitions, via Richard Deitsch of The Athletic.\n\nOther WNBA events drawing larger audiences\n\nThe 2024 All-Star Game, aired in prime time on ABC for the second consecutive year, also saw Arike Ogunbowale set an All-Star Game record with 34 points in the second half, earning her second All-Star MVP award.\n\nIn addition to the All-Star Game, other WNBA events have seen increases in viewership. The 2024 WNBA Draft drew an average of 2.446 million viewers on ESPN, a 307% increase from the previous year. This shattered the previous draft viewership record set in 2004 when Diana Taurasi entered the league, drawing 601,000 viewers. Last year's draft, which saw 572,000 viewers, was previously celebrated as the highest since 2004, marking a 42% increase from 2022.\n\nThe surge in interest for the WNBA Draft is part of a broader trend of growing audience engagement with women's basketball. The 2024 NCAA women's basketball championship game between South Carolina and Iowa drew 18.9 million viewers, the highest ever for a women's college basketball game. It surpassed even men's college basketball games on ESPN platforms. The Women's Final Four averaged 13.8 million viewers, with the Iowa-UConn game brinigng in 14.4 million viewers.\n\nViewership averaged 2.2 million per game throughout the NCAA tournament, a 121% increase from the previous year.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "erin_achenbach@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Erin Achenbach", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WNBA_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "WNBA All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Women's National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2003_WNBA_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2003 WNBA All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angel_Reese", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Angel Reese"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caitlin_Clark", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Caitlin Clark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisa_Leslie", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lisa Leslie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sue_Bird", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sue Bird"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheryl_Swoopes", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sheryl Swoopes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madison_Square_Garden", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Madison Square Garden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Broadcasting_Company", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American Broadcasting Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_women's_national_soccer_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States women's national soccer team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion_Television", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ion Television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Fever", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Fever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Sky", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Sky"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCAA_Division_I_women's_basketball_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NCAA Division I women's basketball tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCAA_Division_I_men's_basketball_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arike_Ogunbowale", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arike Ogunbowale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Athletic", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Athletic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Women's basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diana_Taurasi", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Diana Taurasi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "College basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "South Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "South Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Computer_Platforms", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Computer Platforms", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 77}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/WNBA-news-All-Star-Game-draws-jaw-dropping-viewership-numbers-not-seen-in-21-years.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9752302", "eventUri": "eng-9752302", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2784313725490195, "wgt": 181, "relevance": 1}

The person spoke on condition of anonymity because no official announcement has been made.\n\nThe deal will begin with the 2026 season and run through 2036, with it potentially evaluated after three years and potentially give the WNBA a chance to get even more money. The WNBA's deal was announced shortly after the NBA's.\n\n\"Partnering with Disney, Amazon and NBCU marks a monumental chapter in WNBA history and clearly demonstrates the significant rise in value and the historic level of interest in women's basketball,\" said WNBA Commissioner Cathy Engelbert. \"These agreements allow the league to continue to build a long-term and sustainable growth model for the future of women's basketball and sports which will benefit WNBA players, teams and fans.\"\n\nThe deal also will make the broadcast partners responsible for production and marketing commitments, meaning the roughly.$200 million a year is purely for media rights.\n\nThe league's current media deal is valued at about $60 million per year. The NBA, which owns about 60% of the WNBA, has negotiated the new deals.\n\nUnder the new agreements, the partners will distribute more than 125 regular season and playoff games nationally each year. There will be 25 regular-season games on Disney platforms, 50 on NBC and 30 on Prime Video.\n\nThe playoffs will be split among the three groups. Disney, which owns ABC and ESPN, will broadcast two of the first-round series, and NBC and Prime Video will each get one. The semis and finals will rotate over the 11-year deal, with Disney having eight semis and five finals. Prime and NBC each will have seven of the semifinal series and three finals.\n\n\"We're proud of our highly productive and collaborative partnership with the WNBA since the league's inception in 1997,\" said ESPN Chairman Jimmy Pitaro. \"Through our marquee collection of rights, which includes the WNBA Finals, we will continue to play an important role in the league's extraordinary growth trajectory while fueling ESPN's digital future and super-serving fans as only we can.\"\n\nThe new revenue could greatly increase player salaries, which have been an issue for many years. Since the league was founded in 1997, players have gone overseas to supplement their incomes. The top base salary this year is $242,000, with players potentially earning over half a million through salary, marketing agreements and bonuses. Caitlin Clark makes $76,000 as the No. 1 pick in the draft.\n\nThe league has had a deal with Amazon Prime since 2021 and is showing 21 games this season on the streaming service.\n\nThe WNBA also has broadcast deals with ION and CBS that run through 2025 and could be renewed after they expire. The ION deal is worth $13 million a year right now.\n\nThe league has had incredible ratings over the past two seasons, including seeing the All-Star Game last weekend draw 3.4 million viewers, making it the third most-viewed event in the league's history. It was the 17th WNBA game this season that has had more than 1 million viewers, with Clark appearing in 15 of them.\n\nThe WNBA is expanding to 14 teams over the next two seasons, with the Golden State Valkyries starting play next year and a franchise in Toronto beginning in 2026.\n\nWhen news of the deal first came to light last week, the player's union had concerns that the league is being undervalued.\n\n\"We have wondered for months how the NBA would value the WNBA in its media rights deal,\" executive director of the union Terri Jackson said in a statement. \"With a reportedly $75 billion deal on the table, the league is in control of its own destiny. More precisely, the NBA controls the destiny of the WNBA.\"\n\n\"We look forward to learning how the NBA arrived at a $200 million valuation -- if initial reports are accurate or even close. Neither the NBA nor the WNBA can deny that in the last few years, we have seen unprecedented growth across all metrics, the players continue to demonstrate their commitment to building the brand, and that the fans keep showing up.

Rebilas-USA TODAY Sports\n\nThe WNBA has been breaking and making viewership records all season, and Saturday's All-Star Game's final numbers continued this trend.\n\nThe 2024 All-Star Game became the most watched ASG in the WNBA's history as the ABC broadcast brought in 3.44 million viewers, per The Athletic's Richard Deitsch. The previous record for the All-Star Game was set at 1.441 million viewers back in 2003.\n\nThis viewership count now puts the 2024 All-Star Game as the third-most watched WNBA game in history, behind two games from the league's opening weekend in 1997. The game was the highest-viewed WNBA game on any ESPN broadcast. This also makes the All-Star Game the most watched contest of the season so far.\n\nNow there's been 17 WNBA games this season to hit at least one million viewers. It's quite the feat considering no WNBA game hit that mark in any of the previous 16 seasons.\n\nVarious Indiana Fever games including rookie star Caitlin Clark have brought in record audiences from the past 23 years. The Fever game vs. the Chicago Sky on June 23 capped at 2.302 million viewers on ESPN, which is just below the regular season record of the 2.44 million viewers who watched the Los Angeles Sparks and Houston Comets on NBC in 2001. It was the third time this season Clark has appeared in a game that's drawn viewership nearly on par with that 2001 matchup.\n\nTeam WNBA beat Team USA in the All-Star Game 117-109 on Saturday night in Phoenix.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Women's National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Footprint_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Footprint Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caitlin_Clark", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Caitlin Clark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arike_Ogunbowale", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arike Ogunbowale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-point_field_goal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Three-point field goal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix,_Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Phoenix, Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Phoenix, Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allisha_Gray", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Allisha Gray"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Athletic", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Athletic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Broadcasting_Company", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "American Broadcasting Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston_Comets", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Houston Comets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Fever", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Fever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Sparks", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Sparks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Sky", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Sky"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBC"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/UNO_Dice", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/UNO Dice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Murder-Mystery_and_Deduction", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Murder-Mystery and Deduction", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Resources", "label": "dmoz/Games/Resources", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Party_Games/Drinking_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Party Games/Drinking Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_4192,h_2358,x_1381,y_188/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/si/01j3g74yna140c03ndcj.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9752302", "eventUri": "eng-9752302", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-23", "textStart": 1296, "textEnd": 1303}, {"amb": false, "date": "2020-07-", "textStart": 0, "textEnd": 6}], "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 174, "relevance": 1}

ESPN's WNBA Draft coverage drew an audience four times larger than the previous record, while regular-season matchups saw their highest viewership in more than two decades -- averaging 1.2 million viewers per game and increasing viewership by 177% from last year.\n\nWNBA broadcast partner CBS has aired games nearing or exceeding 2 million viewers, while ION has had three WNBA matchups with audiences of 1 million or more. This all happened as rookie All-Stars Caitlin Clark and Angel Reese set WNBA records for assists in a single game (Clark with 19) and consecutive double-doubles (Reese with 15) and the star-studded Las Vegas Aces and New York Liberty rosters face serious challenges from Connecticut, Seattle, Minnesota and Phoenix.\n\nJust before the All-Star festivities, the media world discovered that the WNBA's portion of the NBA's new $76 billion rights deal with Disney, Amazon and NBC came out to roughly $2.2 billion -- or roughly six times the value of the W's current deal with ESPN. Even that figure -- which puts the WNBA's annual take of $200 million a year over 11 years close to the total $240 million value of the NWSL's then-record-setting women's soccer broadcast deal from November -- seems low to the WNBA's union and other observers.\n\nBut broadcasters aren't the only ones investing in the WNBA. During this most recent All-Star Weekend, the following brands made their presence felt in Phoenix by bringing some additional heat with robust activations and sponsorship announcements.\n\nHere's just a sampling of who checked into the game:\n\nAT&T signed on as one of the WNBA's foundational WNBA Changemakers brands in 2020 and has taken its role as a league investor and builder seriously since.\n\nDuring All-Star, it used Changemaker Day to introduce local students to leaders from within AT&T during keynote sessions and panel discussions. Its Jr. WNBA x AT&T Series included a basketball clinic and discussion/wellness event hosted by Arielle Chambers that featured both AT&T executives and WNBA players.\n\nJust ahead of the event, AT&T teamed with multi-time WNBA MVP and champion A'ja Wilson, three-time WNBA All-Star and NBA vs. WNBA 3-point Challenge shooter Sabrina Ionescu and touted rookie Kamilla Cardoso. Wilson and Ionescu join AT&T's new mentorship-focused content series Beyond the Bleachers, while Cardoso adds her story to those of other women in sports for AT&T's long-running She's Connected feature.\n\nThe brand also gave fans numerous opportunities to meet the players during the event, bringing them into its WNBA Live activation as fans indulged in the multiplayer Slash Court Challenge, got Cabani Manis, made #GRWM videos at Player Poolside Essentials and contributed to a Mural Wall.\n\n\"We've got a huge responsibility as a major sponsor of the WNBA to set the example,\" said Sabina Ahmed, assistant vice president of sponsorships and experiential at AT&T. \"There's still a gap in terms of investment of women in sports, and we want to make sure that you know, these amazing women are getting the support that they deserve.\"\n\nThere are no half-measures for Mielle when it comes to finding athlete and league partners: Only the best will do.\n\nMielle teamed with Angel Reese when she was on her reigning champion Louisiana State University team. The brand then struck a multi-year deal to become the Official Textured Haircare Product of the WNBA -- a league in which 70% of all players have textured hair, according to Mielle brand president Omar Goff.\n\nIn February, Mielle announced it was not only bringing aboard multi-time WNBA MVP and champion A'ja Wilson, but University of Southern California star freshman JuJu Watkins. While the brand was able to put Reese at the center of its From One Queen to Another campaign and in-store displays at Walmart, it had far bigger plans for its second WNBA All-Star Game.\n\nBuilding off of last year's installation which was an Instagrammable blend of a crystal-adorned basketball hoop, fragrance bar and throne, this year's installation came in much larger and surprised fans with a regal appearance from Wilson herself. As Mielle enters a team sponsorship with the WNBA's Atlanta Dream and tells the story of player-turned-owner Renee Montgomery, it continues approaching the partnership with an unwavering standard of excellence.\n\n\"The genesis of it was about making sure that Mielle is a brand that is looking to serve the underserved,\" Goff said. \"We wanted to make sure that we were highlighting the beauty and the diversity of that in women's basketball.\"\n\nAflac was active during the NCAA's women's March Madness tournament and heard the arguments about athlete equity then.\n\nFor this year's WNBA All-Star event, Aflac chipped in $55,000 bonuses to the winners of the WNBA Starry 3-Point Contest and the Kia WNBA Skills Challenge. The winners of the NBA versions of each contest get $60,000 and $55,000 respectively, so Aflac's $110,000 gets the WNBA much closer to that line. Aflac also teamed with media company Togethxr for a Queens of the Court panel discussion moderated by ESPN's Andraya Carter featuring WNBA standouts Arike Ogunbowale, Aliyah Boston and Skylar Diggins-Smith, as well as South Carolina coach and Hall of Famer Dawn Staley.\n\nIt was part of a busy weekend for Togethxr, which also joined the mental health media community Mente in hosting a two-day wellness festival that included mobile nail experiences, affirmation stations, CBD sips, guided meditations, sound baths, food, drinks and a game watch party with VIP drop-ins.\n\nTogethxr also partnered with the Golden State Valkyries WNBA expansion franchise to produce versions of its Everyone Watches Women's Sports shirts in the team's proprietary shade of Valkyrie Violet -- with Ted Lasso's Jason Sudeikis putting one on during a guest appearance. Finally, Togethxr hosted Sue Bird and Megan Rapinoe's live installment of their \"A Touch More\" podcast, recently purchased by Vox Media and featuring Aubrey Plaza and University of Connecticut star Paige Bueckers discussing the rise of women's basketball.\n\nGoogle Pixel and OneTeam Partners took the weekend to announce a partnership with the Women's National Basketball Players Association (WNBPA), the National Women's Soccer League Players Association (NWSLPA) and the U.S. Women's National Team Players Association (USWNTPA) that makes Google Pixel as the \"Official Mobile Phone and Content Capture Partner of the Players.\"\n\nGoing back to building the WNBPA its first-ever players' lounge at All-Star Weekend 2023, Google Pixel is now extending similar courtesy to players and creators at the WNBPA Google Pixel Players' Lounge at All-Star Weekend, the NWSL Players' Party and the USWNTPA Players' Ball. This weekend's Players' Lounge included a VIP suite for relaxation and socialization, a gifting suite with products from women-led brands and the Pixel Portrait Studio with Google's AI-enabled camera power features like Real Tone and Best Take.\n\nFuture events will also feature the Player Portrait studios, allowing players to connect, relax, celebrate and prepare before professional photography sessions.\n\n\"Through Pixel, we're actively increasing visibility and engagement with women's sports by creating content that amplifies the stories of remarkable athletes and providing innovative ways for fans and players to connect with each other,\" said Julia Cheney, Google's cultural marketing lead. \"Our partnership with the WNBPA, NWSLPA and USWNTPA is about showcasing these athletes' journeys beyond the game and competitions, providing the technology and hospitality that help them shine.\"\n\nA WNBA sponsor since 2010, American Express has become a regular fixture at WNBA Live on All-Star Weekend.\n\nThis year's Amex Experience let fans take interactive quizzes that matched their personality to those of WNBA players, including the Phoenix Mercury's Kahleah Copper and Sophie Cunningham, the Indiana Fever's Aliyah Boston and the Dallas Wings' Arike Ogunbowale. Those personalities all showed up on a gallery wall, but fans could get a printed copy and a shareable social media link. They also got the chance to listen to audio recordings of fan stories told by those same WNBA stars.\n\nCardholders, however, received the best perks. They got customized T-shirts of their fan personalities, wristbands featuring the year they became a WNBA fan, access to chats and meet-and-greeks with Copper and Boston, a dedicated fast lane to enter the three-point contest and skills competition and a 10% discount on most WNBA All-Star merchandise.\n\n\"Our partnerships with both the WNBA and NBA are all about showcasing the value of Amex membership and delivering one-of-a-kind experiences and access for our Card Members and basketball fans,\" said Kristina Hunt, vp of global brand sponsorship assets, benefits and operations at American Express. \"We're always looking for ways to innovate and show up authentically around basketball culture, and we take learnings from our sponsorships across both leagues as we continue to evolve and activate in meaningful ways for fans.\"\n\nBumble picked All-Star Weekend to announce its multi-year deal to become the league's first-ever official dating app partner.\n\nThe company served as the presenting sponsor of the Orange Carpet at WNBA Live but has bigger plans for the league. While this isn't Bumble's first time working with athletes -- it sponsored 50 women in sports during the 50th anniversary of Title IX in 2023 and paired with injured Los Angeles Sparks rookie Cameron Brink -- this partnership offers behind-the-scenes and Bumble in-app content from WNBA athletes, activations at fan events, WNBA-themed meetups and date nights at WNBA games and events.\n\n\"Partnering with one of the most renowned organizations in women's sports, the WNBA, is extremely exciting for us and it exemplifies everything Bumble stands for: empowering and spotlighting women's stories, helping people make connections over shared values and interests and creating fun and safe experiences to bring our community together offline,\" said Lidiane Jones, CEO of Bumble.\n\nEven sports betting has been a somewhat inequitable proposition for women's sports since the Supreme Court paved the way for national legalization in 2018.\n\nBut DraftKings saw growing fan enthusiasm, continued demand in the market and a continued dearth of women's sports marketing on traditional sportsbook screens. Just before All-Star Weekend, it announced its agreement with the league to become the Official Sports Betting and Daily Fantasy Partner of the WNBA.\n\n\"We are proud to support the league in its efforts to continue expanding the game,\" said Matt Kalish, president of DraftKings North America. \"It is a priority for us to deliver the most engaging WNBA content to DraftKings' platforms, and through our collaboration with the WNBA this season, we will be able to enhance the experience for millions of our customers and WNBA fans.\"\n\nThis gives DraftKings exclusive rights to league and team IP and marketing, activation and branding rights around WNBA events like All-Star and the playoffs. It will also be presenting partner of the WNBA Postseason Push highlights and social content platform in September.\n\n\"The WNBA is growing, expanding across the board and partnering with industry leaders like DraftKings enables us to offer WNBA fans additional ways to engage with their favorite teams and players, responsibly and with integrity,\" said Colie Edison, WNBA chief growth officer. \"This opportunity for DraftKings to lean in with us to support women's sports will welcome more fans to the WNBA.\"", "source": {"uri": "adweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Adweek"},

The agreement, which includes partnerships with Disney, Amazon Prime Video and new rights holder NBCUniversal, marks a historic moment for the WNBA and highlights the growing interest and value of women's basketball.\n\n\"Partnering with Disney, Amazon, and NBCU marks a monumental chapter in WNBA history and clearly demonstrates the significant rise in value and the historic level of interest in women's basketball,\" WNBA Commissioner Cathy Engelbert said in a statement, per Alexa Philippou of ESPN. \"These agreements allow the league to continue to build a long-term and sustainable growth model for the future of women's basketball and sports, which will benefit WNBA players, teams, and fans.\"\n\nThe deal, reported first by The Athletic, is expected to bring in approximately $200 million annually. Future agreements with additional partners could increase the total value closer to $3 billion. The new media rights deal will begin with the 2026 season and run through 2036, with a potential reevaluation of the rights fees after three years to ensure appropriate value.\n\nUnder the terms of the agreement, Disney, Amazon and NBCU will broadcast over 125 regular-season and playoff games each season. Disney platforms, including ABC, ESPN and ESPN2, will air a minimum of 25 regular-season games. NBCU will distribute 50 games across NBC, USA Network and Peacock, while Amazon Prime Video will stream 30 games.\n\nWNBA playoff games will be divided among media deal partners\n\nThe playoff games will be divided among the partners, with Disney broadcasting two first-round series each year, NBCU and Amazon Prime Video each handling one. The semifinals and finals series will rotate among the broadcasters over the duration of the deal. Disney will telecast eight semifinal series and five finals, while NBCU and Amazon Prime Video will each cover seven semifinal series and three finals. Additionally, Disney will continue to air WNBA All-Star events and the WNBA Draft, and Amazon Prime Video will remain the home for the Commissioner's Cup Championship Game.\n\n\"We're proud of our highly productive and collaborative partnership with the WNBA since the league's inception in 1997,\" said ESPN Chairman Jimmy Pitaro, as reported by Doug Feinberg of The Associated Press. \"Through our marquee collection of rights, which includes the WNBA Finals, we will continue to play an important role in the league's extraordinary growth trajectory while fueling ESPN's digital future and super-serving fans as only we can.\"\n\nThe WNBA also holds current deals with CBS and ION, which are expected to be renegotiated and could yield at least $60 million in additional revenue. This could elevate the league's overall media deals to six times the total of its current agreements.\n\nThe new revenue stream is anticipated to significantly impact player salaries, which have been a long-standing issue within the league. Since its inception in 1997, WNBA players have often sought overseas opportunities to supplement their incomes. The current top base salary in the league is $242,000, with players potentially earning over half a million through salary, marketing agreements, and bonuses.\n\nThe league has experienced remarkable ratings over the past two seasons. Notably, the recent All-Star Game attracted 3.4 million viewers, making it the third most-viewed event in the league's history. The WNBA is also set to expand to 14 teams over the next two seasons, with the Golden State Valkyries joining in 2025 and a new franchise in Toronto beginning in 2026.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "erin_achenbach@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Erin Achenbach", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Prime_Video", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Amazon Prime Video"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Women's National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Walt_Disney_Company", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Walt Disney Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathy_Engelbert", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cathy Engelbert"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBCUniversal", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBCUniversal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peacock_(streaming_service)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Peacock (streaming service)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Athletic", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Athletic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN2", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ESPN2"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Network", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "USA Network"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Broadcasting_Company", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "American Broadcasting Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion_Television", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ion Television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WNBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "WNBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WNBA_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "WNBA All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nielsen_Media_Research", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nielsen Media Research"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CBS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_State_Warriors", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Golden State Warriors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Theme_Parks/Disney", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Theme Parks/Disney", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Media_Conglomerates", "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Media Conglomerates", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Game_Studies", "label": "dmoz/Games/Game Studies", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Production", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Production", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/History", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/History", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 65}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/League-secures-2.2-billion-11-year-media-rights-deal-with-Disney-Amazon.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9752302", "eventUri": "eng-9752302", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4745098039215687, "wgt": 168, "relevance": 1}

Only that game and the inaugural Liberty-Sparks matchup a day earlier (5.04M) delivered larger audiences.\n\nThe previous record for a WNBA All-Star Game was 1.44 million for the 2003 game on ABC, the first to air on broadcast television. Only one other All-Star Game has averaged a seven-figure audience, the 2005 game on ABC (1.25M). Last year's All-Star Game, which also aired in primetime on ABC, had 850,000.\n\nThe WNBA All-Stars' win, which peaked with 4.05 million viewers from 10:30 PM ET through the conclusion, was the weekend's top television program in adults 18-49 and 25-54.\n\nThis year's All-Star Game was particularly appetizing due to the Caitlin Clark-led rookie class and the WNBA vs. Team USA format, which has been used in past Olympic years. Given some of the perceived Olympic snubs, including of Clark, the game had more storylines than is typical for an All-Star event.\n\nThe WNBA All-Star Game easily outdrew the NHL All-Star Game on ABC earlier this year, which aired in the afternoon (1.40M), and also comfortably topped the NASCAR All-Star Race on FS1 (2.57M). The other three major all-star events ranked higher, with the NBA All-Star Game at 5.40 million, NFL Pro Bowl Games at 5.79 million and last week's MLB All-Star Game at 7.44 million.\n\nFriday's WNBA Skills Challenge and Three-Point Contest averaged 695,000 on ESPN, up 142% from last year, when the event took place during the afternoon hours (288K).", "source": {"uri": "sportsmediawatch.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Media Watch"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jon_lewis@sportsmediawatch.com", "name": "Jon Lewis", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WNBA_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "WNBA All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Broadcasting_Company", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "American Broadcasting Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Women's National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrestrial_television", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Terrestrial television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_time", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prime time"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NHL_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NHL All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASCAR_All-Star_Race", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NASCAR All-Star Race"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Sports_1", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fox Sports 1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pro Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Network", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "USA Network"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 32}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads", "wgt": 32}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Stars", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Stars", "wgt": 37}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Action", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Action", "wgt": 33}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 32}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 45}], "image": "https://www.sportsmediawatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/USATSI-23788935-scaled-e1721751047346.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9752302", "eventUri": "eng-9752302", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "1997-06-", "textStart": 237, "textEnd": 246}], "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 167, "relevance": 1}

All but two of those games featured Clark and the Fever, while the two most-watched contests were between the Fever and Reese's Sky.\n\nThe game's success also comes on the heels of the report that the WNBA's media-rights deal is expected to be worth $2.2 billion over 11 years, or about $200 million annually. That annual figure would be worth more than three times the estimated $60 million per year the league's currently receiving from ESPN, Amazon, CBS, and Ion. However, the WNBA agreement is still tied to the $75 billion deal that the NBA is finalizing with ESPN, ABC, and Amazon.\n\n\"I haven't been shy in saying we've been preparing for this moment for many years, saying how important media deals are to the growth and the future of this league, and these deals will be historic and a significant step forward,\" WNBA commissioner Cathy Engelbert said before the All-Star Game.\n\nWhile the rookies were the center of attention, both teams delivered on the court. This year's format pitted USA's Olympics roster against a select group of WNBA talents, many of whom were essentially Team USA snubs.\n\nClark's highly publicized omission from this year's roster was met with a ton of criticism in the media, but Team WNBA also included former MVP Nneka Ogwumike and Arike Ogunbowale, whose USA roster exclusions have been discussed well before this season.\n\nBefore the game, Team WNBA coach Cheryl Miller admitted her players wanted \"to beat the brakes\" off Team USA. Her team ended up winning, 117-109, led by All-Star MVP Ogunbowale, who scored 34 points. Clark finished with 10 assists, a rookie record in the All-Star Game, while Reese had a double double with 12 points and 11 assists.\n\nNBA commissioner Adam Silver has tried and mostly failed to make his league's All-Star Game competitive, but Saturday's WNBA showcase could provide a blueprint for the NBA.\n\nThe timing might be tricky for the NBA, as the USA roster would not be set by its All-Star Game normally scheduled in February. But the option to capitalize on competitiveness, especially following Celtics star Jaylen Brown's comments about being snubbed from this year's roster, could be worth consideration given the WNBA's proof of concept.\n\nIt wouldn't be the first time the NBA took inspiration from the WNBA. The WNBA's regular-season tournament, the Commissioner's Cup, started in 2021, and the NBA adopted it in '23.", "source": {"uri": "frontofficesports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Front Office Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angel_Reese", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Angel Reese"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caitlin_Clark", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Caitlin Clark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Women's National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Amazon (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WNBA_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "WNBA All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arike_Ogunbowale", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arike Ogunbowale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathy_Engelbert", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cathy Engelbert"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion_Television", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ion Television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "CBS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Broadcasting_Company", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "American Broadcasting Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-double", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Double-double"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nneka_Ogwumike", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nneka Ogwumike"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheryl_Miller", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cheryl Miller"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Silver", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Adam Silver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show_Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://frontofficesports.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/USATSI_23787020_168392832_lowres-scaled.jpg?quality=100", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9752302", "eventUri": "eng-9752302", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2784313725490195, "wgt": 165, "relevance": 1}

The remarkable increase in viewership is largely attributed to the arrival of rookie Caitlin Clark, whose popularity has propelled the Indiana Fever's games to the top of the ratings chart.\n\nThe impact of Clark, a former Iowa star, is evident as each of the 10 highest-rated games of the current WNBA season has featured her and the Fever. However, it's not just the sheer number of viewers that has shifted; the demographics of the audience have also changed notably. Nielsen data obtained by Rachel Bachman of The Wall Street Journal reveals that every demographic category has seen at least a double-digit increase, with the biggest gains among young viewers, male viewers and white viewers.\n\nThis increase is not solely due to Clark's arrival. The WNBA has also improved its television offerings, with more national broadcasts and consistent game schedules on platforms like Prime and Ion, making the games easier to find and follow. While many sports struggle to maintain young audiences, the WNBA has seen its numbers skyrocket. On ESPN networks, the viewership of girls aged 2-17 has surged by 181%, and viewers aged 18-34 are outpacing the league's total growth by 54 percentage points.\n\nIncreased interest in WNBA\n\nUniversity of Denver women's basketball coach Doshia Woods has observed this transformation firsthand. Previously, her players often cited NBA stars as their favorites. Now, they name WNBA stars like A'ja Wilson and Nneka Ogwumike. The shift reflects a broader trend where the WNBA's audience is becoming more diverse and younger, partly due to the high viewership of the NCAA women's basketball tournament, which saw many tuning in to follow stars like Clark, Angel Reese and Cameron Brink into the WNBA.\n\nThe crossover from college to professional basketball has also made the WNBA's audience whiter. Non-Hispanic white viewership has grown 156% year-over-year on Ion and 301% on ESPN networks. The NCAA women's tournament audience on ESPN was about 71% white, compared to 55% for WNBA games. However, Black viewers continue to watch the WNBA in greater proportions than their overall share of the U.S. population, making up 34% of ESPN's WNBA viewership and 45% of ION's.\n\nAdditionally, male viewers, who make up a large portion of the WNBA's growing audience, have increased significantly. On ESPN networks, men account for 60% of WNBA viewers, up from previous years. Similarly, on CBS, male viewers aged 18 and older now comprise 54% of WNBA viewership, up from 48%.\n\nA prime example of the increased interest is the June 16 game between the Fever and the Chicago Sky, featuring a rematch of Clark and Reese from the 2023 NCAA title game. The game attracted 2.25 million viewers on CBS, the second-largest audience of the season, only surpassed by the same matchup on ESPN a week later, which drew 2.3 million viewers.\n\nJosh McCart, a 26-year-old accountant from Hoosick Falls, New York, epitomizes the new wave of WNBA fans driven by Clark's influence. Having followed her college career, McCart and his father have become avid WNBA viewers, attending Clark's pro debut and watching nearly every televised Fever game since.\n\n\"It seems like the younger generation is just playing differently,\" he said. \"Much quicker pace, a lot more 3-point shooting. It's more similar to the NBA.\"", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "erin_achenbach@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Erin Achenbach", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caitlin_Clark", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Caitlin Clark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Women's National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion_Television", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ion Television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wall_Street_Journal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Wall Street Journal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowa", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Iowa"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Iowa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCAA_Division_I_women's_basketball_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NCAA Division I women's basketball tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angel_Reese", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Angel Reese"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nneka_Ogwumike", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nneka Ogwumike"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Denver", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "University of Denver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Women's basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A'ja_Wilson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "A'ja Wilson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cameron_Brink", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cameron Brink"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_NCAA_Division_I_women's_basketball_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2017 NCAA Division I women's basketball tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCAA_Division_I_men's_basketball_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-Hispanic_whites", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Non-Hispanic whites"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Sky", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Sky"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-point_field_goal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Three-point field goal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CBS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Computer_Platforms", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Computer Platforms", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Action", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Action", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/How-the-%E2%80%98Caitlin-Clark-Effect-has-shifted-WNBA-audiences.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9752302", "eventUri": "eng-9752302", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-16", "textStart": 2761, "textEnd": 2768}], "sentiment": 0.2784313725490195, "wgt": 154, "relevance": 1}

The Semifinals and Finals series will rotate over the 11-year term, with Disney distributing eight Semifinals series and five Finals, and Prime Video and NBCU each distributing seven Semifinals series and three Finals.\n\nAs part of the deals, Disney platforms will continue to telecast all events from WNBA All-Star, including the All-Star Game, and the WNBA Draft, while Prime Video will continue to stream the Championship Game of the WNBA Commissioner's Cup presented by Coinbase. Prime Video Channels will be the global channels store destination for WNBA League Pass, the WNBA's subscription service for streaming live and on-demand games, in the U.S. and internationally.\n\nThe WNBA is expected to add additional media partners that will further expand the reach and accessibility of WNBA games as of the 2026 season.\n\n\"Partnering with Disney, Amazon and NBCU marks a monumental chapter in WNBA history and clearly demonstrates the significant rise in value and the historic level of interest in women's basketball,\" said WNBA Commissioner Cathy Engelbert. \"These agreements allow the league to continue to build a long-term and sustainable growth model for the future of women's basketball and sports which will benefit WNBA players, teams and fans.\"\n\n\"We're proud of our highly productive and collaborative partnership with the WNBA since the league's inception in 1997,\" said ESPN Chairman Jimmy Pitaro. \"Through our marquee collection of rights, which includes the WNBA Finals, we will continue to play an important role in the league's extraordinary growth trajectory while fueling ESPN's digital future and super-serving fans as only we can.\"\n\n\"As the home of the first-ever nationally televised WNBA game, we are excited to have the league return to NBCUniversal's platforms,\" said Mike Cavanagh, President of Comcast Corporation. \"We look forward to showcasing the talented players and teams that continue to grow the popularity of the WNBA, while further bolstering NBCU's lineup of premium women's sports.\"\n\n\"We've been partners with and believers in the WNBA over the last four seasons, and could not be more excited to expand our relationship so significantly with this landmark agreement,\" said Jay Marine, Global Head of Sports for Prime Video. \"The league's recent surge in popularity is of no surprise to us, as these incredible athletes continue to raise the bar and electrify fans. We're looking forward to providing Prime members around the world with increased access to the W's biggest events as more and more fans gravitate toward the sport.\"\n\nThe new media deals come at a pivotal moment of growth for the WNBA and follow a historic start to the WNBA's 28 season.

Off the court, Reese has dipped a toe into the worlds of music and fashion, and she's become hip-hop's favorite WNBA rookie.\n\nFlau'jae, meanwhile, will be returning to LSU this fall but has also seen her star continue to grow this summer, as she dropped her debut rap album, Best of Both Worlds, in late June -- with some features from star artists like Lil Wayne. She performed at the ESPYs and was all over WNBA All-Star Weekend in Phoenix, which included dropping a new track \"Can't Get Enough\" with Culture Jam alongside BIA and Lakeyah. The music video for the song released on Wednesday, showing the artists making a road trip from L.A. to Phoenix for WNBA All-Star, and the song will be the official track for the WNBA on ESPN.\n\n\"Being part of 'Can't Get Enough' with BIA and Lakeyah has been amazing,\" Johnson said in a release. \"This track is all about celebrating the strength and power of women in sports and music.

A new league that promises high pay and big stars, including Angel Ree", "body": "Angel Reese has already made instant impact with the Chicago Sky, amassing a league-record 15 consecutive double-doubles during the first half of her rookie season.\n\nThe star has decided how to spend her first WNBA offseason: playing in the new professional three-on-three league Unrivaled. Her addition to the league is especially notable because she is the first announced Unrivaled athlete without prior professional international experience.\n\nThe league has already announced a number of high-profile WNBA players and will tip off in January 2025.\n\nPlayer announcements began on July 9, and will continue until the 30-player league pool is full. The current roster is below.\n\nIt promises to pay the highest average salary in women's professional sports league history and will give equity in the league to its inaugural participants, enabling the athletes to profit from Unrivaled for years to come. The league was founded by WNBA superstars Collier and Stewart and has a long list of high-powered investors, including Alex Morgan, Carmelo Anthony, Steve Nash, Megan Rapinoe and former ESPN and Turner presidents John Skipper and David Levy.\n\nAs women's sports spike in popularity, Collier has said that everyone is benefiting but the athletes themselves, as WNBA players are locked into a pay structure governed by a collective bargaining agreement. Unrivaled was created \"on that principle that players deserve compensation and ownership that reflect their value,\" Collier said.\n\nWNBA players historically have played overseas during the offseason to supplement their incomes from domestic salaries. However, playing year-round puts a strain on their bodies and requires personal sacrifices, such as missing holidays with their families. Being overseas also keeps WNBA players out of sight, and thus out of mind, for most of the year, hampering their marketability and the growth of the sport for months at a time.\n\nThe goal of Unrivaled is to keep the best players stateside to carry the momentum of one WNBA season into the next, which can only happen with the record-breaking salaries. The short three-on-three season will also keep players fresher heading into the WNBA calendar, ideally extending their careers in the process. The two leagues should work in concert with one another, as having All-Stars in the U.S. throughout the offseason will help promote the WNBA and optimize its product.\n\nThe league will have 30 players split into six teams of five. They will play for eight weeks, which includes a round-robin regular season and playoffs featuring the top four teams in the standings. Miami will be the home base of Unrivaled, but the founders hope to take the league on the road during the regular season.\n\nThe format of Unrivaled is a modified 3\u00d73 game. The international version is a halfcourt game played to 21. Unrivaled will instead be played on a compressed full court that is about 70 feet long, and games will be four quarters. The extra space is designed to give players room to showcase their skills and also reduce the wear and tear on their bodies.\n\nAs one of the league's co-founders, it came as no surprise when Stewart was officially announced as a player on July 9. Stewart, a two-time WNBA MVP and four-time NCAA champion at UConn, has spent parts of past offseasons playing abroad. She most recently played for the Turkish powerhouse Fenerbah\u00e7e during the spring of 2023.\n\nLike Stewart, Collier's inclusion came as no surprise as she is also one of the league's co-founders. The four-time All-Star with the Minnesota Lynx spent parts of this past offseason playing with Fenerbah\u00e7e, helping lead the club to a second consecutive EuroLeague title.\n\nA three-time WNBA champion, Gray is widely regarded as one of the best point guards in the world. She did not play overseas this past winter, rehabbing a lower leg injury she suffered with the Aces in the 2023 WNBA Finals. However, she has played abroad previously, including the 2022-23 season for the Turkish club \u00c7ukurova.\n\nOgunbowale has made the WNBA All-Star team in four consecutive seasons with the Wings, and she has finished top five in scoring average in her first five seasons. She, too, has experience playing professionally in the winter, including suiting up for the Russian club Dynamo Kursk.\n\nLoyd has won two WNBA championships and made six All-Star games since being the Seattle Storm's No. 1 pick in the 2015 draft. She last played overseas in the 2020 offseason with the Spanish club Perfumerias Avenida. She was the second Notre Dame alum announced to Unrivaled, joining Ogunbowale.\n\nLike Loyd and Stewart, Plum is another former No. 1 draft pick joining the league.

Harris came to the podium to speak but before beginning, she turned to forward A'ja Wilson and said: \"My soror.\"\n\nWilson and Harris are members of the historic Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc., a Black service organization and sorority founded at Howard University in 1908.\n\nAfter Harris spoke to Wilson, it was Wilson who responded with \"Skee Wee,\" which can mean many things but it's mostly a form of acknowledgement, care and love.\n\n\"I couldn't help it,\" Harris said, referring to greeting her fellow soror.\n\nThat moment wouldn't be the last time the two would closely communicate.\n\nIn February, they filmed an Instagram video discussing the importance of the upcoming presidential election with Harris telling Wilson that democracy was at stake. The Instagram caption from Wilson read: \"Creating change is a team effort! Make sure you're registered to vote and this November, let your voice be heard.\"\n\nWhether you agree with their politics is irrelevant. The point is there's already connective tissue between political activism in the WNBA and the greatest social justice issues of our time. If you don't think that will continue now, at one of the most important moments in American history, you don't know the history of the WNBA.\n\nIt's not exactly known how many WNBA players support Harris and it's important to note that Black voters aren't a monolith. But if the majority-Black league follows the general pattern of Black women voters, Harris could have a potent force fighting for her. An NBC News exit poll showed that 90% of Black women voted for Biden in 2020.\n\nHarris isn't a stranger around the WNBA. She was there when Brittney Griner played in her first WNBA game after being released by Russia. In April, Harris name-checked the WNBA when talking about equal pay for women.\n\n\"Women should be paid their fair share. Whether they're a scientist, construction worker, or WNBA All-Star,\" Harris wrote on social media. \"President Biden and I are committed to closing the gender wage gap and creating an economy where every American can thrive.\"\n\nAll of this means the league could be a huge mobilizing force for Harris not just with women but young people in general.\n\nIt's unlikely the WNBA sticks to sports. It's unlikely they shut up and dribble. It is likely some players put their energy behind Harris because righteous activism is in the WNBA's genome. These are players, and this is a league, that believe in Democracy and civil rights. How do I know this? They've fought for these things many times before. Perhaps more than any league in the history of American sports.\n\nYears before Colin Kaepernick would take a knee to protest police brutality, the WNBA was in that space. In 2016, they were among the first to wear \"Black Lives Matter\" shirts before games. WNBA players were fixtures at various protests. In 2020, the league dedicated its season to honoring Breonna Taylor, who was killed in a botched police raid.\n\n\"We have always been at the forefront of initiatives with strong support of #BlackLivesMatter, #SayHerName, the LGBTQ+ community, gun control, voting rights, #MeToo, mental health and the list goes on,\" said WNBPA President Nneka Ogwumike in 2020. \"This is not only necessary from a humanitarian perspective, but it may be one of the biggest opportunities that this league has and will ever have.\"\n\nIn 2021, the Atlanta Dream and Phoenix Mercury helped introduce the nation to Sen. Raphael Warnock. Players wore shirts in pre-game with the words \"VOTE WARNOCK. What the Dream would go on to do in supporting Warnock is one of the great political chef's kisses of athlete activism.\n\nDream players disliked the person who co-owned the team, Kelly Loeffler, because she was MAGA. And insulting. And other things. So the players backed Warnock. The result was nothing short of stunning.\n\nWarnock won his runoff election against Loeffler, becoming Georgia's first Black senator. His win, along with Jon Ossoff's, flipped Georgia blue. It's true, as Time.com noted then, that other factors helped Warnock win. Yet an expert in political science and quantitative methods at Yale concluded that the WNBA helped raise awareness to those unfamiliar with Warnock.\n\nGuard Tiffany Hayes, who played for the Dream then and who's now with the Aces, said at the time: \"We were definitely the loudest voice. We were the sternest voice. And we backed what we said. I don't see any other hand that was bigger.\"\n\nThe story of Warnock has become almost a sort of lore and retelling it is important because of the moment we're in now.\n\nBecause if the Dream, and by extension many in the WNBA, fought to elect the first Black senator from Georgia, what do you think some WNBA players will do to help elect the first Black woman president?", "source": {"uri":

Disney will distribute games on ABC, ESPN or ESPN2 and stream them on the company's new direct-to-consumer service; NBCU will distribute them on NBC, USA Network and Peacock; and Amazon will distribute them on Prime Video.\n\nDisney will distribute two first-round playoff series per year, with NBCU and Prime distributing one each, while semifinal and Finals series will rotate. Disney will telecast eight semifinals series and five Finals, and Prime and NBCU each will show seven semifinals and three Finals.\n\nDisney will continue to air WNBA All-Star events and the WNBA Draft, and Prime will still be home to the Commissioner's Cup Championship Game.\n\nThe WNBA also currently has deals with CBS and ION, which upon renegotiation could yield at least $60 million in additional revenue and bring the league's overall media deals to six times the total of its current deals.\n\nAccording to a source, the figures for the new agreements do not include production costs or marketing commitments, which is the case for numbers associated with the media deals for the NWSL ($240 million over four years with four partners) and MLS ($2.5 billion over 10 years with Apple).\n\nThe partners also agreed to review and potentially reevaluate the rights fees to ensure appropriate value after three years, a source added.", "source": {"uri": "espn.com", "dataType":

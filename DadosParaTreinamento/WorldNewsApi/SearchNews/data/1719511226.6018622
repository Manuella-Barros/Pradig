{"id": 223751858, "title": "Pune District voter turnout: Slight rise in polling for two seats, marginal dip in one, say final EC numbers", "text": "The final voting percentage released by the Election Commissioner (EC) on Friday shows that apart from Baramati, two constituencies in Pune district reported a slight increase in voting percentage while one saw a marginal dip. Baramati, which had witnessed a high tension battle between the Pawars, saw its final voting percentage remain the same. Opposition parties as well as various transparency advocates had raised doubts about the delay in releasing the final voting percentage as well as absolute voters numbers. The EC has stoutly refuted all such allegations. They had pointed out that the polling agents of each political party were given form 17C, where they kept track of voting in every booth. Political parties collect the sheets and tally the same at the end of the day to compare it with the official figures released. Form 17C is an important document used to challenge electoral disputes in courts. The press release by the EC shows the final voting percentage of Pune came to 53.54 per cent, a slight rise from 51.25 per cent, which was released a day after the voting. Similarly, Maval and Shirur showed a slight change in the final voting percentage. Only Baramati\u2019s voting percentage remained unchanged at 59.50 per cent. Barring Pune, the other three constituencies in the district had reported a significant dip from their voters' turn out of 2019. Officers said that a delay in announcing the final figures of voters and voting percentage officers is due to the tedious process involved. Each voting booth has polling agents who maintain their form 17C, where as the presiding officer\u2019s diary is another important document which is used to tally the voter numbers. The final tally is done after the presiding officer's diary is taken into consideration. The final voting percentage is not released until all the diaries are tallied. During counting, agents of political parties tally EVM votes with those on their Form 17C, following which candidate-wise votes collected are shown.", "summary": "", "url": "https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/pune/pune-district-voter-turnout-polling-vote-ec-9353455/", "image": "https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/05/pune-vote-1.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-26 16:04:56", "author": "Parthasarathi Biswas", "authors": ["Parthasarathi Biswas"], "language": "en", "source_country": "in", "sentiment": -0.359}

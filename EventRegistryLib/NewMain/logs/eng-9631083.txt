Kyiv's targeting of Sevastopol has made Novorossiysk a \"crucial\" port for harboring the Black Sea Fleet's \"most valuable assets,\" the British Defense Ministry said earlier this year.\n\n\"Essentially, we have confined the Russian fleet to the Novorossiysk bay,\" Vasyl Maliuk, the head of Ukraine's SBU security service, said in late May. Reports have also suggested the Kremlin is planning a new military base at the port of Ochamchire in Abkhazia, a breakaway region of Georgia. This would put Russian assets even further from Ukraine's coastline.\n\nAlthough Ukraine can more easily target the Crimean base of Sevastopol, Kyiv has also looked to threaten the fleet in Novorossiysk. In mid-May, Ukraine launched drone attacks on military facilities in Novorossiysk and an oil refinery along the Black Sea coastline.\n\nIn late March, the British Defense Ministry said Moscow had started using four barges to guard the entrance to Novorossiysk, designed to strengthen the port's defenses against Ukrainian naval drones. Satellite imagery published by London earlier this year indicated that Russia had painted decoy silhouettes of at least one Kilo-class submarine at Novorossiysk, likely designed to confuse Ukrainian drone operators.\n\nRussia's former defense minister, Sergei Shoigu, previously announced that Moscow would beef up the protection around its Black Sea fleet, adding large-caliber machine guns to shoot at incoming drones before they can hit Russian vessels.", "source": {"uri": "newsweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsweek"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ellie_cook@newsweek.com", "name":

According to pro-Ukraine accounts, residents of Kavkaz reported up to 10 explosions in a row overnight Wednesday; bystander imagery appeared to corroborate a series of explosions and fires at the facility, but the authenticity of the footage could not be immediately confirmed.\n\nSatellite imagery obtained by Radio Free Liberty (a U.S. government-funded news outlet) appears to show limited damage to a tank farm at the port.\n\nThe Ukrainian military also claims to have damaged two vessels that were used for Russian military logistics. The satellite imagery appears to show that two vessels that were present at the pier in Kavkaz before the date of the alleged attack have now departed.\n\nKavkaz is Russia's fifth-busiest port in cargo turnover, and the second-busiest Russian port in the Black Sea area (after Novorossiysk). It is also home to an unusual nine-car rail ferry crossing, connecting to Russian-occupied Crimea on the opposite side of the Kerch Strait.\n\nSeparately, Ukraine's defense ministry claimed another successful drone strike on the Black Sea Fleet, this time in the northwestern Black Sea. The targets this time were smaller in scale - two Tuna-class patrol boats - but the outcome appeared to favor Ukrainian forces. Footage released by Ukrainian intelligence shows the drones approaching the Russian patrol vessels under fire, dodging tracers on their way to making contact with the vessels' hulls. Ukraine's \"Group 13\" drone boat task force claimed to have damaged two of the patrol vessels and destroyed two more.\n\nAfter damage or destruction of at least 15 full-size Russian warships, the once-powerful Black Sea Fleet has retreated to the relative safety of Novorossiysk, a Russian harbor in the northeastern Black Sea. The small Tuna-class patrol craft are among the few targets left on the west side of Crimea, where Ukraine has concentrated its efforts.", "source": {"uri": "maritime-executive.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Maritime Executive"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite_imagery", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Satellite imagery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Port"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caucasus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Caucasus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Russian language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned_aerial_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Unmanned aerial vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Sea", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Black Sea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Petroleum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staff_(military)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Staff (military)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crimea", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Crimea"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Train_ferry", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Train ferry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Armed_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Russian Armed Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Logistics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armed_Forces_of_Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Armed Forces of Ukraine"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrol_boat", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Patrol boat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerch_Strait", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kerch Strait"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Sea_Fleet", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Black Sea Fleet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annexation_of_Crimea_by_the_Russian_Federation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Warship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novorossiysk", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Novorossiysk"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Novorossiysk"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Transportation_and_Logistics/Maritime", "label": "dmoz/Business/Transportation and Logistics/Maritime", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Consumer_Goods_and_Services/Watercraft", "label": "dmoz/Business/Consumer Goods and Services/Watercraft", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Russian", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Russian", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Holidays/Thanksgiving", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Holidays/Thanksgiving", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Boating/Safety", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Boating/Safety", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 49}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 49}], "image": "https://maritime-executive.com/media/images/article/Photos/Wreckage_Salvage/Drone-boat-attack-May-2024-Ukraine-GUR.0fae10.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9631083", "eventUri": "eng-9631083", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.01960784313725494, "wgt": 159, "relevance": 1}

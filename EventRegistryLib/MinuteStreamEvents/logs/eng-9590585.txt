It is time to stop the coronation and conduct proper elections.\n\n\"State governors should allow the SIECs to have greater capacity for independent action. Many of the SIECs have no functional offices in the Local Government Areas in their States and cannot recruit their permanent staff,\" he said.\n\nMahmood lamented that in some states, these commissions were only constituted shortly before elections and dissolved immediately afterwards, with critical functions often taken over by government officials.\n\nThe chairman highlighted the severe underfunding of SIECs, which forces them to rely on INEC for basic election materials like ballot boxes and voting cubicles.\n\nThis dependency, he said has led to confusion among the public, with many mistaking SIECs for INEC.\n\n\"In some states, the SIECs are either not properly constituted, have no security of tenure or their critical functions have been taken over by government officials. Some SIECs are only constituted on the eve of elections and dissolved thereafter.\n\n\"They are also severely under-resourced to the extent that some of them rely on INEC even for basic facilities such as ballot boxes and voting cubicles,\" the chairman said.\n\nGiven INEC's extensive responsibilities and limited federal budget, the chairman emphasised that INEC's support to SIECs would be largely restricted to providing the voters' register, as mandated by the Constitution.\n\nHe stressed that INEC cannot extend limitless support to other commissions for elections outside its mandate.\n\n\"Many Nigerians mistake the SIECs for INEC. Indeed, even some of the stakeholders, including candidates for Local Government elections, call them State INEC.\n\n\"This situation has forced us to reconsider some aspects of our relationship with the SIECs. Our support is now largely restricted to the voters' register as provided by the Constitution.\n\n\"INEC cannot shoulder its extensive responsibilities and at the same time extend almost limitless support to other independent electoral commissions for elections outside our mandate across the country from our lean Federal budget.\"\n\nThe chairman clarified the jurisdictional boundaries between INEC and SIECs, stating that while INEC was responsible for elections in the Federal Capital Territory, SIECs manage elections for 768 Local Government Chairmen and 8,747 Councillors across the country.\n\nHe pointed to the FCT elections conducted by INEC as a model for local covernment elections nationwide, noting improvements such as secure tenures for elected officials, regular elections, and diverse electoral outcomes.\n\nNo single party has ever dominated all constituencies in the Area Councils, he stated.\n\n\"INEC is not unaware of the ongoing discussions about the future of elections for the 774 Local Government Chairmen as well as Councillors representing the 8,809 electoral wards in Nigeria.\n\n\"However, under the extant law, the 36 SIECs are responsible for the election of 768 Local Government Chairmen and 8,747 Councillors, making a total of 9,515 constituencies. INEC conducts elections for the 68 constituencies in the FCT made up of six Area Council Chairmen and 62 Councillors, including bye-elections as they arise.\n\n\"It has been our earnest hope that the elections conducted by INEC in the FCT will provide a model for Local Government elections across the country. Despite the challenges encountered, there has been a progressive improvement in the conduct of the Area Council Elections in the FCT.\n\n\"There is security of tenure for Chairmen and Councillors which is now four years. There are no caretaker committees as elections are held regularly. There is plurality in electoral outcomes as no single party has ever won elections in all the constituencies in the Area Councils.\n\n\"Happily, the Electoral Act 2022 that now governs the conduct of national and Area Council elections also applies to Local Government elections nationwide. This has been made possible by the efforts of INEC arising from earlier discussions with FOSIECOM on the imperative of a model law to govern the conduct of Local Government elections across the country,\" he added.\n\nThe INEC Chairman called on FOSIECOM to address the legal and financial challenges hindering their operations and to courageously protect the integrity and credibility of elections.\n\nHe stressed that true independence stems not only from statutory or financial provisions but also from the commitment to uphold democratic principles.\n\n\"I therefore appeal to FOSIECOM to take the bull by the horns. While there are legal and financial constraints to your operations, your independence does not necessarily draw from statutory or financial provisions alone.\n\n\"The courage with which you discharge your obligation to protect the integrity and credibility of elections is the most important determinant of success.

Our support is now largely restricted to the voters' register as provided by the Constitution.\n\n\"INEC cannot shoulder its own extensive responsibilities and at the same time extend almost limitless support to other independent electoral commissions for elections outside our mandate across the country from our lean Federal budget,\" he stated.\n\nThe commission also accused state governors of taking over the powers and functions of SIEC, regretting that \"Many of the SIECs have no functional offices in the local government areas in their states and cannot recruit their own permanent staff.\n\n\"In some states, the SIECs are either not properly constituted, have no security of tenure or their critical functions have been taken over by government officials. Some SIECs are only constituted on the eve of elections and dissolved thereafter.\n\n\"They are also severely under-resourced to the extent that some of them rely on INEC even for basic facilities such as ballot boxes and voting cubicles.\"\n\nHe also called on state governors to allow the SIECs to have greater capacity for independent action.\n\nProf. Yakubu said INEC was aware of the ongoing discussions about the future of elections for the 774 Local Government Chairmen as well as councillors representing the 8,809 electoral wards in Nigeria.\n\nHe noted that under the extant law, the 36 SIECs are responsible for the election of 768 Local Government Chairmen and 8,747 councillors, while INEC conducts elections for the 68 constituencies in Abuja, the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) made up of six Area Council Chairmen and 62 councillors.\n\nThe INEC Chairman expressed the hope that the elections conducted by the commission in the FCT would provide a model for local government elections across the country.\n\nAccording to him, in spite of the challenges encountered, there has been a progressive improvement in the conduct of the Area Council elections in the FCT, noting that there is security of tenure for the chairmen and councillors which is now four years.\n\n\"There are no caretaker committees as elections are held regularly.\n\n\"There is plurality in electoral outcomes as no single party has ever won elections in all the constituencies in the Area Councils,\" he noted.\n\nProf. Yakubu observed that the Electoral Act 2022 that governs the conduct of national and Area Council elections also applies to local government elections nationwide, and explained that this was made possible by earlier discussions between INEC and FOSIECOM \"on the imperative of a model law to govern the conduct of local government elections across the country.\n\nHe appealed to FOSIECOM to take the bull by the horns, noting that \"while there are legal and financial constraints to your operations, your independence does not necessarily draw from statutory or financial provisions alone.\"\n\nHe told them that there are no shortcuts for them to discharge their responsibility, adding, \"The courage with which you discharge your obligation to protect the integrity and credibility of elections is the most important determinant of success.\n\nProf. Yakubu reassured them that INEC would continue to work with them to push the boundaries of electoral reform.\n\n\"Working together, we should continue to explore all avenues under the law to improve the conduct of local government elections in Nigeria.\n\n\"However, you should always bear in mind that INEC and other stakeholders can only help you, but there must be a determination on your part to do the needful,\" he added.", "source": {"uri": "newtelegraphng.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "New Telegraph"}, "authors": [{"uri": "onyekachi_eze@newtelegraphng.com", "name": "Onyekachi Eze",

part to do the needful.\n\nEarlier in his remarks, the Chairman of FOSIECOM, Chief Jossy Eze, called for review of the MoU between INEC and the forum to make SIECs more functional and effective in the face of changing electoral needs, challenges and expectations.\n\nEze said it would also give the forum more impetus and new direction toward achieving the core objectives of conducting free, fair and

Indeed, even some of the stakeholders, including candidates for local government elections, call them state INEC. This situation has forced us to reconsider some aspects of our relationship with the SIECs.\n\nOur support is now largely restricted to the voters' register as provided by the Constitution. INEC cannot shoulder its own extensive responsibilities and at the same time extend almost limitless support to other independent electoral commissions for elections outside our mandate across the country from our lean federal budget.\"\n\nProfessor Yakubu, who appealed to the Chairmen of SIECs to borrow a leaf from the Federal Capital Territory Area Council Elections being conducted by his Commission, also admonished them to show courage in the discharge of their onerous assignment.\n\n\"It has been our earnest hope that the elections conducted by INEC in the FCT will provide a model for local government elections across the country.

Happily, the Electoral Act 2022 that now governs the conduct of national and area council elections also applies to local government elections nationwide.\n\nThis has been made possible by the efforts of INEC arising from earlier discussions with FOSIECOM on the imperative of a model law to govern the conduct of local government elections across the country.\n\n\"I therefore appeal to FOSIECOM to take the bull by the horns.

Many of the SIECs have no functional offices in the Local Government Areas in their States and cannot recruit their permanent staff,\" he said.\n\nMahmood lamented that in some states, these commissions were only constituted shortly before elections and dissolved immediately afterwards, with critical functions often taken over by government officials.\n\nThe chairman highlighted the severe underfunding of SIECs, which forces them to rely on INEC for basic election materials like ballot boxes and voting cubicles.\n\nThis dependency has led to confusion among the public, with many mistaking SIECs for INEC, he noted.\n\n\"In some states, the SIECs are either not properly constituted, have no security of tenure or their critical functions have been taken over by government officials. Some SIECs are only constituted on the eve of elections and dissolved thereafter.\n\n\"They are also severely under-resourced to the extent that some of them rely on INEC even for basic facilities such as ballot boxes and voting cubicles,\" the chairman said.\n\nGiven INEC's extensive responsibilities and limited federal budget, the chairman emphasised that INEC's support to SIECs would be largely restricted to providing the voters' register, as mandated by the Constitution.\n\nHe underscored that INEC cannot extend limitless support to other commissions for elections outside its mandate.\n\nYakubu noted, \"Consequently, many Nigerians mistake the SIECs for INEC. Indeed, even some of the stakeholders, including candidates for Local Government elections, call them State INEC.\n\n\"This situation has forced us to reconsider some aspects of our relationship with the SIECs. Our support is now largely restricted to the voters' register as provided by the Constitution.\n\n\"INEC cannot shoulder its extensive responsibilities and at the same time extend almost limitless support to other independent electoral commissions for elections outside our mandate across the country from our lean Federal budget.\"\n\nThe chairman clarified the jurisdictional boundaries between INEC and SIECs, stating that while INEC was responsible for elections in the Federal Capital Territory, SIECs manage elections for 768 Local Government Chairmen and 8,747 Councillors across the country.\n\nHe pointed to the FCT elections conducted by INEC as a model for local covernment elections nationwide, noting improvements such as secure tenures for elected officials, regular elections, and diverse electoral outcomes.\n\nNo single party has ever dominated all constituencies in the Area Councils, he stated.\n\n\"INEC is not unaware of the ongoing discussions about the future of elections for the 774 Local Government Chairmen as well as Councillors representing the 8,809 electoral wards in Nigeria.\n\n\"However, under the extant law, the 36 SIECs are responsible for the election of 768 Local Government Chairmen and 8,747 Councillors, making a total of 9,515 constituencies. INEC conducts elections for the 68 constituencies in the FCT made up of six Area Council Chairmen and 62 Councillors, including bye-elections as they arise.\n\n\"It has been our earnest hope that the elections conducted by INEC in the FCT will provide a model for Local Government elections across the country. Despite the challenges encountered, there has been a progressive improvement in the conduct of the Area Council Elections in the FCT.\n\n\"There is security of tenure for Chairmen and Councillors which is now four years. There are no caretaker committees as elections are held regularly. There is plurality in electoral outcomes as no single party has ever won elections in all the constituencies in the Area Councils.\n\n\"Happily, the Electoral Act 2022 that now governs the conduct of national and Area Council elections also applies to Local Government elections nationwide. This has been made possible by the efforts of INEC arising from earlier discussions with FOSIECOM on the imperative of a model law to govern the conduct of Local Government elections across the country,\" he added.\n\nThe INEC Chairman called on FOSIECOM to address the legal and financial challenges hindering their operations and to courageously protect the integrity and credibility of elections.\n\nHe stressed that true independence stems not only from statutory or financial provisions but also from the commitment to uphold democratic principles.\n\n\"I therefore appeal to FOSIECOM to take the bull by the horns. While there are legal and financial constraints to your operations, your independence does not necessarily draw from statutory or financial provisions alone.\n\n\"The courage with which you discharge your obligation to protect the integrity and credibility of elections is the most important determinant of success. There are no shortcuts to the discharge of this enormous responsibility.\n\n\"I want to reassure you that INEC will continue to work with you to push the boundaries of electoral reform. Working together, we should continue to explore all avenues under the law to improve the conduct of Local Government Elections in Nigeria.\n\n\"However, you should always bear in mind that INEC and other stakeholders can only help you, but there must be a determination on your part to do the needful,\" he noted.\n\nIt was reported on May 13, 2024, a former member of the House of Representatives, called for the transfer of conduct of local government elections from State Electoral Commissions to INEC.\n\nOnuigbo said if INEC conducts local government elections, it would minimise the manipulation of the process by governors.", "source": {"uri": "punchng.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Punch Newspapers"}, "authors": [{"uri": "gift_habib@punchng.com", "name": "Gift Habib",

It is, therefore, inappropriate on the part of INEC to allow itself to be used to perpetrate illegality.\n\nIn a statement issued on Wednesday in Lagos by the Founder of the party, Dr Aniebonam, the NNPP decried the inability of the electoral commission to attend to the letter and the issues raised therein.\n\n\"A big organisation like INEC who is charged with election matters in Nigeria should be able to run a simple administration of responding to correspondences and giving direction to matters of urgent importance\n\n\"The letter was sent and acknowledged by INEC on April 3, 2024 and it is getting to two months now without any reply from the commission. This is unbelievable and inappropriate\n\n\"The delay in response is affecting the party negatively especially with governorship elections coming up in Edo and Ekiti,\" he stated.\n\nThe party, however, appealed to the INEC chairman to urgently ensure prompt response to the letter to enable it to attend to the needs of members and intending members of the party.\n\n\"The NNPP was established in 2002 and had been participating in all elections in Nigeria. Therefore, any action by INEC by way of continued delay may affect its participation in upcoming governorship polls ahead of 2027 general election,\" it stated.", "source": {"uri": "leadership.ng", "dataType": "news", "title": "Leadership"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sunday_isuwa@leadership.ng", "name": "Sunday Isuwa", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Nigeria_People's_Party", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New Nigeria People's Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_National_Electoral_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Independent National Electoral Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_party", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Political party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahmood_Yakubu", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mahmood Yakubu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senate_of_Nigeria", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Senate of Nigeria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabiu_Kwankwaso", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rabiu Kwankwaso"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagos", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lagos"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Lagos"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ekiti_State", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ekiti State"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ekiti State"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edo_State", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Edo State"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Edo State"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Planning", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Planning", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Parties", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Parties", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Party_Planning", "label": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Party Planning", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Children", "label": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Children", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://leadership.ng/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/NNPP.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9590585", "eventUri": "eng-9590585", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 135, "relevance": 1}

State governors should allow the SIECs to have greater capacity for independent action.\n\n\"Many of the SIECs have no functional offices in the local government areas in their states and cannot recruit their own permanent staff.\n\n\"In some states, the SIECs are either not properly constituted, have no security of tenure or their critical functions have been taken over by government officials,\" he said.\n\nYakubu added: \"Some SIECs are only constituted on the eve of elections and dissolved thereafter.\n\n\"They are also severely under-resourced to the extent that some of them rely on INEC even for basic facilities such as ballot boxes and voting cubicles.\"\n\nHe said that consequently, many Nigerians including some candidate in local government elections mistook the SIECs for INEC.\n\nThis situation according to Yakubu, had forced INEC to reconsider some aspects of its relationship with the SIECs.\n\n\"Our support is now largely restricted to the voters' register as provided by the Constitution.\n\n\" INEC cannot shoulder its own extensive responsibilities and at the same time extend almost limitless support to other independent electoral commissions for elections outside our mandate across the country from our lean federal budget,'' he said.\n\nYakubu appealed to the commissions to learn from the FCT area council election conducted by INEC, so they could enhance the credibility of LG polls.\n\n\"While there are legal and financial constraints to your operations, your independence does not necessarily draw from statutory or financial provisions alone.\n\n\"The courage with which you discharge your obligation to protect the integrity and credibility of elections is the most important determinant of success.\n\n\"There are no shortcuts to the discharge of this enormous responsibility,'' he said.\n\nWhile assuring SIECs of INEC's continued support to push the boundaries of electoral reform, Yakubu said there must be a determination on SIECs part to do the needful.\n\nEarlier in his remarks, the Chairman of FOSIECOM, Chief Jossy Eze, called for review of the MoU between INEC and the forum to make SIECs more functional and effective in the face of changing electoral needs, challenges and expectations.\n\nEze said it would also give the forum more impetus and new direction toward achieving the core objectives of conducting free, fair and credible elections at all levels.\n\nHe also called for the development of a new strategic work plan for support to SIECS which the last plan was for the period of 2019-2023.\n\nEze, also the Chairman, Ebonyi SIEC, appreciated INEC'S innovations to improve Nigeria's elections as well as its support to the struggle of SIECS, toward financial independence.\n\n\"We strongly believe that our financial independence is not only achievable but a sine qua non for virile Local Government elections in Nigeria.\n\n\"FOSIECON has again, recently submitted a memorandum to the National Assembly Committee on Constitutional amendment.\n\n\"We solicit INEC to throw its weight behind our quest for true independence,'' he said.(NAN)", "source": {"uri": "newsdiaryonline.com", "dataType": "news",

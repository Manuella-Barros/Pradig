Racist grandpas may be dying out, but their bigotry is regenerating in today's youths.\n\nYes, there were swastika-tattooed, Ku Klux Klan-hooded 50-somethings on the streets of Charlottesville.

And some did more than march.\n\nThe driver accused of murdering counterprotester Heather Heyer and injuring 19 is a 20-year-old white man.\n\nHe would of course not be the first radicalized young white man to commit an act of domestic terrorism. There was the then-21-year-old white male who murdered nine African-Americans at a Charleston, South Carolina, church in 2015, and the 28-year-old white Baltimore man who in March allegedly rode a bus to New York in search of black men to kill at random.\n\nA recent Joint Intelligence Bulletin, obtained by Foreign Policy magazine, details plenty of other attacks perpetrated by young white-supremacist men.\n\nThe public faces of the white supremacist \"alt-right\" movement are likewise skewing younger. David Duke is still around, but as a charismatic figurehead he has mostly been displaced by the likes of 39-year-old Richard Spencer, 26-year-old Matthew Heimbach and 29-year-old Tim \"Baked Alaska\" Gionet.\n\nThese are not people whose backwardness we can write off as an unfortunate product of their time.\n\nThat is, we're not talking about young white Americans whose happy formative years took place in a world with (de jure) school segregation, redlining, anti-miscegenation laws and phrenology.\n\nIf any had family who fought for the Confederacy, they've been dead for at least a century. No one is telling them about the good ol' days on the plantation.\n\nIf anything, parents of the Charlottesville rallygoers have professed ignorance or repudiation of their children's odious beliefs.\n\nSo why are millennials, of all people, at the forefront of the small but highly visible resurrection of neo-Nazism?\n\nSome seem to be reactionaries, essentially trolls who may or may not truly believe the anti-Semitic and racist bile that they meme and share to get a rise out of the politically correct left. If youthful rebellion in the 1960s meant embracing free love, peace and equality, then today -- at least for anti-anti-Trumpers -- it is about promoting hatred and structural inequity.\n\nOthers may genuinely wish to burn the whole system down.\n\nIt is a flawed system, after all, one whose recent financial crisis irreparably scarred millennials' economic prospects. Most anti-establishment millennials have drifted toward leftist populist alternatives, but some have sorted into the opposite (and more violent) extreme. For right-wing populists, the key flaw with the system is not that it allows the rich to hoard all the money, but that it privileges undeserving minorities at innocent whites' expense.\n\nWe've already seen a version of this bifurcated youth populism take hold elsewhere. In France's first-round presidential election this year, more young voters chose the Communist-allied far-left candidate. But in second place was far-right ethno-nationalist Marine Le Pen.\n\nHere in the United States, extreme ideology and iconography may also no longer carry the same political baggage they once did. Just as \"socialism\" is not a toxic word to people who came of age after the Cold War, perhaps aligning with Nazis no longer seems as inherently, reflexively evil for those so far removed from World War II.\n\nMore significantly, the presumption that millennials are uniformly more progressive than earlier generations is false.\n\nMillennials overall are more racially tolerant than earlier generations -- but that's because young people today are less likely to be white. White millennials exhibit about as much racial prejudice, as measured by explicit bias, as white Gen Xers and boomers. Yet even young people know that overt racial animus is socially frowned upon, a deal-breaker for those seeking friends, spouses or gainful employment.\n\nAt least, they did, until the 2016 presidential campaign. Perhaps it's no wonder that some self-aggrandizing young white men heard a siren call in all those dog whistles: Tomorrow belongs to them.\n\nWashington Post Writers Group\n\nCatherine Rampell's email

Racist grandpas may be dying out, but their bigotry is regenerating in today's youths.\n\nYes, there were swastika-tattooed, Ku Klux Klan-hooded 50-somethings on the streets of Charlottesville. The most chilling photos, however, show hordes of torch-bearing, fresh-faced, \"fashy\"-coiffed white men in their teens and 20s.\n\nSome marchers in this youth brigade are still students, one the leader of his campus chapter of the College Republicans. And some did more than march.\n\nThe driver accused of murdering counterprotester Heather Heyer and injuring 19 is a 20-year-old white man.\n\nHe would of course not be the first radicalized young white man to commit an act of domestic terrorism. There was the then-21-year-old white male who murdered nine African-Americans at a Charleston, South Carolina, church in 2015, and the 28-year-old white Baltimore man who in March allegedly rode a bus to New York in search of black men to kill at random.\n\nA recent Joint Intelligence Bulletin, obtained by Foreign Policy magazine, details plenty of other attacks perpetrated by young white-supremacist men.\n\nThe public faces of the white supremacist \"alt-right\" movement are likewise skewing younger. David Duke is still around, but as a charismatic figurehead he has mostly been displaced by the likes of 39-year-old Richard Spencer, 26-year-old Matthew Heimbach and 29-year-old Tim \"Baked Alaska\" Gionet.\n\nThese are not people whose backwardness we can write off as an unfortunate product of their time.\n\nThat is, we're not talking about young white Americans whose happy formative years took place in a world with (de jure) school segregation, redlining, anti-miscegenation laws and phrenology.\n\nIf any had family who fought for the Confederacy, they've been dead for at least a century. No one is telling them about the good ol' days on the plantation.\n\nIf anything, parents of the Charlottesville rallygoers have professed ignorance or repudiation of their children's odious beliefs.\n\nSo why are millennials, of all people, at the forefront of the small but highly visible resurrection of neo-Nazism?\n\nSome seem to be reactionaries, essentially trolls who may or may not truly believe the anti-Semitic and racist bile that they meme and share to get a rise out of the politically correct left. If youthful rebellion in the 1960s meant embracing free love, peace and equality, then today -- at least for anti-anti-Trumpers -- it is about promoting hatred and structural inequity.\n\nOthers may genuinely wish to burn the whole system down.\n\nIt is a flawed system, after all, one whose recent financial crisis irreparably scarred millennials' economic prospects. Most anti-establishment millennials have drifted toward leftist populist alternatives, but some have sorted into the opposite (and more violent) extreme. For right-wing populists, the key flaw with the system is not that it allows the rich to hoard all the money, but that it privileges undeserving minorities at innocent whites' expense.\n\nWe've already seen a version of this bifurcated youth populism take hold elsewhere. In France's first-round presidential election this year, more young voters chose the Communist-allied far-left candidate. But in second place was far-right ethno-nationalist Marine Le Pen.\n\nHere in the United States, extreme ideology and iconography may also no longer carry the same political baggage they once did. Just as \"socialism\" is not a toxic word to people who came of age after the Cold War, perhaps aligning with Nazis no longer seems as inherently, reflexively evil for those so far removed from World War II.\n\nMore significantly, the presumption that millennials are uniformly more progressive than earlier generations is false.\n\nMillennials overall are more racially tolerant than earlier generations -- but that's because young people today are less likely to be white. White millennials exhibit about as much racial prejudice, as measured by explicit bias, as white Gen Xers and boomers. Yet even young people know that overt racial animus is socially frowned upon, a deal-breaker for those seeking friends, spouses or gainful employment.\n\nAt least, they did, until the 2016 presidential campaign. Perhaps it's no wonder that some self-aggrandizing young white men heard a siren call in all those dog whistles: Tomorrow belongs to them.\n\nCatherine Rampell is a syndicated columnist.\n\nRead or

Racist grandpas may be dying out, but their bigotry is regenerating in today's youths.\n\nYes, there were swastika-tattooed, Ku Klux Klan-hooded 50-somethings on the streets of Charlottesville. The most chilling photos, however, show hordes of torch-bearing, fresh-faced, \"fashy\"-coiffed white men in their teens and 20s.\n\nSome marchers in this youth brigade are still students, one the leader of his campus chapter of the College Republicans. And some did more than march.\n\nThe driver accused of murdering counterprotester Heather Heyer and injuring 19 is a 20-year-old white man.\n\nHe would of course not be the first radicalized young white man to commit an act of domestic terrorism. There was the then-21-year-old white male who murdered nine African Americans at a Charleston church in 2015, and the 28-year-old white Baltimore man who in March allegedly rode a bus 200 miles to New York in search of black men to kill at random.\n\nA recent Joint Intelligence Bulletin, obtained by Foreign Policy magazine, details plenty of other attacks perpetrated by young white-supremacist men.\n\nThe public faces of the white supremacist \"alt-right\" movement are likewise skewing younger. David Duke is still around, but as a charismatic figurehead he has mostly been displaced by the likes of 39-year-old Richard Spencer, 26-year-old Matthew Heimbach and 29-year-old Tim \"Baked Alaska\" Gionet.\n\nThese are not people whose backwardness we can write off as an unfortunate product of their time.\n\nThat is, we're not talking about young white Americans whose happy formative years took place in a world with (de jure) school segregation, redlining, anti-miscegenation laws and phrenology.\n\nIf any had family who fought for the Confederacy, they've been dead for at least a century. No one is telling them about the good ol' days on the plantation.\n\nIf anything, parents of the Charlottesville rallygoers have professed ignorance or repudiation of their children's odious beliefs.\n\nSo why are millennials, of all people, at the forefront of the small but highly visible resurrection of neo-Nazism?\n\nSome seem to be reactionaries, essentially trolls who may or may not truly believe the anti-Semitic and racist bile that they meme and share to get a rise out of the politically correct left. If youthful rebellion in the 1960s meant embracing free love, peace and equality, then today -- at least for anti-anti-Trumpers -- it is about promoting hatred and structural inequity.\n\nOthers may genuinely wish to burn the whole system down.\n\nIt is a flawed system, after all, one whose recent financial crisis irreparably scarred millennials' economic prospects. Most anti-establishment millennials have drifted toward leftist populist alternatives, but some have sorted into the opposite (and more violent) extreme. For right-wing populists, the key flaw with the system is not that it allows the rich to hoard all the money, but that it privileges undeserving minorities at innocent whites' expense.\n\nWe've already seen a version of this bifurcated youth populism take hold elsewhere. In France's first-round presidential election this year, for example, a plurality of young voters chose the Communist-allied far-left candidate. But in second place was far-right ethno-nationalist Marine Le Pen.\n\nHere in the United States, extreme ideology and iconography may also no longer carry the same political baggage they once did. Just as \"socialism\" is not a toxic word to people who came of age after the Cold War, perhaps aligning with Nazis no longer seems as inherently, reflexively evil for those so far removed from World War II.\n\nMore significantly, the presumption that millennials are uniformly more progressive than earlier generations is false.\n\nMillennials overall are more racially tolerant than earlier generations -- but that's because young people today are less likely to be white. White millennials exhibit about as much racial prejudice, as measured by explicit bias, as white Gen Xers and boomers. Yet even young people know that overt racial animus is socially frowned upon, a dealbreaker for those seeking friends, spouses or gainful employment.\n\nAt least, they did, until the 2016 presidential campaign. Perhaps it's no wonder that some self-aggrandizing young white men heard a siren call in all those dog whistles: Tomorrow belongs to them.\n\nRead more on this topic:\n\nMolly Roberts: Stop blaming white supremacy on 'identity politics'\n\nGary Abernathy: An honest conversation about race is not allowed\n\nE.J.

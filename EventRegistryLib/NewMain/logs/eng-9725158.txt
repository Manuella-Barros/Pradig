Now, a decision by the Securities and Exchange Commission to quietly end a probe into the New York stablecoin issuer Paxos suggests that, in most cases at least, the answer is no.\n\nOn July 9, Jorge Tenreiro, the acting chief of the crypto assets and cyber unit, informed Paxos that he did not intend to recommend an enforcement action, according to a letter shared with Fortune. The notice came more than a year after the SEC sent Paxos a Wells notice, or a letter signaling an impending enforcement action, over the dollar-backed BUSD stablecoin that Paxos issued in partnership with Binance.\n\nThis retreat by the SEC comes days after the agency suffered a partial defeat in a lawsuit against the top crypto exchange Binance. While Congress continues to stall on legislation to regulate the growing asset class, the SEC's decision offers an unexpected win to the stablecoin sector, which now includes companies such as PayPal and VanEck.\n\n\"The termination of this investigation formally is an enormous relief for us,\" said Walter Hessert, the head of strategy at Paxos, in an interview with Fortune. \"It's what we expected all along, and it really should create, hopefully, more certainty in the market among what we see as a growing number of large enterprises.\"\n\nIn response to a request for comment from Fortune, an SEC spokesperson said that \"the SEC does not comment on the existence or nonexistence of a possible investigation.\"\n\nThe New York-based Paxos first launched BUSD in partnership with Binance in September 2019. Though the dollar-backed stablecoin never overtook its competitors Tether and USDC, it soon became one of the leaders in the budding sector thanks to its role in the Binance ecosystem.\n\nWhile BUSD was pegged to the U.S. dollar, the SEC would later argue in a lawsuit against Binance that the stablecoin was an investment contract, and therefore a security, because it earned profits through its reserves for both Binance and Paxos, which were partially passed on to Binance users in the form of yields. While the lawsuit did not come until June 2023, the SEC informed Paxos of its view in the February 2023 Wells notice. In a statement at the time, Paxos disagreed with the SEC's stance, arguing that BUSD was backed 1:1 with dollar-denominated reserves, though it didn't later elaborate on the agency's arguments about profits generated by the reserves.\n\nThe SEC's move against Paxos sent shockwaves through the crypto industry. Stablecoins still fall in a regulatory gray zone barring new legislation, but many argue that the absence of an expectation of profit -- a key prong in the test to determine securities -- separates them from many other crypto assets.\n\nThe investigation continued for over a year, with the agency responding to a Fortune freedom-of-information request by confirming that it remained \"active and ongoing\" as of July 3. The agency appears to have shifted its stance, however, after a federal judge sided with Binance in a June 28 decision that held that the sales of BUSD did not constitute a securities offering and ordered the charge to be dropped.\n\nSpeaking with Fortune, Hessert said that Paxos has had to operate under the \"cloud\" of a Wells notice for over a year, which has impacted its ability to partner with new companies, including PayPal. \"It definitely will accelerate some really exciting enterprise conversations,\" he said.\n\nThe decision may also bolster the stablecoin sector in the U.S. as firms have looked abroad to launch new offerings amid the regulatory uncertainty.", "source": {"uri": "fortune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fortune"}, "authors": [{"uri": "leo_schwartz@fortune.com", "name": "Leo Schwartz", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paxos", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paxos"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stablecoin", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stablecoin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binance", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Binance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortune_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fortune (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Securities_and_Exchange_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States dollar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wells_notice", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wells notice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_asset", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Digital asset"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cryptocurrency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Security (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USD_Coin", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "USD Coin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tether_(cryptocurrency)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tether (cryptocurrency)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PayPal", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "PayPal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cloud computing"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Fraud", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Fraud", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 53}], "image": "https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-1845876331-e1720638871786.jpg?resize=1200,600", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9725158", "eventUri": "eng-9725158", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-09", "textStart": 399, "textEnd": 405}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-03", "textStart": 3083, "textEnd": 3089}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-28", "textStart": 3193, "textEnd": 3200}, {"amb": false, "date": "2019-09-", "textStart": 1728, "textEnd": 1742}], "sentiment": 0.2862745098039217, "wgt": 235, "relevance": 1}

While BUSD did not overtake its competitors Tether's USDT and Circle's USDC stablecoisn in terms of market dominance, it gained its status as a widely used stablecoin largely due to its integral role within the Binance ecosystem.\n\nWhile BUSD maintained a peg to the US dollar, the SEC later claimed in a lawsuit against Binance that the stablecoin should be classified as an investment contract and therefore a security under the Howey test, which many crypto participants believe is an outdated framework for regulating the crypto market.\n\nPaxos, in response, disagreed with the SEC's characterization, asserting that BUSD was fully backed by dollar-denominated reserves in a 1:1 ratio, without delving into the agency's claims regarding profit distribution.\n\nThe investigation persisted for over a year, as confirmed by the SEC in response to a Freedom of Information Act request from Fortune, with the agency stating its active and ongoing status as of July 3.\n\nHowever, it appears that the SEC's stance shifted following a federal judge's ruling on June 28, which favored Binance and concluded that the sale of BUSD did not constitute a securities offering, leading to the dismissal of the charges.\n\nAt the time of writing, Binance's native token BNB trades at $532, up by 1% in the 24 hour time frame.\n\nFeatured image from DALL-E, chart from TradingView.com", "source": {"uri": "bitcoinist.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Bitcoinist.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paxos", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paxos"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stablecoin", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stablecoin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binance", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Binance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Securities_and_Exchange_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cryptocurrency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortune_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fortune (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States dollar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USD_Coin", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "USD Coin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tether_(cryptocurrency)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tether (cryptocurrency)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_Information_Act_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Freedom of Information Act (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Security (finance)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Fraud", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Fraud", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/photo-1676312210846-104b89aafd81.avif", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9725158", "eventUri": "eng-9725158", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-03", "textStart": 1878, "textEnd": 1884}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-28", "textStart": 1975, "textEnd": 1982}, {"amb": false, "date": "2019-09-", "textStart": 906, "textEnd": 920}], "sentiment": 0.2784313725490195, "wgt": 227, "relevance": 1}

SEC Withdrew Its Investigation Against Paxos", "body": "The US Securities and Exchange Commission is finally easing up its leash on the crypto community. Amidst growing calls for clearer rules in crypto, the SEC has wrapped up its investigation into Paxos, a New York stablecoin issuer.\n\nOn July 9, Jorge Tenreiro, acting chief of the SEC's crypto unit, informed Paxos they wouldn't face enforcement action after over a year of scrutiny and a Wells notice served. The investigation started with increasing concerns that BUSD might be a security due to its profit-sharing model with Binance. However, the SEC's move shows they see BUSD as a digital dollar rather than an investment.\n\nThis development follows recent legal setbacks for the SEC, including a federal court ruling that transactions involving BUSD did not amount to securities offerings, providing further legal precedent favorable to stablecoin issuers.\n\nHow It Helps the Crypto Industry:\n\nBy dropping this case, the SEC provides a degree of clarity and relief to the broader crypto industry, This decision could potentially pave the way for increased innovation and investment in decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts. This also suggests that digital assets pegged to and backed by the U.S. dollar, may not be treated as securities moving forward.\n\nThe SEC's decision marks a significant victory for stablecoins, offering clarity amidst regulatory uncertainties. Walter Hessert, Paxos's strategy head, described it as a relief, emphasizing the impact of operating under a \"cloud\" of a Wells notice for over a year. This uncertainty had previously hindered Paxos's ability to form new partnerships, including potential collaborations with companies like PayPal.\n\nThis development eases restrictions for Paxos and is expected to stimulate further innovation in the U.S. stablecoin market.

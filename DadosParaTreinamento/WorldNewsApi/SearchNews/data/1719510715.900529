I felt really empty without one and decided to have my first own dog in January.\"Determined to adopt a dog less likely to find a home, Marusha discovered the 11-year-old pup through an organization rescuing dogs from death stations in Romania. He was previously named Degal, but she renamed him Taro, which means older brother/first child in Japanese.Taro had endured an abusive owner. \"When it was finally time to pick Taro up, he was super scared. But I gave him time to sniff me before signing the adoption papers, and we brought him home,\" Marusha said.The slideshow, which has since gone viral, showcases Taro quickly warming up to his new owner.\"I could see relief in him; he was immediately extremely cuddly and chose me as his owner,\" Marusha said. Despite his initial fear and stubbornness, especially regarding walking and navigating stairs, Taro began to adapt remarkably fast. Within days, he responded to his new name and basic commands in German.Their bond strengthened significantly when Marusha got a seasonal illness shortly after adopting Taro, allowing them to spend uninterrupted time together at home.\"Since then, he has become very attached to me. He follows me everywhere, even into the bathroom when I shower,\" Marusha said.The Humane Society of Macomb explains that many animals are surrendered due to various circumstances, such as behavioral issues, changes in living situations, or financial constraints.According to the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, about 6.3 million pets enter U.S. shelters annually, and roughly 920,000 are euthanized each year. Efforts to promote adoption and reduce euthanasia rates include spaying and neutering programs and behavior rehabilitation.Despite Taro's challenging past and health issues related to his age and previous lack of exercise, Marusha's dedicated care has transformed him. \"He loves to walk, cuddle, and play. He's still scared of men but is incredibly loyal and loving towards me and my family. My mom always says that he's smiling.\"Because he used to be kept in a cage and could not walk for the entire day, Taro now has very bad joints. Fortunately, the poster's aunt is a veterinarian, which means he's getting all the necessary treatments to get his health back on track.The video quickly went viral on TikTok, racking up over 211,200 views and 33,500 likes on the platform so far.One TikTok user, Shoshanna, commented: \"Thank you for finding him...you are amazing person and he knows you are the best 100 percent.\"TikToker Sea.blue.percy wrote, \"He's exactly like my german shepherd.. professional drama queens.\"Do you have funny and adorable videos or pictures of your pet you want to share?

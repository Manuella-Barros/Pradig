They were supposed to be a locked-in group of five forming a young quintet that had few questions heading into 2024 aside, perhaps, surrounding the ace and if he might remain in Cleveland.\n\nBut as a group, they've been anything but secure since those optimistic times.\n\nFive names were written in Sharpie -- Shane Bieber, Triston McKenzie, Gavin Williams, Bibee and Logan Allen -- barring anything unforeseen happening. And then a whole bunch of unforeseen things happened one after the other, which is a good reason why teams plan in very light pencil instead of permanent marker.\n\nBieber? Out for the season after undergoing Tommy John surgery despite a promising start to his year. McKenzie? Currently in Triple-A searching for his command after temporarily leading the league in walks and home runs allowed. Williams? He's made only four starts after missing most of the season with injuries, and his return has featured a mixed-bag of results. Allen? He struggled to a 5.67 ERA and is now on the injured list.\n\nOnly one -- Bibee -- has offered the first-place Guardians any resemblance of consistency from that list. The lineup has been tremendously improved from a year ago. The bullpen has been baseball's best. And then there's Bibee and Ben Lively propping up the starting rotation essentially by themselves.\n\nAdding a starting pitcher at the trade deadline is likely the Guardians' No. 1 priority, though just about every contender could use an extra arm, which might cause some bidding wars. But out of an original rotation of five, Bibee has emerged as their most reliable starter.\n\n\"We have our meetings with starters every series, and we talk about the starter and what they're doing good and how do we keep them going,\" said utility man David Fry. \"Lately it's just like, 'All right, let's talk about Bibee. Yeah, he's been really, really good. OK, keep going, next guy.'\"\n\n\"I mean, I think we've all known that he's a bonafide ace, and I think now the league's starting to see it and they're circling his name, and he's still putting up zeros ever outing. He's so much fun to play behind and watch pitch.\"\n\nTanner Bibee sets career high in strikeouts in a game during hot streak as trade deadline nears\n\nBibee has been on fire lately. In his last 12 starts, he has a 2.82 ERA with 82 strikeouts in 70 1/3 innings. That includes an outing in which he set a career high with 11 strikeouts and then beat that mark his next time out, putting away 12 batters. And in six of those 12 starts, he's pitched at least five innings with zero or one earned run allowed.\n\n\"I think the stuff has gotten better,\" said manager Stephen Vogt, who earlier this year challenged Bibee to remain in the game and get one more out rather than being taken out. \"I think for Tanner, he's learning who he is constantly. He pitches like he's been doing it for a long time, but he's learning a lot of things.\"\n\nThe Guardians are one of the biggest teams to watch across baseball as the trade deadline approaches. They have a need to bolster the rotation (Cleveland is 29th out of 30 clubs in starting pitcher fWAR), the timing (the best record in the American League entering the All-Star break) and the prospect capital, which was helped by winning the No. 1 overall pick in the lottery and drafting Travis Bazzana.\n\nPerhaps they'll view the returns of McKenzie (from Triple-A, eventually), Williams (from the IL, already in progress) and Allen (from the IL, eventually) as enough, but that's also relying on a lot of factors going their way in a short amount of time. For now, Bibee and Lively have at least maintained their spots in the rotation, and helped to hold together the other slots with string and tape.\n\nBut considering the Guardians weren't a team expected to make much noise in the playoff picture this season, the fact that the rotation can be viewed as such a potential issue is a testament to just how great the offense and bullpen have been to have the Guardians in this position in the first place.\n\nTo put it another way, even though the Guardians' situation with their rotation hasn't gone to plan, they're glad to be in a position to have such a sense of urgency as the deadline draws near.\n\n\"I think it's a nice combination of keep doing what we're doing, and kind of take it up a notch,\" Bibee said. \"I mean, I think we're in a way different position last year than this year. We're in a major buy mode, I hope, and everyone really wants to win.\"", "source": {"uri": "lancastereaglegazette.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Lancaster Eagle-Gazette"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ace_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ace (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starting_pitcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Starting pitcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triston_McKenzie", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Triston McKenzie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logan_Allen_(baseball,_born_1997)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Logan Allen (baseball, born 1997)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shane_Bieber", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shane Bieber"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulnar_collateral_ligament_reconstruction", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ulnar collateral ligament reconstruction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple-A_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Triple-A (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_on_balls", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Base on balls"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Earned run average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injured_list", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Injured list"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Lively", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ben Lively"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pitch (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utility_player", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Utility player"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings_pitched", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Innings pitched"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullpen", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bullpen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Vogt", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stephen Vogt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wins_Above_Replacement", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wins Above Replacement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manager (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American League"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Subcultures/Spotters", "label": "dmoz/Society/Subcultures/Spotters", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/History", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.lancastereaglegazette.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2024/06/19/NABJ/74152497007-guardians-mariners-061924-3.JPG?crop=3337,1877,x0,y138&width=1600&height=800&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9761475", "eventUri": "eng-9761475", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 191, "relevance": 1}

Mandatory Credit: Ken Blaze-USA TODAY Sports / Ken Blaze-USA TODAY Sports\n\nThe Cleveland Guardians offense didn't make it easy on themselves, but they came away with a win against the Detroit Tigers on Wednesday night, 2-1.\n\nHere are three observations and takeaways from the Guardians' latest victory.\n\nTanner Bibee was phenomenal in his start against the Tigers. He threw 5.0 innings, gave up just two hits, one earned run, and threw 64 percent of his pitches for strikes. It certainly looked like a game in which he could pitch deep into the seventh inning or further.\n\nThis is the type of efficient start that the Guardians desperately needed from their starting rotation. However, it didn't come with its own drama.\n\nBibee scared everyone at Progressive Field and Guardians fans when he limped off the mound prior to the sixth inning and left the game early. Thankfully, the team confirmed that it was just cramping and nothing more serious than that.\n\nBo Naylor supplied the spark for the offense on Wednesday.\n\nCleveland's catcher recorded a single and advanced to second base on a past ball in the fifth inning. He then came around to score the tying run thanks to a Steven Kwan base hit.\n\nThen in the bottom of the eighth, Bo worked a leadoff walk and stole second base to put himself in scoring position. Detroit smartly walked Jose Ramirez, bringing Josh to the plate. The older Naylor brother came up clutch with a base hit which scored Bo, the winning run.\n\nThe Guardians bullpen looked like they'd get an off night as Bibee quickly wroed through Detroit's lineup. However, once he left the game with cramping, they had to quickly get thsmeleves ready.\n\nEven on short notice, this reliever core came up huge.\n\nScott Barlow had virtually no time to warm up. He came into the game as relief for Bibee and threw 1.1 perfect innings. Then it was Hunter Gaddis and Tim Herrin's turn. Neither of them gave up a base runner in their combined 1.2 innings of work. Lastly, Emmanuel Clase came into the game and did what he does best, notching yet another save.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Guardians", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Guardians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bo_Naylor", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bo Naylor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_Field", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Progressive Field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Catcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanner_Bibee", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tanner Bibee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit_Tigers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Detroit Tigers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle_Mariners", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Seattle Mariners"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pitch (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Earned run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starting_pitcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Starting pitcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter_Gaddis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hunter Gaddis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Kwan", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Steven Kwan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Barlow_(baseball)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scott Barlow (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmanuel_Clase", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Emmanuel Clase"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leadoff_hitter", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Leadoff hitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scoring_position", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scoring position"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stolen_base", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stolen base"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_baseman", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Second baseman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings_pitched", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Innings pitched"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullpen", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bullpen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relief_pitcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Relief pitcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos\u00e9_Ram\u00edrez_(infielder)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jos\u00e9 Ram\u00edrez (infielder)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_6494,h_3652,x_0,y_100/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/cleveland_baseball_insider/01j3kqa67sk5cbvd140s.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9761475", "eventUri": "eng-9761475", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2019-06-", "textStart": 0, "textEnd": 6}], "sentiment": 0.1607843137254903, "wgt": 172, "relevance": 1}

The team announced Bibee, who allowed only Matt Vierling's first-inning homer and one other hit, was dealing with lower-extremity cramping.\n\nHe walked one and struck out four.\n\nHowever, Guardians relievers Scott Barlow, Tim Herrin, Hunter Gaddis (4-2) and Emmanuel Clase (31st save) didn't yield a hit and allowed just one baserunner over the final four innings.\n\nIn the eighth, Cleveland's Bo Naylor drew a leadoff walk from Beau Brieske (1-1), stole second, then made third on a grounder that resulted in the second out.\n\nAfter Jose Ramirez was intentionally walked, Josh Naylor's bouncer was just out of second baseman Colt Keith's reach. The hit wound up producing a second straight victory for the AL Central-leading Guardians, who lost 8-2 on Monday in the opener of the four-game set -- their seventh loss in nine at the time.\n\nFor the sixth time in his past eight starts, Flaherty allowed one or no runs, and the lone tally he surrendered this time was unearned. He gave up three hits and two walks while striking out six in six innings. Flaherty dropped his ERA to 2.95 and further fanned rumors that he might be dealt prior to next week's trade deadline.\n\nBibee retired the first two batters of the game before Vierling sent an opposite-field drive over the wall in right for his 13th homer.\n\nFlaherty was cruising until there were two outs in the fifth, when Bo Naylor grounded a single into center field. With Steven Kwan at the plate, Naylor went to second on catcher Carson Kelly's passed ball. Kwan then laced a single into left-center field that scored Naylor with the tying run.\n\nDetroit has lost three of four following a 10-2 stretch.\n\n--Field Level Media", "source": {"uri": "newsobserver.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The News&Observer"}, "authors": [{"uri": "field_level_media@newsobserver.com", "name": "Field Level Media", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Naylor", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Josh Naylor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Guardians", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Guardians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ace_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ace (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_baseman", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Third baseman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit_Tigers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Detroit Tigers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_batted_in", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Run batted in"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter_Gaddis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hunter Gaddis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beau_Brieske", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Beau Brieske"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Barlow_(baseball)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scott Barlow (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bo_Naylor", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bo Naylor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmanuel_Clase", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Emmanuel Clase"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leadoff_hitter", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Leadoff hitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_baseman", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Second baseman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batted_ball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Batted ball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "American League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intentional_base_on_balls", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Intentional base on balls"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings_pitched", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Innings pitched"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos\u00e9_Ram\u00edrez_(infielder)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jos\u00e9 Ram\u00edrez (infielder)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Kwan", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Steven Kwan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carson_Kelly", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Carson Kelly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passed_ball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Passed ball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_fielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Center fielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Out_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Out (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Earned run"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Fields", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Fields", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Walking", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Walking", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Walking/Women", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Walking/Women", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Walking/Racewalking", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Walking/Racewalking", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.mcclatchy-wires.com/incoming/w4ce0h/picture290404854/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/8ef50b25-64b3-4d28-aec9-e690c62c2e53", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9761475", "eventUri": "eng-9761475", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.09019607843137256, "wgt": 150, "relevance": 1}

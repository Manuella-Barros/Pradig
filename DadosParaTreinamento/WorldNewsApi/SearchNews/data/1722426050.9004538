{"id": 243278658, "title": "Arsenal transfer news: Gunners dealt blow by Barcelona as Osimhen update offered", "text": "Arsenal's transfer business has yet to get going this summer, though the club look set to make their first signing shortly. Mikel Arteta's side look to bolster a squad that came agonisingly close to pushing Pep Guardiola's Manchester City. The club remain intent on signing a new centre forward and significant transfer activity in the area is expected at the Emirates in the near future. Several high-profile players have been linked with a move to the Emirates, including top strikers like Victor Osimhen and Viktor Gyokeres. A new midfielder also remains a top priority, with the future of Ghana international Thomas Partey uncertain amid rumours of a potential exit. The unofficial deadline of PSR arriving this weekend could see the Gunners push for Everton's Amadou Onana or Newcastle United's Bruno Guimaraes. With that said, the Mirror has taken a close look at the transfer rumours from the Emirates Stadium. Osimhen 'agreement' with Napoli The Napoli star is a name that has been heavily linked with Arsenal in recent weeks to help Arteta and Edu in their quest for attacking reinforcements. And new Napoli manager Antonio Conte confirmed that an agreement is in place for the 25-year-old to leave the Italian club. At his unveiling, Conte said: \"As far as Osimhen is concerned, just as I knew very well about the situation of Kvara, Di Lorenzo, Anguissa, Lobotka, on which I have placed an absolute veto. \"Having said that, I know what the situation is regarding Osimhen. I know that there are agreements, that it is a situation different from all the others. I can only assist. He is a player of the highest level, exceptional, but I cannot enter into any discussion because it is part of previous agreements which have been clearly stated to me.\" Barca turn down Kounde approach The Gunners made an initial approach for Jules Kounde but their entreaties have been swiftly jilted by Barcelona. The 25-year-old can be deployed at right-back and centre-back and has been tipped as an important defensive reinforcement for Arteta's side. However, Arsenal will need to think of something creative to peel the defender away from the Spanish giants, after Spanish outlet Jijantes reported that Barcelona have told Arsenal they are not looking to sell Kounde. Barcelona's tone could change, depending on the future of Ronald Ara\u00fajo, who is heavily desired by Manchester United. Smith Rowe pushes for exit Emile Smith Rowe is set to tell Arsenal he wants to leave the club. The 23-year-old has struggled for consistent game time under Mikel Arteta in recent seasons, having become an increasingly peripheral figure in the latest season. The attacking player looks increasingly likely to seek a transfer away from the Emirates this summer. And according to reports, Smith Rowe will make it clear to the Gunners that he needs a move, amid interest from the likes of Aston Villa, Fulham and Crystal Palace. A sale of Smith Rowe could help Arsenal in their pursuit of other transfers while still operating within financial rules. It\u2019s believed that Arsenal are holding out on a fee in the region of \u00a330m. Join our new WhatsApp communityand receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

{"id": 232064310, "title": "Tajikistan's taxi companies to fully transition to EV by 2025", "text": "The Dushanbe Administration has issued a directive requiring all taxi companies in the city to transition entirely to electric vehicles by September 1, 2025. This initiative is part of the broader national electric transport development program for 2023-2028 and the specific concept for the transition to electric transport from 2023-2026. An official within the Dushanbe Administration highlighted that approximately 230 mn somonis ($21 mn) will be allocated over the next five years to develop electric transport. Of this total, 1.4 mn somonis ($129,575) will come from the national budget, 6.2 mn somonis ($573,835) will be provided by development partners, and the private sector will contribute more than 221 mn somonis ($20.5 mn). The initiative also aligns with President Emomali Rahmon's 2021 proposal to waive taxes and customs duties on imports of electric vehicles, including electric cars, buses, and trolleybuses, ASIA-Plus states. The President instructed the government to develop the necessary infrastructure and conditions to support the use of electric vehicles. Dushanbe-based taxi company Yak Taxi was a pioneer in this initiative, announcing in 2022 that it would launch a new category in its app for booking electric vehicles. Unlike the usual yellow cabs, these electric taxis are painted green, distinguishing them from conventional taxis. Additionally, an electric bus assembled at the Akia Avesto plant in Dushanbe was introduced in December 2021. This electric bus can travel up to 200 kilometers on a single charge, showcasing the potential for expanding electric public transportation in the city. The transition to electric vehicles is part of a broader effort to utilize Tajikistan's substantial hydropower resources. The country has significant energy reserves, particularly in hydropower, which accounts for 95% of its electricity generation. Tajikistan ranks eighth globally in hydropower potential relative to its area. By 2020, the total capacity of Tajikistan's hydropower plants had increased to 6,000 MW, with projections to reach 10,000 MW by 2030. The average annual electricity output in Tajikistan is 17 bn kWh, primarily generated by hydropower plants. The country's energy capacity is 5,757 MW, with 87.5% coming from hydropower and only 12.4% from combined heat and power (CHP) plants. This extensive hydropower capacity supports the increase in electricity-powered vehicles, reducing the country's reliance on oil imports and contributing to lower emissions. Electric vehicles, which are quieter and have no exhaust emissions compared to internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles, offer a sustainable alternative that aligns with global trends toward greener transportation options.", "summary": "<a href=\"https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vZGFyeW8udXovZW4vMjAyNC8wNi8wOS90YWppa2lzdGFuc3RheGktY29tcGFuaWVzLXRvLWZ1bGx5LXRyYW5zaXRpb24tdG8tZXYtYnktMjAyNdIBAA?oc=5\" target=\"_blank\">Tajikistan's taxi companies to fully transition to EV by 2025</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color=\"#6f6f6f\">DARYO.UZ - CENTRAL ASIA & AFGHANISTAN NEWS</font>", "url": "https://daryo.uz/en/2024/06/09/tajikistanstaxi-companies-to-fully-transition-to-ev-by-2025", "image": "https://daryo.uz/static/2024/06/medium-6665b1e3ca89a.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 15:18:45", "author": "Daryo.uz", "authors": ["Daryo.uz"], "language": "en", "source_country": "uz", "sentiment": 0.062}

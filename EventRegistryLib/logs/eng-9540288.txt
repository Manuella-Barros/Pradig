Meanwhile, when a tractor carrying illegal sand was stopped, the tractor driver crushed Bagri and jumped out of the vehicle and ran away. ASI Mahendra Bagri died after being hit by a tractor. The rampant sand mafia puts the law and order situation of the state under question.\n\nJitu Patwari condemns murder\n\nIn response to the tragic alleged murder of an Assistant Sub-Inspector (ASI) by the sand mafia in Bhopal, Madhya Pradesh Congress President Jitendra Patwari addressed the media, denouncing the state government for what he described as a trifecta of issues: debt, crime, and corruption.\n\nPatwari emphasized, \"I have been reiterating this fact consistently - Madhya Pradesh is under the grip of 'Karz, crime, and corruption'. It's distressing to witness an ASI losing his life under such circumstances. According to NCRB data, there are 17 reported rapes daily in the state. Whenever I raise these concerns, they respond by filing FIRs against me, attempting to instill fear. But the blood of Congress runs through my veins; I refuse to be intimidated.\"\n\nAbout 5 months ago, a similar case had come to light in Shahdol, when the sand mining mafia had crushed a revenuye inspector (patwari) to death with a tractor. Patwari Prasanna Singh, posted at Khadda in Beohari tehsil, died on the spot. Prasanna Singh was a retired army man, who had joined the job of Patwari after retirement.", "source": {"uri": "centralchronicle.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Central Chronicle"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bagri_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bagri language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shahdol_district", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Shahdol district"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archaeological_Survey_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Archaeological Survey of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tractor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tractor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jitu_Patwari", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jitu Patwari"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sand_theft", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sand theft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhopal", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bhopal"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bhopal"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sand", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_rupee", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indian rupee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Police officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madhya_Pradesh", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Madhya Pradesh"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Madhya Pradesh"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illegal_mining", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Illegal mining"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Village_accountant", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Village accountant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constable", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Constable"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corruption", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Corruption"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beohari", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Beohari"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beohari"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_information_report", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "First information report"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_governments_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "State governments of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_National_Congress", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indian National Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Crime_Records_Bureau", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Crime Records Bureau"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tehsil", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tehsil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sand_mining", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sand mining"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rape"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Unsolved", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Unsolved", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://www.centralchronicle.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/cropped-c306f181-6037-4a88-aff4-a2afd61a89b3.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9540288", "eventUri": "eng-9540288", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.4352941176470588, "wgt": 193, "relevance": 1}

Authorities have announced a reward of \u20b930,000 for information leading to his arrest.\n\nA case has been registered against the accused under Section 302 (murder) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and provisions of the Mines Act. Superintendent of police Kumar Prateek and additional director general of police, Shahdol zone, DC Sagar, confirmed the incident and the ongoing investigation.\n\nThe incident has also sparked controversy due to the alleged improper handling of Bagri's body during the postmortem at Byahari Civil Hospital.\n\nA policeman, speaking on the condition of anonymity, claimed that the ASI's body was placed on the floor during the procedure, showing disrespect for his sacrifice while on duty. Byahari SDM Narendra Singh Dhurve stated that the matter is being investigated.\n\nThis incident follows a similar case in December last year, where a revenue department official (Patwari) was killed by illegal sand miners in the Shahdol district.\n\nALSO READ | Why sand mining in Chambal is not right\n\nThe world uses up 50 billion tonnes of sand every year, a 2022 UN Environment Programme (UNEP) found, enough to build a wall 27 metres wide and 27 metres high around planet Earth.\n\nSand is the second most used resource worldwide after water, and in India, it is mined illegally in several states. Between 2019 and 2022, according to a report by Down to Earth, some 39 people including police and activists were killed for exposing or acting against illegal mining operations across the country.\n\nExperts have warned that extracting sand where it plays an active role, such as rivers, and coastal or marine ecosystems, can lead to erosion, salination of aquifers, loss of protection against storm surges and impact on biodiversity, which pose a threat to livelihoods through, among other things, water supply, food production, fisheries, or to the tourism industry.", "source":

Suddenly, a man \"wearing an army jacket and a ski cap came towards us,\u201d she says in a clip of the June 9 episode of PEOPLE Magazine Investigates: Surviving a Serial Killer, airing on ID at 9 p.m. ET and streaming on Max. (The clip is shown below.) \u201cHe pulled out a gun and I lost it,\u201d says Fann, who was 18 when she and Coates, 22, were approached. Now 61, Fann goes in depth on the harrowing attack at the hands of the infamous Cook brothers on the newest episode of People Magazine Investigates: Surviving a Serial KIller. During the episode, titled \"Surviving the Cook Brothers,\" Fann returns to the very spot where she first saw Anthony Cook, one of the most dangerous serial killers in U.S. history. \u201cI can still see him standing there,\u201d she says in the episode. Raped by both men and then shot in the back, Fann is one of the few victims who survived being attacked by Anthony Cook and his brother, Nathaniel Cook in the early 1980s in Toledo. During their reign of terror, the brothers stalked at least six young couples and one 12-year-old girl. They raped the females and in many cases, killed the victims. For Fann, who was in the hospital for three weeks after the shooting and has undergone more than 20 surgeries because of it, she will never forget the horror she felt that night.

Fann and Coates offered the man their rings and his wallet, hoping he would let them go. \"I kept looking at his face,\" she says. \"He said, 'Don't look at me.'\" Then, she says, \"He pointed the gun right at my head.\" \"He handed us two ski caps and said, 'Put these on and I will be behind you.' And then he had us walk. I started panicking. And then he took us down this alley.\" A little bit after Anthony had appeared with a gun, his brother stepped forward out of the shadows. The chilling episode details what happened to other victims of the Cook brothers \u2014 and how the killers were finally caught.

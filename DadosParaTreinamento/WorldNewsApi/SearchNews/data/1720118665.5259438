Food expert Marzia, who is known online as Little Spice Jar, has revealed three simple steps to up your roastie game \u2013 and you'll never look back. Don't worry, you don't need any fancy equipment or utensils for this recipe \u2013 just two ingredients (along with your potatoes) which you can easily pick up from the supermarket for a couple of quid. So, let's get cooking! \"The first tip is to use the right potato,\" the foodie said in a recent TikTok video. You want something starchy like a Russet potato, which makes them extra crispy in the oven. \"The second thing you want to do is boil your potatoes in alkaline water and we do this by simply adding baking soda to the water while the potatoes are boiling \u2013 this breaks down the surface of the potatoes and gives them more nooks and crannies that brown up in the oven.\" If you haven't got any lying around your kitchen cupboard, you can pick up baking soda from a slew of online retailers at supermarkets. For example, Aldi is currently selling a 200g tub for just 65p. Marzia also recommends using ghee or duck fat rather than butter as they have a 'higher smoking point'. \"This allows them to cook for a longer period of time at a higher temperature without burning,\" she added. \"The longer you roast the potato the crispier it gets.\" The foodie brushes garlic butter over the potatoes after cooking for a boost of flavour, but this is of course optional.

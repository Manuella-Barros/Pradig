Earlier this year, she told the BBC that \u201cI\u2019ve got to figure out a way to make 150,000 people feel like they\u2019re in a small little nightclub.\u201d She went on to say \u201cThat\u2019s the goal, and if there\u2019s one place to do it, it\u2019s gotta be Glasto.\u201d In preparation for Glastonbury 2024, Dua Lipa has been rehearsing with her team of dancers in Birmingham. It is expected that her headline show on the Pyramid stage will begin tonight at 10pm BST and end at around 11.45pm. As for whether anyone will be joining her on stage as a special guest, there are rumours that it could be \u201880s icon Cyndi Lauper, but fans will just have to wait and see\u2026 We may only be half way through 2024 but it is already shaping up to be quite the year for Dua Lipa. She was named one of Time\u2019s 100 most influential people of 2024 and is still only 28 years old. She has three Grammys and picked up her seventh Brit award in March. The lead single, Houdini from her third studio album, Radical Optimism, peaked at No 2 in the UK singles chart. As if dominating the music world wasn\u2019t enough, Dua Lipa made her acting debut with a cameo in Barbie last year and starred in Matthew Vaughn\u2019s spy movie Argylle. She is also one of the most listened-to-female artists on Spotify, and her song Dance the Night was not only on the Barbie soundtrack, but it became her fourth No 1 single. So, with all her success, just how much is Dua Lipa worth? According to The Sunday Times Rich List, Dua is worth a cool \u00a390 million compared to \u00a375 million in 2023. Her parents, Dukagjin and mother Anesa lived in Pristina in Kosovo but had to leave in 1992 due to political instability and moved to the UK where Dua was born in 1995.", "summary": "<p>Dua Lipa along with Harry Styles was named in Sunday Times first 40 under 40 Rich List.</p>", "url": "https://www.edinburghnews.scotsman.com/read-this/glastonbury-2024-as-dua-lipa-is-the-headliner-for-the-pyramid-stage-tonight-how-much-is-she-worth-4683924", "image": "https://www.edinburghnews.scotsman.com/jpim-static/2024/06/28/13/22/Dua-Lipa-along-with-Harry-Styles-was-named-in-Sunday-Times-first-40-under-40-Rich-List.jpg?width=1200&enable=upscale", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 04:49:24", "author": "Marina Licht", "authors": ["Marina Licht"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": 0.257}

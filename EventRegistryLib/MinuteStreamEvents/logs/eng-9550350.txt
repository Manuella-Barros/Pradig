This latest incident follows a similar accident that occurred last month in Srinagar City, highlighting the dangers of crossing the river due to infrastructure shortcomings.\n\nSeven of the labourers, all non-locals, were rescued by swift action from local residents. However, despite immediate search and rescue efforts by the State Disaster Response Force (SDRF), police, and local volunteers, the two remaining individuals have not yet been found.\n\nThis incident comes just weeks after a boat capsized in Srinagar's Gandbal area, claiming the lives of seven people, including two children and their mother, when a boat overturned in the fast-flowing waters of Jehlum.\n\nThese frequent tragedies have exposed the vulnerabilities of those who rely on the boats to cross the Jhelum River, particularly in areas where bridges and safe crossings are lacking. Residents have expressed frustration over the slow progress of infrastructure projects, such as a footbridge that has been under construction for nearly a decade near the site of the Gandbal accident.\n\nThe recent spate of boat capsizing incidents has plunged the Kashmir Valley into mourning, with reignited calls for improved safety measures and expedited infrastructure development to prevent such tragedies from recurring.", "source": {"uri": "news9live.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News9live"}, "authors": [{"uri": "junaid_dar@news9live.com", "name": "Junaid Dar", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jhelum_River", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jhelum River"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Awantipora", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Awantipora"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kashmir", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kashmir"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Srinagar", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Srinagar"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Srinagar"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/States_and_union_territories_of_India", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "States and union territories of India"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kashmir_Valley", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kashmir Valley"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Boating", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Boating", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Boating/Wooden_Boats", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Boating/Wooden Boats", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Classifieds/Watercraft", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Classifieds/Watercraft", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 74}], "image": "https://images.news9live.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Kashmir.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550350", "eventUri": "eng-9550350", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 170, "relevance": 1}

Further updates on the incident are awaited as rescue operations continue.\n\nIn a tragic incident in Pulwama, Jammu and Kashmir, a boat carrying nine individuals capsized in the river Jhelum. Of the nine passengers aboard, seven have been successfully rescued, while two individuals remain missing. Rescue operations are currently underway in full force to locate and save the missing individuals amidst challenging conditions.\n\nEarlier in April, in a devastating incident, six individuals, including four children, lost their lives, and 10 others remain missing after a boat capsized in the swollen Jhelum river in Srinagar. The catastrophe occurred when the boat collided with a pillar of an under-construction bridge, causing it to overturn.\n\nThe boat, which was carrying over 20 passengers, primarily children on their way to school, encountered tragedy when the rope used to cross the river snapped. Heavy rains in the region over the past few days had led to a surge in water levels in the river, exacerbating the perilous conditions.\n\nExpressing anguish over the incident, locals highlighted concerns regarding the prolonged construction of the bridge, which has been ongoing for over a decade. Many believe that if the bridge had been completed, the accident could have been averted, as boats are the primary mode of transport across the river.\n\nThe state disaster relief force has initiated a rescue operation to locate the missing passengers, with senior officials from the administration and police overseeing the efforts on the ground. Despite the challenging circumstances, rescue teams are working tirelessly to locate and save those still missing.\n\nIn addition to the tragic incident, the Jammu-Srinagar National Highway faced closures due to landslides triggered by the heavy rains, further disrupting transportation in the region.

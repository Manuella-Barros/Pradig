The Nikkei closed down 4,451.28 points at 31,458.42. The market's broader TOPIX index fell 12.8% as selling picked up in the afternoon. Darkening the outlook for trading on Wall Street, early Monday the future for the S&P 500 was 2.4% lower and that for the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 2.6%. A report showing hiring by U.S. employers slowed last month by much more than expected has convulsed financial markets, vanquishing the euphoria that had taken the Nikkei to all-times highs of over 42,000 in recent weeks. The Nikkei 225 dropped 5.8% on Friday, making this its worst two-day decline ever. Its worst single-day rout was a plunge of 3,836 points, or 14.9%, on Oct. 20, 1987, a day that was dubbed \"Black Monday.\"\u009d This Monday was gloomy enough: at one point, the benchmark sank as much as 13.4%. Share prices have fallen in Tokyo since the Bank of Japan raised its benchmark interest rate on Wednesday. The Nikkei is now down 3.8% from a year ago. One factor driving the BOJ to raise rates was prolonged weakness in the Japanese yen, which has pushed inflation to above the central bank's 2% inflation target. Early Monday, the dollar was trading at 142.59 yen, down from 146.45 late Friday and sharply below its level of over 160 yen a few weeks ago. The euro fell to $1.0914 from $1.0923. Shares surged to stratospheric heights earlier this year on frenzied buying of stock in companies expected to thrive thanks to advances in artificial intelligence. The latest setback has hit markets heavily weighted toward computer chipmakers like Samsung Electronics and other technology shares: on Monday, South Korea's Kospi plummeted more than 9% as Samsung's shares sank 11.6%. It closed 8.8% lower at 2,441.55. Taiwan's Taiex also crumbled, losing 8.4% as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., the world's biggest chip maker, dropped 9.8%. Stocks began tumbling in earnest on Friday after weaker than expected data on U.S. jobs fanned worries that high interest rates meant to tame inflation might push the U.S. economy into a recession. \"To put it mildly, the spike in volatility-of-volatility is a spectacle that underlines just how jittery markets have become,\"\u009d Stephen Innes of SPI Asset Management said in a commentary. \"The real question now looms: Can the typical market reflex to sell volatility or buy the market dip prevail over the deep-seated anxiety brought on by this sudden and sharp recession scare?\"\u009d The VIX, an index that measures how worried investors are about upcoming drops for the S&P 500, was up about 26% as of early Monday. Bitcoin which recently had surged to nearly $70,000, was down 14% at $54,155.00. Oil prices slipped, with U.S. benchmark crude oil giving up 74 cents to $72.78 per barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, lost 67 cents to $76.14 per barrel. Investors will be watching for data on the U.S. services sector from the U.S. Institute for Supply Management due later Monday that may help determine if the sell-offs around the world are an overreaction, Yeap Jun Rong of IG said in a report. Even though worries over weakness in the U.S. economy and volatile markets have rippled around the world, the U.S. economy is still growing, and a recession is far from a certainty. But the mood was decidedly dark. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index lost 2.2% to 16,579.97 and the S&P/ASX 200 in Australia declined 3.7% to 7,649.60. The Shanghai Composite index, which is somewhat insulated by capital controls from other world markets, edged higher but then gave way, losing 1.5% to 2,862.56. The S&P 500's 1.8% decline Friday was its first back-to-back loss of at least 1% since April. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 1.5%, and the Nasdaq composite fell 2.4%, taking it to 10% below its record set last month.

By about an hour after trading began, the index was down 5.3%, or about 1,900 points, at 34,010.69.\n\nStocks tumbled Friday on worries the U.S. economy could be cracking under the weight of high interest rates meant to tame inflation.\n\nA report showing hiring by U.S. employers slowed last month by much more than expected has convulsed financial markets, vanquishing the euphoria that had taken the Nikkei to all-times highs of over 42,000 in recent weeks.\n\nThe S&P 500 sank 1.8% on Friday for its first back-to-back losses of at least 1% since April. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 610 points, or 1.5%, and the Nasdaq composite fell 2.4% as stocks retreated around the world and back to Wall Street.\n\nThe rout began just a couple days after U.S. stock indexes had jumped to their best day in months after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell gave the clearest indication yet that inflation has slowed enough for cuts to rates to begin in September.\n\nNow, worries are rising the Fed may have kept its main interest rate at a two-decade high for too long, raising risks of a recession in the world's largest economy. A rate cut would make it easier for U.S. households and companies to borrow money and boost the economy, but it could take months to a year for the full effects to filter through.\n\nWorries over weakness in the U.S. economy and volatile markets have rippled around the world, even though the U.S. economy is still growing, and a recession is far from a certainty.\n\nThe Nikkei 225 dropped 5.8% on Friday. It has struggled since the Bank of Japan raised its benchmark interest rate on Wednesday. The hike pushed up the value of the Japanese yen against the U.S. dollar, which could hurt profits for exporters and deflate a boom in tourism.\n\nEarly Monday, the dollar was trading at 145.50 yen. That's sharply below its level of over 160 yen a few weeks ago.\n\nChinese stocks fell Friday as investors registered disappointment with the government's latest efforts to spur growth through various piecemeal measures, instead of hoped-for infusions of broader stimulus, while stock indexes dropped by more than 1% across much of Europe.", "source": {"uri": "aol.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Aol"}, "authors": [{"uri": "elaine_kurtenbach@aol.com", "name": "Elaine Kurtenbach", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikkei_225", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nikkei 225"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Nikkei", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "The Nikkei"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Economy of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_market_index", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stock market index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangkok", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bangkok"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bangkok"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Thailand"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasdaq", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nasdaq"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chair_of_the_Federal_Reserve", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chair of the Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerome_Powell", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jerome Powell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S&P_500_Index", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "S&P 500 Index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wall Street"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Financial market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dow_Jones_Industrial_Average", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dow Jones Industrial Average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recession", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Recession"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_Japan", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bank of Japan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_yen", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Japanese yen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulus_(economics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stimulus (economics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States dollar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Research_and_Analysis", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Research and Analysis", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day_Trading", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day Trading", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Education_and_Training", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Education and Training", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/3TmirRoGPhh.D95lf7jIbA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/aol_associated_press_484/79ba121b459934b76ef6ec0b713b3ec3", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9790475", "eventUri": "eng-9790475", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 231, "relevance": 1}

The market's broader TOPIX index fell 12.8% as selling picked up in the afternoon.\n\nA report that showed hiring by US employers slowed last month by much more than expected has convulsed financial markets, countering the euphoria that had taken the Nikkei to all-times highs of over 42,000 in recent weeks.\n\nThe Nikkei 225 dropped 5.8% on Friday, making this its worst two-day decline ever.\n\nIts worst single-day rout was a plunge of 3,836 points, or 14.9%, on a day dubbed \"Black Monday\" in October 1987. At one point, the benchmark sank as much as 13.4% on Monday.\n\nShare prices have fallen in Tokyo since the Bank of Japan raised its benchmark interest rate on Wednesday. The Nikkei is now down 3.8% from a year ago.\n\nEuropean markets also opened lower on Monday, with Germany's DAX down 2.3% at 17,267.00. The CAC 40 in Paris lost 1.9% to 7,114.33 and the FTSE 100 in London was 2.1% lower at 8,004.19.\n\nDarkening the outlook for trading on Wall Street, early on Monday the future for the S&P 500 was 2.5% lower and that for the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 1.6%.\n\nShare prices have fallen in Tokyo since the Bank of Japan (BoJ) raised its benchmark interest rate on Wednesday. The Nikkei is now down 3.8% from a year ago.\n\nOne factor driving the BoJ to raise rates was prolonged weakness in the Japanese yen, which has pushed inflation to above the central bank's 2% inflation target.\n\nEarly on Monday, the dollar was trading at 142.37 yen (187.6 yen to the pound), down from 146.45 late on Friday and sharply below its level of more than 160 yen a few weeks ago.\n\nThe euro fell to 1.0896 dollars from 1.0923.\n\nShares surged to stratospheric heights earlier this year on frenzied buying of shares in companies expected to thrive thanks to advances in artificial intelligence.\n\nThe latest setback has hit markets heavily weighted toward computer chipmakers like Samsung Electronics and other technology shares: on Monday, South Korea's Kospi plummeted 9.3% as Samsung's shares sank 11.6%.\n\nTaiwan's Taiex also crumbled, losing 8.4% as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co, the world's biggest chip maker, dropped 9.8%.\n\nStocks tumbled around the world on Friday after weaker than expected employment data fuelled worries the US economy could be cracking under the weight of high interest rates meant to tame inflation.\n\nEarly on Monday, the future for the S&P 500 was 1.5% lower and that for the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.7%.\n\nStephen Innes of SPI Asset Management, said: \"To put it mildly, the spike in volatility-of-volatility is a spectacle that underlines just how jittery markets have become.\n\n\"The real question now looms: Can the typical market reflex to sell volatility or buy the market dip prevail over the deep-seated anxiety brought on by this sudden and sharp recession scare?\"\n\nThe VIX, an index that measures how worried investors are about upcoming drops for the S&P 500, was up 105% early on Monday. Bitcoin, which recently had surged to nearly 70,000 dollars, was down 17% at 52,100.00 dollars.\n\nOil prices slipped, with US benchmark crude oil giving up 1.41 dollars to 72.11 dollars per barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, lost 1.35 dollars to 75.46 dollars per barrel.\n\nYeap Jun Rong of IG said investors will be watching for data on the American services sector from the US Institute for Supply Management due later on Monday that may help determine if the sell-offs around the world are an overreaction.\n\nWorries over weakness in the US economy and volatile markets have rippled around the world, even though the US economy is still growing, and a recession is far from a certainty.\n\nElsewhere in Asia, Hong Kong's Hang Seng index lost 2.5% to 16,519.78 and the S&P/ASX 200 in Australia declined 3.8% to 7,637.40.\n\nThe Shanghai Composite index, which is somewhat insulated by capital controls from other world markets, edged higher but then gave way, losing 1.2% to 2,870.34.\n\nThe S&P 500's 1.8% decline on Friday was its first back-to-back loss of at least 1% since April. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 1.5%, and the Nasdaq composite fell 2.4%.\n\nFriday's losses dragged the Nasdaq composite 10% below its record set last month. That level of drop is what traders call a \"correction\".\n\nThe rout began just a couple days after US stock indexes had jumped to their best day in months after US Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell gave the clearest indication yet that inflation has slowed enough for cuts to rates to begin in September.\n\nNow, worries are rising the Fed may have kept its main interest rate at a two-decade high for too long, raising risks of a recession in the world's largest economy.\n\nA rate cut would make it easier for US households and companies to borrow money and boost the economy, but it could take months to a year for the full effects to filter through.\n\nTan Boon Heng of Mizuho Bank in Singapore said in a report: \"Specifically, the scenario of higher unemployment constraining spending and further restraining hiring and incomes and economic activity leading to a recession is the feared scenario here.\"", "source": {"uri": "irishnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The

The market's broader TOPIX index fell 12.8% as selling picked up in the afternoon.\n\nEuropean markets opened lower, with Germany's DAX down 2.5% at 17,222.69. The CAC 40 in Paris lost 2.4% to 7,080.96 and the FTSE 100 in London was 2% lower at 8,011.52.\n\nDarkening the outlook for trading on Wall Street, early Monday the future for the S&P 500 was 2.5% lower and that for the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 1.6%.\n\nA report showing hiring by U.S. employers slowed last month by much more than expected has convulsed financial markets, vanquishing the euphoria that had taken the Nikkei to all-time highs of over 42,000 in recent weeks.\n\nStock markets have mostly been traveling in one direction, higher, with relatively few huge swings in the past year. A bonanza around artificial intelligence technology helped drive Big Tech stocks higher, while other areas of the market held up amid rising hopes for coming cuts to interest rates by the Federal Reserve. But professional investors have been warning that shakier times may be ahead given uncertainty about how quickly the Fed will cut interest rates and other big questions.\n\nThe Nikkei 225 dropped 5.8% on Friday, making this its worst two-day decline ever. Its worst single-day rout was a plunge of 3,836 points, or 14.9%, on Oct. 19, 1987, a global markets crash that was dubbed \"Black Monday\" but proved to be only a temporary setback despite fears it might have augured a worldwide downturn.\n\nThis Monday was gloomy enough: at one point, the benchmark sank as much as 13.4%.\n\nShare prices have fallen in Tokyo since the Bank of Japan raised its benchmark interest rate on Wednesday. The Nikkei is now down 3.8% from a year ago.\n\nOne factor driving the BOJ to raise rates was the prolonged weakness in the Japanese yen, which has pushed inflation to above the central bank's 2% inflation target. Early Monday, the dollar was trading at 142.59 yen, down from 146.45 late Friday and sharply below its level of over 160 yen a few weeks ago.\n\nThe euro fell to $1.0914 from $1.0923.\n\nThe latest setback has hit markets heavily weighted toward computer chipmakers like Samsung Electronics and other technology shares: on Monday, South Korea's Kospi plummeted more than 9% as Samsung's shares sank 10.3%. It closed 8.8% lower at 2,441.55.\n\nTaiwan's Taiex also crumbled, losing 8.4% as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., the world's biggest chip maker, dropped 9.8%.\n\nStocks began tumbling in earnest on Friday after the weaker-than-expected data on U.S. jobs fanned worries that high interest rates might push the U.S. economy into a recession.\n\n\"To put it mildly, the spike in volatility-of-volatility is a spectacle that underlines just how jittery markets have become,\" Stephen Innes of SPI Asset Management said in a commentary. \"The real question now looms: Can the typical market reflex to sell volatility or buy the market dip prevail over the deep-seated anxiety brought on by this sudden and sharp recession scare?\"\n\nThe VIX, an index that measures how worried investors are about upcoming drops for the S&P 500, was up about 26% as of early Monday. Bitcoin which recently had surged to nearly $70,000, was down 14% at $54,155.00.\n\nOil prices slipped, with U.S. benchmark crude oil giving up 74 cents to $72.78 per barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, lost 67 cents to $76.14 per barrel.\n\nInvestors will be watching for data on the U.S. services sector from the U.S. Institute for Supply Management due later Monday that may help determine if the sell-offs around the world are an overreaction, Yeap Jun Rong of IG said in a report.\n\nEven though worries over weakness in the U.S. economy and volatile markets have rippled around the world, the U.S. economy is still growing, and a recession is far from a certainty.\n\nBut the mood was decidedly dark.\n\nHong Kong's Hang Seng index lost 2.2% to 16,579.97 and the S&P/ASX 200 in Australia declined 3.7% to 7,649.60.\n\nThe Shanghai Composite index, which is somewhat insulated by capital controls from other world markets, edged higher but then gave way, losing 1.5% to 2,862.56.\n\nThe S&P 500's 1.8% decline Friday was its first back-to-back loss of at least 1% since April. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 1.5%, and the Nasdaq composite fell 2.4%, taking it to 10% below its record set last month. That level of drop is what traders call a \"correction.\"\n\nThe rout began just a couple of days after U.S. stock indexes had jumped to their best day in months after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell gave the clearest indication yet that inflation has slowed enough for cuts to rates to begin in September.\n\nNow, worries are rising the Fed may have kept its main interest rate at a two-decade high for too long, raising risks of a recession in the world's largest economy. A rate cut would make it easier for U.S. households and companies to borrow money and boost the economy, but it could take months to a year for the full effects to filter through.\n\n\"Specifically, the scenario of higher unemployment constraining spending and further restraining hiring and incomes and economic activity leading to a recession is the feared scenario here,\" Tan Boon Heng of Mizuho

The market's broader TOPIX index fell 12.8% as selling picked up in the afternoon.\n\nDarkening the outlook for trading on Wall Street, early Monday the future for the S&P 500 was 2.4% lower and that for the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 2.6%.\n\nA report showing hiring by U.S. employers slowed last month by much more than expected has convulsed financial markets, vanquishing the euphoria that had taken the Nikkei to all-times highs of over 42,000 in recent weeks, according to the Associated Press (AP).\n\nThe Nikkei 225 dropped 5.8% on Friday, making this its worst two-day decline ever. Its worst single-day rout was a plunge of 3,836 points, or 14.9%, on Oct. 20, 1987, a day that was dubbed \"Black Monday.\" This Monday was gloomy enough: at one point, the benchmark sank as much as 13.4%.\n\nShare prices have fallen in Tokyo since the Bank of Japan raised its benchmark interest rate on Wednesday. The Nikkei is now down 3.8% from a year ago.\n\nOne factor driving the BOJ to raise rates was prolonged weakness in the Japanese yen, which has pushed inflation to above the central bank's 2% inflation target. Early Monday, the dollar was trading at 142.59 yen, down from 146.45 late Friday and sharply below its level of over 160 yen a few weeks ago.\n\nThe euro fell to $1.0914 from $1.0923.\n\nShares surged to stratospheric heights earlier this year on frenzied buying of stock in companies expected to thrive thanks to advances in artificial intelligence. The latest setback has hit markets heavily weighted toward computer chipmakers like Samsung Electronics and other technology shares: on Monday, South Korea's Kospi plummeted more than 9% as Samsung's shares sank 11.6%. It closed 8.8% lower at 2,441.55.\n\nTaiwan's Taiex also crumbled, losing 8.4% as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., the world's biggest chip maker, dropped 9.8%.\n\nStocks began tumbling in earnest on Friday after weaker than expected data on U.S. jobs fanned worries that high interest rates meant to tame inflation might push the U.S. economy into a recession.\n\nThe VIX, an index that measures how worried investors are about upcoming drops for the S&P 500, was up about 26% as of early Monday. Bitcoin which recently had surged to nearly $70,000, was down 14% at $54,155.00.\n\nOil prices slipped, with U.S. benchmark crude oil giving up 74 cents to $72.78 per barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, lost 67 cents to $76.14 per barrel.\n\nInvestors will be watching for data on the U.S. services sector from the U.S. Institute for Supply Management due later Monday that may help determine if the sell-offs around the world are an overreaction, Yeap Jun Rong of IG said in a report.\n\nEven though worries over weakness in the U.S. economy and volatile markets have rippled around the world, the U.S. economy is still growing, and a recession is far from a certainty.\n\nBut the mood was decidedly dark.\n\nHong Kong's Hang Seng index lost 2.2% to 16,579.97 and the S&P/ASX 200 in Australia declined 3.7% to 7,649.60.\n\nThe Shanghai Composite index, which is somewhat insulated by capital controls from other world markets, edged higher but then gave way, losing 1.5% to 2,862.56.\n\nThe S&P 500's 1.8% decline Friday was its first back-to-back loss of at least 1% since April.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 1.5%, and the Nasdaq composite fell 2.4%, taking it to 10% below its record set last month. That level of drop is what traders call a \"correction.\"\n\nThe rout began just a couple days after U.S. stock indexes had jumped to their best day in months after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell gave the clearest indication yet that inflation has slowed enough for cuts to rates to begin in September.\n\nNow, worries are rising the Fed may have kept its main interest rate at a two-decade high for too long, raising risks of a recession in the world's largest economy. A rate cut would make it easier for U.S. households and companies to borrow money and boost the economy, but it could take months to a year for the full effects to filter through.\n\n\"Specifically, the scenario of higher unemployment constraining spending and further restraining hiring and incomes and economic activity leading to a recession is the feared scenario here,\" Tan Boon Heng of Mizuho

The market's broader TOPIX index fell 12.8% as selling picked up in the afternoon.\n\nA report Friday showing hiring by U.S. employers slowed last month by much more than expected has convulsed financial markets, vanquishing the euphoria that had taken the Nikkei to all-times highs of over 42,000 in recent weeks.\n\nStocks tumbled around the world after the employment data fanned worries the U.S. economy could be cracking under the weight of high interest rates meant to tame inflation. Early Monday, the future for the S&P 500 was 1.5% lower and Dow Jones Industrial Average futures were down 0.7%.\n\n\"To put it mildly, the spike in volatility-of-volatility is a spectacle that underlines just how jittery markets have become,\" Stephen Innes of SPI Asset Management said in a commentary. \"The real question now looms: Can the typical market reflex to sell volatility or buy the market dip prevail over the deep-seated anxiety brought on by this sudden and sharp recession scare?\"\n\nWorries over the U.S. economy were rippling around the world even though the U.S. economy is still growing and a recession is far from a certainty.\n\nThe S&P 500's 1.8% decline Friday was its first back-to-back loss of at least 1% since April. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 1.5% and the Nasdaq composite fell 2.4%.\n\nFriday's losses dragged the Nasdaq composite 10% below its record set last month. That level of drop is what traders call a \"correction.\"\n\nThe rout began just a couple days after U.S. stock indexes had jumped to their best day in months after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell gave the clearest indication yet that inflation has slowed enough for cuts to rates to begin in September.\n\nNow, worries are rising the Fed may have kept its main interest rate at a two-decade high for too long, raising risks of a recession in the world's largest economy. A rate cut would make it easier for U.S. households and companies to borrow money and boost the economy, but it could take months to a year for the full effects to filter through.\n\n\"Specifically, the scenario of higher unemployment constraining spending and further restraining hiring and incomes and economic activity leading to a recession is the feared scenario here,\" Tan Boon Heng of Mizuho Bank in Singapore said in a report.\n\nInvestors will be watching for data on the U.S. services sector from the U.S. Institute for Supply Management due later Monday that may help determine if the selloffs around the world are an overreaction, Yeap Jun Rong of IG said in a report.\n\nThe Nikkei 225 dropped 5.8% on Friday, making this its worst two-day decline ever. Its worst single-day rout was a plunge of 3,836 points, or 14.9%, on a day dubbed \"Black Monday\" in October 1987. At one point, the benchmark sank as much as 13.4% on Monday.\n\nShare prices have fallen in Tokyo since the Bank of Japan raised its benchmark interest rate on Wednesday. The Nikkei is now down 3.8% from a year ago.\n\nOne factor driving the BOJ to raise rates was prolonged weakness in the Japanese yen, which has pushed inflation to above the central bank's 2% inflation target. Early Monday, the dollar was trading at 142.39 yen, down from 146.45 late Friday and sharply below its level of over 160 yen a few weeks ago.\n\nThe euro fell to $1.0896 from $1.0923.\n\nShares surged to stratospheric heights earlier this year on frenzied buying of shares in companies expected to thrive thanks to advances in artificial intelligence. The latest setback has hit markets heavily weighted toward computer chipmakers like Samsung Electronics and other technology shares: On Monday, South Korea's Kospi plummeted 9.3% as Samsung's shares sank 11.6%.\n\nTaiwan's Taiex also crumbled, losing 8.4% as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., the world's biggest chip maker, dropped 9.8%.\n\nOil prices were little changed. U.S. benchmark crude oil gained 9 cents to $73.61 per barrel while Brent crude was flat at $76.81 per barrel.\n\nElsewhere in Asia, Hong Kong's Hang Seng index lost 2.5% to 16,519.78 and the S&P/ASX 200 in Australia declined 3.8% to 7,637.40.\n\nThe Shanghai Composite index, which is somewhat insulated by capital controls from other world markets, edged higher but then gave way, losing 1.2% to

By the time of the Tokyo market's midday break, the index was down about 5.5%, or about 1,900 points, at 33,945.43.\n\nAlso Read | US Presidential Election 2024: Kamala Harris Declines Donald Trump's Offer To Shift Presidential Debate to Fox News.\n\nThe market's broader TOPIX index fell as much as 7.8% before recovering to trade down 6.6%.\n\nStocks tumbled Friday on worries the US economy could be cracking under the weight of high interest rates meant to tame inflation.

Market heavyweight and computer chip maker Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. lost 5.3%.\n\nHong Kong's Hang Seng index lost 2.1% to 16,945.51 and the S&P/ASX 200 in Australia declined 1.3% to 7,725.40. South Korea's Kospi declined 3.4% to 2,570.64.\n\nOn Friday, the S&P 500 sank 1.8% for its first back-to-back losses of at least 1% since April. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 610 points, or 1.5%, and the Nasdaq composite fell 2.4% as stocks retreated around the world and back to Wall Street.\n\nFriday's losses for tech stocks dragged the Nasdaq composite 10% below its record set last month. That level of drop is what traders call a \"correction.\"\n\nThe rout began just a couple days after U.S. stock indexes had jumped to their best day in months after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell gave the clearest indication yet that inflation has slowed enough for cuts to rates to begin in September.\n\nNow, worries are rising the Fed may have kept its main interest rate at a two-decade high for too long, raising risks of a recession in the world's largest economy.

It has struggled since the Bank of Japan raised its benchmark interest rate on Wednesday and is now at about the level it was when the year began.\n\nThe sell-offs on Friday and Monday were among the worst ever for the index, which saw its biggest rout during the market meltdowns of Black Monday in October 1987.\n\nThe modest rate hike, to just 0.25% from 0.1%, pushed up the value of the Japanese yen against the U.S. dollar, which could hurt profits for exporters and deflate a boom in tourism. But worries over the U.S. economy seem to be a larger factor driving investors to dump stocks.\n\nEarly Monday, the dollar was trading at 145.50 yen. That's sharply below its level of over 160 yen a few weeks ago.

It has struggled since the Bank of Japan raised its benchmark interest rate on Wednesday. The hike pushed up the value of the Japanese yen against the U.S. dollar, which could hurt profits for exporters and deflate a boom in tourism.\n\nEarly Monday, the dollar was trading at 145.50 yen.

The market's broader TOPIX index fell 12.8 per cent as selling picked up in the afternoon.\n\nDarkening the outlook for trading on Wall Street, early Monday the future for the S&P 500 was 2.4 per cent lower and that for the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 2.6 per cent.\n\nA report showing hiring by U.S. employers slowed last month by much more than expected has convulsed financial markets, vanquishing the euphoria that had taken the Nikkei to all-times highs of over 42,000 in recent weeks.\n\nThe Nikkei 225 dropped 5.8 per cent on Friday, making this its worst two-day decline ever. Its worst single-day rout was a plunge of 3,836 points, or 14.9 per cent, on Oct. 20, 1987, a day that was dubbed \"Black Monday.\" This Monday was gloomy enough: at one point, the benchmark sank as much as 13.4 per cent.\n\nShare prices have fallen in Tokyo since the Bank of Japan raised its benchmark interest rate on Wednesday. The Nikkei is now down 3.8 per cent from a year ago.\n\nOne factor driving the BOJ to raise rates was prolonged weakness in the Japanese yen, which has pushed inflation to above the central bank's 2 per cent inflation target. Early Monday, the dollar was trading at 142.59 yen, down from 146.45 late Friday and sharply below its level of over 160 yen a few weeks ago.\n\nThe euro fell to $1.0914 from $1.0923.\n\nShares surged to stratospheric heights earlier this year on frenzied buying of stock in companies expected to thrive thanks to advances in artificial intelligence. The latest setback has hit markets heavily weighted toward computer chipmakers like Samsung Electronics and other technology shares: on Monday, South Korea's Kospi plummeted more than 9 per cent as Samsung's shares sank 11.6 per cent . It closed 8.8 per cent lower at 2,441.55.\n\nTaiwan's Taiex also crumbled, losing 8.4 per cent as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., the world's biggest chip maker, dropped 9.8 per cent .\n\nStocks began tumbling in earnest on Friday after weaker than expected data on U.S. jobs fanned worries that high interest rates meant to tame inflation might push the U.S. economy into a recession.\n\n\"To put it mildly, the spike in volatility-of-volatility is a spectacle that underlines just how jittery markets have become,\" Stephen Innes of SPI Asset Management said in a commentary. \"The real question now looms: Can the typical market reflex to sell volatility or buy the market dip prevail over the deep-seated anxiety brought on by this sudden and sharp recession scare?\"\n\nThe VIX, an index that measures how worried investors are about upcoming drops for the S&P 500, was up about 26 per cent as of early Monday. Bitcoin which recently had surged to nearly $70,000, was down 14 per cent at $54,155.00.\n\nOil prices slipped, with U.S. benchmark crude oil giving up 74 cents to $72.78 per barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, lost 67 cents to $76.14 per barrel.\n\nInvestors will be watching for data on the U.S. services sector from the U.S. Institute for Supply Management due later Monday that may help determine if the sell-offs around the world are an overreaction, Yeap Jun Rong of IG said in a report.\n\nEven though worries over weakness in the U.S. economy and volatile markets have rippled around the world, the U.S. economy is still growing, and a recession is far from a certainty.\n\nBut the mood was decidedly dark.\n\nHong Kong's Hang Seng index lost 2.2% to 16,579.97 and the S&P/ASX 200 in Australia declined 3.7% to 7,649.60.\n\nThe Shanghai Composite index, which is somewhat insulated by capital controls from other world markets, edged higher but then gave way, losing 1.5% to 2,862.56.\n\nThe S&P 500's 1.8% decline Friday was its first back-to-back loss of at least 1% since April. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 1.5%, and the Nasdaq composite fell 2.4%, taking it to 10% below its record set last month. That level of drop is what traders call a \"correction.\"\n\nThe rout began just a couple days after U.S. stock indexes had jumped to their best day in months after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell gave the clearest indication yet that inflation has slowed enough for cuts to rates to begin in September.\n\nNow, worries are rising the Fed may have kept its main interest rate at a two-decade high for too long, raising risks of a recession in the world's largest economy.

The Nikkei is now down 3.8% from a year ago.\n\nOne factor driving the BoJ to raise rates was prolonged weakness in the Japanese yen, which has pushed inflation to above the central bank's 2% inflation target.\n\nEarly on Monday, the dollar was trading at 142.39 yen (187.6 yen to the pound), down from 146.45 late on Friday and sharply below its level of more than 160 yen a few weeks ago.\n\nThe euro fell to 1.0896 dollars from 1.0923.\n\nShares surged to stratospheric heights earlier this year on frenzied buying of shares in companies expected to thrive thanks to advances in artificial intelligence.\n\nThe latest setback has hit markets heavily weighted toward computer chipmakers like Samsung Electronics and other technology shares: on Monday, South Korea's Kospi plummeted 9.3% as Samsung's shares sank 11.6%.\n\nTaiwan's Taiex also crumbled, losing 8.4% as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co, the world's biggest chip maker, dropped 9.8%.\n\nStocks tumbled around the world on Friday after weaker than expected employment data fuelled worries the US economy could be cracking under the weight of high interest rates meant to tame inflation.\n\nEarly on Monday, the future for the S&P 500 was 1.5% lower and that for the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.7%.\n\nStephen Innes of SPI Asset Management, said: \"To put it mildly, the spike in volatility-of-volatility is a spectacle that underlines just how jittery markets have become.\n\n\"The real question now looms: Can the typical market reflex to sell volatility or buy the market dip prevail over the deep-seated anxiety brought on by this sudden and sharp recession scare?\"\n\nThe VIX, an index that measures how worried investors are about upcoming drops for the S&P 500, fell about 26% as of early Monday. Bitcoin which recently had surged to nearly 70,000 dollars, was down 14% at 54,155.00 dollars.\n\nOil prices were little changed. US benchmark crude oil gained nine cents to 73.61 dollars per barrel while Brent crude was flat at 76.81 dollars per barrel.\n\nYeap Jun Rong of IG said investors will be watching for data on the American services sector from the US Institute for Supply Management due later on Monday that may help determine if the sell-offs around the world are an overreaction.\n\nWorries over weakness in the US economy and volatile markets have rippled around the world, even though the US economy is still growing, and a recession is far from a certainty.\n\nElsewhere in Asia, Hong Kong's Hang Seng index lost 2.5% to 16,519.78 and the S&P/ASX 200 in Australia declined 3.8% to 7,637.40.\n\nThe Shanghai Composite index, which is somewhat insulated by capital controls from other world markets, edged higher but then gave way, losing 1.2% to 2,870.34.\n\nThe S&P 500's 1.8% decline on Friday was its first back-to-back loss of at least 1% since April. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 1.5%, and the Nasdaq composite fell 2.4%.\n\nFriday's losses dragged the Nasdaq composite 10% below its record set last month. That level of drop is what traders call a \"correction\".\n\nThe rout began just a couple days after US stock indexes had jumped to their best day in months after US Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell gave the clearest indication yet that inflation has slowed enough for cuts to rates to begin in September.\n\nNow, worries are rising the Fed may have kept its main interest rate at a two-decade high for too long, raising risks of a recession in the world's largest economy.\n\nA rate cut would make it easier for US households and companies to borrow money and boost the economy, but it could take months to a year for the full effects to filter through.\n\nTan Boon Heng of Mizuho Bank in Singapore said in a report: \"Specifically, the scenario of higher unemployment constraining spending and further restraining hiring and incomes and economic activity leading to a recession is the feared scenario here.\"", "source": {"uri": "irishexaminer.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

The market's broader TOPIX index fell 12.8 percent as selling picked up in the afternoon.\n\nDarkening the outlook for trading on Wall Street, early Monday the future for the S&P 500 was 2.4 percent lower and that for the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 2.6 percent.\n\nA report showing hiring by US employers slowed last month by much more than expected has convulsed financial markets, vanquishing the euphoria that had taken the Nikkei to all-times highs of over 42,000 in recent weeks.\n\nThe Nikkei 225 dropped 5.8 percent on Friday, making this its worst two-day decline ever. Its worst single-day rout was a plunge of 3,836 points, or 14.9 percent, on Oct. 20, 1987, a day that was dubbed \"Black Monday.\" This Monday was gloomy enough: at one point, the benchmark sank as much as 13.4 percent.\n\nShare prices have fallen in Tokyo since the Bank of Japan raised its benchmark interest rate on Wednesday. The Nikkei is now down 3.8 percent from a year ago.\n\nOne factor driving the BOJ to raise rates was prolonged weakness in the Japanese yen, which has pushed inflation to above the central bank's 2 percent inflation target. Early Monday, the dollar was trading at 142.59 yen, down from 146.45 late Friday and sharply below its level of over 160 yen a few weeks ago.\n\nThe euro fell to $1.0914 from $1.0923.\n\nShares surged to stratospheric heights earlier this year on frenzied buying of stock in companies expected to thrive thanks to advances in artificial intelligence. The latest setback has hit markets heavily weighted toward computer chipmakers like Samsung Electronics and other technology shares: on Monday, South Korea's Kospi plummeted more than 9 percent as Samsung's shares sank 11.6 percent.

Bitcoin, which recently had surged to nearly $70,000, was down 14 percent at $54,155.00.\n\nOil prices slipped, with US benchmark crude oil giving up 74 cents to $72.78 per barrel.

A rate cut would make it easier for US households and companies to borrow money and boost the economy, but it could take months to a year for the full effects to filter through.\n\n\"Specifically, the

Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 stock index has lost 12.4% on Monday, August 5, 2024, in the latest bout of sell-offs that are jolting world markets.\n\nU.S. stocks are set to open sharply lower Monday, adding to steep declines in Asia and Europe and deepening a sell-off tied to worries about a recession in the U.S. economy. Japan's main index plunged more than 12%, its worst day since 1987.\n\nS&P 500 futures are down 3.1% and Nasdaq futures are sinking 4.7%. Investors are fleeing the Big Tech names that until recently had powered the U.S. market higher: Apple fell more than 7% and Meta was down 6% in premarket trading. Chipmaker Nvidia tumbled 12.5%.\n\nFutures for the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 2.1%.\n\nA report Friday showing hiring by U.S. employers slowed last month by much more than expected followed weak reports on manufacturing and construction and stoked fears the U.S. economy was finally bending under the pressure of high interest rates. Investors worldwide sold stocks and moved to the safety of bonds, pushing bond yields sharply lower.\n\nThe shakeup began just a couple of days after U.S. stock indexes had jumped to their best day in months after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell set the stage for possible rate cuts to begin in September.\n\nBut after Friday's jobs report, worries are rising the Fed may have kept its main interest rate at a two-decade high for too long, raising risks of a recession in the world's largest economy. A rate cut would make it less expensive for U.S. households and companies to borrow money, but it could take time for the effects to boost the economy.\n\nUntil Friday, there had been relatively few huge market swings in the past year.\n\nA bonanza around artificial intelligence technology helped drive Big Tech stocks higher, while other areas of the market held up amid rising hopes for coming cuts to interest rates by the Federal Reserve. But professional investors have been warning that shakier times may be ahead given uncertainty about how quickly the Fed will cut interest rates and other big questions.\n\nMonday's plunge in the Nikkei followed a nearly 6% drop on Friday. In mid-July, the index had risen to all-time highs. Its worst single-day rout was a plunge of 3,836 points, or 14.9%, on Oct. 19, 1987, a global markets crash that was dubbed \"Black Monday\" but proved to be only a temporary setback despite fears it might have augured a worldwide downturn.\n\nOn Monday, the Nikkei closed down 4,451.28 points at 31,458.42. It had dropped 5.8% on Friday, making this its worst two-day decline ever.\n\nShare prices have fallen in Tokyo since the Bank of Japan raised its benchmark interest rate on Wednesday.\n\nThe Japanese yen also has fallen sharply, trading at 142.37 yen for one U.S. dollar, down from 146.45 late Friday and sharply below its level of over 160 yen a few weeks ago.\n\nAnalysts said another factor contributing to the falling share prices was carry trades, where investors borrow money from a country with low interest rates and a relatively weak currency, like Japan, and invest those funds in places that will yield a high return. Investors have been selling stocks to repay those loans as their costs have risen with a stronger yen and higher interest rates.\n\nSouth Korea stocks sank almost 9%.\n\nIn Europe, markets in London, Paris and Frankfurt each dropped more than 2%.\n\nThe euro rose to $1.0951 from $1.0923.\n\nOne of the few bright spots was Kellanova, formerly Kellogg's, which gained 22% on reports that Snickers owner Mars was deep in talks to acquire the cereal and snackmaker.\n\nThe latest setback has hit markets heavily weighted toward computer chipmakers like Samsung Electronics and other technology shares: on Monday, South Korea's Kospi plummeted more than 9% as Samsung's shares sank 10.3%. It closed 8.8% lower at 2,441.55.\n\nTaiwan's Taiex also crumbled, losing 8.4% as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., the world's biggest chip maker, dropped 9.8%.\n\n\"To put it mildly, the spike in volatility-of-volatility is a spectacle that underlines just how jittery markets have become,\" Stephen Innes of SPI Asset Management said in a commentary. \"The real question now looms: Can the typical market reflex to sell volatility or buy the market dip prevail over the deep-seated anxiety brought on by this sudden and sharp recession scare?\"\n\nThe VIX, an index that measures how worried investors are about upcoming drops for the S&P 500, was up 105% as of early Monday. Bitcoin which recently had surged to nearly $70,000, was down nearly 17% at $52,100.00.\n\nOil prices slipped, with U.S. benchmark crude oil giving up $1.41 to $72.11 per barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, lost $1.35 cents to $75.46 per barrel.\n\nInvestors will be watching for data on the U.S. services sector from the U.S. Institute for Supply Management due later Monday that may help determine if the sell-offs around the world are an overreaction, Yeap Jun Rong of IG said in a report.\n\nEven though worries over weakness in the U.S. economy and volatile markets have rippled around the world, the U.S. economy is still growing, and a recession is far from a certainty.\n\nBut the mood was decidedly dark.\n\nHong Kong's Hang Seng index lost 2.2% to 16,579.97 and the S&P/ASX 200 in Australia declined 3.7% to 7,649.60.\n\nThe Shanghai Composite index, which is somewhat insulated by capital controls from other world markets, edged higher but then gave way, losing 1.5% to 2,862.56.\n\nThe S&P 500's 1.8% decline Friday was its first back-to-back loss of at least 1% since April.

It dropped 5.8% on Friday and has now logged its worst two-day decline ever, dropping 18.2% in the last two trading sessions.\n\nAt its lowest the Nikkei plunged as much as 13.4%. Its biggest single-day rout was a drop of 3,836 points, or 14.9%, on the day dubbed \"Black Monday\" in October 1987. It suffered an 11.4% drop in October 2008 during the global financial crisis and fell 10.6% during the aftermath of massive earthquakes and nuclear meltdowns in northeastern Japan in March 2011.\n\nShare prices have fallen in Tokyo since the Bank of Japan raised its benchmark interest rate on Wednesday. The benchmark is now about 3.8% below the level it was at a year ago.\n\nThe wave of selling hit all sorts of companies.\n\nToyota Motor Corp's shares dropped 11% and Honda Motor Co. lost 13.4%. Computer chip maker Tokyo Electron dived 15.8% and Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group plunged 18.4%.\n\nA report showing hiring by U.S. employers slowed last month by much more than expected has convulsed financial markets, vanquishing the euphoria that had taken the Nikkei to all-times highs of over 42,000 in recent weeks.\n\nOne factor driving the BOJ to raise rates was prolonged weakness in the Japanese yen, which has pushed inflation to above the central bank's 2% inflation target. Early Monday, the dollar was trading at 143.07 yen, down from 146.45 late Friday and sharply below its level of over 160 yen a few weeks ago.\n\nThe euro rose to $1.0934 from $1.0923.\n\nShares had surged to stratospheric heights earlier this year on frenzied buying of shares in companies expected to thrive thanks to advances in artificial intelligence. The latest setback has hit markets heavily weighted toward computer chipmakers like Samsung Electronics and other technology shares: on Monday, South Korea's Kospi plummeted 6.5% as Samsung's shares sank 7.7%.\n\nTaiwan's Taiex crumbled, losing 7.4% as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., the world's biggest chip maker, dropped 8%.\n\nStocks tumbled Friday after weaker than expected employment data fanned worries the U.S. economy could be cracking under the weight of high interest rates meant to tame inflation. Early Monday, the future for the S&P 500 was 1.5% lower and that for the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.7%.\n\n\"To put it mildly, the spike in volatility-of-volatility is a spectacle that underlines just how jittery markets have become,\" Stephen Innes of SPI Asset Management said in a commentary. \"The real question now looms: Can the typical market reflex to sell volatility or buy the market dip prevail over the deep-seated anxiety brought on by this sudden and sharp recession scare?\"\n\nThe VIX, an index that measures how worried investors are about upcoming drops for the S&P 500, fell about 26% as of early Monday. Bitcoin which recently had surged to nearly $70,000, was down 14% at $54,155.00.\n\nOil prices were little changed. U.S. benchmark crude oil gained 9 cents to $73.61 per barrel while Brent crude was flat at $76.81 per barrel.\n\nInvestors will be watching for data on the U.S. services sector from the U.S. Institute for Supply Management due later Monday that may help determine if the sell-offs around the world are an overreaction, Yeap Jun Rong of IG said in a report.\n\nWorries over weakness in the U.S. economy and volatile markets have rippled around the world, even though the U.S. economy is still growing, and a recession is far from a certainty.\n\nElsewhere in Asia, Hong Kong's Hang Seng index lost 0.2% to 16,908.96 and the S&P/ASX 200 in Australia declined 12.8% to 7,722.60.\n\nThe Shanghai Composite index, which is somewhat insulated by capital controls from other world markets, edged 0.1% higher.\n\nThe S&P 500's 1.8% decline Friday was its first back-to-back loss of at least 1% since April. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 1.5%, and the Nasdaq composite fell 2.4%.\n\nFriday's losses dragged the Nasdaq composite 10% below its record set last month. That level of drop is what traders call a \"correction.\"\n\nThe rout began just a couple days after U.S. stock indexes had jumped to their best day in months after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell gave the clearest indication yet that inflation has slowed enough for cuts to rates to begin in September.\n\nNow, worries are rising the Fed may have kept its main interest rate at a two-decade high for too long, raising risks of a recession in the world's largest economy. A rate cut would make it easier for U.S. households and companies to borrow money and boost the economy, but it could take months to a year for the full effects to filter through.\n\n\"Specifically, the scenario of higher unemployment constraining spending and further restraining hiring and incomes and economic activity leading to a recession is the feared scenario here,\" Tan Boon Heng of Mizuho Bank in Singapore said in a report.\n\n\u00a9 Copyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Japan's main index plunged more than 12%, its worst day since 1987.\n\nU.S. stocks are set to open sharply lower Monday, adding to steep declines in Asia and Europe and deepening a sell-off tied to worries about a recession in the U.S. economy. Japan's main index plunged more than 12%, its worst day since 1987.\n\nS&P 500 futures are down 3.1% and Nasdaq futures are sinking 4.7%. Investors are fleeing the Big Tech names that until recently had powered the U.S. market higher: Apple fell more than 7% and Meta was down 6% in premarket trading. Chipmaker Nvidia tumbled 12.5%.\n\nFutures for the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 2.1%.\n\nA report Friday showing hiring by U.S. employers slowed last month by much more than expected followed weak reports on manufacturing and construction and stoked fears the U.S. economy was finally bending under the pressure of high interest rates. Investors worldwide sold stocks and moved to the safety of bonds, pushing bond yields sharply lower.\n\nThe shakeup began just a couple of days after U.S. stock indexes had jumped to their best day in months after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell set the stage for possible rate cuts to begin in September.\n\nBut after Friday's jobs report, worries are rising the Fed may have kept its main interest rate at a two-decade high for too long, raising risks of a recession in the world's largest economy. A rate cut would make it less expensive for U.S. households and companies to borrow money, but it could take time for the effects to boost the economy.\n\nUntil Friday, there had been relatively few huge market swings in the past year.\n\nA bonanza around artificial intelligence technology helped drive Big Tech stocks higher, while other areas of the market held up amid rising hopes for coming cuts to interest rates by the Federal Reserve. But professional investors have been warning that shakier times may be ahead given uncertainty about how quickly the Fed will cut interest rates and other big questions.\n\nMonday's plunge in the Nikkei followed a nearly 6% drop on Friday. In mid-July, the index had risen to all-time highs. Its worst single-day rout was a plunge of 3,836 points, or 14.9%, on Oct. 19, 1987, a global markets crash that was dubbed \"Black Monday\" but proved to be only a temporary setback despite fears it might have augured a worldwide downturn.\n\nOn Monday, the Nikkei closed down 4,451.28 points at 31,458.42. It had dropped 5.8% on Friday, making this its worst two-day decline ever.\n\nShare prices have fallen in Tokyo since the Bank of Japan raised its benchmark interest rate on Wednesday.\n\nThe Japanese yen also has fallen sharply, trading at 142.37 yen for one U.S. dollar, down from 146.45 late Friday and sharply below its level of over 160 yen a few weeks ago.\n\nAnalysts said another factor contributing to the falling share prices was carry trades, where investors borrow money from a country with low interest rates and a relatively weak currency, like Japan, and invest those funds in places that will yield a high return. Investors have been selling stocks to repay those loans as their costs have risen with a stronger yen and higher interest rates.\n\nSouth Korea stocks sank almost 9%.\n\nIn Europe, markets in London, Paris and Frankfurt each dropped more than 2%.\n\nThe euro rose to $1.0951 from $1.0923.\n\nOne of the few bright spots was Kellanova, formerly Kellogg's, which gained 22% on reports that Snickers owner Mars was deep in talks to acquire the cereal and snackmaker.\n\nThe latest setback has hit markets heavily weighted toward computer chipmakers like Samsung Electronics and other technology shares: on Monday, South Korea's Kospi plummeted more than 9% as Samsung's shares sank 10.3%. It closed 8.8% lower at 2,441.55.\n\nTaiwan's Taiex also crumbled, losing 8.4% as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., the world's biggest chip maker, dropped 9.8%.\n\n\"To put it mildly, the spike in volatility-of-volatility is a spectacle that underlines just how jittery markets have become,\" Stephen Innes of SPI Asset Management said in a commentary. \"The real question now looms: Can the typical market reflex to sell volatility or buy the market dip prevail over the deep-seated anxiety brought on by this sudden and sharp recession scare?\"\n\nThe VIX, an index that measures how worried investors are about upcoming drops for the S&P 500, was up 105% as of early Monday. Bitcoin which recently had surged to nearly $70,000, was down nearly 17% at $52,100.00.\n\nOil prices slipped, with U.S. benchmark crude oil giving up $1.41 to $72.11 per barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, lost $1.35 cents to $75.46 per barrel.\n\nInvestors will be watching for data on the U.S. services sector from the U.S. Institute for Supply Management due later Monday that may help determine if the sell-offs around the world are an overreaction, Yeap Jun Rong of IG said in a report.\n\nEven though worries over weakness in the U.S. economy and volatile markets have rippled around the world, the U.S. economy is still growing, and a recession is far from a certainty.\n\nBut the mood was decidedly dark.\n\nHong Kong's Hang Seng index lost 2.2% to 16,579.97 and the S&P/ASX 200 in Australia declined 3.7% to 7,649.60.\n\nThe Shanghai Composite index, which is somewhat insulated by capital controls from other world markets, edged higher but then gave way, losing 1.5% to 2,862.56.\n\nThe S&P 500's 1.8% decline Friday was its first back-to-back loss of at least 1% since April. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 1.5%, and the Nasdaq composite fell 2.4%, taking it to 10% below its record set last month.

Japan's main index plunged more than 12%, its worst day since 1987.\n\nS&P 500 futures are down 3.1% and Nasdaq futures are sinking 4.7%. Investors are fleeing the Big Tech names that until recently had powered the U.S. market higher: Apple fell more than 7% and Meta was down 6% in premarket trading. Chipmaker Nvidia tumbled 12.5%.\n\nFutures for the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 2.1%.\n\nA report Friday showing hiring by U.S. employers slowed last month by much more than expected followed weak reports on manufacturing and construction and stoked fears the U.S. economy was finally bending under the pressure of high interest rates. Investors worldwide sold stocks and moved to the safety of bonds, pushing bond yields sharply lower.\n\nThe shakeup began just a couple of days after U.S. stock indexes had jumped to their best day in months after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell set the stage for possible rate cuts to begin in September.\n\nBut after Friday's jobs report, worries are rising the Fed may have kept its main interest rate at a two-decade high for too long, raising risks of a recession in the world's largest economy. A rate cut would make it less expensive for U.S. households and companies to borrow money, but it could take time for the effects to boost the economy.\n\nUntil Friday, there had been relatively few huge market swings in the past year.\n\nA bonanza around artificial intelligence technology helped drive Big Tech stocks higher, while other areas of the market held up amid rising hopes for coming cuts to interest rates by the Federal Reserve. But professional investors have been warning that shakier times may be ahead given uncertainty about how quickly the Fed will cut interest rates and other big questions.\n\nMonday's plunge in the Nikkei followed a nearly 6% drop on Friday. In mid-July, the index had risen to all-time highs. Its worst single-day rout was a plunge of 3,836 points, or 14.9%, on Oct. 19, 1987, a global markets crash that was dubbed \"Black Monday\" but proved to be only a temporary setback despite fears it might have augured a worldwide downturn.\n\nOn Monday, the Nikkei closed down 4,451.28 points at 31,458.42. It had dropped 5.8% on Friday, making this its worst two-day decline ever.\n\nShare prices have fallen in Tokyo since the Bank of Japan raised its benchmark interest rate on Wednesday.\n\nThe Japanese yen also has fallen sharply, trading at 142.37 yen for one U.S. dollar, down from 146.45 late Friday and sharply below its level of over 160 yen a few weeks ago.\n\nAnalysts said another factor contributing to the falling share prices was carry trades, where investors borrow money from a country with low interest rates and a relatively weak currency, like Japan, and invest those funds in places that will yield a high return. Investors have been selling stocks to repay those loans as their costs have risen with a stronger yen and higher interest rates.\n\nSouth Korea stocks sank almost 9%.\n\nIn Europe, markets in London, Paris and Frankfurt each dropped more than 2%.\n\nThe euro rose to $1.0951 from $1.0923.\n\nOne of the few bright spots was Kellanova, formerly Kellogg's, which gained 22% on reports that Snickers owner Mars was deep in talks to acquire the cereal and snackmaker.\n\nThe latest setback has hit markets heavily weighted toward computer chipmakers like Samsung Electronics and other technology shares: on Monday, South Korea's Kospi plummeted more than 9% as Samsung's shares sank 10.3%. It closed 8.8% lower at 2,441.55.\n\nTaiwan's Taiex also crumbled, losing 8.4% as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., the world's biggest chip maker, dropped 9.8%.\n\n\"To put it mildly, the spike in volatility-of-volatility is a spectacle that underlines just how jittery markets have become,\" Stephen Innes of SPI Asset Management said in a commentary. \"The real question now looms: Can the typical market reflex to sell volatility or buy the market dip prevail over the deep-seated anxiety brought on by this sudden and sharp recession scare?\"\n\nThe VIX, an index that measures how worried investors are about upcoming drops for the S&P 500, was up 105% as of early Monday. Bitcoin which recently had surged to nearly $70,000, was down nearly 17% at $52,100.00.\n\nOil prices slipped, with U.S. benchmark crude oil giving up $1.41 to $72.11 per barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, lost $1.35 cents to $75.46 per barrel.\n\nInvestors will be watching for data on the U.S. services sector from the U.S. Institute for Supply Management due later Monday that may help determine if the sell-offs around the world are an overreaction, Yeap Jun Rong of IG said in a report.\n\nEven though worries over weakness in the U.S. economy and volatile markets have rippled around the world, the U.S. economy is still growing, and a recession is far from a certainty.\n\nBut the mood was decidedly dark.\n\nHong Kong's Hang Seng index lost 2.2% to 16,579.97 and the S&P/ASX 200 in Australia declined 3.7% to 7,649.60.\n\nThe Shanghai Composite index, which is somewhat insulated by capital controls from other world markets, edged higher but then gave way, losing 1.5% to 2,862.56.\n\nThe S&P 500's 1.8% decline Friday was its first back-to-back loss of at least 1% since April. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 1.5%, and the Nasdaq composite fell 2.4%, taking it to 10% below its record set last month. That level of drop is what traders call a \"correction.\"", "source": {"uri": "vinnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "vinnews.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "joseph_feldman@vinnews.com", "name":

The market's broader TOPIX index also fell 8 per cent as selling picked up in the afternoon.\n\nAlso Read | Japan's Nikkei 225 Stock Index Plunges by 8% in Worst Losses Since 1987.\n\nA report showing hiring by US employers slowed last month by much more than expected has convulsed financial markets, vanquishing the euphoria that had taken the Nikkei to all-times highs of over 42,000 in recent weeks.\n\nThe Nikkei 225 dropped 5.8 per cent on Friday and it is headed for its worst two-day decline ever. Its worst single-day rout was a plunge of 3,836 points, or 14.9 per cent, on a day dubbed \"Black Monday\" in October 1987. Share prices have fallen in Tokyo since the Bank of Japan raised its benchmark interest rate on Wednesday. The Nikkei is now at about the level it was a year ago.\n\nAlso Read | North Korea's Kim Jong Un Unveils 250 New Tactical Ballistic Missile Launchers.\n\nOne factor driving the BOJ to raise rates was prolonged weakness in the Japanese yen, which has pushed inflation to above the central bank's 2 per cent inflation target. Early Monday, the dollar was trading at 143.07 yen, down from 146.45 late Friday and sharply below its level of over 160 yen a few weeks ago.\n\nThe euro rose to USD 1.0934 from USD 1.0923.\n\nShares had surged to stratospheric heights earlier this year on frenzied buying of shares in companies expected to thrive thanks to advances in artificial intelligence. The latest setback has hit markets heavily weighted toward computer chipmakers like Samsung Electronics and other technology shares: on Monday, South Korea's Kospi plummeted 6.5 per cent as Samsung's shares sank 7.7 per cent.\n\nTaiwan's Taiex crumbled, losing 7.4 per cent as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., the world's biggest chip maker, dropped 8 per cent.\n\nStocks tumbled Friday after weaker than expected employment data fanned worries the US economy could be cracking under the weight of high interest rates meant to tame inflation. Early Monday, the future for the S&P 500 was 1.5 per cent lower and that for the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.7 per cent.\n\n\"To put it mildly, the spike in volatility-of-volatility is a spectacle that underlines just how jittery markets have become,\" Stephen Innes of SPI Asset Management said in a commentary. \"The real question now looms: Can the typical market reflex to sell volatility or buy the market dip prevail over the deep-seated anxiety brought on by this sudden and sharp recession scare?\"\n\nThe VIX, an index that measures how worried investors are about upcoming drops for the S&P 500, fell about 26 per cent as of early Monday. Bitcoin which recently had surged to nearly USD 70,000, was down 14 per cent at USD 54,155.00.\n\nOil prices were little changed. US benchmark crude oil gained 9 cents to USD 73.61 per barrel while Brent crude was flat at USD 76.81 per barrel.\n\nInvestors will be watching for data on the US services sector from the US Institute for Supply Management due later Monday that may help determine if the sell-offs around the world are an overreaction, Yeap Jun Rong of IG said in a report.\n\nWorries over weakness in the US economy and volatile markets have rippled around the world, even though the US economy is still growing, and a recession is far from a certainty.\n\nElsewhere in Asia, Hong Kong's Hang Seng index lost 0.2 per cent to 16,908.96 and the S&P/ASX 200 in Australia declined 12.8 per cent to 7,722.60.\n\nThe Shanghai Composite index, which is somewhat insulated by capital controls from other world markets, edged 0.1% higher.\n\nThe S&P 500's 1.8 per cent decline Friday was its first back-to-back loss of at least 1 per cent since April. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 1.5 per cent, and the Nasdaq composite fell 2.4 per cent.\n\nFriday's losses dragged the Nasdaq composite 10 per cent below its record set last month. That level of drop is what traders call a \"correction.\"\n\nThe rout began just a couple days after US stock indexes had jumped to their best day in months after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell gave the clearest indication yet that inflation has slowed enough for cuts to rates to begin in September.\n\nNow, worries are rising the Fed may have kept its main interest rate at a two-decade high for too long, raising risks of a recession in the world's largest economy. A rate cut would make it easier for US households and companies to borrow money and boost the economy, but it could take months to a year for the full effects to filter through.\n\n\"Specifically, the scenario of higher unemployment constraining spending and further restraining hiring and incomes and economic activity leading to a recession is the feared scenario here,\" Tan Boon Heng of Mizuho Bank in Singapore said in a report.

Also, don't look at your 401ks (via CNBC):\n\nU.S. stock futures fell Sunday night following a volatile week for Wall Street, in which the Nasdaq Composite dropped into correction territory.\n\nWall Street is coming off a brutal week for the major averages. On Friday, the Nasdaq capped a third straight week of losses, bringing the tech-heavy index down more than 10% from a record set last month.\n\nThe S&P 500 also posted a third straight losing week, down 2% for the week. Even the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which had been outperforming, snapped a four-week win streak, falling 2%.\n\nTreasury yields tumbled as well. The benchmark 10-year note on Friday yielded 3.79%, down from where it was one week previously at 4.20%.\n\nThe recent pullback in stocks was exacerbated Friday when a disappointing jobs report spurred investor fears the Federal Reserve made a mistake last week when it kept interest rates unchanged, and that the economy is headed toward a recession.\n\nMore on the Japanese stock market plunge (via AP):\n\nJapan's benchmark Nikkei 225 stock index plunged as much as 8.1% early Monday, extending sell-offs that shook world markets last week as worries flared over the state of the U.S. economy.\n\nAt one point, the Nikkei shed more than 2,900 points, to 32,991.88.

A rate cut would make it less expensive for American households and companies to borrow money, but it could take time for the effects to boost the economy.\n\nUntil Friday, there had been relatively few huge market swings in the past year.\n\nA bonanza around artificial intelligence technology helped drive Big Tech stocks higher, while other areas of the market held up amid rising hopes for coming cuts to interest rates by the Federal Reserve.\n\nProfessional investors have been warning that shakier times may be ahead, though, given uncertainty about how quickly the Fed will cut interest rates and other big questions.\n\nOn Monday, the Nikkei closed down 4,451.28 points at 31,458.42. It had dropped 5.8 percent on Friday, making this its worst two-day decline ever.\n\nIts worst single-day rout was a plunge of 3,836 points, or 14.9 percent, on Oct. 19, 1987, a global markets crash that was dubbed \"Black Monday\" but proved to be only a temporary setback despite fears it might have augured a worldwide downturn.\n\nEuropean markets also opened lower Monday, with Germany's DAX down 2.3 percent at 17,267.00. The CAC 40 in Paris lost 1.9 percent to 7,114.33 and the FTSE 100 in London was 2.1 percent lower at 8,004.19.\n\nDarkening the outlook for trading on Wall Street, early Monday futures trading for the S&P 500 was 2.5 percent lower and that for the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 1.6 percent.\n\nShare prices have fallen in Tokyo since the Bank of Japan raised its benchmark interest rate on Wednesday. The Nikkei is now down 3.8 percent from a year ago.\n\nThe Japanese yen also has fallen sharply, trading at 142.37 yen, down from 146.45 late Friday and sharply below its level of over 160 yen a few weeks ago.\n\nThe euro rose to $1.0952 from $1.0923.\n\nThe VIX, an index that measures how worried investors are about upcoming drops for the S&P 500, was up about 26 percent as of early Monday. Bitcoin, which recently had surged to nearly $70,000, was down 16 percent at $53,160.00.\n\nOil prices slipped, with U.S. benchmark crude oil giving up 74 cents to $72.78 per barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, lost 67 cents to $76.14 per barrel.\n\nInvestors will be watching for data on the American services sector from the Institute for Supply Management due later Monday that may help determine if the sell-offs around the world are an overreaction, IG's Yeap Jun Rong said in a report.\n\nEven though worries over weakness in the American economy and volatile markets have rippled around the world, the United States economy is still growing, and a recession is far from a certainty.\n\nThe mood was decidedly dark, though.\n\nHong Kong's Hang Seng index lost 2.2 percent to 16,579.97 and the S&P/ASX 200 in Australia declined 3.7 percent to 7,649.60.\n\nThe Shanghai Composite index, which is somewhat insulated by capital controls from other world markets, edged higher but then gave way, losing 1.5 percent to 2,862.56.\n\nThe S&P 500's 1.8 percent decline Friday was its first back-to-back loss of at least 1 percent since April. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 1.5 percent, and the Nasdaq composite fell 2.4 percent, taking it to 10 percent below its record set last month. That level of drop is what traders call a \"correction.\"", "source": {"uri": "nysun.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Sun"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The unemployment rate rose to its highest level since 2021, according to the U.S. Labor Department. In response to the data, Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 dropped by over 12 percent, the biggest drop for the index since 1987.\n\nJapan, which has an export-heavy economy, is particularly vulnerable to changes like these, as a reliance on exports means its market is extremely sensitive to economic conditions in America, which is one of its biggest customers. In response to the latest job data, investors moved money away from equities and into safer assets such as government bonds.\n\nThe yen also strengthened against the dollar. A stronger yen reduces the cost of imports into Japan, but also diminishes the profitability of Japanese companies that export goods abroad at the same time.\n\nBecause of this, large exporters like Toyota and Sony, both huge players in the Japanese economy saw their shares decline by 3.5 percent and four percent, respectively.\n\nJapanese Finance Minister Shunichi Suzuki said that the government was monitoring markets with \"grave concern\", and that \"it's hard to say what is behind the decline in stocks.\"\n\nOther markets across Asia were hit by the U.S. jobs data. South Korea's Kospi index dropped more than nine percent, while Taiwan's Taiex exchange dropped by 8.4 percent. Additionally, markets in Singapore, Indonesia, and Thailand all also fell by around two and three percent.\n\nWhen the U.K. markets opened on Monday, there was a similar impact. The FTSE 100 suffered its biggest drop in more than a year, with the index opening down 159.05 points.\n\nU.S. stock futures fell significantly ahead of the market open. The Dow Jones Industrial Average are down by over 600 points, while S&P 500 Futures dropped 140 points.\n\nThe VIX, an index that measures volatility in the market was up about 26 percent as of early Monday, according to the Associated Press.\n\nFriday's job figures raised the specter of recession in the U.S. Richard Flynn, Managing Director at Charles Schwab U.K., said in a statement shared with Newsweek after the data came out that the \"figures may stir anxieties that central bankers haven't moved fast enough to cut rates, nudging the jobs market into a downward spiral.\"\n\n\"To put it mildly, the spike in volatility-of-volatility is a spectacle that underlines just how jittery markets have become,\" Stephen Innes of SPI Asset Management said in a commentary shared with AP. \"The real question now looms: Can the typical market reflex to sell volatility or buy the market dip prevail over the deep-seated anxiety brought on by this sudden and sharp recession scare?\"\n\nThe U.S. economy is currently growing, though at a moderate pace. In the second quarter of 2024, real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) increased at an annual rate of 2.8 percent, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis.

The unemployment rate rose to its highest level since 2021, according to the U.S. Labor Department. In response to the data, Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 dropped by over 12 percent, the biggest drop for the index since 1987.\n\nJapan, which has an export-heavy economy, is particularly vulnerable to changes like these, as a reliance on exports means its market is extremely sensitive to economic conditions in America, which is one of its biggest customers. In response to the latest job data, investors moved money away from equities and into safer assets such as government bonds.\n\nThe yen also strengthened against the dollar. A stronger yen reduces the cost of imports into Japan, but also diminishes the profitability of Japanese companies that export goods abroad at the same time.\n\nBecause of this, large exporters like Toyota and Sony, both huge players in the Japanese economy saw their shares decline by 3.5 percent and four percent, respectively.\n\nJapanese Finance Minister Shunichi Suzuki said that the government was monitoring markets with \"grave concern\", and that \"it's hard to say what is behind the decline in stocks.\"\n\nOther markets across Asia were hit by the U.S. jobs data. South Korea's Kospi index dropped more than nine percent, while Taiwan's Taiex exchange dropped by 8.4 percent. Additionally, markets in Singapore, Indonesia, and Thailand all also fell by around two and three percent.\n\nWhen the U.K. markets opened on Monday, there was a similar impact. The FTSE 100 suffered its biggest drop in more than a year, with the index opening down 159.05 points.\n\nU.S. stock futures fell significantly ahead of the market open. The Dow Jones Industrial Average are down by over 600 points, while S&P 500 Futures dropped 140 points.\n\nThe VIX, an index that measures volatility in the market was up about 26 percent as of early Monday, according to the Associated Press.\n\nFriday's job figures raised the specter of recession in the U.S. Richard Flynn, Managing Director at Charles Schwab U.K., said in a statement shared with Newsweek after the data came out that the \"figures may stir anxieties that central bankers haven't moved fast enough to cut rates, nudging the jobs market into a downward spiral.\"\n\n\"To put it mildly, the spike in volatility-of-volatility is a spectacle that underlines just how jittery markets have become,\" Stephen Innes of SPI Asset Management said in a commentary shared with AP. \"The real question now looms: Can the typical market reflex to sell volatility or buy the market dip prevail over the deep-seated anxiety brought on by this sudden and sharp recession scare?\"\n\nThe U.S. economy is currently growing, though at a moderate pace.

However, post-job report worries have spiked, questioning whether the Fed's high interest rates could thrust the largest economy into recession.\n\nDuring the past year, markets saw relatively few major swings with sectors like Big Tech enjoying gains from the AI boom and hopeful anticipations for interest rate cuts.

The same sentiment echoed in Europe, where stock prices also tumbled sharply.\n\nOver the past two days, financial markets worldwide -- including the United States, Europe, and Asia -- have seen a decline surpassing 3%.

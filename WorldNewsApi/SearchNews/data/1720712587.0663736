A second read: \"This is a lovely dress, so pretty. I have no end of M&S pretty dresses & this is up there with them all but I must say the bust line on this one is a lot more snug than others in the same style. I ordered petite for the length but looks like the bust has been cut a little shorter on this one. I do like it though & it just about fitted so kept it. A very slimming design. I have received plenty of compliments in this dress.\" Another positive reviewer wrote: \"Dress is very feminine. Material just hangs softly round the body.\" A fourth delighted shopper wrote: \"Gorgeous and feminine. I bought the 12 L as no regular available. I am a 10-12 but still was not disappointed. The sleeves are a lovely length and fluff up with an elegant twist. Go well with sandals and pumps equally. Sits lovely across the bust too. Love it.\" While another M&S shopper added: \"Fed up returning dresses to retailers as never able to purchase a petite length in shops in a 10/12. Was blown away with this one as fits perfectly.\" And another happy shopper said: \"This dress is so clean looking and an easy dress to wear! It will be so handy to put on for any occasion, you can dress it up or down with a pair of sandals or trainers! I really like it and the price is really good!\" One reviewer was less positive about the design, writing: \"The fit of these dresses seems different and the zip in the side sticks out really badly and totally ruins the lines of the dress. Shame I normally buy a few of these in different colours or patterns, very disappointing this time.\" If you prefer a bolder print for the warmer season, then you can consider River Island Blue Floral Puff Sleeve Swing Midi Dress for \u00a348.

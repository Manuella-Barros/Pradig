Their new Las Vegas home won't be ready until 2026, so they will play in Sacramento in 2025.\n\nAn FBI agent stepped outside Thao's home on Maiden Lane Thursday morning with light blue surgical gloves. He asked members of the media to stay away from three black and grey SUVs belonging to the FBI agents parked on the street outside her home. The agent would not answer questions from reporters, including the reason for the raid, what they were finding and how many agents were inside.\n\nAt about 10 a.m. more than a dozen agents exited the home carrying paper boxes, clipboards and large black plastic tubs. They drove off in four SUVs. The mayor was nowhere in sight and nobody answered when reporters knocked on the front door and rang the doorbell.\n\nMiles away, law enforcement in FBI jackets searched another house, nestled at 4320 View Crest Court in the Oakland hills Thursday morning. Two were rifling through luggage in the garage and declined to speak with a reporter. At about 9 a.m., agents began searching parked vehicles outside the house.\n\nThe people of Oakland are frustrated and angry. Their police force has been decimated and the situation is made worse by a lack of trust between the civilians and cops.

She is also a former member of the Oakland Police Commission, which Thao removed her from in 2023.\n\nRecall supporters have said the recall is justified for several reasons, including crime, the city's financial struggles, the way Thao fired former police chief LeRonne Armstrong and her administration's mishandling of a state crime grant application that cost the city $15 million in lost funding.\n\nAccording to reports, Thao rented the residence, and at least three more houses will receive FBI visits in the near future.

Led by former Alameda County Superior Court Judge Brenda Harbin-Forte, OUST organizers have said that Thao needs to be recalled because of her efforts while Mayor leading to a rise in crime as well as eroding public safety. Since being elected as Mayor in the closest Mayoral election in city history in 2022, violent crimes have skyrocketed. In 2023, burglaries shot up by 23%, with vehicle thefts jumping up by 45% and robberies up 38%. The murder rate also remained high, staying above 100 in a single year for yet another year in a row.\n\nWith many believing that Thao has not been addressing crime and public safety concerns, residents began calling for her recall. The notice of intent specifically noted how the Oakland Police Department (OPD) has been hammered by Thao's actions, that Thao has failed to declare a state of emergency in the city despite promising to do so and that Oakland Police Chief LeRonne Armstrong's firing helped create a public safety crisis that has led to \"the city's reputation as one of the most dangerous in America\", with no replacement for Armstrong being picked yet. Other issues have included Thao's failure to failure to keep the Oakland Athletics in Oakland and her missing the deadline to apply for a $15 million state crime grant.\n\nAfter the notice of intent went out in January, organizers began collecting signatures the next month. For a recall to appear on the November ballot, 25,000 signatures need to be collected by July. Organizers and signature collectors from previous recalls also noted that a significant number of extra signatures would be needed, as many would likely be voided during the verification process because of double signatures, invalid information, and other issues. Last month, OUST said that enough signatures had been collected for the recall to reach the ballot, with the total number going in well before the July 2nd deadline being 41,530 despite only 25,000 needed to make it on the ballot.\n\nThis led to the Registrar's announcement on Tuesday night that 40,590 of the 41,530 signatures had been approved, setting a new record in the County for least number of signatures rejected for a ballot initiative by percentage. The recall is to now go before Oakland voters. For the first time in city history, voters will decide on recalling their Mayor.\n\n\"This historic achievement marks the first recall in Oakland's history, with Oakland voters signing with a sense of urgency and purpose to recall this dishonest and incompetent mayor,\" said OUST President Harbin-Forte on Tuesday. \"Thao's actions have pushed Oakland to the brink, but the community is saying, 'NO MORE'. We want Thao gone.\"\n\nSeneca Scott, one of the lead organizers, added, \"I think you're going to see a different tune from the mayor's administration. I think the numbers are clear, voters want Thao gone, voters want her gone. She demoralized the city. We trusted LeRonne Armstrong, we don't trust Mayor Thao.\"\n\nAs of Wednesday morning, Mayor Thao has yet to give a response to the recall making the ballot.\n\nWhile the recall is expected to be on the ballot for November, it is not yet confirmed. The Oakland City Council will likely decide on an election date during the next City Council meeting on July 2nd.\n\nAlameda County pollster Elena Sierra explained to the Globe on Wednesday that \"They had way more than enough signature more than month before signatures were actually due. Voters are mad. And their supporters come from all over. They come from Loren Taylor supporters, many of which still think he was robbed in the 2022 election. They have Armstrong supporters, as we saw through OUST. They have Oakland A's supporters who are mad that she lost the team. They have people who have been affected by crime. And that's on the surface.\n\n\"They want her gone because they have seen her as doing nothing more than causing a ton of damage since being elected less than 2 years ago. And as Thao's supporters have pointed out, she is running across the city trying to make herself look like the good guy and appear hardworking.\"\n\n\"But as we saw through those signatures and the recall making it on the ballot, voters have been seeing otherwise. This is not boding well for her.\"\n\nAn election date for the recall is expected to be announced soon.\n\nAuthor Recent Posts Evan SymonEvan V. Symon is the Senior Editor for the California Globe.

To get on the upcoming ballot, the group only needed to secure 25,000 verified signatures.\n\n'You created a public safety crisis.'\n\nSuperior Court Judge Brenda Harbin-Forte, who spearheaded the effort, toldKTVU, \"This historic achievement marks the first recall in Oakland's history, with Oakland voters signing with a sense of urgency and purpose to recall this dishonest and incompetent mayor.\"\n\n\"Thao's actions have pushed Oakland to the brink, but the community is saying, 'NO MORE. We want Thao gone,'\" Harbin-Forte stated.\n\nAccording to the recall effortswebsite, the group is moving to remove Thao from office for missing a retail theft grant and firing former Oakland Police Department chief LeRonne Armstrong, among many other reasons. The area has struggled with a severe uptick in crime that has prompted a number of businesses to close down.\n\n\"You created a public safety crisis by systematically dismantling the Oakland Police Department, leading to the city's reputation as one of the most dangerous in America,\" the recall effort stated about Thao. \"Your unjust termination of Police Chief LeRonne Armstrong resulted in a surge of serious and violent crimes, delayed OPD's exit from 20 years of federal oversight, and extended the time Oakland must continue paying a federal monitor $1 million each year. You admittedly missed a deadline to apply for a grant to combat retail theft. You failed to implement Oakland's Encampment Management Policy, leading to open-air drug markets and chop shops, making Oakland a national leader in stolen cars. You have made numerous misleading and untrue statements to the public. You failed to keep your promise to appoint a new police chief or declare a state of emergency. In short, you lack the competency, credibility, judgment and ability to lead what was once a great American city.\"\n\nKNTV reported that the FBI raided a home owned by Thao on Thursday morning. While the reason for the raid has not yet been revealed, the outlet stated that the mayor's office is aware of the FBI's actions and deferred all questions to the bureau.\n\nIn a statement, the FBI said that it is \"conducting court authorized law enforcement activity on Maiden Lane.

Thursday morning, FBI agents arrived at Thao's home on Maiden Lane in Oakland's Lincoln Highlands neighborhood in the Oakland Hills. Warrants were served, with Thao being escorted out by agents. For several hours, the FBI stayed at her home with the media receiving very little about the raid beyond it being \"court-appointed\". The Justice Department also confirmed later that agents were inside Thao's home, with ABC also reporting that both the IRS and U.S. Postal Service were also involved in the raid.\n\n\"The FBI is conducting court authorized law enforcement activity on Maiden Lane. We are unable to provide additional information at this time,\" the FBI told all media outlets Thursday morning.\n\nJust after 10 A.M., multiple agents came out of Thao's home with boxes, which were quickly driven away. All remaining agents soon left the scene following that.\n\nMultiple outlets, including the Globe, contacted the Mayor's office about the raid, but as of Thursday noon, they have yet to give so much as a statement on the matter. It is known, however, that Thao cancelled an event planned for 10 A.M. as a result.\n\nWhile the official reason for the raid has yet to be announced, many outlets have offered speculatory reasons. According to ABC, the raid was over \"a public corruption investigation of Thao and her boyfriend.\" The San Francisco Chronicle, meanwhile, noted that the FBI searched a separate home in Oakland Hills on Thursday, whose owner owns California Waste Solutions. That company went under an investigation in 2020 over multiple Oakland City Councilmembers receiving illegal campaign contributions, including then City Councilwoman Thao. Multiple outlets on Thursday also said that Thao's home was one of four raided by the FBI in the Oakland area on Thursday morning, with warrants being served and executed.\n\nWhat is known is that the Thursday raid created yet another setback for Thao this week. On Tuesday, the Alameda County Registrar of Voters announced that enough signatures had been verified to put the Mayoral recall election against That on the ballot, likely for November. This was followed up by many Democratic groups distancing themselves from Thao on Wednesday as a result of the recall election being green-lit for later this year. The FBI raid Thursday, as well as the upcoming announcement over what exactly the reason for it was, have only capped off Thao's tumultuous week.\n\nHowever, Frank Ma, a former law enforcement official who now works as a security advisor for businesses in San Francisco and cities in the Peninsula, told the Globe on Thursday that the raid had nothing to do with the recall.\n\n\"I called some of my buddies over in Oakland, one of whom had been in the FBI, and they said it had nothing to do with the FBI. This was a separate thing. They're all in the dark, however, to what else it can be. It is clear that it is some sort of serious investigation. From experience, law enforcement officials don't raid the homes of people early in the morning on smaller charges. Raids I was part of involved crime rings, drugs, and things of that nature usually.\"\n\n\"I can only speculate, but what everyone is saying about a corruption investigation of some sort fits in to the sort of reasons why we would have done an early morning raid.\"\n\n\"But I can say this. This does no favors for Thao. She needed to be squeaky clean following that recall election announcement on Tuesday, and two days later, she's making headlines because the FBI raided her house. That doesn't look great for someone now fighting for their political lives, does it?\"\n\nAs of Thursday at noon, the FBI or Mayor Thao has yet to give an official announcement of what the raid entailed.\n\nAuthor Recent Posts Evan SymonEvan V.

The Democrat lawmaker's home on Maiden Lane was raided around 5:30 am PT Thursday, CBS San Francisco reports. It is unclear why the property was raided, but according to public records, it appears Thao rents the home.\n\n'The FBI is conducting court authorized law enforcement activity on Maiden Lane. We are unable to provide additional information at this time,' the agency said on Thursday morning. A neighbor told ABC7 News that she woke up to authorities banging on her door around 6 am. According to a law enforcement source, this raid is just one of four locations in Oakland that will be searched by the FBI.\n\nA picture of her home was seen surrounded by multiple unmarked, black vehicles parked on the street. Earlier this week, it was revealed Thao is facing a recall election as voters complain about soaring crime in the Bay Area city. They say her progressive, soft-on-crime policies have emboldened criminals and driven away businesses.\n\nThao will face a historic recall election in November amid anger over her failure to get a grip on the situation in Oakland. The progressive Democrat lawmaker is the first mayor in the city's history to be up for recall, after a campaign to oust her gained more than 40,000 signatures. 'In just a year, Thao's incompetence and dishonesty accelerated Oakland's decline, causing longstanding businesses to close and generational families to leave,' the Oakland United to Recall Sheng Thao (OUST) campaign website stated.\n\nCritics are also angry that she missed an opportunity to apply for a $15 million retail theft grant, fired Oakland Police Chief LaRonne Armstrong, 'for no cause' without appointing a successor and lost the Oakland A's baseball team. They also accused her of lying about calling a State of Emergency to deal with the crime wave crippling the city. Oakland has been rocked by violent crime in recent months, including murders, which have soared from 78 in 2019 to 126 last year.\n\nCrime overall increased by 18 percent in 2023 with property crime up 17 percent and violent crime up 21 percent. And in the first four months of 2024, residential robberies soared by 118 percent on the same period last year. Staggeringly, one car per every 30 residents was also stolen in 2023. The situation has prompted several large corporations to pull out of the city, citing fears for staff safety and the crippling impact of retail theft.\n\nOn Tuesday a Florida family dropping their son off in the city for college enrollment had their rental car ransacked . The traumatized parents and their family have since fled the city and withdrawn their son from studying there. In August one particularly disturbing video showed an innocent woman being dragged along the ground by two male muggers after trying to fight them off. Oakland's only In-N-Out Burger restaurant in the area closed after 18 years, despite still turning a healthy profit, as customers and staff were 'unsafe' due to soaring crime rates, the business said.\n\nThe local Denny's also shut its doors, while Taco Bell refuses to allow indoor dining amid a spate of incidents. Earlier this year, Kaiser, PG&E, Clorox and Blue Shield announced they were plowing $10 million of their own cash into added security measures for their employees amid inaction from the city. Thao's opponents blame her progressive policies for the skyrocketing crime. Among them was a bizarre proposal which suggested life coaching could help tackle homicides and other crimes. The scheme was suggested as part of the city's ceasefire plan which had been dwindling until Thao took office.\n\n'You created a public safety crisis by systematically dismantling the Oakland Police Department, leading to the city's reputation as one of the most dangerous in America,' OUST wrote to the embattled mayor in a statement. 'In short, you lack the competency, credibility, judgment and ability to lead what was once a great American city.' 'Lives have been lost, property destroyed, businesses have shut down, and fear and collective trauma are daily occurrences for Oaklanders. We, the concerned citizens, therefore demand your recall for the sake of our city's future.' The mayor has previously decried the increase in crime, stating that the uptick began in 2019 before her tenure.\n\nWant more stories like this from the Daily Mail?

While other index crimes have fallen, this increase is driven by an increase in robbery.", "source": {"uri": "nysun.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Sun"}, "authors": [{"uri": "russell_payne@nysun.com", "name": "Russell Payne", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recall_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Recall election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mayor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Broadcasting_Company", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "American Broadcasting Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oakland,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Oakland, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oakland, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheng_Thao", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sheng Thao"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_News", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ABC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Crime_Reports", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Uniform Crime Reports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime_statistics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Crime statistics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rape"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robbery", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Robbery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homicide", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Homicide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assault", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assault"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violent_crime", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Violent crime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway,_South_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Conway, South Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Conway, South Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Prevention", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Prevention", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Research", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Research", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Internet_Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Internet Crime", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Publications", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Publications", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://wp.nysun.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/thao.jpg?w=1200&h=630&fit=fill&fm=jpg&fl=progressive", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9665632", "eventUri": "eng-9665632", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1058823529411765, "wgt": 167, "relevance": 1}

But the recall movement is all over the 2024 political landscape in the East Bay this year, as the effort to recall Alameda County DA Pamela Price has made the November 5 ballot. And so it is with the Oakland mayor's office too, as Oaklandside reports that the Recall Sheng Thao movement has gathered enough verified signatures to qualify for the November 5 ballot as well.\n\nRecall supporters needed 25,000 signatures to qualify, they got more than 40,000 which were verified. The November 5 date for the recall election is not a certainty, but according to Oaklandside, \"Under state law, the recall will most likely be folded into the November general election.\"\n\nSo will the recall effort succeed? The recall campaign's press conference announcement seen above did not have a particularly impressive turnout. But Thao is certainly hobbled by an increase in crime in Oakland (which has recently reversed), the year-long lack of a police chief (though Thao recently hired a new chief), and whether it's fair or not, the loss of the Oakland A's.\n\nAnd the recall campaign has tech mogul Ron Conway (as well as Conway's brother) among its top funders, so the effort is likely to benefit from significant amounts of out-of-town money.\n\nThao was barely elected in 2022 via ranked-choice voting, and a recall election brings challenges that ranked-choice winners do not enjoy. Ranked-choice winners get by on second- and third-place votes, recall elections are merely a 50% up-or-down vote.\n\nThao will be less than halfway through her duly elected term when the recall vote happens. And the recall-mania crowd seems to be figuring out, to paraphrase an old saying, \"If you can't beat 'em in a normal election, recall 'em.\"\n\nRelated: Very Predictably, Effort to Recall Oakland Mayor Sheng Thao Now Afoot [SFist]", "source": {"uri": "sfist.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SFist - San Francisco News, Restaurants, Events, & Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recall_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Recall election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheng_Thao", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sheng Thao"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mayor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "District attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Bay", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "East Bay"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gavin_Newsom", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gavin Newsom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oakland,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oakland, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oakland, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alameda_County,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alameda County, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Alameda County, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "General election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voter_turnout", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Voter turnout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instant-runoff_voting", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Instant-runoff voting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gothamist", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gothamist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oakland_Athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oakland Athletics"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law_Enforcement", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law Enforcement", "wgt": 5}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 6}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement/Climate_Control", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement/Climate Control", "wgt": 5}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Alternative_Political_Systems", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Alternative Political Systems", "wgt": 5}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://img.sfist.com/2024/06/GettyImages-2151163507.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9665632", "eventUri": "eng-9665632", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-11-05", "textStart": 558, "textEnd": 568, "freq": 3}], "sentiment": 0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 161, "relevance": 1}

The City Council is expected to discuss placing the recall on the November ballot during a July 2 meeting.\n\nEarlier this month, recall organizers submitted around 40,000 petitions to the city -- far more than 24,644 valid signatures needed to compel a new election.\n\nAfter randomly sampling a portion of the petitions, Alameda County's elections office estimated last week that the whole batch would exceed 110% of the necessary threshold. That's enough to trigger an election outright without a full manual count of signatures.\n\nOrganizers of the recall campaign, led by retired county judge Brenda Grisham and former mayoral candidate Seneca Scott, celebrated news of the validated signatures on social media.\n\n\"Thao's actions have pushed Oakland to the brink, but the community is saying, 'NO MORE. We want Thao gone,'\" Grisham said in a written statement.\n\nThao's opponents have pilloried her and other local progressives for the perception that she is soft on crime and bad at managing public money.\n\nOakland saw a devastating spike in crime during the pandemic that has slowly begun to recede: total citywide crime was down 33% as of Sunday from year-to-date statistics in 2023.\n\nThe city, entrenched in a staggering budget crisis, is planning to direct revenue from a private sale of its share of the Oakland Coliseum property toward its budget shortfall over the next two years -- a move criticized by financial experts as a shortsighted use of long-term funds.\n\nThao has pointed to her revival of the Ceasefire strategy, an anti-violence program in Oakland that slowed during the pandemic, as the cause behind the recent decline in crime.\n\nShe has also cited as success her support of outside investments in Oakland, including by the Ballers, a minor-league baseball team that formed this year ahead of the A's departure to Las Vegas via the Sacramento region.\n\nA once-rare political maneuver, recalls have gained prominence in California. Voters in Alameda County are pursuing a recall against District Attorney Pamela Price in November.\n\nPerhaps the largest source of criticism against Thao has come from supporters of the city's ex-police chief, LeRonne Armstrong, who sued the mayor after she fired him last January for his response to an internal cover-up scandal involving a city cop's hit-and-run.\n\nArmstrong, who is now

Sheng Thao (pictured right) will face a historic recall election in November amid anger over her failure to get a grip on the situation in Oakland.\n\nThe progressive Democrat lawmaker is the first mayor in the city's history to be up for recall, after a campaign to oust her gained more than 40,000 signatures. 'In just a year, Thao's incompetence and dishonesty accelerated Oakland's decline, causing longstanding businesses to close and generational families to leave,' the Oakland United to Recall Sheng Thao (OUST) campaign website states.\n\nCritics are also angry that she missed an opportunity to apply for a $15 million retail theft grant, fired Oakland Police chief LaRonne Armstrong, 'for no cause' without appointing a successor and lost the Oakland A's baseball team. They also accused her of lying about calling a State of Emergency to deal with the crime wave crippling the city. Oakland has been rocked by violent crime in recent months, including murders which have soared from 78 in 2019 to 126 last year.\n\nCrime overall increased by 18 percent in 2023 with property crime up 17 percent and violent crime up 21 percent. And in the first four months of 2024 residential robberies soared by 118 percent on the same period last year. Staggeringly, one car per every 30 residents was also stolen in 2023. The situation has prompted several large corporations to pull out of the city, citing fears for staff safety and the crippling impact of retail theft.\n\nDozens of stories of shocking crimes in Oakland have emerged in recent months. On Tuesday, a Florida family dropping their son off in the city for college enrollment had their hire car ransacked . The traumatized parents and their family have since fled the city and withdrawn their son from studying in the city.\n\nOakland's only In-N-Out Burger restaurant in the area closed after 18 years, despite still turning a healthy profit, as customers and staff are 'unsafe' due to soaring crime rates, the business said. The local Denny's also shut its doors, while Taco Bell refuses to allow indoor dining amid a spate of incidents. Earlier this year, Kaiser, PG&E, Clorox and Blue Shield announced they were plowing $10 million of their own cash into added security measures for their employees amid inaction from the city.\n\nThao's opponents blame her progressive policies for the skyrocketing crime. Among them was a bizarre proposal which suggested life coaching could help tackle homicides and other crimes. The scheme was suggested as part of the city's ceasefire plan which had been dwindling until Thao took office.\n\n'You created a public safety crisis by systematically dismantling the Oakland Police Department, leading to the city's reputation as one of the most dangerous in America,' OUST wrote to Thao in a statement. 'In short, you lack the competency, credibility, judgment and ability to lead what was once a great American city. Lives have been lost, property destroyed, businesses have shut down, and fear and collective trauma are daily occurrences for Oaklanders. We, the concerned citizens, therefore demand your recall for the sake of our city's future.'\n\nThe mayor has previously decried the increase in crime, stating that the uptick began in 2019 before her tenure. Also facing a recall in November is the progressive district attorney for Alameda County, which includes Oakland.\n\nPamela Price's policies have been blamed for emboldening criminals and prioritizing their needs over those of crime victims. In 2022, San Francisco, which sits just across the Bay Bridge from Oakland, recalled its progressive prosecutor Chesa Boudin following similar anger.\n\nWant more stories like this from the Daily Mail?

Crime in Oakland skyrocketed in 2023, when Oakland lacked a police chief for nearly a whole year, with a city-wide crime report showing motor vehicle theft was up 44%, robbery up 38%, violent crime up 21% and overall crime up 17%.\n\n\"[Thao] created a public safety crisis by systematically dismantling the Oakland Police Department, leading to the city's reputation as one of the most dangerous in America,\" the recall group alleges. \"Lives have been lost, property destroyed, businesses have shut down, and fear and collective trauma are daily occurrences for Oaklanders.

The mayor's spokesperson referred inquiries to the FBI, which confirmed only \"court-authorized law enforcement activity.\" The San Francisco Chronicle reports agents also conducted searches about 3 miles to the south at two homes owned by members of a politically influential family.\n\nFOX28 Spokane\u00a9", "source": {"uri": "fox28spokane.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "FOX 28 Spokane"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@fox28spokane.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": true}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oakland,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Oakland, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oakland, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheng_Thao", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sheng Thao"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mayor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_Chronicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco Chronicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spokane,_Washington", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spokane, Washington"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Spokane, Washington"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Construction_and_Maintenance/Residential_Housing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Construction and Maintenance/Residential Housing", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement/Design_and_Construction", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement/Design and Construction", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Life/Agents", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Life/Agents", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Publications", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Publications", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 50}], "image": "https://www.fox28spokane.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Featured-Image-Fallback-National-News-28.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9665632", "eventUri": "eng-9665632", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oakland, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 145, "relevance": 1}

The city of Oakland has seen a serious increase in crime. CNN published this summary back in February.\n\nRobberies grew 38% last year in Oakland, according to police data. Burglaries increased 23%. Motor vehicle theft jumped 44%. Roughly one of every 30 Oakland residents had a car stolen last year, according to a San Francisco Chronicle analysis.\n\nA recall effort was started against Oakland Mayor Sheng Thao and yesterday the leaders of that effort were notified that they had gathered enough signatures to get it on the ballot in November.\n\nThe decision means that Oakland voters will in all likelihood be given the opportunity to weigh in on whether to remove Thao from office less than two years into her tenure, pending any legal twists...\n\nA progressive wave that surged during the pandemic amid protests over the death of George Floyd -- and focused in part on reforming criminal justice systems -- has been met by an increasingly bold opposition, particularly after Chesa Boudin, a reform-minded prosecutor in San Francisco, was successfully recalled in 2022...\n\n\"With businesses closing daily, Oakland is effectively under siege,\" the group's website says. \"A new mayor is crucial for our city's recovery.\"\n\nSeneca Scott, one of the leaders of the recall effort, told NBC Bay Area the public response to their effort was strong.\n\nThe efforts to recall Mayor Thao began in January and Scott says they were able to gather just over 40,000 signatures.\n\n\"I think the numbers are clear, voters want Thao gone, voters want her gone,\" Scott said.\n\nMayor Thao's recall won't be the only one on the ballot. A similar effort to recall progressive DA Pamela Price has already been approved.\n\nA group that calls itself SAFE, or 'Save Alameda for Everyone,' has been on the ground collecting signatures county-wide since October to recall Price.\n\nOf the more than 123,000 signatures they collected and turned in last month, the Registrar of Voters says nearly 75,000 were valid, which is about 1,000 more than what was required to force a recall election (73,195).\n\nOf course getting a recall on the ballot doesn't guarantee its success but in Price's case, she has other serious problems surrounding her at the moment. Back in March she was accused of retaliation and discrimination by a former spokesperson named Patricia Lee. Last week Lee filed a lawsuit based on those claims.\n\nA former public information officer for Alameda County District Attorney Pamela Price has sued Price and the county, alleging that Price's agency fired her for speaking out against the altering or deleting of public records and because she is Asian American...\n\nIn her time working for the DA's office, Lee claimed she \"experienced a clear anti-Asian sentiment,\" including racist remarks from supervisors and Price herself. On one occasion, Price told Lee \"that her enemies were 'the media and the Asians,'\" Lee alleged.\n\nLee also claims that Price intentionally hid documents that were sought under California's public records act. When Lee complained about what she witnessed, she was fired and given 8 minutes to clear out her office.\n\nIn less than 5 months we'll find out if the city of Oakland is ready to cast aside progressive leaders and move in a more moderate direction. That would be an excellent start and another sign that even in deep blue California there are still a lot of \"normie voters\" willing to limit how far left things can go, especially when the results aren't good.", "source": {"uri": "hotair.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "HotAir"}, "authors": [{"uri": "john_sexton@hotair.com", "name": "John Sexton", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mayor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oakland,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Oakland, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oakland, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheng_Thao", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sheng Thao"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motor_vehicle_theft", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Motor vehicle theft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressivism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Progressivism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_Chronicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco Chronicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Floyd", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "George Floyd"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chesa_Boudin", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chesa Boudin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KNTV", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "KNTV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seneca_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Seneca people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Criminal justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "District attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosecutor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prosecutor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alameda_County,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alameda County, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Alameda County, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asian_Americans", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Asian Americans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recall_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Recall election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far-left_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Far-left politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrimination", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Discrimination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "County (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Racism"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/ha/images/up/2023/08/Oakland-break-in.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9665632", "eventUri": "eng-9665632", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 144, "relevance": 1}

FBI agents knocked on the door Thursday morning shouting, \"FBI open up,\" a witness said.\n\nAn hours-long raid ended when about a dozen FBI agents were seen carrying boxes and envelops out of the house. Agents declined to speak to reporters who asked questions as they left in black SUVs.\n\nAn FBI spokesperson told KRON4, \"The FBI is conducting court authorized law enforcement activity on Maiden Lane. We are unable to provide additional information at this time.\" Jones eventually left the house and declined to talk to reporters.\n\nThe raid was related to campaign finance violations, law enforcement sources told KRON4.\n\nFederal agents also raided a house at 12568 Skyline Blvd. in Oakland. The home is connected to David Duong, whose family owns the company Cal Waste Solutions. The company serves as Oakland's trash and recycling collector. Duong is the CEO of Cal Waste Solutions, as well as chairman of the Vietnamese American Business Association.\n\nThe FBI simultaneously searched two additional Oakland properties on Thursday, located at 1211 Embarcadero Way and 4320 View Crest Court.\n\nThe headquarters for Vietnamese American Business Association is located in suite 202 of 1211 Embarcadero Way, and Cal Waste Solutions has an office in suite 300.\n\nAnother member of the Duong family, Andy Duong, owns a house at 4320 View Crest Court.\n\nLast summer, Mayor Thao made her first official overseas trip when she led a trade delegation to Vietnam and promoted Oakland as a trading partner with Vietnam. The delegation was sponsored and planned by the Vietnamese American Business Association. VABA was formed by Victor Duong, vice president of California Waste Solutions.\n\nThe company's website states, \"Under the leadership of siblings David (President & CEO), Kristina (CFO), and Victor (Vice President), the Duongs have established the largest recycling company in Northern California, employing over 300 union and non-union workers directly from the communities they serve. California Waste Solutions serves the Oakland and San Jose communities, and also has created an integrated waste management facility in their native Vietnam.\"\n\nThao was a no-show at a pre-scheduled event on Thursday.\n\nThe mayor's office declined to comment about the FBI raid to KRON4.

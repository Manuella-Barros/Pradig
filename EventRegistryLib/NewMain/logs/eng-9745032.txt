There's no doubt about that, and you can reference \"Halfway To Hell\" or \"Need a Favor\" if you aren't familiar with the rapper-turned-country-star's work. This time around, he crafted a song specifically for the new Twisters blockbuster titled \"Dead End Road.\"\n\nThe new Twister reboot is tracking to be one of the highest earning movies of the summer. Some might say it's the visual effects and the enthralling story line (and Glen Powell) that's driving that success, but I've got another idea as to why the film is doing so well.\n\nIt's country-music-riddled soundtrack.\n\nBasically, Twisters has a country music all-star soundtrack, featuring the likes of Luke Combs, Tyler Childers, Lainey Wilson, Miranda Lambert and many other gigantic names that have all made new music specifically for the film. We thought there were some songs that they definitely could have included, but regardless, it's a jam-packed country music soundtrack.\n\nAnd it's intriguing to see how Jelly Roll put together this song for the movie, yet it fits in so well with the rest of his catalogue. If you just take a look at the chorus of the new track, you'll see that it shares a lot of the common themes of existing Jelly Roll songs:\n\n\"Cause that highway to hell is the road I'm on\n\nI need to turn around before I'm too far gone\n\nIf I'm ever gonna make it on them streets of gold\n\nI gotta quit livin' on a dead end road.\"\n\nHe made the exciting announcement that \"Dead End Road\" was officially released today - and joins the already released Twisters soundtrack:\n\nSome classic, speaker-bumping Jelly Roll right there.\n\nIf you enjoyed that short teaser, then make sure to check out the official music video for \"Dead End Road,\" which is linked below:", "source": {"uri": "whiskeyriff.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Whiskey Riff"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soundtrack", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Soundtrack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_effects", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Visual effects"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hell", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nashville,_Tennessee", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nashville, Tennessee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nashville, Tennessee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockbuster_(entertainment)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Blockbuster (entertainment)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Country music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jelly_Roll_(singer)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jelly Roll (singer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lainey_Wilson", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lainey Wilson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_End_(band)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dead End (band)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glen_Powell", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Glen Powell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyler_Childers", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tyler Childers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miranda_Lambert", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Miranda Lambert"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luke_Combs", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Luke Combs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recording_Industry_Association_of_America_certification", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Recording Industry Association of America certification"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_end_(street)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dead end (street)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refrain", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Refrain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_video", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Music video"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Recordings", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Recordings", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Musical", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Musical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Weddings/Music", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Weddings/Music", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.whiskeyriff.com/wp-content/uploads/Jelly-Roll-Twisters.jpg?fit=1200%2C628&ssl=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9745032", "eventUri": "eng-9745032", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 187, "relevance": 1}

His latest, the hard-charging \"Dead End Road,\" serves as the most recent release from the 29-track Twisters: The Album soundtrack.\n\n\"I'm just a blood-stained, folded hands/ Throwin' back the milligrams,\" he sings in \"Dead End Road,\" acknowledging the incessant tug to live life on the edge, regardless of the consequences. Jelly Roll (real name Jason DeFord) wrote \"Dead End Road\" with Jaxson Free, Taylor Phillips and Brock Berryhill.\n\nJelly Roll's newly released contribution to the Twisters: The Album soundtrack follows a steady slate of songs from the country-music-packed soundtrack. Luke Combs launched it earlier this year with the song \"Ain't No Love in Oklahoma,\" while artists including Bailey Zimmerman, Miranda Lambert, Conner Smith and Megan Moroney are also featured on the set.\n\nTwisters, which releases July 19, connects to the '90s hit movie and centers on a retired tornado chaser/meteorologist who returns to following tornadoes across Oklahoma. The film stars Daisy Edgar-Jones, Glen Powell and Anthony Ramos.\n\nThe release of Jelly Roll's song just before the movie's release is appropriate, given that the Tennessee native's ascendance to a top-tier act shows no signs of slowing down anytime soon. He's notched four No. 1 Billboard Country Airplay hits, and he's expanded his 2024 headlining Beautifully Broken Tour, which runs through November and features an array of openers, including Warren Zeiders, Billboard Hot 100-topping artist Shaboozey, Ernest, Alexandra Kay and Allie Colleen.

Rising stars like Daisy Edgar-Jones and Glen Powell headline the sequel, adding popular appeal and energy to the film's cast. The selection of songs throughout Twisters aims to capture the fun and excitement of a summer blockbuster experience for audiences.\n\nThe Twisters soundtrack is loaded with country songs, many of which were recorded and produced specifically for the movie, to help give audiences a great time. Set in modern Oklahoma, the Twister sequel is a mixture of recapturing the fun of the 1996 original and updating it for present-day audiences. This was done by having rising stars with popular followings like Daisy Edgar-Jones and Glen Powell headlining Twisters' cast. The film's goal of being the ideal summer blockbuster also means providing a great selection of songs throughout.\n\nThe original 1996 Twisters soundtrack relied heavily on pop and rock music to give audiences some recognizable music. The sequel went in a very different direction, embracing the Oklahoma setting for a set list primarily focused on country songs and artists. There are still some non-country music choices included in the movie. Regardless of the music genre, the 2024 blockbuster relies almost exclusively on using songs that were written specifically for the movie, with Luke Combs, Chris Stapleton, Miranda Lambert, Jelly Roll, and others contributing to Twisters' soundtrack.\n\nSong\n\nArtist\n\nSali\u00f3 El Sol\n\nDon Omar\n\nNever Left Me\n\nMegan Moroney\n\nDeath Wish Love\n\nBenson Boone\n\nAin't No Love In Oklahoma\n\nLuke Combs\n\nChasing the Wind\n\nLanie Gardner\n\nArkansas\n\nChris Stapleton\n\n(Ghost) Riders In The Sky\n\nCharley Crockett\n\nWall Of Death\n\nWilderado, Ken Pomeroy, & James McAlister\n\nSong While You're Away\n\nTyler Childers\n\nHell Or High Water\n\nBailey Zimmerman\n\nToo Easy\n\nTanner Adell\n\nDead End Road\n\nJelly Roll\n\nThe Star-Spangled Banner\n\nLeslie Powell\n\nFeelin' Country\n\nThomas Rhett\n\nThe Cards I've Been Dealt\n\nWarren Zeiders\n\nBoots Don't\n\nShania Twain & Breland\n\nCountry Classic\n\nKane Brown\n\nOut Of Oklahoma\n\nLainey Wilson\n\nChrome Cowgirl\n\nLeon Bridges\n\nSteal My Thunder (Feat.

Don Omar's song \"Sali\u00f3 El Sol\" plays on the radio, with Javi singing along to it at a certain point.\n\n\"Never Left Me\" by Megan Moroney - It is not until Kate returns to Oklahoma after the tornado accident that Megan Moroney's song is heard. \"Never Left Me\" plays as she and Javi drive through Oklahoma after leaving New York and prepare for their new goal.\n\n\"Death Wish Love\" by Benson Boone - Another piece of music can be heard as Kate is introduced to Javi's Storm Par team. \"Death Wish Love\" plays as she meets the team at an Oklahoman gas station. It mostly plays in the background of the scene.\n\n\"Ain't No Love In Oklahoma\" by Luke Combs - One of the can't miss songs on Twisters' soundtrack is Luke Combs' \"Ain't No Love In Oklahoma.\" It begins to play as Tyler and his team arrive at the same gas station. The country rock song announces Tyler's arrival amid plenty of fanfare.\n\n\"Chasing the Wind\" by Lanie Gardner - Lanie Gardner gets one of Twisters' songs when \"Chasing the Wind\" plays. It can be heard during the scenes where Kate figures out which storm to chase and leads Javi's team towards a tornado encounter.\n\n\"Arkansas\" by Chris Stapleton - As Kate and the Storm Par team go to find the tornado, they are suddenly cut off on the road when Tyler's team overtakes them on the road. This is when the movie blasts Chris Stapleton's song \"Arkansas,\" which is a fitting decision considering Tyler is from the state the song is named after.\n\n\"(Ghost) Riders In The Sky\" by Charley Crockett - Another extremely memorable song on the Twisters soundtrack is \"(Ghost) Riders In The Sky\" by Charley Crockett. It begins to play after Kate drives Javi's truck away from the tornado, allowing Tyler to swoop in and drive straight into the storm's base. It continues as he shoots fireworks into the tornado for his followers.\n\n\"(Ghost) Riders In The Sky\" was originally written by Stan Jones in 1948, with many covers being recorded since then, including one by Johnny Cash.\n\n\"Wall Of Death\" by Wilderado, Ken Pomeroy, & James McAlister - Richard Thompson's song \"Wall of Death\" gets an acoustic cover performed by Wilderado, Ken Pomeroy, and James McAlister in Twisters. The song is briefly heard as three musicians play it by a bonfire in front of the motel where Kate, Tyler, and others are staying.\n\n\"Song While You're Away\" by Tyler Childers - The next song on Twisters' soundtrack is \"Song While You're Away\" by Tyler Childers. It is heard in the background as Kate talks to Tyler and his team at the motel when she goes back to her room after the first day.\n\n\"Hell Or High Water\" by Bailey Zimmerman - In the morning, Kate goes to the nearby diner to find Javi and his partner talking to their investor. It is during this scene that \"Hell Or High Water\" can be heard playing in the background through the restaurant's speakers.\n\n\"Too Easy\" by Tanner Adell - Twisters gets a jolt of energy when Tanner Adell's \"Too Easy\" begins to play shortly thereafter. It begins to play as Kate and Tyler race to leave the diner first so they can chase the same storm cell.\n\n\"Dead End Road\" by Jelly Roll - Rapper Jelly Roll gets his first song on the Twisters soundtrack with \"Dead End Road.\" This song begins to play when Tyler and Kate split off and go after different tornadoes from the same storm. \"Dead End Road\" is heard as Tyler goes after the tornado on the right and thinks he made the right decision, only to learn that he was wrong.\n\n\"The Star-Spangled Banner\" by Leslie Powell - The United States of America's National Anthem also plays during a part of Twisters. Leslie Powell performs it at the beginning of a rodeo show that Tyler and Kate go to.\n\n\"Feelin' Country\" by Thomas Rhett, \"The Cards I've Been Dealt\" by Warren Zeiders, \"Boots Don't\" by Shania Twain & Breland, and \"Country Classic\" by Kane Brown - The rodeo scene features brief sections of four new songs. Thomas Rhett, Warren Zeiders, Shania Twain, Breland, and Kane Brown all have snippets of their songs from the Twisters soundtrack play during the scenes.\n\nShania Twain is the only music artist to have songs in both Twister movies\n\n\"Out Of Oklahoma\" by Lainey Wilson - Country artist Lainey Wilson gets a pivotal song in Twisters when \"Out Of Oklahoma\" begins to play. It is heard after Kate has a fight with Javi and drives away. The song continues to play as she drives across Oklahoma to clear her mind and go home.\n\n\"Chrome Cowgirl\" by Leon Bridges - \"Chrome Cowgirl\" is heard in the movie when old footage of Kate working in her parents' barn begins to play. Recorded by her boyfriend, the song plays in the background as she works on her formula to tame a tornado.\n\n\"Steal My Thunder (Feat. Tucker Wetmore)\" by Conner Smith - After Tyler comes to Kate's mom's house and convinces her to test out her formula again, a montage of them working together is set against \"Steal My Thunder.\" Conner Smith and Tucker Wetmore's song lifts the spirits of the movie as Tyler and Kate have fun together in the field.\n\n\"Already Had It\" by Tucker Wetmore - The next song in Twisters plays when Kate meets with Tyler's team. It plays as they make necessary changes to their equipment so they can test out the revised formula to disrupt a tornado.\n\n\"Tear Us Apart\" by Sam Barber - Viewers will hear Sam Barber's song \"Tear Us Apart\" during Twisters' ending. It is part of the final act as Kate and Tyler go to test the new formula before stopping to save people in a nearby town.\n\n\"Run Horse Run\" by Charley Crockett - The final scene in Twisters is set against Charley Crockett's \"Run Horse Run.\" It plays as Kate goes into the airport so she can return to New York while Tyler watches her from outside. \"Run Horse Run\" continues as he decides to run into the airport after her.\n\n\"Ain't In Kansas Anymore\" by Miranda Lambert - The beginning of Twisters' credits are set to Miranda Lambert's song \"Ain't In Kansas Anymore.\" It continues to play as additional footage from the production is shown and a few updates on Kate, Tyler, and Javi's life appear on-screen.\n\n\"Leave The Light On\" by Jelly Roll (Feat. Alexandra Kay) - Jelly Roll gets the last song on the Twisters soundtrack as \"Leave The Light On\" plays over the second part of the credits. It features Alexandra Kay, as she joins Jelly Roll to close out the movie.\n\nWhere To Listen To The Twisters Soundtrack\n\nBenjamin Wallfisch Did The Score Too\n\nThe official Twisters soundtrack is available on music streaming platforms such as Apple Music and Spotify. \"Twisters: The Album\" contains 29 songs, including eight new songs not featured in the movie.

While the blockbuster has a lot going for it, the soundtrack is proving to be one of its strongest aspects. Comb through Roll's addition, \"Dead End Road,\" with us, below.\n\nVideos by American Songwriter\n\n[RELATED: Jelly Roll Pens Heartfelt Tribute to \"Childhood Hero\" Eminem, Talks the Rapper Bringing Him to Tears]\n\nBehind the Meaning of Jelly Roll's 'Twisters' Soundtrack Inclusion, \"Dead End Road\"\n\nDespite this song being written specifically for the film, the country singer manages to keep true to himself. He doesn't drop his inspirational and motivating style of writing. The sentiment behind \"Dead End Road\" sees Roll attempt to change his trajectory in life.\n\nI'm just an underthinkin', overusin', tall drinkin', short fusin'\n\nGettin' in my own way\n\nI'm just a blood-stained, folded hands\n\nThrowin' back the milligrams\n\nLike many of his songs, this track is candid about drug issues and other addictions. Roll has never been afraid to highlight his rough edges, in an effort to help others overcome their obstacles. Though the musicality of this song is rough-and-tumble country rock-perfect for a blockbuster-the lyrics are intimate and powerful.\n\n'Cause that highway to hell is the road I'm on\n\nI need to turn around before I'm too far gone\n\nIf I'm ever gonna make it on them streets of gold\n\nI gotta quit livin' on a dead end road\n\nIn the chorus, the singer recognizes that the path he's on only ends one way. 'Cause that highway to hell is the road I'm on, he sings. He turns heel and tries to find a new way forward-one that will have a better ending.\n\nThis song is tailor-made for Twisters and its life-or-death scenarios. But, what is so stellar about \"Dead End Road\" is that it could stand on its own in Roll's advice-heavy discography.

If you buy from a link, we may earn a commission. Why Trust Us?\n\nThe highly anticipated Twisters movie is here, and it has nostalgic vibes for fans of the 1996 hit starring Helen Hunt and Bill Paxton. While there is no replacing the original (and this is technically a sequel, not a remake), we're certainly happy that Glen Powell is giving it a try.\n\nThe new movie, in theaters now, focuses on a team of storm chasers in Oklahoma (if you haven't gotten tickets yet, go ahead and order them now). While it promises a disaster-based thrill ride, Twisters is getting attention for another reason: Its incredible soundtrack. The track list is basically a who's who of country music stars today. We're talking Miranda Lambert, Luke Combs, Jelly Roll, Thomas Rhett, Shania Twain...the list goes on and on -- for 29 songs!\n\n3. Conner Smith - \"Steal My Thunder (feat. Tucker Wetmore)\"\n\n28.

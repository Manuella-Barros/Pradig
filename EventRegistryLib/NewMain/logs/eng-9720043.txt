Let them do their job in accordance with law, let them do whatever they have to,\" Siddaramaiah told reporters here in response to a question on the raids.\n\nThe illegal money transfer issue, involving the Corporation, came to the fore, after its accounts superintendent, Chandrasekharan P killed himself on May 26.\n\nHe left behind a note claiming unauthorised transfer of Rs 187 crore belonging to the Corporation from its bank account; from that, Rs 88.62 crore was illegally moved to various accounts allegedly belonging to \"well-known\" IT companies and a Hyderabad-based cooperative bank among others.\n\nChandrasekharan has named the Corporation's now-suspended Managing Director J G Padmanabh, accounts officer Parashuram G Durugannavar, and Union Bank of India Chief Manager Suchismita Rawal in the note, while also stating that the \"Minister\" had issued oral orders for transferring the funds.\n\nFollowing allegations against him in connection with the scam, Nagendra, who was Scheduled Tribes Welfare Minister, tendered his resignation on June 6.\n\nThe state government has constituted an SIT headed by Manish Kharbikar, Additional Director General of Police, Economic Offences, at the Criminal Investigation Department (CID), to conduct the probe.\n\nThe SIT questioned Nagendra and Daddal on Tuesday in connection with the case.\n\nMumbai-headquartered Union Bank of India had also filed a complaint with the CBI in connection with embezzlement of money belonging to the Corporation involving its MG Road branch, following which the premier investigation agency had initiated a probe.\n\nMeanwhile, State BJP chief B Y Vijayendra said that based on the Union Bank of India's letter, the CBI has registered an FIR, and now the ED is also conducting raids in connection with the case. \"We welcome ED raids on Nagendra and Daddal.\" \"This is probably a big corruption scam that is unheard of in the state's history. The money that was kept for ST communities has been misused by siphoning off to other states for the elections there and for the Lok Sabha polls,\" he alleged.\n\nVijayendra further said that until a couple of days ago SIT that was constituted by the state government did not even bother to give notice to Nagendra and Daddal in connection with the case, and it was only due to pressure from the BJP they were called for inquiry.

You (media) ask things just because the BJP is alleging.\" Once the SIT submits the report after a probe, action will be taken and responsibility will be fixed, he said, adding that \"without a report being submitted, how can the responsibility be fixed?\" The ED has been carrying out searches since Wednesday, including at the premises of a former minister in the Siddaramaiah government, B Nagendra, and ruling Congress MLA Basanagouda Daddal, who is Chairman of the Corporation, official sources said.\n\nThe agency covered around 20 locations in Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Maharashtra as part of the case registered under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), the sources said.\n\nMeanwhile, Deputy Chief Minister D K Shivakumar in Bengaluru said, ED searches were not required as SIT has already conducted searches and have recovered certain money.\n\n\"The CBI has the provision that, in case there are irregularities over a certain amount, they can look into it. There was no need for ED (to get involved). No one had given any complaint to ED....there is a system they can't take up just because anyone says something,\" he said.\n\nThe government itself had handed over the probe to SIT. Investigations are on by them and they have served notices to some people in connection with a case, Shivakumar said.\n\nNagendra, who was minister, has voluntarily resigned to enable a free and fair probe. \"We have cross examined, he has explained to us, he has not done any signature anywhere and is not involved. In accordance with the law probe was on, but in between that the ED has done searches now, let's see,\" he said.\n\nAsked whether ED searches are politically motivated, the deputy chief minister said, \"let them finish it (searches), we will talk later.\" The illegal money transfer issue, involving the Corporation, came to the fore after its accounts superintendent, Chandrasekharan P killed himself on May 26.\n\nHe left behind a note claiming unauthorised transfer of Rs 187 crore belonging to the Corporation from its bank account; from that, Rs 88.62 crore was illegally moved to various accounts allegedly belonging to \"well-known\" IT companies and a Hyderabad-based cooperative bank among others.\n\nChandrasekharan has named the Corporation's now-suspended Managing Director J G Padmanabh, accounts officer Parashuram G Durugannavar, and Union Bank of India Chief Manager Suchismita Rawal in the note, while also stating that the \"Minister\" had issued oral orders for transferring the funds.\n\nFollowing allegations against him in connection with the scam, Nagendra, who was Scheduled Tribes Welfare Minister, tendered his resignation on June 6.\n\nThe state government has constituted an SIT headed by Manish Kharbikar, Additional Director General of Police, Economic Offences, at the Criminal Investigation Department (CID), to conduct the probe.\n\nSIT had questioned Nagendra and Daddal on Tuesday in connection with the case.\n\nMumbai-headquartered Union Bank of India had also lodged a complaint with the CBI in connection with embezzlement of money belonging to the Corporation involving its MG Road branch, following which the premier investigation agency had initiated a probe.

Nagendra, who resigned as minister for Scheduled Tribes Welfare on June 6 in connection with the alleged scam, and Raichur Rural MLA Basanagouda Daddal, who is Chairman of the corporation.\n\nThe ED raids come a day after Mr. Nagendra and Mr. Daddal, were questioned in connection with the scam by the SIT, on July 9.

I am confident that he will come out clean after the investigations. The perpetrators of this case must be brought to book. There were similar cases during the previous BJP government.\"\n\nHe further said that investigations revealed that there was no involvement of Nagendra and Valmiki Board Chairman Daddal in the case.\n\nHe said, \"I don't know the details of the raids. The SIT had issued a notice to Nagendra and Daddal in the case and the investigations so far have revealed that there is no involvement of the minister and the MLA.\"\n\nOn his visit to Nonavinakere Mutt, he said that he had been coming here for a long time.\n\nHe said, \"It is my faith and belief. I haven't gone to Handanakere Mutt, but I have got a road done to the Siddeshwara temple.

The Special Investigation Team (SIT) has seized Rs 14.5 crore out of the remaining \u20b960 crore.\n\nThe raids that happened in over 20 places were linked to Congress Ballari Rural MLA Nagendra, who recently resigned from his post as minister for Scheduled Tribes Welfare in the Siddaramaiah government on June 6 after his alleged involvement in the scam surfaced. Another Congress Raichur Rural MLA Basanagouda Daddal is the Chairman of the corporation.\n\nED has also searched Nagendra's three residences -- two in Bengaluru and one in Ballari city. Daddal's residence in Raichur, his room in the Legislator's Home in Bengaluru, and the corporation's head office in Vasanth Nagar were also raided. Both the legislators were present at their residences during the raids. Subsequently, they were questioned by ED as part of the investigation.\n\nPolitical Analyst Rajendra Chenni commented, \"The recent raid by the ED is part of the central government exercising its powers to show there is a collision in the State government. This might be done to create a feeling of inadequacy and destabilise the government.\"\n\nA day earlier, both ministers were questioned regarding the alleged scam by the State government nominated SIT, which to date, has arrested 11 persons.\n\nThe 'scam' was detected after Chandrasekharan P, the Accounts Superintendent of the Corporation, who allegedly took his own life in May. In a suicide note, he mentioned the alleged transfer of \u20b988 crore.\n\n\"The State government has initiated an SIT probe and is interrogating people. There is a provision that if banks defraud more than three crores, they also can ask the CBI and ED to inquire. As a party, we will wait for the outcomes of the raid and investigation. Ultimately, the culprits must face the consequences and the law of the land,\" said B L Shankar, Congress spokesperson.\n\nAccording to reports, ED also raided key accused J. J. Padmanabh, Managing Director of the corporation, Parashuram, the corporation's accountant, three employees of the Union Bank of India, M. G. Road branch in Bengaluru where the alleged money laundering happened. Interestingly the ED has taken security cover from the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) for the raids and not that of the Karnataka State Police.\n\nSHARE Copy

When the CBI probe is going on, the Karnataka government formed an SIT to hide this scam. Now the SIT is not helping the CBI, but the probe is going on and the ED conducted raids.

Sriramulu said.\n\nHe said that there is also an SIT investigation and that the ED has conducted raids in 18 locations. He suggested that the raids might be based on a complaint filed by Union Bank to the CBI. He charged that Rs 80 lakh had been transferred from the Valmiki Corporation to the account of Harish, who was Nagendra's PA.\n\nHe also criticised the state Home Minister G. Parameshwara for saying that they were not aware of the ED raids and claimed that the government was a part of this major scam.\n\n\"The people of the state are calling this a shameless government and referring to it as a government of thieves. After a robbery, the thieves need to be caught. The ED has already caught an associate of the kingpin in the scam. The ED is proceeding to identify the kingpin,\" he said.\n\nBJP state President B. Y. Vijayendra also criticised the Karnataka government over the alleged diversion of funds meant for Dalits to other categories.", "source": {"uri": "thehansindia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hans India"}, "authors": [{"uri": "hans_india@thehansindia.com", "name": "Hans India", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enforcement_Directorate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Enforcement Directorate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valmiki", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Valmiki"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharatiya_Janata_Party", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bharatiya Janata Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karnataka", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Karnataka"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Karnataka"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B._Nagendra", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "B.

Allegations of Rs 89.63 crore scam involving ST welfare funds lead to minister's resignation. Government awaits SIT report before taking further action. Bank officials implicated in fraudulent activities, with recovery efforts ongoing. Tragic suicide note sheds light on unauthorized fund transfers within the corporation.Karnataka Deputy Chief Minister DK Shivakumar on Thursday said the series of raids by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) officials on Wednesday on the residential premises of two Congress MLAs and others in connection with the diversion of funds meant for ST welfare were not necessary.\n\nShivakumar, who is also the president of Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC), said a special investigation team (SIT) of the state police was already conducting investigations into illegal diversion Maharshi Valmiki ST Development Corporation's funds.\n\nThe Dy CM admitted that there had been irregularities in the case, and the SIT will come up with its findings. The government was also attaching the funds that had been misused. The ED could have, later, evaluated if the SIT investigation was in order. \"I don't know why ED is conducting raids now. The investigations are going on in a free and fair manner. Let's see what the ED will do.\"\n\nHe said he would comment if the raids were politically motivated after the ED's probe was complete.\n\nShivakumar was commenting on a series of search operations ED conducted in Karnataka, Telangana and Andhra Pradesh over a scandal involving illegal transfer of Rs 89.63 crore of government funds to unknown people in Hyderabad. The unearthing of the scam led to the resignation of state's tribal welfare and sports minister B Nagendra.\n\nSenior BJP leader B Sriramulu on Thursday alleged that the corporation's scamsters honey-trapped government and bank officials to misappropriate the ST welfare funds. The former minister said funds meant for the welfare of tribals were used to buy luxury cars, including a Lamborghini.\n\nACTION AFTER REPORT:\n\nChief Minister Siddaramaiah told the media that CBI, SIT and ED were all investigating the case. The government was yet to receive a preliminary report from the SIT. The team may give its report probably after a charge sheet was filed. The government would act after receipt of the report.\n\nA group of people allegedly played fraud on the bank and siphoned off the funds, allocated to the Corporation for the welfare of scheduled tribe members, between February 21 and May 6 this year. The alleged fraud came to light only on May 24, after the corporation managing director wrote to UBI's MG Road branch.\n\nThe bank, in its complaint to the CBI, said it had been able to recover Rs 5 crore while Rs 84.63 crore remained unrecovered from the recipients of funds from illegal transfers.\n\nIn May, P Chandrashekar, an accounts superintendent at the corporation, ended his life leaving a suicide note accusing his higherups of pushing him to open parallel bank account for diversion of funds from the corporation's primary account. The note revealed the unauthorised transfer of funds and named the corporation's MD, accounts officer and the bank's chief manager for the fraud, while alleging that it was done under the oral orders of the minister.", "source": {"uri": "economictimes.indiatimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Economic Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enforcement_Directorate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Enforcement Directorate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_National_Congress", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indian National Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheduled_Castes_and_Scheduled_Tribes", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welfare", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Welfare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chief minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karnataka_Pradesh_Congress_Committee", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_rupee", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Indian rupee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crore", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Crore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karnataka", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Karnataka"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Karnataka"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_deputy_chief_ministers_of_Maharashtra", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "List of deputy chief ministers of Maharashtra"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Suicide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B._Nagendra", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "B.

We held today's party meeting to analyse where we made mistakes... I know BJP and JD(S) will fight together in alliance. We are looking at what we can do in the future,\" Shivakumar told reporters.\n\nOn Karnataka Congress meeting over Lok Sabha results, party leader MB Patil said, \"In the meeting, it was discussed why we could not reach the 15 seats target. I briefed about my parliamentary segment.\"\n\nOver the Enforcement Directorate raids in the Valmiki Development Corporation case were unwarranted, Karnataka Deputy CM said that there was no need to ED raid.\n\n\"There was no need to ED raid. Our SIT officers have already done an investigation and money has been recovered. CBI have already filed an FIR and they have provisions to take up the investigation, ED doesn't have that provision. There is a procedure for how it can be done, not on NR Ramesh or somebody's complaint ED can do an investigation,\" he added.\n\nThe development comes after ED conducted raids at many places on Wednesday allegedly linked to former Karnataka Minister B Nagendra and MLA Basanagouda Daddal in connection with the embezzlement of funds in Valmiki Development Corporation.\n\nOn NCSC's notice to Karnataka over the alleged diversion of SC/ST funds, Shivakumar said that there is nothing wrong with it.\n\n\"We have brought a law, whatever money we are spending, we are spending to the same community people, like this percentage of money we are going to spend on the concerned. First, it was brought in Andhra Pradesh, then we have brought it. There is nothing wrong in it,\" he said.\n\nThe BJP and JD-S allied to contest the Lok Sabha election in Karnataka, with the former fighting on 25 seats, while the latter is contesting on three seats.\n\nIn the 2019 elections, the BJP almost swept the state by winning 25 out of 28 seats.

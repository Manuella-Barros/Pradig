{"id": 223751904, "title": "Novak Djokovic enters the French Open with 'low expectations and high hopes'", "text": "PARIS (AP) \u2014 Novak Djokovic has yet to win a title this season. Hasn\u2019t even reached a final. His schedule has been lighter than usual, and so has his record, which is just 14-6 entering the French Open. So this is how he framed his outlook for Roland Garros on Sunday: \u201cLow expectations and high hopes.\u201d And just how low are those expectations? Well, this is Novak Djokovic we\u2019re talking about \u2014 the owner of 24 Grand Slam titles, including his third in Paris a year ago, and more time at No. 1 than any player in the history of the computerized rankings \u2014 so his definition of that phrase differs greatly from pretty much anyone else\u2019s. \u201cIt\u2019s tough to talk about. It\u2019s very subjective. I almost feel a bit embarrassed to say what my expectations are. Anything but a title for me is not satisfactory. It always has been like that,\u201d Djokovic said. \u201cIt might sound arrogant to a lot of people, but I think I have the career that backs it up.\u201d Sure does. Which is why Djokovic, who turned 37 on Wednesday, probably figures what has been going on this year does not necessarily mean he can\u2019t turn it on when it counts the most. And why other players, such as two-time French Open runner-up Casper Ruud, agree with that assessment. \u201cTo me, even though Novak hasn\u2019t had the best year as he typically has, or the same level, I think he is still the favorite,\u201d Ruud said. \u201cHe is the No. 1 seed, and he has 24 Slams under his belt, so if there\u2019s anyone who knows when to find their peak and form, it\u2019s probably him.\u201d Djokovic is coming off a loss in the semifinals at the Geneva Open, a lower-tier event that he normally would never enter on the eve of a major. He said after that defeat that he had stomach problems. Before that came a second-round loss at the Italian Open \u2014 and a bizarre episode in which a spectator\u2019s water bottle conked him in the head after a match \u2014 which was preceded by a semifinal setback against Rudd at Monte Carlo. In all, Djokovic is 0-3 in semifinals this season \u2014 he was beaten at that stage by Jannik Sinner at the Australian Open \u2014 and this is only the second time since Djokovic won his first ATP title in 2006 that he has entered the French Open without getting to least one final anywhere. He\u2019s taken some time off, too, missing tournaments in Miami and Madrid, for example. On Saturday, he alluded in a vague way to off-court matters that have affected him in 2024, saying only that there were \u201cvarious things that were happening in the last couple of months, but I don\u2019t want to get into it. I hope you understand that. It\u2019s just I don\u2019t want open Pandora\u2019s Box and talk about things.\u201d As for the source of the \u201chigh hopes\u201d he mentioned Sunday? \u201cI would say that I know what I\u2019m capable of, and particularly in the Grand Slams, I normally play the best tennis \u2014 at least I aim always to play the best tennis \u2014 and I was most of my career able to do that, so that\u2019s the goal,\u201d Djokovic said. \u201cIt does affect me, the five months that I had so far in the year that haven\u2019t been great in terms of my tennis,\u201d he acknowledged. \u201cThat\u2019s why I have kind of an approach that is focused on a daily basis more trying to build the form and momentum, so that I can have a better chance to reach further in the tournament.\u201d ___ Howard Fendrich has been the AP\u2019s tennis writer since 2002.

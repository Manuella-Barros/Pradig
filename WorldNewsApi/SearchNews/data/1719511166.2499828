Tim Scott (R-SC) tore into President Joe Biden\u2018s record on race and racial justice in response to Biden campaign ads criticizing former President Donald Trump. Scott, the U.S. Senate\u2018s only black Republican and a candidate to become Trump\u2019s new vice president, contended a second Trump administration appealed to the black community because of jobs and justice issues. \u201cIf you\u2019re really concerned about racial justice in America, let\u2019s not forget Joe Biden is the guy who talked about racial jungles as a result of desegregation,\u201d Scott said on CNN\u2019s State of the Union on Sunday. \u201cLet\u2019s not forget the fact that Joe Biden is the president who said if you don\u2019t vote for me, you can\u2019t be black.\u201d \u201cThis is the president who said that the Republican Party wants to put you back in chains,\u201d he said. \u201cThe only person I\u2019ve seen restraining black folks economically is the Joe Biden economy. So I find it quite insulting to suggest that Joe Biden does not have serious concerns.\u201d Scott alleged Biden\u2019s lack of support for charter schools in cities such as Chicago is an education policy that \u201cresegregates schools in America.\u201d \u201cWe need four more years of common sense under Donald Trump and not four more years of segregation under Joe Biden and his approach to allowing poor black kids to go to any school in their own cities,\u201d he said. When asked for clarification, Scott double-downed on his comments, claiming, \u201cSchools in our largest cities are being resegregated.\u201d \u201cJoe Biden\u2019s Department of Education has halted the growth of charter schools that provide greater diversity and opportunities,\u201d Scott said. \u201cIn the city of Chicago today, more black kids are not allowed to go to public schools in their own city. The president of the United States refuses to stand up to the teachers unions, and, as a result, the future of these kids will be lower and devastated.\u201d \u201cThe closest thing to magic in America is a good education and the place where you can\u2019t find that is in blue cities, dominated by a monopoly on their city councils, where they refuse, refuse to allow poor kids, typically black, to attend public schools within their own cities,\u201d he added. One of the two ads the Biden campaign launched last week criticizing Trump\u2019s race record described the former president as \u201cdisrespecting\u201d black people when he \u201cstood with violent white supremacists and warned of a blood bath, if he loses the next election.\u201d The ads are part of the campaign\u2019s May push to \u201cramp up investments to bolster its existing, historic efforts to reach the voters that will decide this election,\u201d according to the campaign. Trump is trying to encourage the erosion of Biden\u2019s support among black people, a key component of the Democratic coalition. Trump averages a 1 percentage point edge over Biden, per RealClearPolitics.", "summary": "Sen.

The surprise show featured heavy hitters like Future, Jeremih and more.\n\nThe historic Bud Billiken Parade -- considered the largest and one of the oldest African-American parades in the country -- kicked off in Bronzeville and extended two miles along the route south to Washington Park. As Chance waved to the crowed, he was followed by his charity organization, SocialWorks, which in partnership with STATE Bags handed out some 30,000 backpacks, filled with supplies, to some clearly thrilled parade-goers.\n\nWhile the parade was in full swing, Chance announced his other big freebie for Chicagoans, the surprise aftershow, as it were. \"I'm handing out free tickets all day long,\" he told ABC7. \"I wanted to make sure I can identify all those teachers that support our youth and build our children up, all those fathers that are out here with their families, the cornerstones of their houses, bringing their families out -- I wanted to make sure I can identify y'all so my people can get you some free tickets.\"\n\nCheck out the gallery above for some classic Bud Billiken sights, including those dazzling marching bands and drum lines.

But the singer's ordeal isn't over quite yet. While U.S. District Judge William Martinez threw out David Mueller's case against Swift on Friday, identical allegations against her mother and her radio liaison are expected to go to jurors Monday. Mueller sued the three after Swift's team reported the alleged 2013 assault in Denver to his bosses. He is seeking up to $3 million, saying the allegation cost him his reputation and his job. Swift countersued Mueller, saying she wanted a symbolic $1 and the chance to stand up for other women. The jury will still consider her assault claim. \"I couldn't be more proud to represent somebody like Taylor Swift who's willing to step up in a situation like this,\" attorney Douglas Baldridge said outside court Friday. He also expressed his gratitude for the judge. Mueller's team didn't comment on the decision, which followed days of testimony from the singer and others, and just before jurors were set to hear closing arguments. Swift spent an hour on the witness stand Thursday recounting what she called a \"despicable and horrifying and shocking\" encounter before a concert. \"He stayed attached to my bare ass-cheek as I lurched away from him,\" she testified. \"It was a definite grab. A very long grab,\" she added in her testimony.\n\n* Grammy Award-winning artist Chance the Rapper rode through the streets of his Chicago hometown as grand marshal of the city's back-to-school parade. The 24-year-old rapper sat atop a white convertible waving at the crowds during Saturday's Bud Billiken Parade, which welcomes Chicago children back for the new school year. It's not the first time Chance has been involved with Chicago Public Schools. Earlier this year he donated $1 million. He also was part of an effort to distribute thousands of free backpacks stuffed with school supplies at the parade. He has urged politicians to help the schools, as well. He told WLS-TV that he wants to \"make sure everything is a little easier\" for students, teachers and parents. The rapper, whose name is Chancelor Bennett, won three Grammys in February. The first Bud Billiken Parade was held in 1929.", "time": "07:55:00"}

But the familiar sights and sounds of the parade -- the sequin leotards, the rumbling snare drums, the sweet scent of barbecue wafting from backyard grills -- were overshadowed Saturday by the parade's grand marshal.\n\n\"Chance! CHANCE!\" children yelled as they pushed through crowds, hoping to catch a glimpse of Chance the Rapper, the 24-year-old local musician who rose to greater fame this year by winning three Grammy Awards and donating $1 million to Chicago Public Schools. One group of kids ran down the entire parade route, trying to keep up with the white convertible driving him so that he wouldn't leave their sights.\n\nFor several families, no one was better suited to lead the historically back-to-school celebration than Chance, who isn't shy about championing youth empowerment or standing up for Chicago schoolchildren. Trailing the white convertible was a U-Haul truck from which volunteers with the rapper's local charity SocialWorks unloaded 30,000 backpacks stuffed with school supplies. Children cheered as they were handed backpacks by volunteers.\n\n\"A water bottle! Headphones! Oh, my God!\" cried out 7-year-old Xavier Pratt. The second grader at Heather Hill Elementary in Flossmoor rummaged through the backpack as though it was a Christmas stocking. There were pens and pencils, Post-it notes, a notebook and a sturdy folder. His cousin Kailyn Paschal, a third grader at Calvary Academy in South Holland, was just as delighted.\n\n\"This is lit! This is lit!\" Kailyn said as she pulled out each item. She was excited to come to the parade this year to see Chance, but would've attended the parade regardless, she said.\n\n\"This is tradition,\" she said. \"Something we always do.\"\n\nChance stole the show with a second giveaway: tickets to a free concert Saturday evening at Auditorium Theatre, 50 E. Congress Pkwy. He posted on Twitter on Saturday afternoon that the tickets had been available at locations around the city, but that they were all gone. He told his followers \"stay tuned\" for more opportunities to get into the concert.", "time": "21:45:00"}

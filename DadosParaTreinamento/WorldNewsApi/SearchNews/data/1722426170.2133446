Neither was known to each other as the violent encounter escalated into murderous rage at 7.30pm on July 21 last year. There were lots of people out socialising on the Friday evening in Cleethorpes. Tom, a fish supply business employee who had worked on Grimsby docks for over 15 years, was out enjoying an evening with his friend. Closed circuit television footage from a number of bars was also compiled into a timeline by Detective Constable Lister of Humberside Police to show where the individuals had been drinking and \"behaving in a way consistent with being intoxicated\" as the prosecutor Sam Green KC told the murder trial at Grimsby Crown Court. READ MORE: Hulse, 22, of Chester Walk Grimsby was stood with his girlfriend, Gabrielle Hough when Tom, 32, and his pal Jack Kitchen walked past. A rude remark directed by Kitchen towards his girlfriend led Hulse to shout verbal abuse at the two men. Daniel Champion had been drinking with Hulse and Hough and he joined in the violent exchange. Within 90 seconds, Champion had been kicked unconscious by Kitchen and Hulse drew a lock knife from his waistband and began slashing at the men, Seconds later the cameras captured the fatal blow to the left side of Tom's head. At the trial at Grimsby Crown Court, Hulse claimed he had used the knife to \"scare them away\" and he recalled \"only waving it.\" The prosecutor said Tom, a father to five children and step father to one, died on August 15 nearly four weeks after the fatal blow with the knife. \"He was stabbed with sufficient force for the knife to penetrate his skull and enter his brain,\" he said. He added: \"The Prosecution case is that Connor Hulse was the person who stabbed him and that Connor Hulse is, therefore, guilty of murder.\" It took the jury just two hours to find Hulse guilty of murder earlier this week. He is due to be sentenced in a few weeks. The events which led to the fatal encounter were expertly compiled by detectives from Humberside Police in their thorough investigation into the murder of Tom Gaughan. Hulse had taken cocaine, four pregabalin tablets and had been drinking through the afternoon. He had visited Boston Brothers bar in Grimsby Top Town, The Nunsthorpe Tavern and Zero Degrees North on Cleethorpes High Street and The Swashbuckle on Grant Street. The group of three, including Champion and Hough had been ejected from the High Street bar after they had all been in the Ladies Toilets. In court Hulse said he had been engaging in sex acts. In The Swashbuckle, CCTV captured Hulse lying on top of Hough in the corner of a seated area , simulating a sex act with her. The group were asked to leave the venue and did so, walking from Grant Street towards High Street. CCTV footage from the Coliseum beer garden showed Tom and his pal Jack Kitchen drinking. Kitchen took off his top, placed it over a hanging line of decorative lights and proceeded to use the arrangement as some kind of makeshift zip wire. This resulted in them both being asked to leave. They walked along High Street towards Grant Street. Hulse claimed that earlier that day, he had bought a knife from a store in Freeman Street along with a couple of fishing floats and claimed he had signed a record book and provided a Citizen Card to show proof of identification. Hulse said his father had asked him to buy the knife so they could go fishing the next day, along with Hulse's grandfather. The court heard the store owners had declined to provide evidence, but confirmed anyone buying a knife does not need to sign a record of purchase. The prosecutor told the jury Hulse had a previous conviction for carrying weapons when he discharged an air gun into the face of another man. He was convicted of wounding and possession of a weapon with intention to cause fear of violence in June 2021. Hulse was convicted of an offence of battery in March 2021 when he stamped on a man's head in a violent confrontation in Grimsby. In court Hulse claimed he had only just met Gabrielle Hough, of Louth for the first time that day. CCTV footage showed the two embracing at times. After the 90 seconds of violence on the corner of High Street and Grant Street, she followed Hulse when he hid behind a wall in the car park of Fantasy World. One clip of footage shows Hough helping Hulse back onto his feet and hobbling back towards High Street. As police officers arrive and restrain Hulse, she is seen on CCTV cameras kneeling beside him pleading with her boyfriend to be calm.One of the first officers on the scene, PC Holly Haynes was approached by a member of the public who alerted the officer to a knife hidden in the back pocket of Hough's jeans. She too was arrested and was heard on police body worn cameras shouting: \"I promise I didn't do anything. I got given it to me. It got give to me. I'm scared.\" The shiny, blue metallic lock knife was retrieved and forensic examination proved it was the knife used in the fatal stabbing of Tom Gaughan. Hough has admitted assisting an offender. Daniel Champion and Jack Kitchen have admitted offences of affray. All defendants are due to be sentenced together in a few weeks. The relatives of Tom have continued to campaign for fund raising for emergency bleed kits at venues throughout North East Lincolnshire. They have also called for tougher sentences for people caught carrying knives in public.", "summary": "Humberside Police produced a timeline of events on CCTV which led to the murder of Tom Gaughan", "url": "https://www.grimsbytelegraph.co.uk/news/grimsby-news/chance-encounter-between-strangers-night-9366939", "image": "https://i2-prod.grimsbytelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article9376628.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Untitled-design-18.png", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 04:00:00", "author": "Peter Craig", "authors": ["Peter Craig"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": -0.08}

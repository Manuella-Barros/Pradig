Prosecutors allege Read left O'Keefe to die in the snow outside a fellow Boston officer's home in Canton, but Read's lawyers say she was framed in a vast coverup.\n\nRead faces three charges: Second-degree murder, manslaughter while operating a motor vehicle under the influence, and leaving the scene of a fatal accident. The murder charge is the most severe, carrying a possible life sentence if Read is convicted.\n\nIn a new motion filed Monday, Read's lawyers say they've received unsolicited information from three of the 12 deliberating jurors \"indicating in no uncertain terms that the jury had a firm 12-0 agreement that Ms. Read was not guilty of two of the three charges against her, including the charge of murder in the second degree.\"\n\nAccording to Read's lawyers, one juror approached defense attorney Alan Jackson the day after Judge Beverly Cannone declared a mistrial in the case. The juror allegedly told Jackson the second-degree murder charge was \"off the table\" and that the jury had also come to a unanimous conclusion that Read was not guilty of leaving the scene of a fatal accident.\n\nThe next day, defense attorney David Yannetti allegedly heard similar accounts from individuals who claimed to have received information from two other jurors. According to the defense, one of the jurors reported the jury was \"split in half\" on the OUI manslaughter charge.\n\nThe jury's unanimous conclusion on the first and third counts constitutes an acquittal and precludes the Norfolk County District Attorney's Office from re-prosecuting Read on those charges, the defense argued.\n\nThe DA's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment Monday, though prosecutors previously said they intend to retry the case.\n\nRead is due back in court for a scheduling conference on July 22.", "source": {"uri": "boston.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Boston"}, "authors": [{"uri": "abby_patkin@boston.com", "name": "Abby Patkin", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hung_jury", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hung jury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquittal", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Acquittal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SUV", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "SUV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_O'Keefe_(neuroscientist)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "John O'Keefe (neuroscientist)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Trial"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Police officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_imprisonment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Life imprisonment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manslaughter", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manslaughter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canton,_Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Canton, Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Canton, Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Jackson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alan Jackson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "District attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norfolk_County,_Massachusetts", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Norfolk County, Massachusetts"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Norfolk County, Massachusetts"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackson,_Mississippi", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jackson, Mississippi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jackson, Mississippi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Unsolved", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Unsolved", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 70}], "image": "https://bdc2020.o0bc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Officer_Killed_Girlfriend_Trial_34813-668c073970ad2-768x432.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9715446", "eventUri": "eng-9715446", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-22", "textStart": 2504, "textEnd": 2511}], "sentiment": -0.5372549019607843, "wgt": 214, "relevance": 1}

A judge declared a mistrial Monday after jurors deadlocked in the case of Read, who was accused of killing her Boston police officer boyfriend by striking him with her SUV and leaving him in a [...]\n\nDEDHAM, Mass. (AP) -- Jurors in the trial of Karen Read unanimously concluded she was not guilty of murder or of leaving the scene of a deadly accident, and were deadlocked on only the remaining manslaughter charge before the judge abruptly declared a mistrial, her defense team said Monday.\n\nThe disclosure was made in a defense motion Monday seeking the judge's permission to question all 12 jurors after they learned of three who described their conclusions. They hope to show that for reasons of double jeopardy, the state of Massachusetts cannot retry her for murder.\n\nRead was accused of ramming into her Boston police officer boyfriend with her SUV and leaving him for dead in a snowstorm in January 2022.\n\nA judge made the mistrial declaration on the fifth day of deliberations after jurors declared that they were hopelessly deadlocked. The defense said she announced the mistrial without questioning the jurors about the individual charges, and without giving lawyers for either side a chance to comment.\n\nThe motion filed in Norfolk County Superior Court said one juror told the defense team that jurors voted 12-0 to acquit Read of second-degree murder and of leaving the scene of an accident in which there was a death. The motion asked for those charges to be dismissed. Jurors were deadlocked, however, on the charge of manslaughter while operating a motor vehicle under the influence of alcohol, the juror told the attorneys.\n\nThe lawyers also received second- and third-hand accounts about two other jurors, both indicating there was agreement on acquitting Read of second-degree murder.\n\nRead, a former adjunct professor at Bentley College, faced second-degree murder and other charges in the death of O'Keefe, a 16-year member of the Boston police who was found outside a Canton home of another Boston police officer. An autopsy found O'Keefe died of hypothermia and blunt force trauma.\n\nThe defense contended O'Keefe was killed inside the home after she dropped him off at the gathering and that the officers chose to frame her because she was a \"convenient outsider.\"\n\nA turning point in the two-month trial came when the lead investigator, State Trooper Michael Proctor, was forced to acknowledge and apologize for sending offensive texts about Read to friends, family and fellow troopers during the investigation.\n\nMassachusetts State Police relieved Proctor of duty after the trial, saying the move followed the agency's previous decision to open an internal affairs investigation about potential serious misconduct. Proctor's status hearing was being held behind closed doors on Monday. The possible outcomes were suspension, being placed on restricted duty or being returned to full duty.", "source": {"uri": "tribtown.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Tribune"}, "authors":

The filing was made in an effort to dismiss some of the charges against Read.\n\nRead is accused of hitting and killing Boston police officer John O'Keefe, who she was dating at the time, with her SUV and leaving him to die in the snow in 2022. Her defense attorneys say she is being framed and O'Keefe was killed during a fight, then dragged outside and left on the front lawn of a Canton home.\n\nThe monthslong trial, which gained national attention, ended last week in a mistrial due to a \"starkly divided\" hung jury.\n\nRead's attorneys filed a motion to dismiss on Monday. In the motion, Jackson says a juror contacted him the day after the mistrial was declared.\n\nAccording to Jackson, the jury unanimously agreed to that Read should be found not guilty of second degree murder as well as leaving the scene leaving the scene of personal injury and death. Jackson did not reveal what the jury voted on the charge of manslaughter while operating under the influence.\n\nThe defense attorney said Judge Beverly Cannone did not provide Read's lawyers the opportunity to be heard when the jury indicated for a final time that it was at an impasse. He also said in the new court filing that Cannone did not ask the jury foreperson what counts the jury was at an impasse on.\n\n\"Had the Court so inquired, it appears clear that NOT GUILTY verdicts would have been recorded for Count 1 and Count 3. Ms. Read was denied her right to receive those verdicts in her favor,\" Jackson wrote.\n\nYannetti said he was contacted by two informants who received information from two separate jurors. Yanetti said one of the informants provided screenshots with a juror who said \"I thought the prosecution didn't prove the case. No one thought she hit him on purpose...\"\n\nYannetti claimed that he also spoke to a person who joined a Zoom meeting with a third juror who they work with. That person claimed that the juror said during the meeting that polling for the manslaughter began with an even split and ended deadlocked with eight people voting guilty and four not guilty.\n\nIn the motion, defense attorneys argue Read should not face a second trial on two of the counts because of double jeopardy.\n\nProsecutors have not yet commented on the filings. They said minutes after the mistrial was declared that they plan to re-try the case.\n\nNo deciding jurors have publicly commented on the trial. One alternate juror spoke to WBZ-TV about what it was like being a part of the trial.\n\nIn a separate filing on Monday, Read also added an additional attorney to her legal team.\n\nAttorney Martin Weinberg filed to become one of Read's attorneys \"for the limited purpose of representing the defendant in regards to litigating the Motion to Dismiss.\"", "source": {"uri": "cbsnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackson,_Mississippi", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jackson, Mississippi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jackson, Mississippi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Trial"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_O'Keefe_(neuroscientist)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "John O'Keefe (neuroscientist)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Jackson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alan Jackson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hung_jury", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hung jury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquittal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Acquittal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Police officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Massachusetts"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Massachusetts"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canton,_Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Canton, Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Canton, Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_(legal)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Motion (legal)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_injury", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Personal injury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manslaughter", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manslaughter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Informant", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Informant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoom_(software)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Zoom (software)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WBZ-TV", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "WBZ-TV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_jeopardy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Double jeopardy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defendant", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Defendant"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Unsolved", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Unsolved", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 51}], "image": "https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/06/26/8fd693c7-94a8-45fc-8e8b-a4b89099d990/thumbnail/1200x630/1b39247a7cb5f79a46986e83d5977478/readwed.jpg?v=57e8061b2038d609da26e467de5ddfb8", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9715446", "eventUri": "eng-9715446", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2313725490196078, "wgt": 193, "relevance": 1}

We look forward to picking a new trial date on July 22.\"\n\nJudge Beverly Cannone also ordered Monday that the names of the jurors in the case not be released. In making her ruling, she said there \"is a risk of immediate and irreparable injury should the list be made available to the public at this time.\"\n\nShe did not specify the potential risk but said that people associated with the case had been charged with intimidation.\n\nMs. Read was accused of ramming into her Boston police officer boyfriend with her SUV and leaving him for dead in a snowstorm in January 2022.\n\nA judge made the mistrial declaration on the fifth day of deliberations after jurors declared that they were hopelessly deadlocked. The defense said she announced the mistrial without questioning the jurors about the individual charges, and without giving lawyers for either side a chance to comment.\n\nThe motion filed in Norfolk County Superior Court said one juror told the defense team that jurors voted 12-0 to acquit Ms. Read of second-degree murder and of leaving the scene of an accident in which there was a death. The lawyers also received second- and third-hand accounts about two other jurors, both indicating there was agreement on acquitting Ms. Read of second-degree murder. The motion asked for the murder and leaving-the-scene charges to be dismissed.\n\nJurors were deadlocked, however, on the charge of manslaughter while operating a motor vehicle under the influence of alcohol, the juror told the attorneys.\n\nMs. Read, a former adjunct professor at Bentley College, faced second-degree murder and other charges in the death of O'Keefe, a 16-year member of the Boston police who was found outside a Canton home of another Boston police officer. An autopsy found O'Keefe died of hypothermia and blunt force trauma.\n\nThe defense contended O'Keefe was killed inside the home after Ms. Read dropped him off at the gathering and that the officers chose to frame her because she was a \"convenient outsider.\"\n\nA turning point in the two-month trial came when the lead investigator, State Trooper Michael Proctor, was forced to acknowledge and apologize for sending offensive texts about Ms. Read to friends, family, and fellow troopers during the investigation.\n\nMr. Proctor also admitted texting his sister that he wished Ms. Read would \"kill herself,\" which he claimed was a figure of speech and that \"emotions got the best of me.\" He apologized for some of the language he used but insisted they had no influence on the investigation.\n\nMs. Proctor acknowledged in his testimony that he is friends with the brother of Brian Albert and his wife -- though he insisted it had no influence on the investigation and that he had never been to their house before O'Keefe's death. Brian Albert is a Boston police officer who hosted the house party in Canton where O'Keefe's body was found in the front yard.\n\nMassachusetts State Police relieved Mr. Proctor of duty after the trial, saying the move followed the agency's previous decision to open an internal affairs investigation about potential serious misconduct.\n\nOn Monday, the state police hearing board ruled that Mr. Proctor should be suspended without pay. An internal affairs investigation into Mr. Proctor is ongoing.\n\nThe State Police Association did not respond to a request for comment and a phone number for Mr. Proctor could not be found.",

Cannone declared a mistrial. That was on July 1.\n\n\"Undersigned counsel began receiving unsolicited communications from three of the twelve deliberating jurors indicating in no uncertain terms that the jury had a firm 12-0 agreement that Ms. Read was not guilty of two of the three charges against her,\" the defense motion filed today states.\n\nThat included murder in the second degree, the harshest charge, the lawyers stated as they filed a motion to dismiss.\n\n\"Given the central importance that acquittals have held in our criminal justice system for hundreds of years,\" the motion adds, \"the jury's unanimous agreement precludes re-prosecution of Ms. Read on Counts 1 and 3 and mandates dismissal of those charges.\"\n\nThe defense is also seeking a post-verdict review to determine why, if what they say is true, the jury could not settle on a lesser charge.\n\nThe Norfolk DA's office said they are \"examining the motion in anticipation of filing a response. We look forward to picking a new trial date on July 22.\"\n\nRead is accused of killing her boyfriend of two years, 16-year Boston Police officer John O'Keefe, by backing her Lexus SUV into him at a high speed, leaving him to die in the cold during a major snowstorm.\n\nShe is charged with second-degree murder, manslaughter while operating a motor vehicle under the influence and leaving the scene of an accident resulting in death.\n\nThe defense has alleged a massive frame-up job to ensnare Read -- arguing that O'Keefe was beaten to death inside 34 Fairview Road before his body was dragged to the front yard on Jan. 29, 2022.\n\nAccording to the documents filed today with the court, Read's lawyers Alan Jackson and David Yannetti argue they were never consulted over the deadlock among jurors -- specifically, whether it was \"in relation to one, two or all of the charges in the indictment,\" they write.\n\n\"Once the jury was seated, the Court then read the jury note verbatim in court and, without providing any opportunity for defense counsel to be heard, the Court declared a mistrial and excused the jury,\" the attorneys' motion reads.\n\n\"Defense counsel was denied the opportunity to request that the Court inquire on which count or counts the jury may have been deadlocked (including lesser included offenses), and on which count or counts the jury may have arrived at a verdict,\" the lawyers wrote.\n\nAttorney Jackson was contacted \"the following day\" on July 2 by a juror who wished \"to inform (him) of the 'true results' of the jury's deliberations.\"\n\nThat juror, who is not identified in the court papers but is referred to as Juror A, said the jury unanimously agreed Read was \"NOT GUILTY\" of second-degree murder and that it was \"off the table.\"\n\nThe same was true for leaving the scene of injury or death, records state.\n\nYannetti, the motion continues, was then contacted by \"two different informants\" who \"received information from two distinct jurors\" that the jury was \"split in half\" for the second count of manslaughter while operating a motor vehicle under the influence.\n\n\"No one thought she hit (O'Keefe) on purpose,\" those informants said in texts, the motion states.\n\nIt's also alleged that a juror spoke of the Read case on a \"Zoom meeting\" at work -- but after the mistrial and the jury was dismissed. That juror stated the initial vote for OUI vehicular manslaughter was 6-6, then changed to 8-4 guilty for OUI vehicular manslaughter.\n\nRead's attorneys stated it would be \"double jeopardy\" to force Read to go through a trial again, especially after the defense did not have an opportunity to challenge the mistrial.\n\n\"Had the Court so inquired, it appears clear that NOT GUILTY verdicts would have been recorded for Count 1 and Count 3,\" the attorneys wrote. \"Ms. Read was denied her right to receive those verdicts in her favor.\"\n\nA new attorney for Read helped file the motion to dismiss -- Martin Weinberg, who was added on Monday as \"limited appearance counsel\" for Read. Weinberg has been known for many federal cases over the years, including when he represented Richard Vitale, who was a close associate of former Massachusetts Speaker of the House Salvatore DiMasi.\n\n(Rick Sobey contributed to this report.)\n\n\u00a92024 MediaNews Group, Inc.

They argued that she left him for dead in a snowbank outside another officer's home in the early hours of January 29, 2022.\n\nThe murder case ended in a mistrial July 1 when the jury told Judge Beverly Cannone that they were deadlocked.

(WHDH) - Attorneys for Karen Read on Monday filed a motion to dismiss charges in light of new information about jury deliberations in Read's recent trial.\n\nThe filing came exactly one week after Judge Beverly Cannone declared a mistrial in the case. Amid a vow from the Norfolk District Attorney's Office to retry Read, her team asked Cannone to dismiss charges including second degree murder and leaving the scene of an accident causing death.\n\nIn their 10-page motion, attorneys said they received unsolicited information from three deliberating jurors who indicated no one believed Read intentionally killed O'Keefe.\n\nThe defense said jurors were split on the remaining charge of manslaughter while driving drunk.\n\nProsecutors said Read hit her boyfriend, Boston police officer John O'Keefe, with her SUV and left him to die in a snowbank outside the Canton home of Brian and Nicole Albert in January 2022.\n\nHer defense claims O'Keefe actually died after a fight in the Albert home, saying Read was framed as part of a wide-ranging law enforcement cover up.\n\nRead's trial continued for more than two months between late April and July 1. After five days of deliberations, though, the jury in a note to Cannone said it was unable to reach a verdict.\n\nCannone declared a mistrial, and set July 22 as a date for parties to return to court to discuss their next steps.\n\nAs both the prosecution and the defense prepare for a new trial, Read's team invoked the Constitution's \"Double Jeopardy Clause\" to argue the unanimous agreement among jurors on two of three counts mean Read cannot be tried again on the same charges.\n\n\"Given the central importance that acquittals have held in our criminal justice system for hundreds of years, the defense respectfully submits that the jury's unanimous agreement precludes prosecution of Ms. Read on Counts 1 and 3 and mandates dismissal of those charges,\" the defense said.\n\nRead's re-trial could happen in January. If Cannone does not dismiss the second degree murder and leaving the scene of an accident causing death charges, Read's team is asking that she conduct a voir dire questioning of the jury to get more information confirming the defense's claims.\n\nWhile the defense filed its motion morning, State Police Trooper Michael Proctor was scheduled to face a duty status hearing after he was placed on leave following the mistrial result in Read's trial.\n\nProctor served as the lead investigator in the case and came under intense scrutiny after he testified about vulgar text messages he sent discussing Read.\n\nProctor's hearing was scheduled to take place virtually and was closed to the public.\n\n(Copyright (c) 2024 Sunbeam Television.

The jury deliberated for more than 24 hours over five days before Judge Beverly Cannone declared a mistrial on July 1. On Monday, Read's attorneys filed a motion to dismiss two of the three charges.\n\nIn the motion, reviewed by Court TV, attorneys Alan Jackson and David Yanneti say that before telling the judge they were deadlocked, the jury had unanimously voted to acquit Read on two charges, including second-degree murder. According to the motion, the attorneys \"began receiving unsolicited communications from three of the twelve deliberating jurors indicating in no uncertain terms that the jury had a firm 12-0 agreement that Ms. Read was not guilty of two of the three charges against her, including the charge of murder in the second degree.\" The jury also allegedly agreed to find Read not guilty of leaving the scene of a fatal crash.\n\nWhen Judge Cannone declared the mistrial, there was no public polling of the jury, so no court record exists that would indicate whether the jury had, in fact, unanimously agreed on any charges.\n\nRelated: Hung jury leads to mistrial in Karen Read's high-profile murder trial\n\nOne of the issues raised in the motion is that after receiving a note from the jury on July 1 saying the jury was unable to reach a verdict, the court declared a mistrial \"without providing any opportunity for defense counsel to be heard\" and that the judge failed to ask the jury whether it was deadlocked on one, two or all three of the charges in the indictment. The defense motion argues that Read cannot face retrial for the two charges on which the jury would have found her innocent, saying that she is protected by the double jeopardy clause in the U.S. Constitution that prohibits anyone from being prosecuted twice for the same crime after a verdict is reached.\n\nIf the judge is unwilling to dismiss the two charges against Read, in that case, the motion alternatively asks for the court to \"conduct a voir dire of the jury and/or an evidentiary hearing to substantiate the existence of an acquittal.\"\n\nThis story was originally published by Lauren Silver at Court TV.", "source": {"uri": "fox13now.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KSTU"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karen_Read", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Karen Read"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquittal", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Acquittal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Trial"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hung_jury", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hung jury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_(legal)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Motion (legal)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Driving_under_the_influence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Driving under the influence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manslaughter", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manslaughter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Court_TV", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Court TV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Constitution of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_jeopardy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Double jeopardy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_trial", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New trial"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voir_dire", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Voir dire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defense_(legal)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Defense (legal)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preliminary_hearing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Preliminary hearing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indictment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indictment"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 59}], "image": "https://ewscripps.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/170359a/2147483647/strip/true/crop/600x315+0+43/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fewscripps.brightspotcdn.com%2Fde%2Fae%2Fa46237f74f17851b7724fcae899e%2Ff5c16690-ap24183707909660-600x400.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9715446", "eventUri": "eng-9715446", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-01", "textStart": 597, "textEnd": 603, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": -0.3176470588235294, "wgt": 185, "relevance": 1}

(AP) -- Jurors in the trial of Karen Read unanimously concluded she was not guilty of murder or of leaving the scene of a deadly accident, and were deadlocked on only the remaining manslaughter charge before the judge abruptly declared a mistrial, her defense team said Monday.\n\nThe disclosure was made in a defense motion Monday in which they argued that retrying Read on those two counts \"would violate\" the double jeopardy protections in the U.S. and Massachusetts constitutions. If the court needs additional information, the defense said, it should approve a \"post-verdict inquiry\" in which they are allowed to \"seek additional proof from the jurors\" regarding their having \"unanimously acquitted the defendant of two of the three charges against her.\"\n\nRead's attorney Alan Jackson also submitted an affidavit detailing how he had been contacted directly by a juror, and Read's attorney David Yannetti submitted one in which he said that he had been contacted by two individuals who had received information \"from two distinct jurors.\"\n\nIn a statement, the Norfolk District Attorney's Office said it is \"examining the motion in anticipation of filing a response. We look forward to picking a new trial date on July 22.\"\n\nRead was accused of ramming into her Boston police officer boyfriend with her SUV and leaving him for dead in a snowstorm in January 2022.\n\nA judge made the mistrial declaration on the fifth day of deliberations after jurors declared that they were hopelessly deadlocked. The defense said she announced the mistrial without questioning the jurors about the individual charges, and without giving lawyers for either side a chance to comment.\n\nThe motion filed in Norfolk County Superior Court said one juror told the defense team that jurors voted 12-0 to acquit Read of second-degree murder and of leaving the scene of an accident in which there was a death. The lawyers also received second- and third-hand accounts about two other jurors, both indicating there was agreement on acquitting Read of second-degree murder. The motion asked for the murder and leaving-the-scene charges to be dismissed.\n\nJurors were deadlocked, however, on the charge of manslaughter while operating a motor vehicle under the influence of alcohol, the juror told the attorneys.\n\nRead, a former adjunct professor at Bentley College, faced second-degree murder and other charges in the death of O'Keefe, a 16-year member of the Boston police who was found outside a Canton home of another Boston police officer. An autopsy found O'Keefe died of hypothermia and blunt force trauma.\n\nThe defense contended O'Keefe was killed inside the home after Read dropped him off at the gathering and that the officers chose to frame her because she was a \"convenient outsider.\"\n\nA turning point in the two-month trial came when the lead investigator, State Trooper Michael Proctor, was forced to acknowledge and apologize for sending offensive texts about Read to friends, family and fellow troopers during the investigation.\n\nProctor also admitted texting his sister that he wished Read would \"kill herself,\" which he claimed was a figure of speech and that \"emotions got the best of me.\" He apologized for some of the language he used but insisted they had no influence on the investigation.\n\nProctor acknowledged in his testimony that he is friends with the brother of Brian Albert and his wife -- though he insisted it had no influence on the investigation and that he had never been to their house before O'Keefe's death. Brian Albert is a Boston police officer who hosted the house party in Canton where O'Keefe's body was found in the front yard.\n\nMassachusetts State Police relieved Proctor of duty after the trial, saying the move followed the agency's previous decision to open an internal affairs investigation about potential serious misconduct.\n\nOn Monday, the state police hearing board ruled that Proctor should be suspended without pay. An internal affairs investigation into Proctor is ongoing.\n\nThe State Police Association did not respond to a request for comment and a phone number for Proctor could not be found.", "source":

Ms. Read was denied her right to receive those verdicts in her favor,\" Jackson said in his affidavit.\n\nThe defense also filed a \"limited appearance of counsel\" so that attorney Martin Weinberg can represent Read in the motion to dismiss.", "source": {"uri": "turnto10.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WJAR"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_O'Keefe_(neuroscientist)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "John O'Keefe (neuroscientist)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_(legal)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Motion (legal)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Police_Department", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boston Police Department"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hung_jury", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hung jury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquittal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Acquittal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Trial"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mansfield,_Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mansfield, Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mansfield, Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canton,_Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Canton, Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Canton, Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "District attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_jeopardy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Double jeopardy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Jackson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alan Jackson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Of_counsel", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Of counsel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicular_homicide", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vehicular homicide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Informant", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Informant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affidavit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Affidavit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackson,_Mississippi", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jackson, Mississippi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jackson, Mississippi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 50}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 46}], "image": "https://turnto10.com/resources/media/0789aa12-7721-4df1-b75e-9f31afe415a8-large16x9_AP24183505081362.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9715446", "eventUri": "eng-9715446", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 184, "relevance": 1}

(AP) -- Jurors in the trial of Karen Read unanimously concluded she was not guilty of murder or of leaving the scene of a deadly accident, and were deadlocked on only the remaining manslaughter charge before the judge abruptly declared a mistrial, her defense team said Monday.\n\nThe disclosure was made in a defense motion Monday seeking the judge's permission to question all 12 jurors after they learned of three who described their conclusions. They hope to show that for reasons of double jeopardy, the state of Massachusetts cannot retry her for murder.\n\nRead was accused of ramming into her Boston police officer boyfriend with her SUV and leaving him for dead in a snowstorm in January 2022.\n\nA judge made the mistrial declaration on the fifth day of deliberations after jurors declared that they were hopelessly deadlocked.

The motion asked for those charges to be dismissed. Jurors were deadlocked, however, on the charge of manslaughter while operating a motor vehicle under the influence of alcohol, the juror told the attorneys.\n\nThe lawyers also received second- and third-hand accounts about two other jurors, both indicating there was agreement on acquitting Read of second-degree murder.\n\nRead, a former adjunct professor at Bentley College, faced second-degree murder and other charges in the death of O'Keefe, a 16-year member of the Boston police who was found outside a Canton home of another Boston police officer. An autopsy found O'Keefe died of hypothermia and blunt force trauma.\n\nThe defense contended O'Keefe was killed inside the home after she dropped him off at the gathering and that the officers chose to frame her because she was a \"convenient outsider.\"\n\nA turning point in the two-month trial came when the lead investigator, State Trooper Michael Proctor, was forced to acknowledge and apologize for sending offensive texts about Read to friends, family and fellow troopers during the investigation.\n\nMassachusetts State Police relieved Proctor of duty after the trial, saying the move followed the agency's previous decision to open an internal affairs investigation about potential serious misconduct.

These jurors collectively determined that Read was innocent of the accusations of second-degree murder and were divided on the charge of vehicular manslaughter.\n\nAdditionally, the motion highlighted that the jury was in complete agreement that Read was not culpable of the third allegation, which pertained to leaving the scene following a fatal collision.\n\nAs CrimeOnline previously reported, Read's murder trial ended in a mistrial July 1 when the jury told Judge Beverly Cannone that they were deadlocked.

(AP) -- Prosecutors in Massachusetts say they plan to retry Karen Read for the death of her Boston police officer boyfriend. She's accused of striking him with her SUV and leaving him to die in a snowstorm. The judge declared a mistrial after jurors said they couldn't agree.\n\nKaren Read was facing second degree murder and two other charges for allegedly striking John O'Keefe with her SUV and then leaving the scene when she dropped him off at a fellow officer's house after a night of drinking.\n\nBoth sides will be in court July 22 to consider next steps. Plenty of questions remain unanswered. A federal investigation of how law enforcement handled O'Keefe's death continues, and Read's defense wants to question the jurors. Her lawyers said three of the 12 said the jury was united for acquitting Read of the most serious charge, so trying her again for murder would be unconstitutional double jeopardy. A motion to dismiss\n\nProsecutors have yet to respond to a defense motion to dismiss the charges of second degree murder and leaving the scene of an accident resulting in death. Defense lawyers said they were contacted by one juror and two acquaintances of jurors. They said all three jurors said the jury had unanimously concluded that Read was not guilty on those charges, and they couldn't agree only on the remaining manslaughter charge.\n\nPartial verdicts are possible in Massachusetts, but the defense motion said Judge Beverly Cannone abruptly declared the mistrial in open court without first questioning jurors about where they stood on each charge, or giving the prosecution and defense a chance to raise questions.\n\nIf the court requires more information on the defense motion filed Monday, Read's defense team is calling for a \"post-verdict inquiry\" in which they would be allowed to \"seek additional proof from the jurors\" regarding their unanimous findings on the two counts. What's a judge to do?\n\nSome Massachusetts trial court veterans defended the judge's response to the deliberations.\n\nBrad Bailey, a former state and federal prosecutor and longtime criminal defense lawyer, said Cannone declared a mistrial on all the charges because that is what she heard from the jury: Jurors repeatedly said they were deadlocked but never indicated they had reached a decision on any of the charges.\n\nJuries are routinely instructed \"that any communication with the judge should not reveal what actually is going inside the jury room in terms of the nature and substance of their deliberation,\" but it's not unusual for jurors to declare themselves deadlocked \"on all counts,\" or to announce decisions on only some counts, Bailey said.\n\nMichael Coyne, the dean at the Massachusetts School of Law, said he found it \"curious\" that jurors never indicated they had reached a verdict on some of the counts -- if indeed they had. \"That is the unusual part -- If in fact they had reached consensus on some, why didn't they report it to the court?\"\n\nSince the jurors left the verdict forms blank, Coyne expects prosecutors to make the case that they \"didn't reach consensus on anything,\" he said. Juror secrecy, for now\n\nThe jurors' identities have not been released yet, and none are believed to have spoken with the media. A week after declaring the mistrial, Cannone ordered a 10-day hold on naming them publicly, citing \"a risk of immediate and irreparable injury should the list be made available to the public at this time.\" She noted that people surrounding the case had been charged with intimidation. The ruling aims to protect the jurors' privacy if they want to remain anonymous, but doesn't prevent them from volunteering to speak publicly.\n\nThe order could be extended out of concern for \"potential violence to those jurors if their names and other identifying information was disclosed,\" Coyne observed, but he predicted that pressure to release their names will grow.\n\n\"We all wanted to know the names before to see if anyone would speak,\" the dean said. \"Now it's even more pressing because the defendant is saying the jurors reached a verdict on counts one and three. We ought to know what they are actually saying about that.\" Investigating the investigator\n\nThe lead investigator, State Trooper Michael Proctor, was relieved of duty after the trial revealed he'd sent vulgar texts to colleagues and family, calling Read a \"whack job\" and telling his sister he wished Read would \"kill herself.\" He said that was a figure of speech and that his emotions had gotten the better of him.\n\nThe defense also suggested he should've stepped aside from the investigation because he had personal relationships with several of the people involved in the case. Read's lawyers also questioned the sloppiness of the police work: The crime scene was left unsecured for hours; the house wasn't searched; bloodstained snow was scooped up with red plastic drinking cups; and a leaf blower was used to clear snow.\n\nProctor was relieved of his duties after the trial but was still being paid until Monday, when a state police hearing board changed that suspension to without pay, effective immediately. Meanwhile an internal affairs investigation could result in charges against him, and there's a federal probe into state law enforcement's handling of the case.

Her lawyers are now accusing the judge of declaring a mistrial without questioning the jurors further.\n\nThe jury \"sharply divided\" over Karen Read's guilt in the death of her Boston police officer boyfriend were only hopelessly deadlocked on a charge of manslaughter, and were unanimously poised to acquit her of murder and leaving the scene of a deadly accident before a judge declared a mistrial in the case, her lawyers claimed in a Monday court filing.\n\nRead's defense team, Alan Jackson and David Yannetti, are seeking to get both the latter charges thrown out. Retrying Read on those counts, they argued, would constitute a violation of double jeopardy protections, a constitutional clause that prohibits a person from being prosecuted twice for the same crime.\n\nThe lawyers said in their motion to dismiss that Jackson had been contacted last Tuesday, a day after the mistrial was declared, by a juror, who told him that the jury had unanimously agreed Read was not guilty of second-degree murder, nor of fleeing the crime scene.\n\nYannetti said in his own affidavit that he'd heard much the same from two people in contact with two other jurors. He added that one of these informants had provided screenshots from a conversation with a juror in which they wrote, \"I thought the prosecution didn't prove the case. No one thought she hit him on purpose.\"\n\nRead, 44, was arrested in February 2022, a month after John O'Keefe's death. Prosecutors alleged that she hit him with her SUV and left him for dead in the snow outside another officer's home. During closing arguments, a prosecutor honed in on Read's words in the minutes after his body was discovered the next morning: \"I hit him, I hit him, I hit him, I hit him.\"\n\nAt trial, her lawyers have thrown the facts under a different light, portraying O'Keefe's killing as a concerted cover-up by his fellow officers, who they said had fatally beaten him after a gathering at the suburban home. Authorities have denied any conspiracy in the case.\n\nJudge Beverly J. Cannone declared a mistrial after having been passed several notes from jurors saying they were at an impasse over the course of five days of deliberations. One, passed to her last Monday morning, declared that the jury had \"fundamental differences in our opinions,\" and that \"consensus is unattainable.\"\n\nThe final note was given to Cannone on Monday afternoon. \"Our perspectives on the evidence are starkly divided,\" the jury wrote. \"The deep division is not due to a lack of effort or diligence, but rather a sincere adherence to our individual principles and moral convictions.\"\n\nCannone said she'd \"never seen a note like this\" before. But before declaring a mistrial, she failed to ask the jury any followup questions, including about the counts they were deadlocked on, according to Jackson and Yannetti.\n\n\"Had the Court so inquired, it appears clear that NOT GUILTY verdicts would have been recorded for Count 1 and Count 3,\" they wrote. \"Ms. Read was denied her right to receive those verdicts in her favor.\"\n\nThe lawyers added in their filing that they were also deprived of the right to speak before the mistrial was declared.\n\nThe Norfolk County District Attorney's Office said shortly after the mistrial was declared that it intended to retry Read.

No one ever asked about those counts.\"\n\nAs we first reported ... Read was acquitted on charges of murder and leaving the scene of an accident by a unanimous vote of 12-0 in her favor. But, the jury was deadlocked on the last charge - vehicular manslaughter - voting 9-3 in favor of a guilty verdict. For a conviction on the vehicular manslaughter charge, the jury needed to be unanimous.\n\nThe judge declared a mistrial, but never disclosed the vote count. Read's attorney, Alan Jackson, then filed a motion pointing out that prosecutors should not be allowed to retry the murder case because it would amount to double jeopardy, which, by law, means you can't be tried twice for the same crime.\n\nAccording to the new court filing, the juror says the jury believed they were \"compelled to come to a resolution on all counts before they could or should report verdicts on any of the counts.\"\n\nAs for what allegedly happened, prosecutors contended Read got into an argument with her boyfriend, police officer John O'Keefe, back in 2022 before plowing into him with her SUV and fleeing the scene after a night of partying with friends.\n\nBut, Read's legal team argued that Read was framed by police after she dropped off O'Keefe at a house filled with cops having a celebration. During their get-together, the lawyers said, O'Keefe was killed after a fight broke out, and he was dragged outside and left for dead in the snow. According to the defense, the officers pinned the crime on Read because they wanted someone else to take the fall.\n\nDuring the trial, defense attorneys also discredited the case's lead investigator, who was relieved of duty after it was revealed he sent sexist and offensive texts about Read.\n\nProsecutors, however, say it's not over yet. ...

This information was brought to light in a motion to dismiss the second-degree murder charges and leaving the scene of an accident. According to Boston 25, three out of the 12 jurors reached out to the defense, stating that they had a unanimous agreement that Ms. Read was not guilty of two of the three charges.\n\nThe trial of 44-year-old Karen Read concluded after five days of deliberations, with Judge Beverly Cannone declaring a mistrial due to the jury's inability to reach a unanimous decision. Despite their efforts, jurors expressed deep divisions and fundamental differences that prevented them from coming to a consensus on the case.\n\nThe case revolves around the death of John O'Keefe, a Boston police officer and Read's boyfriend at the time. O'Keefe died during a snowstorm in January 2022 after allegedly being struck by Read's SUV, who then left the scene, leaving him to die outside another officer's home. The main point of contention between the defense and prosecution was whether Read intentionally hit O'Keefe or was even aware of hitting him.\n\nRead claimed that O'Keefe's police colleagues had conspired against her, setting her up as the scapegoat for the incident. On the other hand, prosecutors argued that the couple had an alcohol-fueled argument on the night of O'Keefe's death.\n\nFollowing the mistrial declaration, prosecutors have expressed their intention to pursue a new trial against Read. However, her defense team has raised a constitutional double jeopardy argument, stating that the jury had essentially reached a not guilty verdict on at least two charges.\n\nThe case continues to be a subject of intense debate and legal wrangling as both sides prepare for the next steps in the judicial process. The complexities and nuances of the case highlight the challenges and uncertainties that can arise in high-profile criminal trials, where the stakes are high and the outcomes can have far-reaching consequences for all parties involved.", "source": {"uri": "usanews.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "USANews Press Release Network"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquittal", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Acquittal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Trial"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_(legal)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Motion (legal)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_O'Keefe_(neuroscientist)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "John O'Keefe (neuroscientist)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Police_Department", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boston Police Department"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_jeopardy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Double jeopardy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_process", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Legal process"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scapegoat", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scapegoat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_procedure", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Criminal procedure"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Unsolved", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Unsolved", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://usanews.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/news-08072024-111931.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9715446", "eventUri": "eng-9715446", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.4196078431372549, "wgt": 175, "relevance": 1}

\"It didn't feel right,\" Jackson also noted.\n\nRead's first trial ended with a mistrial last Monday when the jury sent a note to Judge Beverly Cannone indicating they were at an \"impasse\" and future deliberations would be futile.\n\nIt was the third note the jury sent stating they could not reach a unanimous decision during the five days of deliberations.\n\n\"The jury believed that they were compelled to come to a resolution on all counts before they could or should report verdicts on any of the counts,\" Jackson wrote in the filing.\n\nThe Norfolk District Attorney's Office

The defense filed a motion on Monday asking Judge Beverly Cannone to dismiss two of the three charges against Read, citing unsolicited information from three of the 12 deliberating jurors.\n\nRead, 44, is charged with second-degree murder, manslaughter while operating a motor vehicle under the influence, and leaving the scene of a fatal accident. Prosecutors say she was driving drunk and intentionally backed her SUV into her boyfriend, Boston Police Officer John O'Keefe, outside a home in Canton on Jan. 29, 2022. However, Read's lawyers maintain she was framed in a vast conspiracy meant to protect the family who owned the home where O'Keefe was found unresponsive in the snow.\n\nIn their Monday motion, the defense attorneys said they had received information from three jurors -- identified in court documents as \"Juror A,\" \"Juror B,\" and \"Juror C\" -- \"indicating in no uncertain terms that the jury had a firm 12-0 agreement that Ms. Read was not guilty of two of the three charges against her.\"\n\nIn a supplemental affidavit filed Wednesday, defense attorney Alan Jackson said he later heard a similar account from a fourth juror, identified as \"Juror D.\"\n\nThe juror, who contacted Jackson on Monday, allegedly said they were \"uncomfortable\" with how the trial ended, describing the last day of deliberations as a \"whirlwind\" and noting they found the conclusion \"very confusing.\"\n\nAccording to Jackson's affidavit, Juror D said the jury unanimously agreed Read was \"not guilty\" of murder and leaving the scene of a fatal accident, only deadlocking on the OUI manslaughter charge and its lesser included offenses.\n\n\"Juror D said that the jury actually discussed telling the judge that they had agreed unanimously on NOT GUILTY verdicts for Counts 1 and 3, but they were not sure if they were allowed to say so,\" Jackson wrote.\n\nAccording to Jackson, Juror D also reported that after the jury was excused, \"many of the jurors appeared uncomfortable with how things ended, wondering, Is anyone going know that we acquitted [Karen Read] on Count 1 and 3? No one ever asked about those counts.\" [Note: Italics are Jackson's.]\n\nJuror D allegedly said they felt \"very uncomfortable\" with the result of the trial, adding, \"It did not feel right.\"\n\n\"I inquired whether, in his/her opinion, other jurors would agree and acknowledge that NOT GUILTY verdicts were reached on Count 1 and Count 3,\" Jackson wrote. \"Juror D, without hesitation, said in substance, Every one of us will agree and acknowledge that we found [Karen Read] NOT GUILTY of Counts 1 and 3. Because that's what happened.\"\n\nIn a supplemental motion filed Wednesday, Read's lawyers reiterated their belief that a mistrial was unnecessary for two of the three charges, as the jury had reached a unanimous conclusion. A retrial on those charges would violate laws against double jeopardy, the defense argues.\n\nProsecutors have said they intend to retry Read's case, and Cannone set a hearing for July 22 to determine next steps. In a statement Monday, a spokesperson for the Norfolk County District Attorney's Office said the DA's office was examining the defense motion \"in anticipation of filing a response\" and looks forward to picking a new trial date on July 22.\n\nProsecutors had yet to file their response as of 11:30 a.m. Wednesday.", "source": {"uri": "boston.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Boston"}, "authors": [{"uri": "abby_patkin@boston.com", "name": "Abby Patkin", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquittal", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Acquittal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SUV", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "SUV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karen_Read", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Karen Read"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hung_jury", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hung jury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Driving_under_the_influence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Driving under the influence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manslaughter", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manslaughter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Trial"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affidavit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Affidavit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Police officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackson,_Mississippi", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jackson, Mississippi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jackson, Mississippi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspiracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Conspiracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_O'Keefe_(neuroscientist)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "John O'Keefe (neuroscientist)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Jackson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alan Jackson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canton,_Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Canton, Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Canton, Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesser_included_offense", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lesser included offense"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_jeopardy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Double jeopardy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_trial", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New trial"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "District attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norfolk_County,_Massachusetts", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Norfolk County, Massachusetts"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Norfolk County, Massachusetts"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Unsolved", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Unsolved", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 75}], "image": "https://bdc2020.o0bc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/7NMRBZAODS4V6VONNIDML645HE-1-668eadb9319b0-768x432.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9715446", "eventUri": "eng-9715446", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-22", "textStart": 3469, "textEnd": 3476, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": -0.3725490196078431, "wgt": 163, "relevance": 1}

Cannone had a legal duty to inform the defense that the jury had reached a unanimous verdict on two of the three charges when she pronounced a mistrial.\n\nAccording to court documents, Jackson contended that this would have enabled them to argue that a mistrial should not have been reached.\n\nJackson further insisted that the judge should have entered an acquittal on both the murder charge and the charge of leaving the accident.\n\nThe reason why the jury was unanimous on the charge of leaving the scene of an accident and split on the charge of manslaughter lies in the question of Read's intent.\n\nIn order to be guilty of leaving the scene of an accident where death or injury is present, the driver must be aware that someone was maimed or killed.\n\nRead and her attorney, Alan Jackson, laugh after recess at Norfolk County Superior Court in Dedham on May 2. Jackson has argued in court documents that the jury's vote to acquit should protect Read from double jeopardy murder charges\n\nJackson and his client were seen getting cozy in public while the jury deliberated\n\nThe jury agreed that Read, who was accused of leaving her boyfriend for dead in the snow outside a friend's house, was ignorant of O'Keefe's plight.\n\nThe charge of manslaughter, however, does not hinge on intent, and all prosecutors are required to prove is reckless conduct.\n\nIf Jackson succeeds in his bid to push the double jeopardy issue, Read could still be retried on the charge of vehicular manslaughter.\n\nLast Monday's mistrial ending marked an end of the bitter legal drama, over the course of which Read and her defense tried to paint her as the hapless victim of a far-reaching plot to frame her.\n\nProsecutors countered that Read ran over O'Keefe to end their toxic relationship before leaving him for dead in the snow.\n\nOn the evening of O'Keefe's death, he and Read had been drinking with a group of friends at the Waterfall Bar and Grill in Canton, around 14 miles south of Boston, and were invited to his friend Brian Albert's home for an afterparty.\n\nRead, who prosecutors say drank several alcoholic drinks beforehand, decided to drop her boyfriend at the afterparty before she went to his home to sleep at around 1am. O'Keefe shared the home with his orphaned niece and nephew.\n\nProsecutors had claimed Read and O'Keefe's relationship was on the rocks when he died\n\nCourt documents revealed that the couple had been bitterly arguing for weeks beforehand, and on the night O'Keefe died, Read left him a voicemail calling him a 'f****** loser', and telling him: 'John, I f****** hate you.'\n\nThe couple had been dating for two years at the time of O'Keefe's death. He had been serving on the Boston Police Department for 16 years.\n\nAccording to Read's version of events, she woke up at 4am to find that O'Keefe never returned home, leading her to frantically drive out to try and find him.\n\nAfter finding O'Keefe's body outside Albert's home, which party attendees claimed he never entered, first responders on the scene alleged that Read repeatedly told them she hit him while in a panicked state.\n\nO'Keefe was found in the snow outside this home in Canton, around 12 miles from Boston, in the early hours of January 29, 2022\n\nRead (right, with her defense attorney following Monday's decision) claimed she was the victim of a wide-ranging conspiracy to frame her for murder\n\nVehicle data also found that Read reversed her SUV for 62 feet at 24mph near to Albert's home. O'Keefe's cause of death was listed as blunt force trauma and hypothermia, with pieces of Read's taillight found around his body, prosecutors said.\n\nIn his closing argument on Tuesday, Norfolk County Assistant District Attorney Adam Lally said the claims that Read was framed was little more than 'rampant speculation.'\n\nLally also pointed to hair and DNA from O'Keefe found on the rear end of Read's SUV.\n\nThe defense countered that the taillight was actually broken by Read when she left in a panic to find O'Keefe when he never returned home.\n\nRead More Who is Karen Read, the glamorous girlfriend dubbed America's 'happiest murder defendant' as she's accused of killing her cop boyfriend in hit-and-run\n\nThis included security video shown at trial showing Read clipping O'Keefe's vehicle as she backed out of her home to search for him.\n\nRead claimed that attendees at the afterparty beat him to death, and her attorneys presented phone data that showed O'Keefe's phone climbed dozens of steps at the time he was allegedly struck.\n\nJackson said that these steps could have been the basement of Albert's home. Albert was never charged with any wrongdoing.\n\nRead's attorneys added that although first responders claimed she spoke of hitting O'Keefe at the scene, they alleged this evidence was falsely given at a later date and not said at the time.\n\nA forensic engineer was brought in to evaluate the case, who testified that if O'Keefe had been struck by a vehicle at over 20mph he would expect to see more severe injuries.\n\nLast week, another twist in the trial emerged after Michael Proctor, the lead investigator in Read's case, was relieved of duties after 'serious misconduct.'\n\nLast month, Proctor testified in the trial that he had sent his friends and coworkers various text messages about Read, a financial analyst and college professor.\n\nProctor called Read a 'whack job' and a 'c***' and referred to her as a 'babe' with 'no a**,' while also making light of her 'Fall River accent.\n\nIn other messages, he joked about rummaging through her phone for nude photos during the investigation.\n\nRead's defense attorneys claim these texts support their theory that she was framed by police in a vast conspiracy to blame her for the killing.\n\nProctor claimed that 'these juvenile, unprofessional comments had zero impact on the facts, the evidence and the integrity of the investigation.'\n\nSources have since told NBC Boston that Proctor is also part of a federal probe into the handling of the case.\n\nWhen her trail began, Read received a slew of support from true crime fans who camped outside the courthouse with signs reading 'Free Karen Read.'\n\nA judge issued an order barring Read's supporters from coming within 200 feet of the courthouse or wearing supportive colors due to her rampant support\n\nAs her trial began, Read received a slew of support from true crime fans and locals who camped outside the courthouse with signs reading 'Free Karen Read'\n\nMany took to wearing pink as a show of support for Read, leading a judge to issue an order barring any clothing or accessories that could be perceived as encouraging, and banning them from coming within 200 feet of the courthouse.\n\nAs the trial made national headlines, some observers were turned off by Read's apparent flippant attitude during the proceedings, leading her to be nicknamed 'America's happiest murder defendant.'\n\nThe moniker was coined by one of Read's legion of X.com detractors. The nickname has since stuck.\n\nShe was seen winking to cameras and snacking inside the courthouse, which angered some critics.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title":

(WHDH) - Lawyers for Karen Read filed new paperwork in court Wednesday to support a previous argument to dismiss two of the three charges against their client.\n\nIn an affidavit, attorney Alan Jackson said he spoke with a fourth juror who said the jury agreed on a not guilty verdict on the charge of second degree murder and leaving the scene of a crash causing personal injury or death, while remaining split on the charge of manslaughter while driving drunk.\n\nAccording to Jackson, the juror said they were \"uncomfortable\" with the way Read's trial ended, describing a \"confusing\" series of events before Judge Beverly Cannone declared a mistrial in the case.\n\nRead was charged after prosecutors said she hit her boyfriend, Boston Police Officer John O'Keefe with her SUV and left him to die outside the Canton home of Brian and Nicole Albert in January 2022.\n\nHer defense claimed she was framed, saying O'Keefe actually died after a fight inside the Albert home.\n\nThe trial got underway in late April and ended on July 1 after five days of jury deliberations.\n\nIn a final note to Cannone, the jury said it was deadlocked, saying \"To continue to deliberate would be futile.\"\n\nThe Norfolk County District Attorney's Office quickly promised to re-try Read.\n\nJackson and fellow defense attorney David Yannetti first moved to dismiss charges on Monday. In their filing, the pair said they spoke directly with one juror and indirectly with two others who shared the same story about unanimous agreement on the second degree murder and leaving the scene of a crash charges.\n\nIn his supplemental Wednesday filing, Jackson said a fourth juror contacted him and said the last day of the trial was \"a whirlwind.\"\n\n\"He/she recounted that his/her perspective was that the jury was brought into the courtroom, the note was read, the mistrial was declared, and the jury was then rushed out of the courtroom,\" Jackson said.\n\nJackson said the juror told him the panel discussed telling Cannone that they had reached a not guilty verdict on two counts.\n\n\"But they were not sure if they were allowed to say so,\" Jackson said.\n\n\"The jury believed they were compelled to come to a resolution on all counts before they could or should report verdict on any of the counts,\" he added.\n\nWhile being taken away from Norfolk Superior Court in a bus, Jackson said, the juror said many other jurors \"appeared uncomfortable with how things ended, wondering 'Is anyone going to know that we acquitted [Karen Read]?\"\n\nThe defense has argued Cannone should have asked the jury about the prospect of a partial verdict, which could have yielded a result on some charges while also resulting in a mistrial on any other charge or charges where the jury was deadlocked.\n\nAfter Monday's filing, though, legal expert Tom Hoopes told 7NEWS Cannone is unlikely to grant the defense's request.\n\nHoopes said defense attorneys could have asked Cannone to poll the jury before she declared a mistrial. He continued, saying recent defense actions likely come too late to stave off another trial on charges including second degree murder.\n\nRead is due back in court on July 22.\n\nThe prosecution is also expected to file documents responding to the defense's motion at some point.\n\n(Copyright (c) 2024 Sunbeam Television.

Morrissey's office said, \"The Norfolk DA's Office is examining the motion in anticipation of filing a response. We look forward to picking a new trial date on July 22.\"\n\nFollowing the news of the mistrial, the prosecutor's key witness, State Police Trooper, Michael Proctor, was relieved of duty.\n\nDuring cross-examination, he had previously admitted to sending offensive text messages about Read to his family, friends, and coworkers, during the investigation.\n\nProctor had called Read a \"whackjob\" and a \"b***h\", as well as talked about how he wanted her to \"kill herself.\"\n\nProctor claimed that despite the \"juvenile, unprofessional comments\" he made, it had no impact on the investigation.\n\nThat same day, during the cross-examination he admitted to knowing Albert's brother Chris, as well as his wife Julie and their son, despite previously telling the Norfolk County District Attorney's office that he did not know members of the Albert family.\n\nHowever, he clarified that while he knew them he \"didn't have a relationship with them.\"\n\nNeama Rahmani, founder of West Coast Trial Lawyers, told The U.S. Sun that Proctor's performance was one of the worst he has seen in his 20-year career.\n\n\"Proctor lied about his relationship [with the homeowner], he's not likable, he's not credible, and that's your key witness [...] I don't think the prosecution did a good job of fronting the evidence,\" Rahmani remarked.\n\nAfter his time on the stand, there was a separate internal investigation done on the state trooper, according to police.\n\nProctor was placed on paid leave and he can no longer function as a state trooper.\n\nHe now faces an internal hearing on Monday to determine if he can keep his job, the Boston Herald reported.\n\nSince 2022, Read's innocence has been a hot topic among the residents of Canton.\n\nSome people had placed signs in front of their homes showing support for either Read or O'Keefe.\n\n\"Free Karen Read!\" read one sign.\n\nAnother read: \"Remember it's about justice for John.\"\n\nOne resident explained that this has been a controversial topic in the town.\n\n\"You can't even go out to eat at a local restaurant without having folks walk in, you know, saying, 'Oh, John. Oh, Karen. Oh, Kelly.'

They are asking the judge to dismiss the case or call the jurors back to court.\n\nTop criminal defense attorney Ed Ryan says this case is unique. \"This would be a very unusual inquiry,\" Ryan said. \"Given the facts, that we're going to ask did you reach a verdict on one of the indictments and not report it. This could be a mistake on the jury form, this could be a mistake made by the judge for not asking the specific question have you reached a verdict on any of the counts and it could be a failure of the judge to discuss this matter with the prosecutors and the defense lawyers before she made the final decision to declare a mistrial.\"\n\nDuring what was a monthslong trial, prosecutors said Read backed her SUV into Boston Police Officer John O'Keefe during a blizzard in 2022 leaving him to die in the snow. The two were dating at the time. Read's lawyers claim she was framed, and that O'Keefe got into a fight at an afterparty at the Canton home of another Boston police officer and was left injured on the front lawn.\n\nLast week, the jury reported being deadlocked. This new information is now raising a number of questions: were the jury instructions clear and did the panel understand that they could report reaching a unanimous decision on some of the charges but not others?\n\n\"Judges normally would not give an instruction that you can give a mixed bag of everything,\" Former Judge Jack Lu said. \"On the other hand, they might say something similar which is that you're obligated to consider every charge separately and decide whether the charge has been proven beyond a reasonable doubt based on my instructions.\"\n\nIn this case, Lu says, \"they did not send a verdict slip to the judge saying we find the defendant not guilty of the two charges... It is a concern. Did they know they had a choice?\"\n\nFurther complicating the case, the law does not allow for inquiry into jury deliberations.

This was filed as a supplemental affidavit in support of a motion to dismiss.\n\n\"Given the central importance that acquittals have held in our criminal justice system for hundreds of years, the defense respectfully submits that the jury's unanimous agreement precludes re-prosecution of Ms. Read on Counts 1 and 3 and mandates dismissal of those charges,\" defense attorneys wrote in that Monday motion to dismiss.\n\nThe Norfolk District Attorney's office, which prosecuted the case, told the Herald through a spokesman that \"We do not have comment at this time.\"\n\nRead, 44, of Mansfield, is accused of killing her boyfriend of two years, 16-year Boston Police officer John O'Keefe, by backing her Lexus SUV into him at a high speed and leaving him to die in the cold during a major snowstorm.\n\nShe is charged with second-degree murder (Count 1), manslaughter while operating a motor vehicle under the influence (Count 2), and leaving the scene of an accident resulting in death (Count 3).\n\nJackson wrote in the latest filing that Juror D indicated he or she wanted to reach out because \"he/she was 'uncomfortable' with how the trial ended,\" describing the last day as a \"whirlwind.\"\n\n\"He/she recounted that his/her perspective was that the jury was brought into the courtroom, the note was read, the mistrial was declared, and the jury was then rushed out of the courtroom,\" Jackson wrote. \"Following a brief meeting with the judge, the next thing they all knew, the jury was on the bus. He/she described the end of the trial as very confusing.\"\n\nThe juror said he or she would be willing to testify that \"the jury unanimously reached NOT GUILTY verdicts on Count 1 and Count 3, as long as his/her identity remained protected.\"\n\nSocial media has been awash in speculation as to the split between the jurors since the nine-week trial ended in a mistrial, with some armchair commentators claiming their numbers are correct based on inside knowledge.\n\nBut observers should take all such statements with a quite a few grains of salt as there is no reliable data to make such claims. No straw poll was conducted of the jury during their deliberations and Judge Beverly Cannone ordered that the juror list remain impounded since they did not reach a verdict and that \"the safety of jurors is crucial to the fair functioning of the judicial system.\"\n\n\"This case has garnered significant and divisive attention in Massachusetts and across the nation. The trial was livestreamed on local and national broadcasting channels. The proceedings continue to be the daily subject of commentary on various social media platforms,\" Cannone wrote in her Monday order impounding the juror list for 10 days. \"People associated with the case have been charged with intimidation.\"\n\nWhile Cannone said that Massachusetts law requires that such a list be maintained by the court and available to the public if it reaches a verdict, that is not the case here.\n\n\"The jury in this case did not render a verdict, however, the Court concludes that there is a real and present 'risk of [personal] harm to the jurors [and] to the integrity of their service,'\" she wrote in the order, citing case law. \"Consequently, the Court finds that good cause exists to impound the list identifying the names of empanelled jurors in the trial of this case.\"", "source": {"uri": "denverpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Denver Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_defense_lawyer",

Lawyers for Read have maintained that O'Keefe went inside the home, where he was beaten before his body was dumped on the front lawn.\n\nIn interviews after the jury deadlocked in the case last week, Jackson and Kane said they deeply regretted that the defense's accusations of a law enforcement cover-up had turned the trial into a spectacle.\n\nFriends and family of O'Keefe who attended the trial in Norfolk Superior Court faced crowds of pink-clad Read supporters, holding signs and chanting that she was innocent. Police set up metal barriers to keep the crowds at bay, but that didn't stop some from shouting at O'Keefe's loved ones and accusing them of being complicit in a conspiracy to frame Read as they walked down the sidewalk and up the courthouse steps, said Kane, a friend of O'Keefe's since childhood.\n\nA lot of those people don't \"have any skin in this game\" and only latched onto the case \"because this is true crime entertainment\" for them, said Kane, who grew up on the same street as O'Keefe in Braintree.\n\n\"They were tailgating at a murder trial,\" he said. \"It's literally a murder carnival.\"\n\nKane, 48, said O'Keefe wanted to be a police officer since they were kids. He joined the force in Boston when he was 29 after serving as an auxiliary officer in Duxbury and Falmouth.\n\nAfter his sister and her husband died just months apart, he became the guardian of his 6-year-old niece and 3-year-old nephew. He moved from Dorchester to Canton and adjusted his work schedule to care for the children, his friends said.\n\nO'Keefe's family and friends declined the majority of interview requests during the trial. Kane said they wanted to allow the judicial process to play out. But in light of the mistrial, Jackson, 48, and Kane said they felt obliged to speak out about the trial.\n\n\"We're just frustrated with that outcome and we think that the process could potentially be better served by us rehumanizing Johnny and . . . putting the focus back on the victim,\" Kane said. \"This is about the victim. This is not about the 'happiest murder defendant in America' smirking at the victim's brother, smiling on the courthouse steps, celebrating a tie at halftime.\"\n\nThe Norfolk district attorney's office has said they intend to retry the case against Read, 44. Read's lawyers have filed a motion to dismiss the charges of second-degree murder and leaving the scene of personal injury and death, claiming jurors had unanimously determined she was not guilty of those charges but could not reach a verdict on a third charge -- vehicular manslaughter while operating under the influence.\n\nKane and Jackson said they followed every moment of the trial, sometimes taking turns with other friends and family to witness the proceedings in person. Other times, they watched a livestream.\n\nBoth friends are adamant that Read, who had been dating O'Keefe for about two years, hit him with her car and left him there in the cold.\n\n\"It's a simple domestic violence case,\" Jackson said, citing the text messages between Read and O'Keefe that showed they were fighting in the hours before they met up with friends at a Canton bar. \"\n\nProsecutors said at trial that Read, a former adjunct professor of finance at Bentley University, had nine drinks before driving O'Keefe to the Fairview Road home where his body was later found outside.\n\n\"It's not an interesting story, it's a sad story,\" Kane said. \"Then you get the circus coming to town and this absurd narrative comes through ... It was a defense strategy: throw it all against the wall.\"\n\nJackson said the vast interest in the case, both outside the courthouse and online, has been hardest on O'Keefe's parents and his brother, Paul, but they're prepared to move forward with a second trial. A status conference in the case is set for July 22.", "source": {"uri": "bostonglobe.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Boston Globe"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

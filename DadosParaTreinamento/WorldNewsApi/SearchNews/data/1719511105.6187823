Kerry Carpenter has been the biggest threat in the Tigers' lineup this season, slashing .285/.340/.576 with eight home runs and 29 RBI. Carpenter has homered in both games this series and he'll look to continue to stay hot on Sunday. Meanwhile, Mize was shelled for six earned runs in 1 2/3 innings his last time out but he had managed quality starts in his last two starts prior to that. See which team to pick here. Why you should back the Blue Jays The Blue Jays will be relying heavily on Kikuchi to continue what has already been a spectacular season for the Japanese lefty. Kikuchi has given up three earned runs or less in nine of his 10 starts this season and has 61 strikeouts over 58 innings. However, Toronto has only managed to score three runs in the first two games of the series and offense has been a struggle all year, with no regulars posting an OPS better than .796 over the first 51 games this season. Vladimir Guerrero Jr. has been hot of late, as he enters Sunday on a four-game hitting streak with three extra-base hits during that span. See which team to pick here.

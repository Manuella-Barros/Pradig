The claims came in the latest round of their ongoing legal dispute regarding financial settlements after becoming officially divorced in November 2019.\n\nDewan has accused Tatum of working with others to hide his income from the 2012 Magic Mike franchise, in which Tatum played a male stripper. Various international offshoots of the movie have subsequently been produced, including sequels, musicals and other shows.\n\nTatum denied his ex-wife's claims pertaining to his income from Magic Mike in documents obtained by DailyMail.com, calling them \"completely false\".\n\nHowever, representatives for Dewan told The Independent that Tatum's claims were \"smears and falsehoods\" and accused the actor of \"bullying and gaslighting\".\n\n\"Is Channing really calling Jenna a 'liar' for trying to get back an asset that he effectively stole from her in clear violation of California family law?\" a spokesperson said.\n\n\"These latest smears and falsehoods are really just more of the same bullying and gaslighting Jenna has been subjected to for years.\n\n\"Regardless of whether Channing chooses to do the right thing, Jenna is confident that the law and the facts are on her side and she hopes this will soon come to a proper and honest conclusion.\"\n\nThe latest disagreement comes amid the pair's years-long battle over earnings, division of assets, spousal support and child support for their 10-year-old daughter.\n\nSince the divorce, the ex-couple, who met on the set of the 2006 dance movie Step Up, have both become engaged to new partners.\n\nDewan is currently expecting her second child with actor and singer Steve Kazee, to whom she is engaged. Meanwhile, Tatum has been with his fianc\u00e9e, singer and model Zo\u00eb Kravitz since the two were first romantically linked in 2021.\n\nWhile Tatum has denied Dewan has any right to spousal support, under California family law, the issue of spousal support must be considered by a court even if it is simply to terminate or end both parties' rights to receive it.\n\nThe Jump Street actor, who shares a 10-year-old daughter with Dewan, described their eight-year marriage as \"short-term\", saying that he refused to financially support her because she \"works\".", "source": {"uri": "independent.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Independent"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jenna_Dewan", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jenna Dewan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channing_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Channing Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaslighting", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gaslighting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullying", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bullying"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Settlement_(litigation)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Settlement (litigation)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divorce", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Divorce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Family law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stripper", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stripper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_theatre", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Musical theatre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Independent", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Independent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Kazee", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Steve Kazee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zo\u00eb_Kravitz", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Zo\u00eb Kravitz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_support", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Child support"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alimony", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alimony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dance"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Parenting", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Parenting", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Mental_Health/Grief,_Loss_and_Bereavement", "label": "dmoz/Health/Mental Health/Grief, Loss and Bereavement", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Divorce", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Divorce", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/05/05/12/newFile-1.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542735", "eventUri": "eng-9542735", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2019-11-", "textStart": 632, "textEnd": 645}], "sentiment": -0.192156862745098, "wgt": 196, "relevance": 1}

In that time, I have made exhaustive efforts to settle all issues in this matter without litigation. I have made countless settlement proposals, attended multiple mediations, my attorneys have prepared numerous drafts of a proposed judgment, and I have tried to resolve issues directly with Petitioner. While we have resolved some issues, the most significant financial issues in the case remain unresolved because Petitioner continues to delay resolution and provides one reason after another for why this case cannot settle,\" Tatum accused in his court-filed declaration. \"I believe that Petitioner's RFO is another delay tactic to prolong resolution of our financial settlement.\"\n\nAdding the actor, \"I request the Court deny Petitioner's RFO and set trial dates on all issues in this matter.\"\n\nIn explaining his opposition, Tatum argued having one trial to address all of their disputed issues would \"be simpler, take less time and cost less in attorneys' and experts' fees.\"\n\nIn addition to arguing against the bifurcation of the trial, Tatum also addressed Dewan potentially seeking spousal support from him at trial, telling the court that he does not believe the request is \"appropriate\" as they were married for less than 10 years, have already been separated for more than five years, and Dewan has since become engaged to Steve Kazee, and they are currently expecting their second child together.\n\n\"Petitioner works, is able to contribute to her own support, and will receive one-half of the community property residuals and royalties and income from other investments. Petitioner will also have substantial investment income from the cash assets she has received in our divorce,\" Tatum states in the documents. \"Petitioner has already received millions of dollars in cash assets pursuant to our various stipulations. She will receive additional cash assets when the remainder of our estate is divided, and post separation accounting is finalized. There are not, nor have there ever been, any orders for temporary spousal support. Petitioner never formally requested spousal support from me, and I am not currently paying her spousal support. I believe Petitioner is now requesting spousal support from me to further delay our financial settlement.\"\n\nHe further addressed what he claims were false allegations Dewan made against him in her request for order. Tatum denied transferring assets to a trust without her knowing and called her allegation that he \"colluded with third-parties\" false. He also declared that she \"has not contributed any efforts to enhance the Magic Mike intellectual property.\"\n\nIn response, a rep for Jenna Dewan tells ET, \"Is Channing really calling Jenna a 'liar' for trying to get back an asset that he effectively stole from her in clear violation of California family law? These latest smears and falsehoods are really just more of the same bullying and gaslighting Jenna has been subjected to for years. Regardless of whether Channing chooses to do the right thing, Jenna is confident that the law and the facts are on her side and she hopes this will soon come to a proper and honest conclusion.\"\n\nA source previously told ET in April, \"Jenna and Steve are making plans for their future as a couple. Jenna has moved on from her previous relationship and is ready to take the next step with Steve.

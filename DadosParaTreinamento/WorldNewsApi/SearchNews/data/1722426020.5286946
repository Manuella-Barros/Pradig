Washington officials were left scratching their heads this week when they found a mammal indigenous to the rainforest crawling along a stretch of desert. The kinkajou \u2014 also known as a honey bear \u2014 was discovered Sunday darting up a tall wooden post at a rest stop along Interstate 82 southeast of Yakima, the state Department of Transportation said on X. \u201cHello from our friendly Kinkajou! What\u2019s that you say? It\u2019s a nocturnal rainforest animal,\u201d the DOT wrote. \u201cWhy was it at our east Selah Creek Rest Area over the wknd? We have no idea, but our friends with Dept. of Fish & Wildlife rescued him. We don\u2019t know if it was dropped off or escaped.\u201d Animal experts suspect that the weasel-like critter was obtained through the illegal pet trade before being abandoned and left to fend for itself in the arid climate. At the time of its rescue, it was \u201cvery thin\u201d and weighed only 2.5 pounds \u2014 about four pounds less than the average weight of a kinkajou, according to The Association of Zoos and Aquariums. While the full results of the young animal are still pending, officials said the kinkajou \u2014 which looks like a cross between a monkey and a tiny bear \u2014 was in fair overall health. He is recuperating at the zoo as officials look for a permanent home for the tiny beast. Kinkajous, which have prehensile tails, are carnivores that live in tropical rainforests from southern Mexico through Brazil. With sandy yellow fur, round ears and big dark eyes, they are capable of grasping objects and are often mistakenly called primates, the zoo said. \u201cDespite their cuteness, kinkajous do not make good pets,\u201d the zoo said. Kinkajous are not endangered but are hunted for their fur, and the illegal exotic pet trade threatens their population, according to the zoo.", "summary": "Officials were left scratching their heads this week when they found a mammal indigenous to the rainforest crawling along a stretch of desert.", "url": "https://nypost.com/2024/06/28/us-news/rainforest-kinkajou-found-crawling-along-washington-state-highway/", "image": "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/06/say-nocturnal-rainforest-animal-east-84644789_8fe8bf.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 02:27:50", "author": "Katherine Donlevy", "authors": ["Katherine Donlevy"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.128}

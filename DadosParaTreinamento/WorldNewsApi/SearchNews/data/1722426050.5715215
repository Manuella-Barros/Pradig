Henson Teases She&#39;ll Be &#39;Showcasing Yet Another&#39; of Her Talents as 2024 BET Awards Host (Exclusive)", "text": "Viewers may not be ready for what they're about to see from Taraji P. Henson. Before the 53-year-old Oscar-nominated actress takes the stage as host of the 2024 BET Awards for the third time on June 30, she's opening up about her plans for the annual ceremony \u2014 which include something unexpected. \"I'm showcasing yet another talent that a lot of you don't know that I can do. Some of you know, but not all of you,\" Henson tells PEOPLE, adding that she's been wanting to display the talent for quite some time. \"I just haven't had the stage. I have, actually, once. But everybody didn't see it. This is culture's biggest night. The world will know.\" Even after two times hosting the show, the Color Purple star still gets jitters before the event kicks off \u2014 but she likes it that way. \"I love nerves. I still get nervous. I get nervous on the first day of shooting. It's a live show. Anything can go right or wrong, you know, but that's what's so exciting,\" says Henson. \"That's what I love about live theater. It keeps you on your toes.\" \"It's the not knowing that drives my adrenaline through the roof, but nerves are good. It just means you're alive,\" she continues. \"If I'm not nervous, I would be nervous.\" Henson hasn't been to the BET Awards since she last emceed in 2022, but she would've served as host last year if 2023 panned out differently for actors. \"I was ready last year to host and then we had the [SAG and WGA] strike. So, I'm really excited this year. It's gonna be an incredible show,\" she says. \"It's culture's biggest night. The performances are gonna blow us all away. We got Will Smith, guys. I am so excited to see what he has up his sleeve.\" In addition to Smith, whose new song \"You Can Make It\" is out now, performers at the 2024 BET Awards will also include GloRilla, Latto, Muni Long, Sexyy Red, Shaboozey, Victoria Mon\u00e9t, Lauryn Hill, YG Marley, Ice Spice, Tanner Adell, Tyla, Megan Thee Stallion, Chl\u00f6e, Childish Gambino (a.k.a. Donald Glover), Keke Palmer, Summer Walker, Marsha Ambrosius and Coco Jones. Drake led this year's nominations with seven, followed by Nicki Minaj with six, while J. Cole, Sexyy Red, SZA, and Mon\u00e9t each earned five, and 21 Savage, Beyonc\u00e9, Doja Cat, Megan, Tyla and Usher each received four. \"Usher is getting his flowers, and I'm so honored to host the show where he's receiving his flowers. I'm just proud of him,\" continues Henson of the R&B icon, who will take home the lifetime achievement award at the show. \"It's a proud moment for the culture.\" The 2024 BET Awards will air live on BET at 8 p.m. ET from the Peacock Theater in Los Angeles on June 30.", "summary": "The annual awards show will air live on BET from the Peacock Theater in Los Angeles on June 30", "url": "https://people.com/taraji-p-henson-will-display-another-of-her-talents-at-2024-bet-awards-exclusive-8671361", "image": "https://people.com/thmb/_oNmutLCLpnhzF9-IG2hVdcAEFo=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(785x247:787x249)/taraji-p-henson-062824-d9371db7c617452b8b15773a5279715e.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 02:50:00", "author": "Jack Irvin,Nathan Vinson", "authors": ["Jack Irvin", "Nathan Vinson"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": 0.387}

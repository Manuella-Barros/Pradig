(NYSE: AGR), a leading sustainable energy company and member of the Iberdrola (OTC:IBDRY) Group, today announced the signing of a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) with CPS Energy, the nation's largest community-owned provider of electric and natural gas services, for a 161-Megawatt (MW) portion of Avangrid (NYSE:AGR)'s Pe\u00c3\u00b1ascal I wind farm in Kenedy County, Texas south of Baffin Bay.\n\nThis represents an extension and expansion of a previous 15-year agreement between the two companies for energy from Pe\u00c3\u00b1ascal I. CPS Energy more than doubled its power offtake from the project \" increasing from 77 MW to 161 MW \" and will now receive almost 80% of the power generated there. Avangrid is supplying CPS Energy with enough energy from Pe\u00c3\u00b1ascal I to power about 41,000 Texas homes.\n\nThis is another great example of Avangrid working closely with our partners to continue delivering clean, reliable energy to customers, said Pedro Azagra, Avangrid CEO. In this case, we are growing our already strong relationship with CPS Energy to support their growing customer base while managing merchant risk at one of our existing wind facilities. Partnerships like this are critical to supporting a clean energy transition in Texas and beyond.\n\nGrowing our portfolio of renewable energy brings us closer to realizing our Vision 2027 goals, said Rudy D. Garza, President and CEO of CPS Energy. This expansion is an exciting step in our renewable energy commitments and is well-aligned with our approved generation plan.\n\nThe additional 84 MW of wind power supports CPS Energy's Vision 2027 plan that contemplates the retirement of 2,249 MW of older generation capacity before 2030. These efforts also align with CPS Energy's commitment to the City of San Antonio's Climate Action & Adaptation Plan (CAAP), which includes a resolution by the CPS Energy Board of Trustees to support the CAAP's goal to become carbon neutral by 2050, and the interim goals of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 41% from 2016 levels and 71% by 2040.\n\nPe\u00c3\u00b1ascal I was the first wind power project on the Texas coast, reaching commercial operations in 2009. It includes 84 turbines that generate a total of 202 MW of renewable energy and supports 16 permanent employees in the community. Additionally, Pe\u00c3\u00b1ascal I has paid nearly $30 million in property taxes since being built, which is used for public services like education.\n\nAvangrid developed this project in a way that minimizes environmental impacts on birds, wildlife and wetlands. Before construction began, Avangrid partnered with wildlife biologists who spent more than 4,000 hours in the field studying the site and avian patterns during a wide variety of weather conditions. Information gleaned from the studies showed that Pe\u00c3\u00b1ascal I has minimal impact on the environment and wildlife.\n\nAbout Avangrid: Avangrid, Inc.

CPS Energy more than doubled its power offtake from the project - increasing from 77 MW to 161 MW - and will now receive almost 80% of the power generated there. Avangrid is supplying CPS Energy with enough energy from Pe\u00f1ascal I to power about 41 000 Texas homes.\n\n\"This is another great example of Avangrid working closely with our partners to continue delivering clean, reliable energy to customers,\" said Pedro Azagra, Avangrid CEO. \"In this case, we are growing our already strong relationship with CPS Energy to support their growing customer base while managing merchant risk at one of our existing wind facilities. Partnerships like this are critical to supporting a clean energy transition in Texas and beyond.\"\n\n\"Growing our portfolio of renewable energy brings us closer to realising our Vision 2027 goals,\" said Rudy D. Garza, President and CEO of CPS Energy. \"This expansion is an exciting step in our renewable energy commitments and is well-aligned with our approved generation plan.\"\n\nThe additional 84 MW of wind power supports CPS Energy's Vision 2027 plan that contemplates the retirement of 2249 MW of older generation capacity before 2030. These efforts also align with CPS Energy's commitment to the City of San Antonio's Climate Action & Adaptation Plan (CAAP), which includes a resolution by the CPS Energy Board of Trustees to support the CAAP's goal to become carbon neutral by 2050, and the interim goals of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 41% from 2016 levels and 71% by 2040.\n\nPe\u00f1ascal I was the first wind power project on the Texas coast, reaching commercial operations in 2009. It includes 84 turbines that generate a total of 202 MW of renewable energy and supports 16 permanent employees in the community. Additionally, Pe\u00f1ascal I has paid nearly US$30 million in property taxes since being built, which is used for public services like education.\n\nAvangrid developed this project in a way that minimises environmental impacts on birds, wildlife and wetlands. Before construction began, Avangrid partnered with wildlife biologists who spent more than 4000 hours in the field studying the site and avian patterns during a wide variety of weather conditions. Information gleaned from the studies showed that Pe\u00f1ascal I has minimal impact on the environment and wildlife.\n\nThe Spring 2024 issue of Energy Global starts with a guest comment from Field on how battery storage sites can serve as a viable solution to curtailed energy, before moving on to a regional report from Th\u00e9odore Reed-Martin, Editorial Assistant, Energy Global, looking at the state of renewables in Europe.

(NYSE: AGR), a leading sustainable energy company and member of the Iberdrola (OTC:IBDRY) Group, today announced that it recently donated 300 pounds of decommissioned wind turbine blades to WindLoop, a startup comprising of students at Yale University, to test an innovative process for blade recycling. Consistent with Avangrid's commitment to sustainability, WindLoop's mission is to build a circular economy for the wind industry by recycling wind turbine components.\n\nAvangrid is one of America's most innovative leaders in renewable energy, and this is yet another example of our forward-thinking approach to accelerating a clean energy transition across the United States, said Avangrid CEO Pedro Azagra. We recognize the great challenges in front of us, and we are helping lay the groundwork to find new and efficient methods to recycle blades that will improve the circularity of our industry.\n\nWind turbine blade recycling has long been a challenge in the industry due to the high costs associated with transporting blades and difficulty extracting blade materials \" including glass fiber and epoxy resin \" in such a way that they that they can be reused. The donated turbine blades came from Avangrid's Baffin wind farm in Kenedy County, Texas.\n\nWindLoop's strategy includes two parts. It incorporates an on-site blade shredder which has been shown to significantly reduce transportation costs from wind farm to recycling facility. The company has also developed a process, using green chemistry principles, to effectively separate the fibers and resin in blades. WindLoop's novel solution can recover over 90% of turbine blade material and 97% of the overall value of the turbine blades.\n\nFor a future powered by solar, wind, and energy storage, we need to minimize waste and ensure that materials are recycled for the next wave of clean energy manufacturing, Shubh Jain, CEO and Co-Founder of WindLoop. Currently, there is no large-scale industrial process for recycling wind turbine blades, and companies are facing increasing pressure to find recycling facilities that offer circular recycling solutions. WindLoop seeks to bridge this gap. Avangrid's support is essential for WindLoop to carry out advanced R&D and bring its novel recycling process for wind turbine blades to market. Our shared commitment to developing a circular economy for wind energy in America makes this partnership especially promising.\n\nAvangrid is committed to minimizing resource consumption and waste and establishing a circular process to keep materials in use and at high value for the long term. Engaging in a circular economy is one of the top three environmental priorities for Avangrid, resulting in a plan to recycle 100% of the company's decommissioned wind turbine blades by 2030.\n\nSustainability is at the core of every decision we make at Avangrid, and serves as a guiding principle in our business,\" said Laney Brown, vice president of sustainability at Avangrid. \"Blade recycling is a key component to the sustainable use of resources as we support the clean energy transition. We are pleased to work with forward-thinkers like WindLoop to develop circular solutions that minimize environmental impacts in our industry.\"\n\nFinding a solution to recycling turbine components will become increasingly important to the maturing U.S. wind industry as repowering becomes more common. Repowering includes the replacement of some or all parts of a wind turbine once they reach 10-15 years old to capitalize on improving wind turbine technology and increasing efficiency. Finding a commercially viable blade recycling solution is important to ensuring the sustainability of current and future wind projects across the nation's wind fleet.\n\nWindLoop's team comprises of four students at Yale School of the Environment in Connecticut, near Avangrid's company headquarters.\n\nAbout Avangrid: Avangrid, Inc.

CPS Energy more than doubled its power offtake from the project - increasing from 77 MW to 161 MW - and will now receive almost 80% of the power generated there.\n\nPe\u00f1ascal I was the first wind power project on the Texas coast, reaching commercial operations in 2009. It includes 84 turbines that generate a total of 202 MW.\n\nJoin us at GridTECH Connect California, June 24-26, 2024, in Newport Beach, CA! With some of the most ambitious sustainability and clean energy goals in the country, California is at the cutting edge of the energy transition while confronting its most cumbersome roadblocks. From electric vehicles to battery storage, microgrids, community solar, and everything in between, attendees will collaborate to advance interconnection procedures and policies in California.\n\n\"This is another great example of Avangrid working closely with our partners to continue delivering clean, reliable energy to customers,\" said Pedro Azagra, Avangrid CEO. \"In this case, we are growing our already strong relationship with CPS Energy to support their growing customer base while managing merchant risk at one of our existing wind facilities. Partnerships like this are critical to supporting a clean energy transition in Texas and beyond.\"\n\n\"Growing our portfolio of renewable energy brings us closer to realizing our Vision 2027 goals,\" said Rudy D.

The donated turbine blades came from Avangrid's Baffin wind farm in Kenedy County, Texas.\n\n\"For a future powered by solar, wind, and energy storage, we need to minimize waste and ensure that materials are recycled for the next wave of clean energy manufacturing,\" Shubh Jain, CEO and cofounder of WindLoop. \"Currently, there is no large-scale industrial process for recycling wind turbine blades, and companies are facing increasing pressure to find recycling facilities that offer circular recycling solutions. WindLoop seeks to bridge this gap. Avangrid's support is essential for WindLoop to carry out advanced R&D and bring its novel recycling process for wind turbine blades to market. Our shared commitment to developing a circular economy for wind energy in America makes this partnership especially promising.\"\n\nWindLoop's strategy includes two parts. It incorporates an on-site blade shredder which the company says has been shown to reduce transportation costs associated with moving materials from a wind farm to a recycling facility. The company says it has also developed a process, using green chemistry principles, to separate the fibers and resin in blades. WindLoop claims its novel solution can recover over 90% of turbine blade material and 97% of the overall value of the turbine blades.\n\n\"Sustainability is at the core of every decision we make at Avangrid, and serves as a guiding principle in our business,\" said Laney Brown, vice president of sustainability at Avangrid. \"Blade recycling is a key component to the sustainable use of resources as we support the clean energy transition. We are pleased to work with forward-thinkers like WindLoop to develop circular solutions that minimize environmental impacts in our industry.\"\n\nWindLoop's team consists of four students at Yale School of the Environment in Connecticut, near Avangrid's company headquarters.\n\nAs wind turbines reach the end of their operational lives, the disposal and recycling of wind turbine blades can become a complex issue. These blades, often made from composite materials like carbon fiber or glass, are challenging to recycle using conventional methods, often leading to considerable waste.\n\nThe wind energy manufacturing industry also depends on critical minerals, such as rare earth elements (including neodymium and dysprosium), which do not currently have domestic commercial-scale recycling options.\n\nDue to their large size and durable composition, finding sustainable solutions for handling used wind turbines is crucial. Landfill disposal has been a common approach, but this method presents a different set of environmental and lifecycle cost challenges.\n\nWind turbines have an operational lifespan of several decades, so waste management during decommissioning is a long-term consideration. Waste regulation aims to address concerns related to the disposal, recycling, and environmental impact of wind turbine components at the end of their useful life.\n\nBecause the wind energy industry is relatively young, U.S. wind farm operators and policymakers have yet to encounter decommissioning challenges.", "source": {"uri": "renewableenergyworld.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Renewable Energy World"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sean_wolfe@renewableenergyworld.com", "name": "Sean Wolfe", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avangrid", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Avangrid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_turbine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wind turbine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_sterling", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pound sterling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recycling", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Recycling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbine_blade", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Turbine blade"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_energy", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sustainable energy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epoxy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Epoxy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_farm", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wind farm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glass_fiber", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Glass fiber"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yale_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Yale University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renewable_energy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Renewable energy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_chemistry", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Green chemistry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_economy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Circular economy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiber", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fiber"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_storage", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Energy storage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainability", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sustainability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resin", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Resin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research_and_development", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Research and development"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_power", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wind power"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenedy_County,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kenedy County, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kenedy County, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysprosium", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dysprosium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rare-earth_element", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rare-earth element"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connecticut", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Connecticut"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Connecticut"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Environment", "label": "dmoz/Business/Environment", "wgt": 31}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Environment/Waste_Management", "label": "dmoz/Business/Environment/Waste Management", "wgt": 35}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Renewable", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Renewable", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Pollution_Prevention_and_Recycling", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Pollution Prevention and Recycling", "wgt": 33}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 46}], "image": "https://www.renewableenergyworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/thumbnail_IMG_8357.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9626111", "eventUri": "eng-9626111", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3803921568627451, "wgt": 158, "relevance": 1}

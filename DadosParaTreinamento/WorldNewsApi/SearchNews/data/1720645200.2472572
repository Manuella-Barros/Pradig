{"id": 231372788, "title": "Kilkenny Local Elections: Three key takeaways so far with First Count now under way", "text": "The First Count is now finally under way at Kilkenny count centre, and nervous candidates have retreated to the corridors and back rooms to get some headspace, with a first result expected around 7pm. (Some are also watching the small matter of the Leinster final between Kilkenny and Dublin). The tallies have shed some light on what we can possibly expect the make-up of the next council to be. Here are three key takeaways so far on how things may pan out: Keep up to date on our live blog 1. Fianna Fail and Fine Gael will hold onto their share The two largest parties in Kilkenny's local government look set to remain so. Fianna Fail candidates are on course to top the poll in three of the four local electoral areas, Fine Gael in the other. Almost all of their sitting councillors will retain their seats. Where candidates have retired, such as Matt Doran (FF), Patrick O'Neill (FG) and Eamon Aylward (FF), the parties look set to hold onto their seats through new candidates. This trend seems to be broadly reflected nationally. 2. Some newcomers are shaking things up A handful of newcomers are firmly in the hunt for a seat here. In the north, Independent Maurice Shortall is very much in the mix. In Callan-Thomastown, Joe Sheridan (FF) has had a barnstorming vote and will be hard to stop. Stephanie Doheny (SF) has also reason to be hopeful in this area, as does Jenny Catt Slattery in South Kilkenny. 3. Sinn Fein have had a tough election Six months ago, Sinn Fein were riding high in the polls, and it's only four years since Kathleen Funchion won a General Election in this constituency with a poll-topping, record-breaking vote. Things have stuttered for the party in the meantime, however, and despite running a total of eight candidate across the four Kilkenny LEAs, the party may be lucky to win two seats. Sitting councillor Denis Hynes has an uphill battle ahead. All said, they are still in with a shot however - it's not over until it's over.", "summary": "<table><tr><td><img src=\"https://www.kilkennypeople.ie/resizer/300/200/true/2024_06_08/Untitled_design_%2811%29-1717867087566.jpg--kilkenny_.jpg?1717867087727\" alt=\"\" align=\"left\" />The First Count is now finally under way at Kilkenny count centre, and nervous candidates have retreated to the corridors and back rooms to get some headspace, with a first result expected around 7pm.

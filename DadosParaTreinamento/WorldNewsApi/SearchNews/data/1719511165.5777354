Perez was tagged by Magnussen as the backmarkers sped uphill to Casino square, with the Mexican sent spinning into the barriers and Hulkenberg also caught in the mayhem. The Haas cars had started from the last row of the grid after being excluded from the qualifying results due to a rear wing breach. All three drivers climbed out of their cars unhurt, with carbon fibre debris strewn across the track as red flags were waved. Red Bull said Perez, who started the day third in the championship led by team mate Max Verstappen, did not have to go to the medical centre. \u201cIt was a typical lap-one racing accident. Two drivers who both didn\u2019t want to bail out and didn\u2019t give enough room on a tight track like Monaco, and I was the unlucky victim there,\u201d said Hulkenberg. Stewards reviewed the incident and decided to take no further action, a relief for Magnussen who is in danger of a race ban. The two Alpines of Pierre Gasly and Esteban Ocon also banged wheels at Portier as they fought for position, with Ocon\u2019s car lifted into the air. \u201cWhat did he do? Why did he try to attack me?\u201d exclaimed Gasly. \u201cThe whole car is damaged now.\u201d Ocon, who did not re-start, was given a 10-second penalty for causing a collision which will likely translate into a grid drop at the next race. Ferrari\u2019s Charles Leclerc led from pole position with McLaren\u2019s Oscar Piastri second. All cars returned to the pit lane before a second standing start, which went off cleanly, in their original order. That was good news for Ferrari, who had seen Carlos Sainz go off at Casino before the collision and after an incident with Piastri. The Spaniard, who started third, was able to get going and return to the pits. Leclerc was bidding to become the first Monegasque to win his home grand prix since 1931.

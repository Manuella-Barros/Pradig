Orlando Cepeda, the 11-time All-Star inducted to the Hall of Fame in 1999, died Friday at the age of 86, his wife, Nydia, said in a statement released by the Giants. \u201cOur beloved Orlando passed away peacefully at home this evening, listening to his favorite music and surrounded by his loved ones,\u201d Nydia said. \u201cWe take comfort that he is at peace.\u201d Cepeda\u2019s death was announced in between the fifth and sixth innings of the Giants\u2019 game Friday night against the Los Angeles Dodgers, and the crowd on hand honored the \u201cBaby Bull\u201d with a moment of silence. Giants players were taking the field for the top of the sixth, and many stopped and removed their caps. Many Giants players also learned of Willie Mays\u2019 death last week when it was announced between innings at Wrigley Field. \u201cWe lost a true gentleman and legend,\u201d Giants chairman Greg Johnson said in a statement. \u201cOrlando was a great ambassador for the game throughout his playing career and beyond. He was one of the all-time great Giants and he will truly be missed. Our condolences go out to the Cepeda family for their tremendous loss and we extend our thoughts to Orlando\u2019s teammates, his friends, and to all those touched by his passing.\u201d Named the Rookie of the Year in 1958, Cepeda went on to play 17 major-league seasons, including nine in San Francisco, where he earned 10 of his 11 All-Star appearances (MLB played two All-Star games per year from 1959-62) and slugged 226 of his 379 career home runs, including a league-high 46 while finishing second in MVP voting in 1961, eventually going on to win the award for the St. Louis Cardinals six years later. Cepeda\u2019s 142 RBIs in 1961 still stands as the Giants\u2019 franchise record, and he ranks among the leaders in the San Francisco-era in RBIs (4th, 767), home runs (5th, 226), hits (6th, 1,286) and runs (9th, 652). In 1,114 career games as a Giant, Cepeda hit .308 with 226 doubles, 22 triples, 226 homers, 767 RBI, 92 stolen bases and posted an .887 OPS. \u201cThis is truly a sad day for the San Francisco Giants,\u201d Giants CEO Larry Baer added. \u201cFor all of Orlando\u2019s extraordinary baseball accomplishments, it was his generosity, kindness and joy that defined him. No one loved the game more. Our heartfelt condolences go out to his wife, Nydia, his five children, Orlando, Jr., Malcolm, Ali, Carl and Hector, his nine grandchildren, his one great granddaughter as well as his extended family and friends.\u201d This is a developing story.

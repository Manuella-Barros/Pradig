Lenders run the ruler over borrowers\u2019 living expenses, and could see frequent use of \u201cbuy now, pay later\u201d (BNPL) providers as a red flag, Giamalis says. Some BNPLs reserve the right to report missed payments on your credit history, which could affect your credit score. The federal government has introduced a bill to parliament that will regulate BNPL as consumer credit, similar to how credit cards are regulated. When passed, new users of those services will undergo a credit check, for example. Giamalis says as well as saving for your deposit, you should start saving the amount you need for your monthly mortgage repayment.

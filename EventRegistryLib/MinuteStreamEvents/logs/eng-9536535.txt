He told his congregation Sunday that her death was \"self-induced\" and that she \"wasn't well mentally\" and was in need of medicine that was \"hard to get to her.\" He never mentioned Mica Miller by name.\n\n\"I got a call late last night, my wife has passed away,\" he said. \"It was self-induced and it was up in North Carolina.\"\n\nThe pastor asked his congregation not to talk about his wife's death inside the church, adding that he was just \"kind of going on adrenaline.\"\n\n\"She had struggled with suicide before,\" John-Paul Miller said. \"Each time we would help her through it and take her to the doctor, and we got through it and everything was fine. She even gave a few testimonies here at church that we have on video. She battled suicide, but God took care of her and got her through it.\"\n\nCourt filings showed that Mica Miller had filed for divorce from her husband just weeks before her death.\n\nStill, a glowing obituary for Miller described a loving relationship between the two, writing that the Kansas native was a \"great stepmother\" to five children and an \"amazing wife.\"\n\n\"Mica was energetic, affirming, adventurous, faithful, loving, giving, forgiving, talented, joyous, creative, assertive, bold, determined, authoritative, passionate, hardworking, a risk taker, and so much more,\" the obituary says. \"She and JP have been friends since 2009, married in 2017, and spent almost every single day and night together.\"\n\nThe Robeson County Sheriff's Office announced Thursday it was opening a probe into Miller's death, with Maj. Damien McLean telling WPDE its officers were still \"in the process of gathering information from people in South and North Carolina as part of their investigation into how Miller died.\"\n\nMiller posted a final photo to her public Facebook profile on April 9, a selfie with the eerie caption, \"When terrible terrible TERRIBLE things happen to you... (y'all know what I'm talking about) RPF: resting peace face.\"\n\nShe had posted photos of herself being baptized in the ocean a little over a week earlier, tagging a South Carolina church that was not the one where her husband preached. And on March 22, posted a video in which she discussed \"leaving a dangerous situation.\"\n\nMcLean told WPDE there is no indication the public is in danger. A GoFundMe for Mica Miller had raised approximately $4,000 by Friday morning.\n\nThe Facebook page Voices in the Wilderness, said to be run by Miller's mother, has posted frequently since her death. Her mom noted that a \"no contact order and a divorce was filed just days before this tragedy,\" adding that \"we are devastated.\"\n\nMiller's sister Sierra Francis urged people in a Facebook post not to \"listen to false stories being shared about\" her sibling, adding that she had suffered from abuse.\n\n\"Mica was a God-fearing, joyful, loving woman who did not deserve the abuse she endured,\" Francis wrote. \"If you hear anything about this from anyone other than her family please question it, reach out to her siblings or parents.\"", "source": {"uri": "thedailybeast.com",

She battled suicide, but God took care of her and got her through it.\"\n\nCourt filings showed that Mica Miller had filed for divorce from her husband just weeks before her death.\n\nStill, a glowing obituary for Miller described a loving relationship between the two, writing that the Kansas native was a \"great stepmother\" to five children and an \"amazing wife.\"\n\n\"Mica was energetic, affirming, adventurous, faithful, loving, giving, forgiving, talented, joyous, creative, assertive, bold, determined, authoritative, passionate, hardworking, a risk taker, and so much more,\" the obituary says. \"She and JP have been friends since 2009, married in 2017, and spent almost every single day and night together.\"\n\nThe Robeson County Sheriff's Office announced Thursday it was opening a probe into Miller's death, with Maj. Damien McLean telling WPDE its officers were still \"in the process of gathering information from people in South and North Carolina as part of their investigation into how Miller died.\"\n\nMiller posted a final photo to her public Facebook profile on April 9, a selfie with the eerie caption, \"When terrible terrible TERRIBLE things happen to you... (y'all know what I'm talking about) RPF: resting peace face.\"\n\nShe had posted photos of herself being baptized in the ocean a little over a week earlier, tagging a South Carolina church that was not the one where her husband preached. And on March 22, posted a video in which she discussed \"leaving a dangerous situation.\"\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=pfbid0Tz7VjbKLu9AgQkuz5Dki41jynGbBFqiEwHYhSiinuRHK6GMZfLtL3fjomsR9tHBrl&id=61557256090698\n\nMcLean told WPDE there is no indication the public is in danger. A GoFundMe for Mica Miller had raised approximately $4,000 by Friday morning.\n\nThe Facebook page Voices in the Wilderness, said to be run by Miller's mother, has posted frequently since her death. Her mom noted that a \"no contact order and a divorce was filed just days before this tragedy,\" adding that \"we are devastated.\"\n\nMiller's sister Sierra Francis urged people in a Facebook post not to \"listen to false stories being shared about\" her sibling, adding that she had suffered from abuse.\n\n\"Mica was a God-fearing, joyful, loving woman who did not deserve the abuse she endured,\" Francis wrote. \"If you hear anything about this from anyone other than her family please question it, reach out to her siblings or parents.\"\n\nRead more at The Daily Beast.\n\nGet the Daily Beast's biggest scoops and scandals delivered right to your inbox.

(NewsNation) -- A South Carolina community is mourning the death of a pastor's wife, but say they're not buying everything he's said about her final days.\n\nThe Robeson County Sheriff's Office is investigating Mica Miller's death after her body was found in a North Carolina state park on April 27.\n\nMica Miller, 30, was found dead with an alleged self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head at Lumber State Park in Lumberton, North Carolina, according to the police report.\n\nIf you or someone you know needs help, resources or someone to talk to, you can find it at the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline website or by calling 1-800-273-8255. People are available to talk to 24\u00d77.\n\nJohn-Paul Miller on Mica Miller's death\n\nHer husband, John-Paul Miller announced her death the following day to his congregation, claiming the 30-year-old had taken her own life after struggling with mental illness.\n\n\"I got a call late last night, my wife has passed away,\" John-Paul Miller said. \"It was self-induced and it was up in North Carolina.\"\n\nThe pastor asked the congregation not to discuss her death inside the church -- Solid Rock Church in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina.\n\n\"Y'all pray for me and my kids and everybody. You all knew she wasn't well mentally and she needed medicine that was hard to get to her. I'm sure there will be more details to come, but keep her family in your prayers,\" he said.\n\nHowever, her family and friends say otherwise, urging police to \"deeply investigate\" what happened.\n\nEditor's note: NewsNation obtained documents stating Mica Miller was \"afraid for her life\" before her death.\n\nMica Miller files for divorce\n\nAccording to reports, Mica Miller had filed multiple times for a legal separation from John-Paul Miller. In October 2023, she filed for divorce.\n\nMica Miller posted a video on Facebook on abuse just weeks ago, offering advice for people who may be in an abusive relationship. Some believe the video is proof that Mica Miller was in an abusive relationship herself.\n\n\"God hates divorce. But why? According to everybody I've asked, the scriptures I've found, it's because it hurts people. But does abuse hurt people? How do you think God feels about that?\" Mica Miller said.\n\nA Facebook group called \"Justice for Mica\" pointed out a statement in her obituary that they felt was odd.\n\nIt reads, \"She would praise her husband after every church service telling him he was the best preacher in the world (even if it wasn't true). She also told him he was the funniest preacher in the world (even though that wasn't true either).\"\n\nDemanding justice for Mica Miller\n\nMore than a hundred people rallied outside the Myrtle Beach church on Sunday, demanding justice for Mica Miller.\n\n\"I came out today to support her, to support her family, to support her story because her story is important and it needs to be heard,\" a rally attendee said.\n\nMica Miller's sister told friends on social media to \"not listen to false stories being shared about Mica.\"\n\nA friend of the 30-year-old said she spoke to Mica Miller multiple times the week she died, and her final text to her on Friday night was not a woman about to die but a woman making plans to live.\n\nMica Miller's death investigation launched\n\nThe Robeson County Sheriff's Office has officially opened an investigation into the shooting death of Mica Miller.\n\n\"Officers are in the process of gathering information from people in South and North Carolina

Miller told the church her death was self-induced and details of her memorial service on May 5, 2024.\n\nThe video of that sermon has since been deleted from YouTube and the church's website.\n\nMica Miller's family have posted on social media regarding her death, alluding to false information and abuse that Mica had suffered. It is unclear what the abuse was. Mica Miller too posted on her Facebook about abuse and leaving a dangerous situation with the hashtag, \"abuseawareness.\"\n\nMica Miller's mother posted on the Facebook page Voices in the Wilderness that her daughter had \"a no contact order and a divorce was filed just days before this tragedy.\"\n\nHusband says wife was battling mental illness\n\nJohn-Paul Miller confirmed that his wife had filed for divorce. He was notified by police of his wife's death late April 27.\n\nHe was told that Mica had purchased a gun and drove two hours to Lumber River State Park in Lumberton, North Carolina, where she was found in her vehicle by a kayaker, Miller said May 3, 2024.\n\nMiller described his wife's battle with mental illness, adding that this wasn't the first time she tried to take her own life. Mica Miller has been open about her mental health struggles, posting videos about it on social media and offering testimonies at her church.\n\nShe had been in the hospital in February, one of many times Mica had been placed there during their marriage, Miller said.\n\n\"That was just our life,\" Miller said.\n\nMiller described his wife as caring with a great love for the church. \"She did everything,\" Miller said.\n\nMica Miller, who would sit in the front row, was the leader for worship, youth and women's ministry as well as operating as her husband's personal assistant and taking care of other problems that people may have, Miller said.\n\nMiller said he is glad that the sheriff's department is investigating his wife's death.\n\n\"I want them to find out every detail,\" Miller said. \"I want to know everything, every detail.\"\n\nFamily has seen problems before\n\nThis isn't the first time the Miller family has been placed in the national media spotlight.\n\nIn 2014, John-Paul Miller's father, Reginald Wayne Miller, who founded the Cathedral Bible College, pleaded guilty in federal court to felony charges related to his treatment of international students who came to the Myrtle Beach college to earn degrees in theology, ministry and other Christian studies.\n\nThe senior Miller also was embroiled in controversy over allegations of sexual improprieties that forced him to move his ministry from Florence to Myrtle Beach.\n\nMiller once led one of South Carolina's largest charismatic churches and was a leading spokesman for the movement, which emphasizes speaking in tongues, prophecy and faith healing.", "source": {"uri": "myrtlebeachonline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MyrtleBeachOnline"}, "authors": [{"uri":

I've had lots of women that have reached out to me about situations of abuse, and I just want to tell you what a lot of people have told me lately, because I think I forgot.\n\n'But you are the bride of Christ before anybody else's, male or female, it doesn't matter what gender you are, abuse is abuse.'\n\nMyrtle Beach pastor John Paul Miller, 44, stunned his congregation at Solid Rock at Market Common Church in South Carolina when, after a service in which he had laughed and appeared entirely at ease, he announced that his wife had died and that her death was 'self-induced.'\n\nHe then told worshippers that he would be taking 'a little break' and to leave the church without discussing what he had just told them.\n\nMica Miller offered her support to victims of abuse and reminded them that they 'don't have to stay' in an emotional Facebook video shared on March 22\n\nMiller urged her friends and followers to share her message with anyone struggling to reconcile their faith with their abusive relationships\n\nDailyMail.com has learned that Mica's untimely death on April 27 came just 48 hours after she served her husband, Pastor John-Paul Miller, with divorce papers\n\nBut in the days since Mica's death on April 27, her family has pushed back at her husband's explanation of it as suicide.\n\nSpeaking to DailyMail.com today, Mica's sister Sierra Brown, 28, said that the family wasn't making any statements until the investigation was complete but pointed out: 'The one thing I would say is that he has said it was an official suicide, that is not the case. There's still an open investigation.'\n\nMica was found with a fatal gunshot wound in Lumber River State Park, North Carolina, in a death that is under investigation by Robeson County Sheriff's department. They have not made any comment other than to say there is no ongoing danger to the public.\n\nNow DailyMail.com has learned that Mica's death came just 48 hours after her husband, from whom she had been separated for one month, was served with divorce papers.\n\nCourt records hint at the tumult within the marriage with Mica first filing for divorce back in October 2023 before withdrawing the filing February 12.\n\nLater that same month Miller filed against his wife for Separate Support and Maintenance in a motion withdrawn March 11.\n\nBut on April 15, just 12 days before she was found dead, Mica filed once more and, according to friends, also sought a no contact order against her husband.\n\nToday, her haunting Facebook posts reveals the inner conflict with which Mica had wrestled before making her decision to leave, as she sought to square her religious convictions with the prospect of divorce. But she seemed, finally, to have done so.\n\nSpeaking March 22 she said: 'You don't have to stay in an abusive relationship. Whether that's sexual, whether that's somebody forcing you to take illegal drugs or alcohol abuse, or physical abuse, psychological abuse, making you think that this is all your fault or that you're a bad mom or a bad husband or you're not giving it your all when you know you are.\n\nJohn-Paul Miller shocked his congregation when he announced her death as a suicide at the end of a service at Solid Rock at Market Common Church in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina last Sunday\n\nMica was discovered with a fatal gunshot wound on April 27 in Lumber River State Park, North Carolina\n\nMica's sister Sierra, seen above in Facebook video, told DailyMail.com the family is not commenting publicly until the investigation is completed but confirmed her official cause of death has not yet been determined\n\n'God hates divorce, but why? According to everybody that I've asked and the scriptures I've seen it's because it hurts people. But does abuse hurt people. How do you think God feels about that?'\n\nMica met Miller, 14 years her senior, when she was just 14 years old and a member of his church youth group.\n\nAddressing his congregation Miller stated that Mica, stepmother to his five children, 'was mentally unwell.'\n\nBut friends have taken to social media to refute this statement with one posting on X: 'Mica is a close friend of mine, she 100% would not have committed suicide. She was excited to start a new life no longer living in fear of him & was finally on her way out.'\n\nIn Mica's obituary penned by Miller, who has a criminal record including multiple counts of aggravated assault and battery to which he pleaded guilty, makes no mention of the fact that the couple had separated.\n\nInstead, he described her as a 'great stepmother, and an amazing wife and helpmate, and portrayed her as his biggest cheerleader.\n\nKenn Young, Mica's friend, is among those searching for answers over what happened.\n\n'This has to be at least looked into deeply. There's got to be some accountability here,' he told WPDE. 'Because yeah, a tragic life was lost, and it's not just as simple as mental health issues.'\n\nMiller's sisters have also alluded to questions around her death, making posts with the caption '#JusticeforMica.'\n\n'There is a lot of talk already going on so I want to set the record straight. Our sister Mica Miller passed away yesterday,' Miller's sister Sierra Francis wrote.\n\n'Please do not listen to false stories being shared about her. Mica was a God-fearing, joyful, loving woman.\n\nBut the lack of information about Miller's passing has raised questions for some, including amongst her family\n\nBut the lack of information from the police has led many including Millers sisters (pictured) to question what happened\n\n'We know that so many of you feel this gut-wrenching loss with us. The fight is not over.'\n\nMiller originally hails from Wichita, Kansas, as one of five children, according to her obituary.\n\nCourt filings indicate she had served her husband with divorce papers just weeks before her death.\n\nThe pastor's obituary describes her as, 'energetic, affirming, adventurous, faithful, loving, giving, forgiving, talented, joyous, creative, assertive, bold, determined, authoritative, passionate, hardworking, a risk taker, and so much more.'\n\nIn an interview with ABC15, Miller's husband reiterated that his wife had taken her own life.\n\n'She had struggled with suicide before,' he said. 'Each time we would help her through it and take her to the doctor, and we got through it and everything was fine.\n\n'She even gave a few testimonies here at church that we have on video. She battled suicide but God took care of her and got her through it.'\n\nHe added she was 'probably the greatest wife anyone could ask for' and described nights spent talking to each other for hours.\n\nA celebration of Miller's life is scheduled to take place on Sunday.\n\nMajor Damien McLean with the Robeson County Sheriff's Office said his team is still working on the case. At this stage, there is nothing to suggest a threat to the wider community, he said.\n\nMcLean added his office plans to release more information in the next few days.\n\nDailyMail.com has contacted Robeson County Sheriff's Office for comment.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Miller, originally of Wichita, Kansas, was married to John-Paul Miller - pastor of the Solid Rock at Market Common church in Myrtle Beach, S.C.\n\nHer obituary - written by her husband - referred to her as \"energetic, affirming, adventurous, faithful, loving, giving, forgiving, talented, joyous, creative, assertive, bold, determined, authoritative, passionate, hardworking, a risk taker, and so much more.\"\n\nThe tribute also spoke extensively of Miller's relationship with her husband ... portraying her as his most ardent admirer and someone who \"helped (him) with the church in every way.\"\n\n\"She truly served Jesus and her husband with all of her heart,\" it noted. \"She would praise her husband after every church service telling him he was the best preacher in the world (even if it wasn't true). She also told him he was the funniest preacher in the world (even though that wasn't true either).\"\n\n(Click to View)\n\nWas this idyllic portrayal consistent with reality, though?\n\nThat's a question friends and family members of the late pastor's wife have been asking in the aftermath of her death - and the\n\nJohn-Paul Miller publicly announced his wife's death at the conclusion of his sermon last Sunday (April 28, 2024).\n\n\"We're not going to do an altar call today,\" he said. \"Instead ... I'm going to have you stand up and I'm going to make an announcement and after the announcement I'm going to ask that you leave church quietly and don't talk about the announcement here in the building.\"\n\nMiller then implored his congregants to \"continue to come to church and serve and give for the next little bit because ... I'm talking a little bit of a break.\"\n\n\"My break may be a few days, a few weeks - I don't know,\" Miller continued, his voice breaking. \"I got a call late last night my wife has passed away. Yeah. It was self-induced and it was up in North Carolina and, um, we're going to have a funeral for her next Sunday here at 3:00 p.m.\"\n\n\"Ya'll knew that she wasn't well mentally - and that she needed her medicine that was hard to get to her,\" Miller said. \"I'm sure there'll be more details to come.\"\n\nAs noted in John-Paul Miller's sermon and the obituary, a \"celebration of life\" service for his late wife has been scheduled for this coming Sunday (May 5, 2024) at the Solid Rock church.\n\nThis media outlet has prepared a flurry of Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests in the hopes of gathering information from the law enforcement agencies tasked with investigating Miller's death. We are also investigating reports from several of Mica Miller's close friends regarding the circumstances surrounding her unexpected passing.\n\nSpecifically, several videos have been posted to social media in which Miller discussed a situation she was dealing with in her personal life.\n\n\"I just wanna let you know that I'm alive and well,\" Miller said in one video posted to her Facebook page in mid-March. \"Life's been kinda crazy a couple past weeks, months, years. I've kinda had to keep my circle really small for the past couple weeks just because I'm going through a lot and it's hard - and it's my cross to bear.\"\n\nIn another video discussing her \"situation,\" Miller addressed being the \"bride of Christ.\"\n\n(Click to View)\n\n\"A bunch of people have been reminding me lately that I'm God's bride first,\" she said. \"And even an earthly spouse - who's a good spouse - when they know that their bride is being hurt, just imagine what an earthly spouse does. What do think your heavenly spouse does? When you're the bride of Christ and he sees his bride going through abuse and hurt - what do you think he thinks about that?\"\n\nMiller encouraged her followers to share the video with anyone \"struggling with leaving a dangerous situation because they think God will be 'mad' at them.\"\n\nAnyone with information related to this story is encouraged to reach out to our media outlet ...\n\nWill Folks is the founding editor of the news outlet you are currently reading.

YOUNG MOM VANISHES WITHOUT A TRACE AS SHADOWY WITNESS IMPLIES FOUL PLAY\n\nREAD ON THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nAn obituary for Miller states that the 30-year-old woman was \"energetic, affirming, adventurous, faithful, loving, giving, forgiving, talented, joyous, creative, assertive, bold, determined, authoritative, passionate, hardworking, a risk taker, and so much more.\"\n\nHowever, Mica's loved ones on social media are noting one part of the obituary that strikes them as odd: \"She would praise her husband after every church service telling him he was the best preacher in the world (even if it wasn't true). She also told him he was the funniest preacher in the world (even though that wasn't true either). Mica loved her family soooooooo much.\"\n\nCOLORADO MOM SUZANNE MORPHEW'S AUTOPSY RESULTS REVEAL CAUSE, MANNER OF DEATH\n\nThe Horry County Clerk's Office in South Carolina confirmed to Fox News Digital that Mica Miller had filed three different \"separate support and maintenance\" requests since last year -- the latest filed on April 16. Separate support and maintenance allows one spouse to receive court-ordered support from another spouse without officially divorcing.\n\nSince Mica's death, which has rocked the Myrtle Beach community, her family and friends have been sharing posts on social media with the hashtag, \"JusticeforMica.\"\n\nMISSING TENNESSEE TEEN SEBASTIAN ROGERS' DAD HIRES PIO AS SEARCH ENTERS 2ND MONTH: 'COULD BE ANYWHERE'\n\nHer sister pleaded with friends on social media to \"not listen to false stories being shared about\" Mica.\n\n\"Mica was a God-fearing, joyful, loving woman who did not deserve the abuse she endured. If you hear anything about this from anyone other than her family please question it, reach out to her siblings or parents,\" she wrote.\n\nGO HERE FOR MORE TRUE CRIME FROM FOX NEWS DIGITAL\n\n\"I talked to her multiple times in her final week here on earth,\" Mica's friend wrote on Facebook. \"She was making plans to get her hair cut, getting help with her car payment because she was a little short after PAYING HER DIVORCE LAWYER and planning to meet us for the second service at church on Sunday. My final text with her on Friday at 9:19 pm was a woman making plans to live!!!! What happened between Friday night and Saturday?\"\n\nFox News Digital reached out to John-Paul's Myrtle Beach congregation, Solid Rock at Market Common, for comment but did not immediately hear back. The Robeson County Sheriff's Office also did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital.\n\nOriginal article source: Death of South Carolina pastor's wife under investigation as her family warns of

While that was a significant development in and of itself, the application for this appointment contained the real revelation - a harrowing glimpse into the life of fear Miller told friends and family she was leading in the days just before her death.\n\nIn social media messages posted prior to her alleged suicide in Lumberton, North Carolina last Saturday (April 27, 2024), Miller spoke of a \"difficult situation\" she was going through in her personal life.\n\n\"I'm going through a lot and it's hard,\" she said.\n\nThe probate court application spelled out in no uncertain terms that the difficult \"situation\" Miller was dealing with was years of alleged violence, abuse and stalking from her pastor-husband, John-Paul \"JP\" Miller.\n\nThe Millers' story made national headlines following the bizarre announcement of Mica's death by her husband to the congregation of their church - Solid Rock at Market Common - just one day after he allegedly received the news. At the conclusion of a full-length, upbeat sermon last Sunday (April 28, 2024), Miller asked his congregation to stand for an announcement -- giving his parishioners strict instructions not to discuss the forthcoming news amongst themselves.\n\n\"We're not going to do an altar call today,\" he said. \"Instead ... I'm going to have you stand up and I'm going to make an announcement and after the announcement I'm going to ask that you leave church quietly and don't talk about the announcement here in the building.\"\n\nMiller implored his congregants to \"continue to come to church and serve and give for the next little bit because ... I'm talking a little bit of a break.\"\n\n\"My break may be a few days, a few weeks - I don't know,\" Miller continued, his voice breaking. \"I got a call late last night my wife has passed away. Yeah. It was self-induced and it was up in North Carolina and, um, we're going to have a funeral for her next Sunday here at 3:00 p.m.\"\n\n\"Ya'll knew that she wasn't well mentally - and that she needed her medicine that was hard to get to her,\" Miller said. \"I'm sure there'll be more details to come.\"\n\nImmediately following the announcement, Miller's family and friends took to the internet expressing shock and disbelief at her husband's claim that Mica committed suicide.\n\nMica Miller's body was found last weekend at the Lumber River State Park in North Carolina - a little over an hour's drive from Myrtle Beach. While it has been reported her death was the result of a gunshot wound to the head, the exact circumstances surrounding how or where her body was located are still unknown. Friends have indicated she had no known ties to the area - no reason to be an hour away from home.\n\nBehind the scenes, her family was actively taking steps to protect her estate as tensions were beginning to escalate. On May 3, 2024, an application was filed by attorney Jarrett Bouchette in Horry County probate court on behalf of Mica's sister, Sierra Francis. That application sought to appoint Francis as a special administrator of Mica's estate. Attached to this application were affidavits and exhibits showing why friends and family are actively seeking a full investigation into her death.\n\nThe appointment of special administrator was requested to:\n\nAccording to a memorandum in support of this request, the timing of Mica's death was very suspicious.\n\nAs we previously reported, just prior to her death - on April 15, 2024 - Mica filed for divorce from her husband. As we reported, JP Miller was served these papers on April 25, 2024 -- two days prior to her death. The hearing relating to this filing had been scheduled for June 5, 2024 in front of S.C. family court judge Jan Bromell Holmes. At that hearing, Miller's attorneys hoped to obtain an order which would restrain John-Paul Miller from disposing of, encumbering, transferring, selling, hypothecating, pledging, destroying or otherwise altering the status or value of any marital asset.\n\nBecause Mica Miller's divorce papers were filed prior to her death, the portion of the divorce seeking equitable division of assets - basically the individual's share of the marital estate - survives even if the individual dies. That means Mica's estate can seek to recover that portion of the marital estate so long as a claim has been filed.\n\nThe memorandum in support of installing Mica Miller's sister as administrator pointed out \"it would be impractical for Mr. Miller to be appointed as special administrator, or personal representative, of (Mica's) estate as he has a pecuniary interest in the outcome of such a claim regarding the marital estate.\"\n\n\"It is prudent for a third-party to be appointed for this purpose to ensure that the results are equitable to those involved,\" the memo added.\n\nThe affidavits from Mica's sister and brother go into further detail about what the young wife was experiencing in the weeks and days leading up to her death. In her affidavit, Mica's sister -- who said she spoke to Mica \"every few days\" and texted with her daily -- stated Mica \"expressed the abuse and violence against her by her husband to others, including family members and members of the church congregation.\"\n\nThe affidavit claimed Mica was living in fear as she prepared to serve divorce papers on her estranged husband. It added that JP Miller allegedly had people following his wife and keeping track of where she went - which he reportedly acknowledged in at least one sermon.\n\nMica also told her sister that JP Miller had been moving assets around to avoid them being included in the marital estates. Specifically, she stated he transferred the deed to their house to the church - and transferred his interest in a local piano bar called 'Crocodile Rocks' to his son.\n\nAccording to the affidavit, Mica had been gathering evidence in preparation to file for divorce - evidence which would have supported her claims of \"abuse, character, his paramours, and associates he 'paid off' or blackmailed when she was admitted to the Waccamaw Mental Health facility.\"\n\nAccording to her sister, when Mica was discharged from the facility - unbeknownst to her - JP Miller had moved her belongings out of the house and all of the evidence she had gathered was \"removed from her phone, personal laptop, vehicle and purse and never recovered.\"\n\nMica was further unable to access her email, iCloud or Facebook account following this admission, according to her sister. Additionally, JP Miller allegedly continued to use at least one of her accounts - causing any recipient who received messages from it to believe they were sent by Mica.\n\nMica's sister says in the weeks leading up to her death, she was very hopeful about her future - but had expressed fear that \"she would not make it to the divorce and that her life would be taken from her.\"\n\nShe told Sierra many times, \"if I end up with a bullet in my head, it was not by me, it was JP.\"\n\nThe worst fears of Mica Miller's friends and family were realized on April 27, 2024 - but a campaign immediately began to find the truth about how Mica Miller died. After being informed they were not welcome to attend Mica's funeral at the church she had allegedly been trying so hard to escape, Mica's friends and family held a memorial for her on Sunday on the beach - a place she loved based on the many photos of her beaming with the ocean in the background. There, they celebrated the life of this young woman - and demanded a thorough investigation into the circumstances surrounding her death.\n\nCount on our media outlet - which first reported on MIller's suspicious death last Thursday - to keep our audience up to speed on the very latest related to this story.\n\nJenn Wood is FITSNews' incomparable research director.

He said, apparently pretty matter-of-factly:\n\n\"I got a call late last night, my wife has passed away. It was self-induced and it was up in North Carolina.\"\n\nHe then gave everyone details about her memorial service and told them not to talk about the announcement anymore within the church. Weird. Also weird? He was exceptionally quick to label his ex's shockingly sudden death a suicide. He even added that \"she wasn't well mentally\":\n\n\"Y'all pray for me and my kids and everybody. You all knew she wasn't well mentally and she needed medicine that was hard to get to her. I'm sure there will be more details to come, but keep her family in your prayers.\"\n\nUnlike all his other sermons, this one isn't available to watch on the Solid Rock YouTube page anymore -- but it's the internet, and someone got a copy anyway. See for yourself (below):\n\nHe also spoke to local outlet WPDE, telling them the same -- just really talking surprisingly candidly about her suicide, and her past struggles with it:\n\n\"She had struggled with suicide before. Each time we would help her through it and take her to the doctor, and we got through it and everything was fine. She even gave a few testimonies here at church that we have on video. She battled suicide but God took care of her and got her through it.\"\n\nHe also told the outlet:\n\n\"She was probably the greatest wife anyone could ask for. She was incredibly affirming. We spent every night together for hours just talking and talking and talking.\"\n\nAwful news... except... Right now the public only has his word this was a suicide. Robeson County Sheriff's Office Major Damien McLean would only tell the local ABC affiliate that there was an investigation into the death of the 30-year-old, saying:\n\n\"Officers are in the process of gathering information from people in South and North Carolina as part of their investigation into how Miller died.\"\n\nNo official cause of death has been released.\n\nRelated: Woman Who Stabbed Boyfriend 108 Times Says They're Really 'BOTH To Blame'\n\nLocal NC outlet The Robesonian was the first to report any actual details of Mica's April 27 death, saying she was found with a gunshot wound to the head at Lumber River State Park in Lumberton (about an hour and a half north of Myrtle Beach). But they've since taken down their article! Everyone else was citing them for those deets. Why did they take that down? Did the cops tell them it's too soon?\n\nMeanwhile here you have this Pastor just telling anyone who will listen how his wife definitely died by suicide. If police weren't sure yet, wouldn't you think a spouse would want to wait and be 100% sure, too?? Why would a husband be so forthcoming about such a personal matter anyway? Seems a little odd, right?\n\nOdder still? In all his talk about spending every night together talking with Mica, he didn't mention she'd filed for divorce from him just weeks earlier. Yeah. Clearly their marriage was not as lovey-dovey as he makes out. And she has zero photos of him left on her Facebook, apparently having deleted everything before March. And yet he was the one who wrote her obituary. An obituary with lines about what a good wife she was to him:\n\n\"She truly served Jesus and her husband with all of her heart. She would praise her husband after every church service telling him he was the best preacher in the world (even if it wasn't true). She also told him he was the funniest preacher in the world (even though that wasn't true either).\"\n\nMan, this guy really made her obit all about himself. Ugh. This all just seems so sus to us! No wonder her loved ones are asking for a full investigation! Her friend Kenn Young told WPDE:\n\n\"This has to be at least looked into deeply. There's got to be some accountability here.\"\n\nHe made a point of saying \"it's not just as simple as mental health issues.\" So what the heck is he talking about??\n\nWell, Mica herself started referring to \"abuse\" in posts made shortly before her death. In fact, there are ONLY posts from shortly before her death. As mentioned, she seems to have wiped everything before mid-March! But around that time she posted a video in which she talks about \"going through abuse and hurt.\" She also talks about \"leaving a dangerous situation\":\n\nSee that hashtag? #AbuseAwareness? Something was going on! She also posted just three weeks before her death:\n\n\"When terrible terrible TERRIBLE things happen to you... (yall know what I'm talking about \ud83d\ude09 RPF: resting peace face #stillblessed #Godisgood\"\n\nShe wrote that she was \"still blessed\"? And at peace? Hmm.\n\nAnd in her own post announcing Mica's death, her sister made sure to mention she \"did not deserve the abuse she endured.\" Whoa.\n\nThat leads us to what we've seen on social media that we can't verify. We've seen several women claiming to be former members of the Solid Rock church and friends of Mica personally who are accusing her ex -- the pastor -- of grooming, of stalking, of physical and mental abuse. We can't verify any of it, obviously, but it's shocking stuff. And if we were the cops investigating the case, we definitely would be reaching out to talk to these people. Read for yourself HERE and HERE and HERE if you want to dig deeper. But remember to keep a healthy sense of skepticism as these allegations have not been vetted.\n\nWe just hope the truth is found -- and Mica gets all the justice she deserves.\n\nIf you or someone you know is contemplating suicide, help is available.

I'm taking a little bit of a break, and I don't want to have to worry about the church. My break may be a few days, or a few weeks. I don't know,\" he said.\n\n\"I got a call late last night. My wife has passed away. Yeah, it was self-induced and it was up in North Carolina,\" he added, noting that a funeral will be held for her at the church at 3 p.m. on May 5.\n\n\"I'm just kind of going on adrenaline right now, so y'all pray for my kids and everybody. Y'all knew she wasn't well mentally, and she needed medicine that was hard to get to her and so, I'm sure there'll be more details to come so just keep our family in your prayers.\"\n\nSome members of Mica Miller's family, like her sister Sierra Francis, quickly rejected the idea that she had killed herself and suggested she was abused.\n\n\"There is a lot of talk already going on, so I want to set the record straight. Our sister Mica Miller passed away yesterday. Please do not listen to false stories being shared about her,\" Francis noted on Facebook.\n\n\"Mica was a God-fearing, joyful, loving woman who did not deserve the abuse she endured. If you hear anything about this from anyone other than her family please question it, reach out to her siblings or parents. Keep our family in your prayers and if you have any information that needs to be shared, please contact one of us. Please respect us in this time and honor her memory with joy that she is no longer suffering. #justiceformica.\"\n\nSpeculation about Mica Miller's death has spread like wildfire on social media. Some critics openly questioned why Pastor Miller was in the pulpit hours after his wife's death.\n\nCourt records cited by The New York Post show that Mica Miller filed for divorce from her husband in October 2023, but the reasons were not stated. The case was eventually dismissed in February, but a few days later Pastor Miller filed for \"Separate Support and Maintenance\" seeking financial support. Mica Miller would file for similar support in April. A hearing was scheduled for June 5.\n\nIn an interview with The Christian Post on Friday, Pastor Miller admitted that his relationship with Mica began with adultery. He said they were both previously married and cheated on their spouses, and many people left his church, forcing them to start over. He said he and Mica got married in 2017. Shortly after, she underwent surgery for an undisclosed reason and was diagnosed with \"bipolar II, schizophrenic and dependent personality disorder.\"\n\nSince 2017, says Pastor Miller, they have been trying to manage his wife's mental illness with lithium, and significant support. As long as she took her medication, Pastor Miller said, his wife would be fine. Mica, however, had a roller coaster relationship with the medication.\n\nHe recalled how she would complain how the medication would make her gain weight or cause her to slur. And earlier this year, the wife of a well-meaning pastor friend who had no understanding of mental illness offered to pray and believe that Mica Miller's mental illness would go away. That incident, he said, stuck with Mica and she started to believe that she no longer needed the medication.\n\n\"I took care of her through every time she went to the mental institute. I took care of her every time she stopped taking her lithium. I would never expose this stuff of her if I didn't have to now, but every time she tried to kill herself, I would be there. I would literally sometimes pick her up physically put her in the truck, take her to the [hospital],\" Miller said with a slight crack in his voice.\n\nThe pastor said he took his wife to probate court a few weeks ago to get her hospitalized, but the court stated that she wasn't a danger to others so she could not be forced.\n\n\"Nobody believed me when I told them that she was having a psychotic break. She would have never left. She would have never done what she did. They wouldn't believe me. I have 48 text messages that I sent out saying she needs her lithium; somebody help me please. And no one believed me,\" the grieving pastor said.\n\n\"Everybody thought I was a demon for trying to take her to probate court and get her put in a hospital. I told her family, I have text messages, over and over, I told her family she needs her medicine. They told me I'm crazy. She doesn't need any medicines. I text messaged her, but they sent her saying, it makes you fat or it makes you slur. Or you shouldn't take your meds, or you just need something holistic, you don't need what the doctors say.\"\n\nThough there were some things that Pastor Miller said were discussed with his church, the depths of his struggle with his wife's mental illness felt quite lonely at times.\n\n\"Nobody believed me. Nobody understood mental illness. She was diagnosed by the doctors for the past seven years as ... bipolar II, schizophrenic and dependent personality disorder. And I was with her every time she thought she was seeing aliens. I was with her every time she thought artificial intelligence was after her. I was with her through everything, and the last psychotic episode she had, she didn't know who I was,\" he explained.\n\n\"She thought that I was the enemy somehow. ... Nobody believed me, everybody thought that she was just normal being herself, and nobody understood. With her mental illness, people understand that she can say a sentence that's normal. In the very next sentence, she'd say, with the same cadence, the same tone, and it will be completely abnormal, which is why people didn't understand.\n\n\"She'd say, I want to go make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. And after that, I'm going to learn how to fly.\"\n\nThe Rev. Charles Randall, Pastor Miller's spiritual advisor and mentor, told CP that \"basically, social media is very wicked in saying things and lying about the situation, things that they are not aware of.\"\n\nHe said he has known Miller for a long time and was one of his teachers in high school. He also said he had been counseling Mica and Pastor Miller since September 2023 and was not aware of any abuse. He acknowledged that there was \"a little bump in the road\" during efforts to restore their marriage but did not disclose what that bump was.\n\n\"I live by the Holy Spirit of God. If God would lead me to remove him, I will do that. It has not happened at this time. As far as abuse, they are lying about that. There was no abuse,\" Randall told CP.\n\n\"As far as working with him, I've been working closely with them since last September on their marriage. They did have a little bump in the road, no abuse, and he was working on that. The marriage was in the process of being restored.\"\n\nRandall said he was with Pastor Miller the night he got the call about his wife's death, and despite what people thought about his preaching last Sunday, he was \"tore up.\"\n\n\"He was very tore up when we got the news. I was with him on Saturday night when he received the news. Very, very, very, very, very, tore up over it because he loved his wife very much. If the naysayers would tell the truth, they would know how much he did and tried to please his wife,\" Randall said.\n\n\"The same people that are lying and saying he mistreated his wife, even the family members, he offered to pay for every family member to travel from wherever they are, wherever they live, to bring them here, pay for their accommodations, and take care of them to honor his wife during this time. And they are in the streets, some of them, I believe, lying about what he is doing,\" he added.\n\nRandall said rumors online that the pastor has already started dating are not true.\n\nWhen asked why Mica Miller wanted to leave her marriage, Randall said Mica did not even tell him she was filing for a divorce.\n\n\"She did not relay that to me,\" he said.\n\nRandall further noted that he couldn't remember the last time he counseled the couple together and was never told why Mica wanted to end her marriage.\n\nPastor Miller had promised to answer additional questions from CP but noted that after talking with his attorney he was advised not to speak further because he was getting death threats.\n\nRandall also noted protesters are expected at Mica's funeral on Sunday.", "source": {"uri":

He said, \"I got a call last night. My wife has passed away and it was self-induced. It was up in North Carolina. Y'all pray for me and my kids and everybody. You all knew she wasn't well mentally and she needed medicine that was hard to get to her. I'm sure there will be more details to come, but keep her family in your prayers.\"\n\nThe pastor continued to speak on his wife allegedly enduring a years-long battle with mental health issues, claiming, \"She had struggled with suicide before. Each time we would help her through it and take her to the doctor, and we got through it and everything was fine. She even gave a few testimonies here at church that we have on video.

In February 2024, the pastor filed for Support and Maintenance, a request that was dismissed.\n\nThen on April 16, 2024, Mica filed for Support and Maintenance. A hearing notice was issued on April 23 with a court date set in June. But, five days later, on April 28, Mica died. The Horry County Clerk's Office in South Carolina told Fox News Digital that Mica Miller filed three different \"separate support and maintenance\" requests since last year, with the last being on April 16.\n\nAdditionally, before her death, Mica uploaded a series of videos online, suggesting that she was being abused and simply wanted to be at peace.\n\n#Socialites, be sure to check out the

(WPDE) -- There is an ongoing investigation into the death of a Myrtle Beach woman who was found dead in Robeson County last weekend.\n\nABC15 requested reports from the Horry County Police Dept. that listed 30-year-old Mica Miller as the victim. HCPD sent two reports from March 11.\n\nAccording to the documents, Miller reported to police that a razor blade was placed in her tire at the Springmaid Pier. She claimed this was the second time a razor had deflated her tire within that week. The report said that as Miller was leaving the pier, she heard a pop and noticed metal protruding from her tire. The responding officer said the metal was a tire deflation device that could be bought online.\n\nMiller believed a suspect, whose name is redacted in the report, may have placed or had the item placed on the tire. The report stated that Miller noticed \"strange activity\" and believed people were following or watching her. Miller told police that the unidentified suspect had a history of similar actions against her, according to the report.\n\nPolice stated that the evidence was not sufficient enough to prove that the suspect placed the razor device under the tire.\n\nLater that same morning, another officer responded to the East Coast Honda dealership. The officer spoke with Miller, who advised that after another officer helped change her tire, she went to the gas station and then straight to the Honda dealership to get her tire fixed.\n\nMiller said that while at the gas station, the suspect in the incident pulled up next to her pump trying to talk to her. She told him to go away and that she did not want to talk, per the report. When she pulled out her phone to record, the suspect reportedly sped off. Miller then left the gas station to go back to East Coast Honda, where the suspect also showed up, according to the police report.\n\nWhile an officer was standing with Miller, she received a no-caller ID call, which ended up being the suspect, the officer noted in the report. The suspect was advised that the victim does not want any further contact and if he proceeds then warrants may be written up. The suspect acknowledged the advisory, police said.\n\nThe victim told the officer she \"was afraid for her life.\" She also said that she blocked the suspect's number and would still get calls and texts from him on other numbers.\n\nAfter the officer left, Miller contacted him to say the mechanics found a tracking device on her vehicle.\n\nAbout an hour later, Miller also notified the officer that she was at the Magistrate's office to get a restraining order. The officer requested to meet her to get the GPS device, to which Miller agreed.\n\nWhile out front of the Magistrate's office with Miller, the officer saw a white Honda Accord slowly drive by and Miller said it was the suspect in her car driving by. The vehicle then sped up and drove away, the report concluded.\n\nOn Thursday of last week, the Robeson County Sheriff's Office said they started an investigation at Lumber River State Park, where she died, to determine the cause of her death.\n\nMiller's husband, John-Paul Miller, the pastor at Solid Rock Church in Market Common, told ABC15 in an interview last week that Mica's death was a suicide, though law enforcement has not released a cause of death. Friends and family members have expressed disagreement with John-Paul Miller's statement that Mica died by suicide and are urging law enforcement to look closely into her death.\n\nCourt documents show divorce proceedings were underway between the couple.\n\nFriends and family held a rally Sunday out front of Solid Rock Church, calling for justice for Mica. Mica's family also held a memorial service Sunday afternoon - at the same time a memorial service, hosted by Mica's estranged husband, was held at the Solid Rock Church.", "source": {"uri": "wsbt.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WSBT"}, "authors": [{"uri": "courtney_rowles@wsbt.com", "name": "Courtney Rowles", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tire", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horry_County,_South_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Horry County, South Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Horry County, South Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filling_station", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Filling station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honda", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Honda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavy_metal_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Heavy metal music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mica", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mica"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Coast_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "East Coast of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pier", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pier"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pop music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myrtle_Beach,_South_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Myrtle Beach, South Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Myrtle Beach, South Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robeson_County,_North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Robeson County, North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Robeson County, North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lumber_River_State_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lumber River State Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Market_Common", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Market Common"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honda_Accord", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Honda Accord"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restraining_order", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Restraining order"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanic", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mechanic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divorce", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Divorce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pastor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pastor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Positioning_System", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Global Positioning System"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Suicide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Funeral", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Funeral"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rock music"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Appraisal_and_Valuation", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Appraisal and Valuation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 52}], "image": "https://wsbt.com/resources/media/7972f2d5-fff7-41b2-8aff-7998d548c6fe-large16x9_WPDEEditedImages57.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9536535", "eventUri": "eng-9536535", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Horry County, South Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-03-11", "textStart": 291, "textEnd": 299}], "sentiment": -0.1607843137254902, "wgt": 132, "relevance": 1}

The program capacity at each hospital will depend on demand and resources. Those eligible will follow a carefully planned daily dosing schedule of peanut powder, taken at home, over two years.\n\nProfessor Kirsten Perrett, Director of the NACE, Paediatric Allergist and Leader of MCRI's Population Allergy Group, said unlike OIT clinical trials, the treatment would be offered as a new standardised model of care. This will be the first peanut allergy treatment program offered in Australian hospitals outside of a clinical trial setting.\n\nImage: Professor Kirsten Perrett\n\n\"Oral immunotherapy is being variably implemented around the world using different approaches making it difficult to assess the results, including the long-term outcomes for children, their families and the health system,\" Professor Perrett, Head of the ADAPT OIT Program, said.\n\n\"Under this Australia-wide model, a food allergy test at the end of the treatment will help determine if remission was achieved. These children will then be followed in routine clinical care for at least 12 months to help us evaluate the acceptability, safety and effectiveness, quality of life and long-term outcomes.\n\n\"Ultimately, we want to change the trajectory of allergic disease in Australia so that more children can go to school without the risk of a life-threatening peanut reaction.\"\n\nThe NACE, which is funded by the Federal Government, will lead an evaluation study to analyse the program's results. If successful, it's hoped more hospitals and private allergy clinics will then adopt the program, including in regional and remote areas.\n\nAssistant Minister for Health Ged Kearney said: \"The Albanese Labor Government is funding life changing medical research to save lives while building capacity and capability, which is so critical in allergy research.\n\n\"Today's announcement is a big step forward towards combating life threatening peanut allergies in babies.\n\n\"This new model of care might be the game changer we have all wanted to stop this terrible allergy in its tracks.\"\n\nDr Michael O'Sullivan, Allergist and Program Lead at Perth Children's Hospital and Fiona Stanley Hospital in Western Australia, encouraged families who suspect their baby had a peanut allergy to first visit their GP.\n\n\"Australian guidelines recommend infants are introduced to common allergens, such as peanut in the form of peanut butter, in the first year of life,\" he said.\n\n\"If you think your baby has had an allergic reaction to peanut, avoid that food and talk to your GP, who may refer your child to an allergist at one of the participating hospitals.\"\n\nPeanut allergy affects 3.1 per cent of 12 month olds in Australia and over two thirds of children with a peanut allergy remain allergic by age 10, according to MCRI-led research.\n\nDr Lara Ford, Allergist and Program Lead at the Children's Hospital at Westmead in NSW, said: \"One of the biggest concerns for families living with peanut allergy is the fear of accidental exposure. This program has the potential to remove that burden.\"\n\nThe Chatwin family first noticed their son, Hunter, showing signs of being allergic to peanuts when he ate peanut butter and developed hives at the age of six months.\n\nImage: Hunter developed hives after having an allergy reaction to peanut butter.\n\nHunter, now nine months old, has been referred into the ADAPT OIT Program at The Royal Children's Hospital in Melbourne.\n\n\"We are taking part in the program to try and improve his chance of being able to safely eat peanut in the future,\" Hunter's mother Kirsten said.\n\n\"Many families are desperate to protect their children from allergic reactions and anaphylaxis. Some are travelling interstate or even overseas for OIT treatment at private clinics, so to have this program available and free at public hospitals is a game-changer.\"\n\nDr Tim Brettig, ADAPT OIT Program Medical Lead, said like all treatments, OIT may not be suitable for everyone and it does not guarantee remission.\n\n\"OIT treatment takes time and this program requires a long-term commitment from families to give their child daily doses of peanut powder at home along with regular visits to their hospital allergy clinic,\" he said. It is important to remember, OIT is not a cure, but by following treatment it may improve the chance of being able to safely eat a specific food allergen, such as peanut.\n\nImage: Denis and Kirsten Chatwin are hopeful that their son Hunter will be able to safely eat peanut in the future.\n\nWhile on the program, children are prescribed an Australasian Society of Clinical Immunology and Allergy (ASCIA) Anaphylaxis Action Plan and adrenaline injector, families receive a comprehensive education pack and have access to an allergist on-call.\n\nEligible babies will be referred into the program by their allergist from either The Royal Children's Hospital in Victoria, Perth Children's Hospital and Fiona Stanley Hospital in Western Australia, Queensland Children's Hospital, Women's and Children's Health Network in South Australia, and Sydney Children's Hospital, Randwick, The Children's Hospital at Westmead, John Hunter Children's Hospital Newcastle, Campbelltown Hospital and Royal Prince Alfred Hospital in NSW.\n\nFor more details on the program, visit the NACE website or email show email address\n\n/Public Release.

be offered life-saving treatment in a nationwide programme touted as a world first.\n\nEligible babies will receive daily doses of peanut powder for two years to build up their tolerance, said officials announcing the initiative on Wednesday.\n\nOver time, the infants will be given increasing doses in the hope of reducing their sensitivity to peanuts, under the supervision of doctors at 10 paediatric hospitals around the country.\n\nIt is the first national peanut allergy treatment programme offered in hospitals outside of a clinical trial setting, said Kirsten Perrett, head of oral immunotherapy at the National Allergy Centre of Excellence.\n\nAt the end of the two years, a food allergy test will determine if the treatment has led to a remission.\n\n\"Ultimately we want to change the trajectory of allergic disease in Australia so that more children can go to school without the risk of a life-threatening peanut reaction,\" Perrett said.\n\nPreviously, families have been told to ensure their children strictly avoid foods with peanuts.\n\nAustralian children have some of the highest rates of food allergies in the world.\n\nPeanut allergies affect three percent of Australian children by the time they are 12 months old, government data shows.\n\nOf those, only 20 percent will outgrow their allergy by the time they are teenagers.\n\nNine-month-old Hunter Chatwin, who is among those in the free treatment programme, started developing hives after eating peanut butter.\n\n\"We are taking part in the programme to try and improve his chance of being able to safely eat peanut in the future,\" Hunter's mother Kirsten said.\n\n\"Many families are desperate to protect their children from allergic reactions and anaphylaxis,\" she said.\n\n\"To have this programme available and free at public hospitals is a game-changer.\"\n\nIf successful, the programme will be rolled out more broadly, including in regional and remote areas.\n\nDeaths from peanut allergies are rare in Australia, but almost 20 percent of the population has an allergic disease, data from Australia's leading allergy institute found.\n\nPromotedListen to the latest songs, only on

Professor Perrett, who's also the head of the ADAPT OIT Program, said.\n\n\"These children will then be followed in routine clinical care for at least 12 months to help us evaluate the quality of life and long-term outcomes.\"\n\nAssistant Minister for Health Ged Kearney said today was a big step toward combating life-threatening peanut allergies in babies.\n\nProgram medical lead Dr Tim Brettig said the treatment used peanut powder in very carefully measured doses, which are slowly increased overtime.\n\n\"This is a slow process. Under supervision, each child has increases in dose each month at a level that shouldn't cause a reaction for that child,\" he said.\n\n\"Eventually they will reach a maintenance dose, where they'll then stay and continue this dose for up to two years before stopping to see if this treatment has been effective.\"\n\nHe said the powder is given daily, mixed into other foods.\n\n\"Ideally families can make it part of the regular meal in the morning, where they can then be observed after their dose has been given,\" he said.\n\n\"Oral immunotherapy is quite an involved process and that's one of the challenges, that it requires a big commitment from families.\"\n\nHe said the families have to follow strict guidelines because of a risk of reaction.\n\n\"Unfortunately, we know that with oral immunotherapy, there can be side effects, including a reaction at some point during the treatment, but in this age group in particular, the majority of these reactions are mild and do not require treatment,\" he said.\n\n\"The decision to undertake oral immunotherapy is always a discussion between the clinician and the family to make sure this is the right fit.\n\n\"We know in clinical trials that around 10 per cent can drop out because the undertakings of the program are quite challenging, there might be concerns about reactions, the length of the dosing schedule or challenges with adhering to the post-dose observation period.\"\n\nDr Brettig, also a senior research clinician at MCRI, said it's important that if you think your child may have a peanut allergy, see your GP and seek a referral to a participating hospital.\n\nIf the allergy is confirmed they may be offered a place in the program.\n\n\"If they're eligible, then they will then have a discussion with their hospital to work out whether this program is the right thing for them and whether they'd like to participate,\" he said.\n\nDr Brettig warned families not to try oral immunotherapy at home unsupervised.\n\n\"This program follows a carefully planned dosing schedule and children are under the strict medical supervision of their hospital allergy team,\" he said.\n\nHe said while there has been evidence from a number of trials that this can be a good treatment for children with a food allergy, there has been a lot of variability worldwide.", "source": {"uri": "abc.net.au", "dataType":

the National Allergy Centre of Excellence (NACE), hosted at Murdoch Children's Research Institute (MCRI), to be the first globally to introduce a nation-wide peanut oral immunotherapy program into mainstream care.\n\nAbout three in every 100 Australian children have a peanut allergy, which is usually treated by strictly avoiding nuts in diets.\n\nThe free program aims to safely build a tolerance to the allergen and hopefully achieving remission.\n\nThose eligible will follow a carefully planned daily dosing schedule of peanut powder, taken at home, over two years.\n\nProfessor Kirsten Perrett, pediatric allergist and director of the NACE, said unlike other clinical trials, the treatment would be offered as a new standardised model of care.\n\n\"Under this Australia-wide model, a food allergy test at the end of the treatment will help determine if remission was achieved,\" Prof Perrett said on Wednesday.\n\n\"Ultimately, we want to change the trajectory of allergic disease in Australia so that more children can go to school without the risk of a life-threatening peanut reaction.\"\n\nThe Chatwin family first noticed their son, Hunter, showing signs of being allergic to peanuts when he ate peanut butter and developed hives at the age of six months.\n\nHunter, now nine months old, has been referred into the program at The Royal Children's Hospital in Melbourne.\n\n\"We are taking part in the program to try and improve his chance of being able to safely eat peanut in the future,\" Hunter's mother Kirsten said.\n\n\"Many families are desperate to protect their children from allergic reactions and anaphylaxis.\n\n\"Some are travelling interstate or even overseas for treatment at private clinics, so to have this program available and free at public hospitals is a game-changer.\"\n\nWhile on the program, children are prescribed an anaphylaxis action plan, adrenaline injector, a comprehensive education pack and have access to an allergist on-call.\n\n* Perth Children's Hospital and Fiona Stanley Hospital in Western Australia\n\n* Queensland Children's Hospital\n\n* Women's and Children's Health Network in South Australia\n\n* Sydney

It is the first nationwide OIT program for peanut allergies offered in mainstream care anywhere in the world.\n\nGed Kearney, the assistant minister for health, said in a statement on Wednesday that the program could be a game changer for Australians with peanut allergies.\n\n\"Today's announcement is a big step forward towards combating life-threatening peanut allergies in babies,\" she said.\n\nThe free program will be offered to eligible babies who are receiving care from allergists at the 10 participating hospitals.\n\nBabies in the program will first undertake food tests to confirm their peanut allergy before starting a dose of peanut powder.\n\nAfter one month of taking a daily prescribed dose at home, they will return to hospital to increase the dose.\n\nThe process will continue for two years, after which another food test will be conducted to determine if they are in remission.\n\nThe results of the program will be analyzed by the NACE.

treatment program for babies with peanut allergies", "body": "The oral immunotherapy program will carefully expose eligible allergic babies to peanuts over two years.\n\nPeanut allergies are the second-most common allergy in Australia -- and for those severely allergic to the legume, mere traces can be fatal.\n\nNow, 10 paediatric hospitals across Australia are introducing a world-first mainstream care model offering \"peanut oral immunotherapy program\" for babies under the age of one.\n\nWATCH THE VIDEO ABOVE: New peanut allergy treatment program launched in Aussie hospitals.\n\nKnow the news with the 7NEWS app: Download today\n\nParents of children with the allergy work hard to ensure their little ones are not exposed to peanuts, but accidental exposure can be a persistent fear.\n\n\"It can be like having a poison in every fridge,\" Federal Assistant Health Minister Ged Kearney said.\n\nBy the age of 12 months, 3 per cent of Australian children will have a peanut allergy -- with only one third of those shedding the allergy by age 10.\n\nStrictly avoiding peanuts is the current strategy for those impacted by the allergy, but the ADAPT OIT Program aims to change that.\n\nEligible children under 12 months of age will take carefully planned daily dosages of a special peanut powder, with that dosing schedule continued over a two-year period.\n\n\"This will be the first peanut allergy treatment program offered in Australian hospitals outside of a clinical trial setting,\" Murdoch Children's Research Institute paediatric allergist, and National Allergy Centre of Excellence director, Kirsten Perrett said.\n\nNine-month-old Hunter Chatwin is one of the babies enrolled in the program.\n\n\"As soon as I found out he had a peanut allergy, my worry was that he'd be exposed while I'm not there and potentially be in a life-or-death situation,\" his mother Kirsten Chatwin said.\n\nShe realised Hunter had an allergy after she fed him peanut butter when he was six months old.\n\nBabies on the ADAPT OIT Program will all be prescribed an anaphylaxis action plan by the Australasian Society of Clinical Immunology and Allergy (ASCIA).\n\nTheir caregivers will also be given an adrenaline injector, a comprehensive education pack, and access to an allergist on-call.\n\nProgram medical lead Dr Tim Brettig said oral immunotherapy does not guarantee remission, and may not be a suitable treatment option for everyone.\n\n\"OIT treatment takes time and this program requires a long-term commitment from families to give their child daily doses of peanut powder at home along with regular visits to their hospital allergy clinic,\" he said.\n\nChatwin said if Hunter is able to live a \"normal life\" without fearing exposure to peanuts, \"it would just be a massive relief\".\n\nTo be eligible for the program, babies must already be receiving care by an allergist at one of the participating hospitals, and be referred to the program by their allergist.\n\nThe participating hospitals are The Royal Children's Hospital in Victoria, Perth Children's Hospital and Fiona Stanley Hospital in Western Australia, Queensland Children's Hospital, Women's and Children's Health Network in South Australia, Sydney Children's Hospital in Randwick, The Children's Hospital at Westmead, John Hunter Children's Hospital Newcastle, Campbelltown

(CSE: BIOV) (FRA: 5LB) (OTCQB: BVAXF) (\"BioVaxys\" or the \"Company\"), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing a portfolio of immune-educating therapies based on its novel DPX\u2122 platform, is pleased to announce that it has executed a binding Letter of Intent (\"Agreement\") with AP Visionaries, Inc. of (\"APVI\") to jointly develop a proprietary DPX\u2122 formulation to address the urgent need for a therapy to treat or alleviate the potentially life-threatening risk of certain food allergies, namely those triggered by exposure to peanut/tree nuts or eggs.\n\nAPVI is founded by , CEO of Frontline (NYSE:FRO) Medical Technologies, Inc., an -based medical technologies company, and , MD, a vascular surgeon at London Health Sciences Centre, one of largest acute care teaching hospitals, and Associate Professor, Division of Vascular Surgery, The Schulich School of Medicine & Dentistry at Western University in Ontario.\n\nBioVaxys and APVI are conducting the study in collaboration with The Schroeder Allergy and Immunology Research Institute (\"SAIRI\") at McMaster University in , a new institute that consolidates clinicians, scientists, and data specialists in a \"one-stop shop\" to research the causes of life-threatening allergies and develop new treatments.\n\nUnder the terms of the Agreement, BioVaxys will provide funding for the study to APVI, which has a collaboration in place with SAIRI to evaluate in animal models the robustness of DPX\u2122 protection and evaluate whether DPX\u2122 transforms the underlying immunopathology of food allergy. BioVaxys will retain all intellectual property rights to any resulting product. APVI will receive a royalty from BioVaxys on any gross sales from a resulting product, in addition to a milestone payment at first regulatory approval.\n\nThe allergic reaction provoked by peanuts is an Immunoglobulin E (\"IgE\")-mediated type I hypersensitivity reaction. Following exposure, peanut-specific IgE antibodies bind to high-affinity receptors on mast cells and basophils, triggering the release of histamine and other mediator substances from mast cells. In addition to other effects, histamine induces vasodilation of arterioles and constriction of bronchioles in the lungs. Symptoms can include angioedema, facial swelling, rhinitis, vomiting, diarrhea, acute abdominal pain, exacerbation of atopic eczema, asthma, anaphylaxis and cardiac arrest. Since peanut allergy reaction requires allergen crosslinking of IgE molecules on the surface of granulocytes, it is BioVaxys and AVPI's belief that the DPX\u2122 + peanut antigen formulation should be incapable of mounting an anaphylactic response. To test this, one facet of the collaboration with SAIRI will have allergic mice challenged with DPX\u2122 + antigen formulation, and both clinical and immunological outcome measures will be compared to whole allergen challenge.\n\n, President & Chief Operating Officer of BioVaxys stated \"Our ability to tackle this unmet medical need is directly attributable to the immune educating capability and highly flexible antigen loading capacity of our DPX\u2122 platform. With the DPX\u2122 platform already the backbone of multiple BioVaxys clinical programs in oncology and infectious disease, we see a staggering opportunity for continued expansion into other novel DPX-formulations with polynucleotides, peptides, proteins, virus-like articles, and small molecules.\"\n\nPeanut / tree nut allergy is recognized as one of the most severe food allergies due to its prevalence, persistency, and potential severity of allergic reaction (Peanut allergy\". Clin. Exp. Allergy. 25 (6): 493\"502). The global peanut allergy treatment market size is expected to reach by 2030, according to a new report by Grand View Research, Inc. The market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 11.82% from 2024 to 2030 (Grandview Research, ). Peanut allergy accounts for the majority of severe food-related allergic reactions. It tends to present early in life, and affected individuals generally do not outgrow it. In highly sensitized people, even just trace exposure can induce an anaphylactic reaction which can be life threatening. Peanut allergies affect an estimated 1.2% of the overall US population and about 2.5% of the pediatric population. They are the most common food allergy in children, affecting about 25% of those with a food allergy, and are a leading cause of allergy-related death in children (Am J Manag Care 2018;24:-S0). Avoiding peanut allergens entirely is nearly impossible, given the nearly ubiquitous presence of peanut-related molecules in many foods, whether deliberately or through contamination during processing. Thus, accidental reactions are quite common, with US studies finding rates as high as 37% over 5 years in 1 cohort and 75% over 14 years in another cohort (Sicherer SH, Burks AW, Sampson HA. Clinical features of acute allergic reactions to peanut and tree nuts in children. Pediatrics. 1998;102(1):e6).\n\nThe health, economic, and personal cost of food allergies, which includes peanut allergies, is staggering. A 2012 survey of the parents of 1643 children with a food allergy (28.7% to peanuts) estimated the economic cost of any food allergy in US children at annually, or per child, with in direct medical costs. Hospitalizations accounted for , followed by outpatient visits to allergists (), emergency department (ED) visits (), and pediatrician visits (). Further, although nearly all the children (88.9%) in this group had health insurance, parents still encountered in out-of-pocket costs from co-payments and deductibles, special diets their children needed, and childcare costs related to the allergy. Annual opportunity costs due to lower work productivity, which affected 9.1% of caregivers, were , or per child. Overall, 4.9% of caregivers reported quitting a job because of their child's condition, 2.5% had to change jobs, and 1.9% lost their jobs (Gupta R, Holdford D, Bilaver L, Dyer A, Holl JL, Meltzer D. The economic impact of childhood food allergy in . JAMA Pediatr. 2013;167(11):1026-1031).\n\nThere have been substantial advances in the treatment of peanut allergy, but cures have remained elusive and, therefore, is typically a lifelong disease. Avoidance and carrying an epinephrine autoinjector in case of accidental ingestion is unfortunately still the standard of care for most food-allergic individuals. Therapeutic advances include OIT, or oral immunotherapy, which involves ingesting small doses of peanut flour until the peanut allergic individual reaches a maintenance dose- typically 3,000mg or 9 peanuts. A significant drawback with OIT is that during the desensitization there are numerous allergic reactions(about 25%) and some involve need epinephrine. More recently, a monoclonal antibody was approved for adult and pediatric patients with IgE-mediated food allergy, which is by subcutaneous injection every 2 or 4 weeks. In addition to the need for frequent dosing, this monoclonal antibody vaccine package insert has a 'black box' warning for \"anaphylaxis presenting as bronchospasm, hypotension, syncope, urticaria, and/or angioedema of the throat or tongue, has been reported to occur after administration.\"\n\n, CEO of BioVaxys, stated \"Competing approved allergy desensitization treatments require weekly treatments, have risk of anaphylaxis, and take years to compete \" compliance with this therapy is very difficult for parents. Recently approved monoclonal antibody treatment carries a cost of and per month which could place treatment out of reach for sone patients. We look forward to completing preclinical studies with our development partners, and anticipate an emerging profile for a single dose, long duration, product consistent with other DPX formulations.\"\n\nAbout BioVaxys Technology Corp.\n\nBioVaxys Technology Corp.

There can be no assurance that such statements will prove to be accurate, and actual results and future events could differ materially from those expressed or implied in such forward-looking statements.\n\nThese forward-looking statements reflect the beliefs, opinions and projections on the date the statements are made and are based upon a number of assumptions and estimates, primarily the assumption that BioVaxys will be successful in developing and testing vaccines, that, while considered reasonable by the Company, are inherently subject to significant business, economic, competitive, political and social uncertainties and contingencies including, primarily but without limitation, the risk that BioVaxys' vaccines will not prove to be effective and/ or will not receive the required regulatory approvals. With regards to BioVaxys' business, there are a number of risks that could affect the development of its biotechnology products, including, without limitation, the need for additional capital to fund clinical trials, its lack of operating history, uncertainty about whether its products will complete the long, complex and expensive clinical trial and regulatory approval process for approval of new drugs necessary for marketing approval, uncertainty about whether its autologous cell vaccine immunotherapy can be developed to produce safe and effective products and, if so, whether its vaccine products will be commercially accepted and profitable, the expenses, delays and uncertainties and complications typically encountered by development stage biopharmaceutical businesses, financial and development obligations under license arrangements in order to protect its rights to its products and technologies, obtaining and protecting new intellectual property rights and avoiding infringement to third parties and their dependence on manufacturing by third parties.\n\nThe Company does not assume any obligation to update the forward-looking statements of beliefs, opinions, projections, or other factors, should they change, except as required by law.\n\nLogo: https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2415135/4832936/BioVaxys_Technology_Corp_Logo.jpg", "source": {"uri": "uk.investing.com",

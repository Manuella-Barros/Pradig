Conille, 58, who took office just over a week ago, was rushed to hospital after suffering breathing problems, news outlets Gazette Haiti and Le Nouvelliste said, without providing further details. Radio Metronome reported that Conille\u2019s condition was stable. His representatives did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Reuters images showed several ambulances and police officers outside a hospital in a suburb of the capital Port-au-Prince where Conille was reportedly undergoing treatment. Conille had briefly led the country over a decade ago, and was most recently a former regional director at U.N. children\u2019s agency UNICEF. He was named interim prime minister on May 29 by a transition council with the mandate to restore stability and take back control from violent gangs. The transition council aims to hold elections before Feb. 7, 2026, as laid out in Haiti\u2019s constitution, after a series of crises in the country\u2019s leadership. President Jovenel Moise was assassinated in 2021, leaving Haiti to this day without a president, while Prime Minister Ariel Henry resigned in March this year after he left Haiti to seek support for the Kenyan security mission and was unable to re-enter the country.", "summary": "<a href=\"https://www.stabroeknews.com/2024/06/09/news/regional/haitis-interim-pm-in-stable-condition-in-hospital-local-media-says/\" title=\"Haiti&#8217;s interim PM in stable condition in hospital, local media says\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img width=\"736\" height=\"558\" src=\"https://s1.stabroeknews.com/images/2024/06/IMG_3169.jpeg\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" style=\"display: block; margin: auto; margin-bottom: 15px;max-width: 100%;\" link_thumbnail=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://s1.stabroeknews.com/images/2024/06/IMG_3169.jpeg 736w, https://s1.stabroeknews.com/images/2024/06/IMG_3169-659x500.jpeg 659w, https://s1.stabroeknews.com/images/2024/06/IMG_3169-132x100.jpeg 132w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 736px) 100vw, 736px\" /></a><p>PORT-AU-PRINCE,&#xA0; (Reuters) &#8211; Haiti&#8217;s new interim prime minister, Garry Conille, was hospitalized with respiratory issues but appeared to be in stable condition, local media said on Saturday.</p>\n<p>The article <a href=\"https://www.stabroeknews.", "url": "https://www.stabroeknews.com/2024/06/09/news/regional/haitis-interim-pm-in-stable-condition-in-hospital-local-media-says/", "image": "https://s1.stabroeknews.com/images/2024/06/IMG_3169.jpeg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 13:54:33", "author": "Stabroek News", "authors": ["Stabroek News"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "gy", "sentiment": -0.177}

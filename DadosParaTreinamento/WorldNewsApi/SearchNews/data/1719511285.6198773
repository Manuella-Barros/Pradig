{"id": 223768006, "title": "Cockhill Celtic are Donegal Signs Cup champions after extra time thriller", "text": "Cockhill Celtic 3 \u2013 1 Buncrana Hearts (AET) Cockhill Celtic were made to work hard to seal yet another piece of silverware this season in this hotly-contested local derby clash against Buncrana Hearts, with the Donegal Signs Cup up for grabs. Cockhill Celtic captain Peter Doherty opened the scoring with a header on the 38th minute, creating a one-goal advantage that would last until half time. It didn\u2019t take Buncrana long to find a response though, as Aaron McDaid slotted home with just six minutes gone in the second half to equalise. Cockhill were left with their backs against the wall in the last half hour, after Jack Mullen was sent off. Despite that, they created chances in a tense finish to regulation time \u2013 but neither side could make the crucial breakthrough. Just as extra time got underway, Buncrana lost their man advantage after Bart Wesolowski was sent off for a second bookable offence, making it 10v10 in the closing minutes. Cockhill took advantage and pushed on with penalties looming. It was Luke Rudden who became the cup final hero, scoring twice in the dying minutes to secure the title for Cockhill and yet another trophy in an astonishing year for the Inishowen side.", "summary": "<p>Cockhill Celtic 3 &#8211; 1 Buncrana Hearts (AET) Cockhill Celtic were made to work hard to seal yet another piece&#8230;</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.donegaldaily.com/2024/05/26/cockhill-celtic-are-donegal-signs-cup-champions-after-extra-time-thriller/\">Cockhill Celtic are Donegal Signs Cup champions after extra time thriller</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.donegaldaily.com\">Donegal Daily</a>.</p>", "url": "https://www.donegaldaily.com/2024/05/26/cockhill-celtic-are-donegal-signs-cup-champions-after-extra-time-thriller/", "image": "https://www.donegaldaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/cockhill-celtic-inishowen-champions-scaled.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-26 16:24:21", "author": "Staff Writer", "authors": ["Staff Writer"], "language": "en", "source_country": "ie", "sentiment": -0.151}

Jets Capitalize on Cap Casualty Even if Aaron Rodgers had stayed healthy in 2023, the New York Jets probably would've looked weak at receiver. They absolutely needed to bolster the position this offseason, and they pounced on Mike Williams after the Los Angeles Chargers released him for cap reasons. He's recovering from an ACL injury but is a potential bargain at $10 million. 24. Commanders Begin the Build Around Biadasz In advance of drafting Jayden Daniels with the No. 2 pick, the Washington Commanders gave the rookie quarterback a reliable veteran at center. Tyler Biadasz, who started for the Dallas Cowboys, followed now-Washington coach Dan Quinn from the NFC East rival. Biadasz will provide stability as the Commanders begin a new era. 23. Dolphins Sign OBJ for Cheap Tyreek Hill is a superstar wideout, and Jaylen Waddle isn't terribly far behind. The problem for the Miami Dolphins, though, is they lacked a dangerous third receiver. Given the team's salary-cap crunch, picking up Odell Beckham Jr. for just $3 million was a shrewd move. If he's simply a 500-yard target, that's a considerable upgrade for Miami. 22. Titans Upgrade the Receiving Corps Last year, the Tennessee Titans basically had DeAndre Hopkins and nobody else at receiver. Not a single wideout other than Hopkins averaged two catches per game. Tennessee used its plentiful cap space on the position, making a splash with Calvin Ridley and later adding Tyler Boyd. As always, signing a couple of recognizable names will not guarantee progress. Tennessee is still in a much better spot. 21. Panthers Deal for Diontae Johnson Whether the Carolina Panthers overpaid for guards Robert Hunt and Damien Lewis is a fair conversation, even as upgrading the offensive line was a sensible choice. On the other hand, Diontae Johnson only cost Carolina a late-round pick swap and corner Donte Jackson. Johnson reeled in 51 passes for 717 yards and five touchdowns last season despite the Steelers' offensive issues.", "summary": "Each offseason brings a flurry of activity around the NFL as teams sign free agents and acquire players in trades or the draft.

House of Books and Friends is based within the Manchester Reform Club building on King Street, which dates back to 1870. The book shop first opened at the start of last year with the purpose of combating loneliness and isolation. The book shop was recently nominated as a North England finalist for Independent Bookshop of the Year at the The British Book Awards 2024. Until August, the venue has announced that it will be hosting a series of exclusive afternoon teas to help bring members of the community together.

There will also be an option to swap the tea for Prosecco. The first session will take place this Friday (May 31), with prices starting from \u00a325 per adult and \u00a312 a child. The House of Books and Friends building was originally home to the Reform Club, later known as The Manchester Club, and used as a meeting place for the city's Liberal party supporters and politicians. Amongst the famous faces to have visited the venue during its time as a clubhouse were former Prime Ministers Winston Churchill and William Gladstone. The club later wound up in 1986. Three further afternoon tea sessions at the King Street venue will take place on June 16, July 14 and August 11. The store and caf\u00e9 was able to open due to financial support from the gunnercooke foundation and showcases how a good book can provide connection and contentment in people. Laura Jones, director of the gunnercooke foundation, said: \u201cThe success of the House of Books & Friends since its establishment in 2022 has been extremely heart-warming to witness, with the initiative really having a positive impact on the community. \u201cWe hope our limited series of afternoon tea events will bring regular and new faces to the shop, helping to spread our message of connection and prevent more people from feeling like they\u2019re on their own.\u201d To book a spot on the House of Books and Friends\u2019 afternoon tea on either May 31, June 16, July 14 or August 11, you can visit the store and speak to a member of staff or call 07597 365 380.

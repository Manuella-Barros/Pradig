{"id": 223683064, "title": "No one would be jailed for refusing new UK national service, says Tory minister, as Labour dismisses \u2018gimmick\u2019", "text": "Teenagers in the United Kingdom would not be sent to jail for defying the Conservative Party\u2019s proposed \u201cmandatory\u201d national service, the UK home secretary James Cleverly has said, as Labour dismissed the policy as a \u201cgimmick\u201d. The plans were aimed at getting young people \u201cout of their bubble\u201d and would not involve the threat of criminal sanctions for those who refuse to comply, said Mr Cleverly. In the first major policy announcement in advance of July\u2019s British general election, Rishi Sunak pledged to get 18-year-olds to either join the military for 12 months or do \u201cvolunteer\u201d work one weekend a month for a year. The prime minister said the policy would help unite society in an \u201cincreasingly uncertain world\u201d and give young people a \u201cshared sense of purpose\u201d. In an apparent pitch to older voters and those who may turn to Reform UK, the Tories said volunteering could include helping local fire, police and NHS services, as well as charities tackling loneliness and supporting elderly people. Opposition critics have dismissed the plans as unserious, with Labour saying the pledge would never come to fruition and amounted to \u201canother unfunded commitment\u201d. Touring broadcast studios on Sunday, Mr Cleverly said the Tories would ensure the scheme \u201cfits with different people\u2019s attitudes and aspirations\u201d after questions arose over whether teenagers would be punished for not taking part. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be no criminal sanction. There\u2019s no one going to jail over this,\u201d he told Sky News\u2019s Sunday Morning With Trevor Phillips programme. \u201cThis is about dealing with what we know to be the case, which is social fragmentation. \u201cToo many young people live in a bubble within their own communities. They don\u2019t mix with people of different religions, they don\u2019t mix with different viewpoints.\u201d Shadow work and pensions secretary Liz Kendall said: \u201cThis is an unfunded commitment, a headline-grabbing gimmick, it is not a proper plan to deliver it, it doesn\u2019t deal with the big challenges facing young people who are desperate to get the skills and qualifications they need to get good jobs, to have a home they can call their own.\u201d The prime minister is seeking to draw a dividing line with Labour on global security following his pledge to raise defence spending to 2.5 per cent of gross domestic product by 2030. Heightening his attack on Saturday, Mr Sunak said voters would be left \u201cat risk\u201d with the Labour leader Keir Starmer because Britain\u2019s enemies would notice that he \u201cdoesn\u2019t have a plan\u201d. As part of the national service proposals, teenagers who choose to sign up for a placement in the forces would \u201clearn and take part in logistics, cybersecurity, procurement or civil response operations\u201d, the Tories said. The Conservatives said they would establish a royal commission bringing in expertise from across the military and civil society to establish the details of what they described as the \u201cbold\u201d national service programme. The party said this commission would be tasked with bringing forward a proposal for how to ensure the first pilot is open for applications in September 2025. After that, it would seek to introduce a new \u201cNational Service Act\u201d to make the measures compulsory by the end of the next , the party said. It estimates the programme will cost \u00a32.5 billion (\u20ac2.9 billion) a year by the end of the decade and plans to fund \u00a31 billion through plans to \u201ccrack down on tax avoidance and evasion\u201d. The remaining \u00a31.5 billion will be paid for with money previously used for the UK Shared Prosperity Fund (UKSPF), a key part of the Levelling Up agenda which supports local charities and community groups, the Tories said. Mr Sunak said: \u201cThis is a great country but generations of young people have not had the opportunities or experience they deserve and there are forces trying to divide our society in this increasingly uncertain world. \u201cI have a clear plan to address this and secure our future. I will bring in a new model of national service to create a shared sense of purpose among our young people and a renewed sense of pride in our country. \u201cThis new, mandatory national service will provide life-changing opportunities for our young people, offering them the chance to learn real world skills, do new things and contribute to their community and our country.\u201d Earlier on Saturday, the prime minister suggested a government led by Mr Starmer would be marked by uncertainty and a \u201cmore dangerous world.\u201d \u201cThe consequences of uncertainty are clear. No plan means a more dangerous world. You, your family and our country are all at risk if Labour win,\u201d he said. Mr Starmer\u2019s party pointed out that David Cameron introduced a similar scheme \u2013 the National Citizen Service \u2013 when he was prime minister. Mr Cameron\u2019s announcement had no military component to it, instead encouraging young people to take part in activities such as outdoor education-style courses as part of his \u201cBig Society\u201d initiative. A Labour spokesperson said: \u201cThis is not a plan \u2013 it\u2019s a review which could cost billions and is only needed because the Tories hollowed out the armed forces to their smallest size since Napoleon. \u201cBritain has had enough of the Conservatives, who are bankrupt of ideas, and have no plans to end 14 years of chaos. It\u2019s time to turn the page and rebuild Britain with Labour.\u201d Liberal Democrat defence spokesperson Richard Foord said: \u201cIf the Conservatives were serious about defence, they would reverse their damaging cuts to our world class professional armed forces, instead of decimating them, with swingeing cuts to the number of our regular service personnel. \u201cOur armed forces were once the envy of the world. This Conservative government has cut troop numbers and is planning more cuts to the size of the Army. \u201cThis would be far better spent reversing Conservative cuts to troop numbers.\u201d Mr Sunak\u2019s pledge marks the first major policy announcement from either side in advance of the July 4th general election that he called in a rain-soaked statement outside Downing Street earlier this week. The prime minister has said he is \u201cpumped up\u201d and enjoying himself on the campaign trail despite a difficult start that saw him encounter several hiccups on a whistle-stop two-day tour of the UK. His trip included a visit to the Titanic Quarter in Belfast, which invited undesirable \u201csinking ship\u201d comparisons with his party\u2019s fortunes, as well as a brewery in Wales where he made a footballing gaffe about the Euros. Mr Sunak spent Saturday meeting local veterans in his North Yorkshire constituency of Richmond before joining activists on the doorstep in southwest London. \u2013 PA", "summary": "Rishi Sunak pledges to get 18-year-olds to either join the military for 12 months or do \u2018volunteer\u2019 work one weekend a month for a year", "url": "https://www.irishtimes.com/world/uk/2024/05/26/no-one-would-be-jailed-for-refusing-new-uk-national-service-says-tory-minister-as-labour-dismisses-gimmick/", "image": "https://www.irishtimes.com/resizer/dy3VDky83CdFtgW48Igkgzxk2eY=/1600x900/filters:format(jpg):quality(70):focal(2597x883:2607x893)/cloudfront-eu-central-1.images.arcpublishing.com/irishtimes/MXSDCVJCFJGE63GGKEOCLETOPU.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-26 12:46:39", "author": "Nina Lloyd", "authors": ["Nina Lloyd"], "language": "en", "source_country": "ie", "sentiment": -0.105}

Four people including three children were shot and killed at a barber shop yesterday. Three children were also wounded in the attack and have been hospitalised. Provincial Minister, Reagen Allen, says, \u201cThis murderous incident is horrific and angers me deeply, particularly with the number of young people senselessly murdered and wounded. These heartless criminals have absolutely no regard for life. We need to ensure that they are swiftly arrested so that a conviction can follow. Life should never be this cheap.\u201d Allen has called on anyone with information to come forward. \u201cThe South African (Police) Service should employ every ounce of their intelligence and I urge anyone with information to make it available to all law enforcement agencies so that justice can be done,\u201d he says. Residents of Khayelitsha on the Cape Flats say they fear for their safety following the mass shooting, and are appealing to authorities to be more visible in the area. The youngest victim was 4-years old. Community leader Raymond Qoba has appealed for more police deployment in the area to reduce crime in it. \u201cWhat we gonna do now as the leaders, we gonna come together and SAPS, CPF and Neighbourhood Watch, because there\u2019s a Neighbourhood Watch also here in this area. But we need to consult the community to come together and then we call the police, maybe Mr Bheki Cele can make a plan to give us a lot of police in this area and soldiers because totally we are not safe. I don\u2019t want to lie. We are not safe in this area, totally not safe,\u201d says Qoba.

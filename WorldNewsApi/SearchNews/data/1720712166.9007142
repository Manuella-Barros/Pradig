The NCP was instead offered the post of a Minister of State with independent charge, which party leader Praful Patel called a \u201cdemotion\u201d. Maharashtra Deputy Chief Minister and BJP leader Devendra Fadnavis on Sunday said, \"Nationalist Congress Party was offered one seat from the government- MoS Independent Charge. But from their side Praful Patel's name was finalised and he was already a minister. Therefore, he would not be able to hold the post of MoS Independent Charge.\u201d\u201cWhen a government is formed with an alliance, some criteria need to be decided, because several sides are together. But because of one party, the criteria cannot be twisted,\u201d he added.Who gets which ministry in Modi 3.0?

We have informed the BJP leadership and they have already told us to just wait for a few days, they will take remedial measures....\"Patel said.Meanwhile, Ajit Pawar, who is going to attend Narendra Modi's oath-taking ceremony today, said that the party was ready to wait for a few days for the cabinet ministry post.\"Praful Patel has served as a cabinet minister in the central government and we did not feel right in taking Minister of State with independent charge. So we told them (BJP) that we are ready to wait for a few days, but we want a cabinet ministry. We are going to attend the swearing-in ceremony today...\" Ajit Pawar said.Backing his demand for the cabinet berth, Ajit Pawar said, \"We have one Lok Sabha and one Rajya Sabha MP today, but in the next two-three months, we will have a total of three members in the Rajya Sabha and our number of MPs in Parliament will be four. So we said we should be given one (cabinet ministry) seat.\"Published By: Anuja JhaPublished On: Jun 9, 2024", "summary": "<a href=\"https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/modi-new-government-ncp-not-getting-cabinet-post-praful-patel-ajit-pawar-reacts-2550995-2024-06-09\"> <img align=\"left\" hspace=\"2\" height=\"180\" width=\"305\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/202406/ajit-pawar--praful-patel-092528628-16x9_0.jpg?VersionId=b9vxz5Fn3qfN8PflrqZsc.fHO5LeRhaK\"> </a> Modi 3.0: NCP not getting cabinet post?

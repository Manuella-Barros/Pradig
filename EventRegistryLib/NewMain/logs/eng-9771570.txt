The birr's value against the U.S. dollar plummeted by 30% to 74.73 per dollar, a significant drop from 57.48 birr to the dollar last Friday, according to the Commercial Bank of Ethiopia.Thank you for reading this post, don't forget to subscribe!\n\nThe move aligns Ethiopia with other African economies like Nigeria, which have adopted similar strategies. Ethiopia, grappling with high inflation and chronic foreign currency shortages, defaulted on its government debt last December, becoming the third African nation to do so in recent years.\n\nThe central bank announced that banks are now permitted to trade foreign currencies with their clients and among themselves at freely negotiated rates, with the central bank making only \"limited interventions\" in the foreign exchange markets moving forward. Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed initially announced these reforms late on Sunday.\n\nCentral bank governor Mamo Mihretu stated in an online video that Ethiopia would receive $10.7 billion in external financing from the IMF, World Bank, and other creditors. \"The IMF and World Bank are both providing exceptional and front-loaded funding support that will be among their highest such allocations in the African continent,\" he said.\n\nImporters, previously reliant on the black market for securing dollars, welcomed the central bank's decision. \"Now I don't need to go to the black market to buy or sell dollars. It is now a market-based foreign exchange regime, so we will buy or sell based on the legal channels,\" said a businessman in Addis Ababa.\n\nThe IMF has yet to respond to requests for comment. Bloomberg reported that the IMF's executive board was scheduled to meet on Monday to discuss a new program for Ethiopia, though Reuters could not confirm the meeting.\n\nEthiopia's main $1 billion dollar government bond rose to 75.42 cents on the dollar by 1400 GMT, its highest level since early 2022. The United States welcomed the shift, stating, \"Market-based FX is a difficult, but necessary step for Ethiopia to address macroeconomic distortions,\" via the U.S. embassy in Addis Ababa's social media platform X.\n\nEthiopia requested a debt restructuring under the Group of 20's Common Framework process in early 2021, but progress was slowed by the war in Tigray. Earlier this month, the government announced other reforms linked to IMF talks, including adopting an interest rate-based monetary policy.\n\nHowever, the longer-term impact of the devaluation remains uncertain.

Ethiopia also secured a $3.4 billion program from the IMF. The funds will support budgetary needs and economic changes as Ethiopia navigates challenges including inflation, climate change, and post-war reconstruction.\n\nThe World Bank announced on Tuesday that its board has approved $1.5 billion in financing for Ethiopia, facilitating the Horn of Africa country's long-running debt restructuring efforts.\n\nEthiopia, Africa's second-most populous nation, secured a four-year, $3.4 billion program from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on Monday. This move comes hours after the central bank floated its birr currency, indicating progression in its debt overhaul. According to the World Bank's statement, the financial aid includes a $1 billion grant and $500 million in low-interest credit and is part of the first-ever budgetary support provided to Ethiopia by the global lender.\n\nThe World Bank stated its intention to offer around $6 billion in new commitments over the next three fiscal years, bolstering economic reforms through swift budget support. This initiative is part of a $10.7 billion financing package from the IMF, World Bank, and other creditors outlined by Ethiopian officials.\n\nEthiopia initiated the restructuring of its sovereign debt in 2021 under the G20 Common Framework, designed to aid developing nations but saw progress hindered by a civil war in the northern Tigray region, which concluded last year. Signs of momentum in Ethiopia's debt restructuring emerged following the completion of similar efforts by Chad and Zambia under the Common Framework. Ghana is nearing the end of its own restructuring process under the same initiative.\n\nWhile Ethiopia's development partners supported the shift to a market-based foreign exchange rate, some analysts warned that this could lead to higher inflation and elevated living costs, particularly for the country's poorest residents.

The IMF said the program will \"catalyze additional external financing from development partners and provide a framework for the successful completion of the ongoing debt restructuring.\"\n\nEthiopia has about $28.4 billion of external debt and has been seeking to restructure its loans since 2021.

Ethiopia has had eight earlier IMF arrangements, according to the lender's website.\n\nThe IMF said the new program will \"address macroeconomic imbalances, restore external debt sustainability and lay the foundations for higher, inclusive and private sector-led growth.\" As part of its current fiscal program, the country's fuel and fertilizer subsidies, which are common and popular measures in emerging economies, \"will need to be unwound gradually over time,\" the fund said.\n\nThe IMF estimates real gross domestic product will grow 6.5% in the current fiscal year, which began in July, accelerating to 8% by 2027-28. Meanwhile, the rate of inflation will drop from 30% to about 10% over the same period, while external debt-to-GDP will decline from 28% to about 23%.\n\n--With assistance from Eric Martin, Christopher Condon and Paul Richardson.\n\n(Updates with comment by Georgieva in fifth paragraph; bond move in seventh)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek", "source": {"uri": "ca.finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

It was little changed on Tuesday after tumbling 30% on the day it was floated on Monday.\n\nEthiopia sought to restructure its sovereign debt in 2021, under the G20 Common Framework initiative to offer relief to developing nations, but progress was slowed by a civil war in the northern region of Tigray that ended the following year.\n\nEthiopia's winding debt restructuring mirrors that of Chad and Zambia which completed their debt overhauls under the Common Framework. Ghana, another African country saddled with high debt, is nearing the finish line of its own restructuring under the initiative.\n\nEthiopia's development partners have welcomed its move to a market-based foreign exchange rate, but some analysts have said the move could drive up inflation and the cost of living, especially for its poorest residents.\n\nThe country of 126.5 million people also faces a number of other challenges, including the impact of climate change and the post-war reconstruction of Tigray.

Removing the central bank's fixed rate is part of sweeping reforms aimed at easing the chronic shortage of foreign currency that have plagued its economy.\n\nThe Horn of Africa country hopes the switch will enable it to secure loans from lenders such as the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. It has been in talks with the IMF to establish a new lending programme.\n\nEthiopia became the third African economy in as many years to default on its government debt in late 2023. That contributed to its credit rating being downgraded last year to \"junk territory\" by the Fitch Ratings agency.\n\nCentral bank governor Mamo Mihretu said the reforms formalize a shift that was already happening. He said Ethiopia will receive $13.5 billion in coordinated financing from multilateral lenders and creditors to support the transition.\n\nA financial package of $10.7 billion offered by Ethiopia's external partners to support the reforms will mitigate the transitional costs and impact of changes, according to Mihretu who said it was the single biggest ever coordinated commitment of support by international partners towards Ethiopia.\n\nSome $2.8 billion in bilateral support is also expected in the form of central bank deposits and swap lines, as well as further financing from the World Bank, the International Finance Corporation, and other multilateral institutions.\n\nThe currency liberalization is the most eye-catching reform in a raft of changes.\n\nOther key elements of the reforms include ending mandatory foreign exchange surrender requirements for exporters, liberalizing import and capital flow rules, allowing non-bank currency exchanges, and deregulating how commercial banks allocate forex to importers.\n\nLocals receiving remittances will also be permitted to hold foreign currency accounts to have them use an official exchange avenue instead of the informal market.\n\nA key question concerns how this will affect ordinary Ethiopians. A similar move in Nigeria last year, where the naira currency was allowed to float freely, has fueled widespread hardship by contributing to price rises.\n\nEthiopia's Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed has said those expected to be impacted by the move will be temporarily supported by way of subsidized fuel and there will be a salary hike for public servants.\n\nAnd there is a broader sense that the country needed to take this step to kickstart international investment.\n\nEconomic analyst Sam Rosmarin, who is based in Addis Ababa, supports the move as a way for Ethiopia to be an attractive destination for foreign investors who have long called for such a move.\n\n\"This is necessary economic medicine to satisfy external creditors,\" he told me. \"The economy is already operating on the parallel market and these reforms will help attract significant foreign investment that is needed.\"", "source": {"uri": "finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

Fund staff carry out the programme's first review in mid-2020, but the board never finalises it, leading it to be abandoned by both sides.\n\n* January 2021: The government says it will seek to restructure its sovereign debt under a new G20 initiative to offer relief to developing economies known as the Common Framework. It becomes the second nation, after Chad, to announce it will pursue the initiative. Zambia and Ghana later follow.\n\n* June 2022: Talks with the IMF resume.\n\n* October 2022: The government in Addis Ababa bans the import of dozens of products including cars, liquor and household goods due to acute foreign currency shortages. Business owners report a thriving black market for dollars.\n\n* March/April 2023: An IMF team visits Ethiopia on a staff mission for talks with authorities.\n\n* August 2023: Ethiopia says it has secured a debt servicing suspension from China, one of its key creditors.\n\n* September/October 2023 - Another IMF team visits Addis Ababa for another staff mission for talks with authorities.\n\n* November 2023: The government reaches an agreement in principle with its official creditors on an interim debt service suspension.\n\n* December 2023: The country defaults on its $1 billion Eurobond after missing a $33-million coupon payment. That leads its sovereign bond price to slide and ratings agencies cut the country's credit rating to reflect the default.\n\n* July 29, 2024: The central bank floats the birr currency, a key demand of the IMF for a new financing arrangement, sending the birr 30% lower against the dollar. Hours later, the IMF's executive board approves a four-year, $3.4 billion programme, paving the way for Ethiopia's debt restructuring to move forward.

But years of economic mismanagement have left the country with a debilitating shortage of dollars. In an attempt to fix the problem, President Bola Tinubu relaxed longstanding foreign exchange restrictions shortly after taking office in May 2023.\n\nRead also: UPDATED: Top 10 African countries facing the biggest IMF debts\n\nThe local naira currency, pegged for years at an artificially high level against the dollar, has since fallen 70%. Tinubu's goal was to trigger an influx of foreign capital and eventually make Nigeria a more attractive investment destination. The near-term impact was to send inflation surging to a 28-year high, leading to a cost-of-living crisis that could potentially undermine stability in Africa's most populous nation.\n\nIn Ethiopia, Abiy Ahmed, the prime minister, initiated a swathe of economic reforms after coming to power in 2018 to open up Ethiopia's $164 billion economy that's been ravaged by wars and weather-related calamities for decades.

A more than 2 cents jump left it trading at almost 78 cents on the dollar - or just over a 20% discount of its original face value.\n\nIn the foreign exchange market, leading commercial banks quoted the Ethiopian birr at 74.74 against the dollar. That was unchanged from where it had settled after Monday's float announcement prompted it to drop 30% against the dollar.\n\nEthiopia's development partners have welcomed the move to a market-based foreign exchange rate, but some analysts have said it could drive up inflation and the cost of living, especially for the poorest.\n\nEthiopia also faces other challenges including the impact of climate change and the need to reconstruct its northern Tigray region, which was ravaged by a two-year civil war that ended in late 2022.

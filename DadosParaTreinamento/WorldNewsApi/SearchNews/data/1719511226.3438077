Click here to get it delivered to your inbox every Sunday. America has reached the point of mass confusion. As far as the economy is concerned, things are red hot. While the stock market set no new records last week, the Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite are all still flying high. GDP continues to grow and unemployment is at a near-historic low, though first-time unemployment claims are starting to rise. On the flip side, more than half of U.S. consumers think we\u2019re currently in a recession, according to a Harris Poll survey conducted for the Guardian. Nearly half thought the S&P 500 stock index was negative this year, and 49% thought unemployment was at a 50-year high. It isn\u2019t just this study, either. Consumer confidence is at its lowest level since July 2022, according to the Conference Board\u2019s latest readings. While part of this economic dichotomy can be attributed to the rise of online disinformation and fewer people reading well-reported business news, it isn\u2019t the only problem here. Forbes senior reporter Derek Saul writes inflation has persisted in the post-pandemic years. Although it\u2019s moderated from a four-decade high of 9.1% in June 2022 to 3.4% last month, many prices have yet to recede. Wages haven\u2019t kept up with inflation, either. Since January 2021, the consumer price index has risen 19.3%, while average hourly wages have increased by 16.1%. So even without considering costs, most average consumers find their money isn\u2019t going as far as it used to. Conference Board Chief Economist Dana M. Peterson said, \u201celevated price levels, especially for food and gas, dominated consumer\u2019s concerns, with politics and global conflicts as distant runners-up.\u201d What this means for business is complicated, especially because the picture differs by industry. Target reported declines across the board in its quarterly earnings last week, stemming from fewer customers spending less money at its stores. However, Nvidia soared as it reported more than 600% profit growth compared to last year. At the core, businesses should keep an eye on how their customers see the economic situation and respond accordingly: through lower prices, payment flexibility or marketing campaigns. And whenever the Federal Reserve opts to cut interest rates\u2014which chairman Jerome Powell has still said could happen this year\u2014it\u2019s important to pass those savings on to customers. ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang at the Nvidia GTC Artificial Intelligence Conference in March. Justin Sullivan/Getty Images Nvidia once again shattered expectations and records when it reported quarterly earnings last week. The AI chip designer\u2019s profits were up 628% compared to the same time last year, and its revenues were 268% higher. It was Nvidia\u2019s most profitable quarter ever, with gross profits of $20.4 billion, a staggering $15.8 billion year-over-year increase. Unsurprisingly, the sharpest increase was in Nvidia\u2019s data center business, which makes the chips that largely power the AI revolution. Data center revenues hit a record $22.6 billion, making up nearly 87% of the company\u2019s total revenues. Nvidia is currently worth $2.3 trillion, making it the world\u2019s third most valuable company behind Microsoft and Apple. And CEO Jensen Huang, who has a 3.5% stake in Nvidia, saw his net worth increase more than $7 billion, landing him on Forbes\u2019 list of the top 20 wealthiest people. As with most companies providing goods or services to facilitate the AI revolution, the tide of Nvidia\u2019s rising stock following its earnings lifted several other tech stocks. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, Arm Holdings, Dell Technologies, Super Micro Computer Inc. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) and ASML Holdings also saw their share prices increase in the hours after Nvidia\u2019s earnings report. Many of the other top tech stocks\u2014known as the \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d\u2014ended Thursday at a loss, quite possibly because investors interested in buying Nvidia may have needed to sell other shares, though the markets as a whole recovered on Friday. The massive bump to Nvidia\u2019s share price seems to further the argument that hype around the new technology is fueling an \u201cAI bubble,\u201d which is in danger of bursting. However, Nvidia\u2019s gains are based on actual sales and early orders from the company\u2019s more powerful Blackwell line are slated to get to buyers this quarter. The level at which AI sales continue is still unknown, but one other product announcement made last week\u2014Microsoft\u2019s built-for-AI Copilot+ PC\u2014will at least provide more actual sales metrics. LEGAL ISSUES Mateusz Slodkowski/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images The Biden administration is flexing its antitrust muscles again, filing a lawsuit against Ticketmaster and its parent company, Live Nation, last week. Thirty state attorneys general joined in the litigation, which demanded the mega-company be restructured. Live Nation bills itself as the world\u2019s largest live music production company and owns or controls more than 265 concert venues in North America, while Ticketmaster is the leader in event ticketing and marketing, controlling more than 80% of major concert venues\u2019 tickets. The two companies\u2019 2010 merger allowed it to exercise a monopoly over the live events industry, costing fans more in fees, giving artists fewer opportunities for concerts, squeezing out smaller promoters, and forcing venues to use its ticketing services, Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a release. Live Nation responded on its website that it\u2019s \u201cabsurd\u201d to claim it wields monopoly power, and argued Ticketmaster\u2019s fees are competitive with other providers. The Wall Street Journal first reported on the potential of this lawsuit in April, and Forbes senior contributor Peter Cohan, who had written about the Live Nation-Ticketmaster merger in a business school case, then broke down the issues at stake and the likely outcomes. Cohan wrote that ticket prices have soared since 2010\u2014especially since Ticketmaster can automatically hold back tickets for secondary markets, where they receive enormous markups from face value. And despite a provision in the merger agreement prohibiting Live Nation from threatening to keep concerts from venues that don\u2019t use Ticketmaster, the Justice Department in 2019 found Live Nation had done that. However, Cohan wrote, analysts predicted Live Nation would choose to settle the litigation and make some policy changes. SUSTAINABILITY President Joe Biden at CS Wind, the largest wind tower manufacturer in the world, in Pueblo, Colorado in November. ANDREW CABALLERO-REYNOLDS/AFP via Getty Images Companies in some industries have been working toward becoming more sustainable for years, but energy providers are moving at a slower pace. In the last three and a half years, the Biden administration has created $1.6 trillion worth of federal grants for energy companies to pursue sustainable policies, so companies have the funds. But, as Forbes senior contributor Dipka Bhambhani writes, something else is standing in their way: politics. With a contentious election just six months away and Republican candidate and former President Donald Trump literally promising oil executives that he\u2019ll reverse clean energy policies if elected, some companies are pressing pause on their plans. Matt Leggett, a partner in the policy and law group at K&L Gates, said it is possible that a Trump administration and Republican-dominated legislature could scuttle all of the credits and incentives toward clean energy. Many companies are pressing forward, noting that incentives are based on states and industries, and may be difficult to just cancel. \u201cWhile you have this political instability every two years, every four years that may call into question discrete energy policies, the long-term trend is clearly in favor of supporting an energy transition,\u201d Leggett told Bhambhani.

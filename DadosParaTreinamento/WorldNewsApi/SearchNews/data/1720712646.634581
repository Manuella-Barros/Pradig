Sadly, this is not the first a person was swallowed alive by a snake, not even just in Indonesia. Farida, 45, had disappeared while walking to a market in the village of Kalempang, Indonesia, on Thursday. Her body was discovered the next day when a search party cut open the bulging belly of a python with a machete. It had swallowed her head first. Five people eaten in Indonesia The gruesome moment a grandmother was cut out of a python (Picture: ViralPress) Farida is at least the fifth person to end up in the stomach of a snake in Indonesia since 2017, CBS News reported. Another woman in the same region around Sulawesi was swallowed whole by an even bigger python, measuring 23ft long, in June 2018. Wa Tiba, 54, had vanished while checking on her vegetable garden, which sat at the bottom of a rocky cliff where snakes were known to live. This prompted a huge search by her neighbours, who found her sandals and machete lying near a python with a bloated belly the next day, the BBC reported. Local police chief Hamka said: \u2018Residents were suspicious the snake swallowed the victim, so they killed it, then carried it out of the garden. \u2018The snake\u2019s belly was cut open and the body of the victim was found inside.\u2019 Is there a fate more horrific than being swallowed whole by a snake? (Picture: ViralPress) Just a year earlier, a 25-year-old farmer, Akbar Salubiro, was swallowed whole by a python while harvesting his crops on a palm oil plantation, also on Sulawesi. The 23ft snake was seen slithering awkwardly away from the scene. Junaidi, a senior official in Salubiro village, said: \u2018We were immediately suspicious that the snake had swallowed Akbar because around the site we found palm fruit, his harvesting tool and a boot.\u2019 It seems plantations are bad luck, because in October 2022, another 54-year-old woman never returned home from the one where she worked. Her husband sounded the alarm after finding Jahrah\u2019s sandals, headscarf, jacket and the tools on the rubber plantation, on the Indonesian island of Sumatra \u2013 popular with tourists. The next morning, they found a python, The Guardian reported. Local police chief Harefa said: \u2018When the security team and residents conducted a search around the rubber plantation, then we found a python 7 metres long. It is this snake that is suspected of preying on the victim. After we caught him, we found the victim\u2019s body in the snake\u2019s stomach How often do snakes eat humans? Snakes usually snack on smaller animals, but this one picked a crocodile for its tea (Picture: Tiffany Corlis/EPA via ABC) Despite the shocking number of people eaten by snakes in Indonesia in recent years, it\u2019s actually quite rare for snakes to swallow humans. The reticulated pythons responsible for these cases can reach lengths of up to 32ft, more than five times the height of an average adult man. However, they usually prey on animals even smaller than humans, like monkeys, pigs and family pets, CBS News reported. Sometimes though, they\u2019re bold in their ambitions. Snakes are able to open their mouths wide and expand their body to swallow their prey, but this leaves a telltale sign in their bulging belly (Picture: ViralPress) There are even cases of snakes devouring crocodiles and alligators \u2013 among the most ferocious of predators \u2013 in Australia, Myanmar and the USA. In one 2014 case, a python coiled its way around a desperately struggling crocodile in Queensland before finally killing it and eating it, the BBC reported. When snakes do strike humans, it\u2019s usually with a simple bite. There are roughly 5.4million snake bites each year, of which up to 2.7million result in poisoning, according to the World Health Organisation. In Indonesia, and other Southeast Asian countries where reticulated pythons are common, it is children and agricultural workers in poorer, rural communities who are most at risk, The Guardian reported. Considering that, it\u2019s little surprise the victims of Indonesia\u2019s snake attacks are mostly women and farm workers. How snakes attack If a python did attack you, it would either be a defensive bite, or \u2013 more nightmarish \u2013 it would lie in wait before approaching you with stealth. Pythons kill through constriction, latching onto their prey with dozens of sharp, curved teeth. They then squeeze them to death before swallowing their meal whole. It takes just a couple of minutes to die this way, as blood stops flowing to the brain and airways are blocked. But swallowing their food can take pythons an hour. That\u2019s about as much time as it would take to watch an episode of Game of Thrones, according to USA Today. Dr. Harry W. Greene, a professor at Cornell University, said: \u2018It would be extremely difficult for me to save my life without help. \u2018It wouldn\u2019t take very long and it would be awful.\u2019 Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.

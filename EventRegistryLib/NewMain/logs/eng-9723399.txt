The Netherlands had taken an early lead through Xavi Simons' powerful strike. However, England were handed a lifeline when Harry Kane was caught on the follow-through by Denzel Dumfries after the England captain had already shot over the bar. Initially, no penalty was awarded, but referee Felix Zwayer pointed to the spot after being advised to review the incident by VAR. Kane converted the spot-kick, and substitute Ollie Watkins netted a 90th-minute winner, securing England's place in Sunday's final against Spain.\n\n\"In my opinion, it should not have been a penalty,\" Koeman stated. \"He kicked the ball and the boots touched. I think that we cannot play proper football, and this is due to VAR. It really breaks football.\" Despite the loss, Koeman expressed more pride than hurt, feeling optimistic about the future. He acknowledged the heartbreak of losing a match where he felt his team performed better overall but praised his players' attacking mentality and resilience.\n\n\"I'm disappointed about the final result because it started well for us,\" Koeman said, referring to Xavi Simons' early goal. However, the Dutch struggled to maintain control in midfield against England's Jude Bellingham and Phil Foden before regaining momentum late in the match.\n\n\"The feeling was we were the better team overall in the last 20 minutes; we attacked more. And suddenly, there was that great goal,\" Koeman added, referring to Watkins' stoppage-time winner. \"And it was all over... that's difficult to accept.\"\n\nKoeman reiterated his disagreement with the penalty decision but acknowledged that his team had opportunities to turn the game in their favor. \"As a former defender myself, what could he do in that position? He tried to block the ball... To penalize that is to tell him we cannot play proper football,\" he said.\n\nDespite the disappointment, Koeman remained proud of his players' efforts and believed the Dutch fans should be optimistic about the future. He is already looking forward to the 2026 World Cup, confident in a promising mix of youth and experience within the team.\n\n\"I believe our team is capable of more, and there are players who will join us in the future. Some were not able to play because they were not fit,\" Koeman said. \"We have worked well together, which was important and gave us a path to follow. We have to improve some aspects, but we were really close to the finals. Great mentality... team spirit... I wish I could see them playing in the final, but it's not possible.

Dutch manager not happy with penalty decision RSS Syndicated Content Published: Thu 11 Jul 2024, 8:45 AM Last updated: Thu 11 Jul 2024, 9:00 AM\n\nReuters\n\nNetherlands coach Ronald Koeman said he did not agree with the decision to award the penalty that brought England level when Harry Kane was caught by the studs of Denzel Dumfries as he shot.\n\n\"As a former defender myself, what could he do in that position? He tried to block the ball ... To penalize that is to tell him we cannot play football properly,\" Koeman said.\n\n\"That's my personal opinion. We should be proud because we've achieved many things in these weeks and there's no criticism after seeing how my player fought until the end.\"\n\nBut the Dutch coach said his side could still have turned the game back to their advantage had they been more decisive.\n\n\"We have fought like lions. We just needed a little more balance and the English team did it better than us, so congratulations to them.\n\n\"I have to thank my players because they believed in something and it was good to see that ... Although now it's too late. We can't do anything with that feeling, but in the future we will come back stronger.\"\n\nKoeman said that he is already looking forward to the 2026 World Cup and believes that the Netherlands will reach it with a great mixture of youth and experience that should make them a power to reckon with.\n\n\"I believe our team are able to do more and there are also players who will join us in the future. Some people were not able to play because they were not fit,\" Koeman said.\n\n\"We have worked in a proper way together, it was important and it gave us a path to follow. We have to improve some aspects as well but I think we were really close to the finals.\n\n\"Great mentality ... Team spirit ... I wish I could see them playing in the final ... but it's not possible... And I feel so sorry about that.\"\n\nKoeman said it was heartbreaking to lose a game where he thought his side were best, but felt Dutch fans should be optimistic about the future after his players showed an attacking mentality until the end.\n\n\"I'm disappointed about the final result because it started good for us,\" said Koeman, whose team went 1-0 up after seven minutes thanks to a brilliant Xavi Simons strike.\"\n\nBut the Dutch went on to relinquish control in midfield against English players like Jude Bellingham and Phil Foden, Koeman said, before then coming back strongly.\n\n\"The feeling was we were the better team overall in the last 20 minutes, we went on attacking more. And suddenly, there was that great goal,\" he added, referring to Ollie Watkins' stoppage-time winner.\n\n\"And it was all over ... that's difficult to accept.\"\n\nRSS Syndicated Content Published: Thu 11 Jul 2024, 8:45 AM Last updated: Thu 11 Jul 2024, 9:00 AM", "source": {"uri": "con-telegraph.ie", "dataType": "news", "title": "Connaught Telegraph"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Koeman", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ronald Koeman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denzel_Dumfries", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Denzel Dumfries"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Kane", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Harry Kane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "England national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_cricket_team", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "England cricket team"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xavi_Simons", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Xavi Simons"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jude_Bellingham", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jude Bellingham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Foden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Phil Foden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ollie_Watkins", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ollie Watkins"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://imengine.public.prod.cmg.infomaker.io/?uuid=ecbf3aa1-2a7b-5b28-8f35-dae7ac978f34&function=cropresize&type=preview&source=false&q=75&crop_w=0.99999&crop_h=0.99265&x=0&y=0&width=1200&height=675", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9723399", "eventUri": "eng-9723399", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 201, "relevance": 1}

But a controversial Harry Kane penalty hauled the Three Lions level. England secured victory in stoppage time thanks to Ollie Watkins' brilliant strike after a much-improved display from Gareth Southgate's side, who dominated the Dutch for the first 45 minutes.\n\nAnd ex-Everton and Southampton boss Koeman can't see why they won't be able to upset the odds against Spain. Speaking after his side's defeat, the 61-year-old said: \"England showed great football in the first half after being 1-0 down.\n\n\"It's football. If you watch all the matches of the Spanish national team they are more offensive with wingers and [playing] football from the back and ball position and you need to stop that.\n\n\"But England are in the final and have the possibility to win it. Maybe from the outside because Spain are playing from a high level [they are favourites] but England can stop them, why not.\"\n\nKoeman had attempted to stem the England tide in Dortmund. After an opening 45 minutes in which his side struggled to cope, he flooded the midfield. That appeared to give the Netherlands far more control but it was still not enough to halt the Three Lions.\n\nExplaining what went wrong, Koeman added: \"I'm disappointed after a match which started so well for us.\n\nWho will win Euro 2024? Share your predictions in the comments below\n\n\"After that we had some problems in midfield with [Jude] Bellingham and [Phil] Foden between the lines. We made changes to control the game and in the last 20 minutes we were the better team, attacking more - but it was a knockout on 90 minutes. It's a great goal, but then it's over and that's difficult to accept.\"\n\nWhile Koeman was magnanimous in defeat, he was left furious with one decision in particular - England's penalty. Referee Felix Zwayer awarded the spot-kick after a VAR review, despite Kane appearing to kick Denzel Dumfries.\n\nSlamming the decision, Koeman said: \"In my opinion it should not have been a penalty. He kicked the ball and the boots touched.\n\n\"I think that we cannot play properly football and this is due to VAR.

Glory at Euro 2024 would add to the Euro 88 triumph Koeman was part of in his playing days.\n\nHere's everything you need to know about a man who shares one particularly notable moment of history with semifinal opponents England.\n\nMORE: Euro 2024 schedule and results, updated LIVE | Who will win Euro 2024? Latest odds and predictions | How to watch all the Euro 2024 action\n\nWhat happened when Ronald Koeman played England?\n\nSurprise package Norway complicated matters by stealing ahead in UEFA Group 2, meaning the Netherlands hosted England in a must-win encounter in qualification for the 1994 FIFA World Cup at De Kuip on October 13, 1993.\n\nFor all his history-making achievements as a player, this night is how Koeman remains burned into the brains of a certain generation of English football fans.\n\nBefore the hour, Andy Sinton played David Platt through on goal. Koeman panicked and dragged down the midfielder right on the edge of the area. Inexplicably, he was only shown a yellow card and not a red for denying a clear goal-scoring opportunity.\n\nThe chance passed England by and, to make matters worse, Koeman expertly dispatched a free-kick in a similar position at the other end of the field a few moments later. It set in motion a 2-0 win for the Dutch, who qualified at England's expense.\n\nRonald Koeman: Teams coached, trophies won\n\nConsidering Koeman's education under great football minds such as Cruyff, Guus Hiddink and Rinus Michels, anticipation was high at the start of his coaching career.\n\nAn initial stint at Vitesse, who he led to UEFA Cup qualification, saw Koeman fast-tracked to Ajax, where he won a domestic double in 2001/02. He retained the title the following season but standards in Amsterdam and his team falling behind PSV in the Eredivisie and being eliminated from the UEFA Cup by Auxerre led to him resigning under mounting pressure in February 2005.\n\nAn unsuccessful foray at Benfica preceded Koeman echoing his controversial switch from Ajax to PSV during his playing days by taking charge of the Eindhoven giants for the 2006/07 season. Despite collapsing in the second half of the season, PSV claimed the Eredivisie title on goal difference ahead of AZ and Ajax.\n\nKoeman also claimed the notable scalp of Arsenal in that season's Champions League before losing to Liverpool in the quarterfinals. In October 2007, Valencia came calling. Not for the last time in his career, Koeman made an ill-advised switch to Spain.\n\nA short and unsuccessful tenure was followed by a similarly truncated stint with AZ, who were defending Dutch champions after storming to the Eredivisie under Louis van Gaal in 2008/09.\n\nAlmost 18 months out of the game followed before Koeman was appointed by Feyenoord, meaning he completed the set of the Netherlands' big three as he did as a player. He did not claim any major honours but it was a restorative three seasons that laid a path for time in the Premier League, first with Southampton and then less successfully with Everton.\n\nFour months on from his October 2017 sacking on Merseyside, Koeman was handed the reins of a Dutch national team at a low ebb having failed to qualify for Euro 2016 or the 2018 World Cup. He embarked on a swift and impressive rebuilding job, which included progress to the inaugural UEFA Nations League finals, where the Netherlands beat Gareth Southgate's England in the semifinals.\n\nBut for the coronavirus pandemic, he'd have led his nation at Euro 2020. Events accelerated, however, and when Barcelona sacked Quique Setien, the job Koeman cherished above all others presented itself. The man whose goal secured Barca's maiden European Cup in 1992 was coming home.\n\nThe only problem was the roof was caving in, there was no money in the electricity meter and the landlords had severe cashflow problems. Barcelona were in shambles and Koeman was forced to preside over Lionel Messi's unseemly exit. He managed to lead the Blaugrana to the 2020/21 Copa del Rey, but his card was marked long before another club great, Xavi, succeeded him.\n\nWhen his old foe Van Gaal stood down at the end of the Netherlands' 2022 World Cup campaign, Koeman had the chance to pick up some unfinished business.\n\nFootball is a family affair for the Koemans. Ronald is the son of former Netherlands international Martin Koeman and he made his debut for the national team alongside his elder brother Erwin in a 3-0 friendly loss to Sweden.\n\nErwin won 31 caps compared to his elder brother's 78 despite their careers each spanning 1983 to 1994. Erwin has enjoyed a coaching career of his own but is now serving as Ronald's assistant with the Netherlands, as he was at Southampton and Everton.", "source": {"uri": "sportingnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sporting News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "dom_farrell@sportingnews.com", "name": "Dom Farrell", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFC_Ajax", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "AFC Ajax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PSV_Eindhoven", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "PSV Eindhoven"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Koeman", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ronald Koeman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Kuip", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "De Kuip"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eredivisie", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eredivisie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UEFA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Europa_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Europa League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_kick_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Free kick (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SBV_Vitesse", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "SBV Vitesse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AZ_Alkmaar", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "AZ Alkmaar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rinus_Michels", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rinus Michels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guus_Hiddink", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Guus Hiddink"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AJ_Auxerre", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "AJ Auxerre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_card", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Penalty card"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johan_Cruyff", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Johan Cruyff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goal_difference", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Goal difference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S.L._Benfica", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "S.L.

The episode was preserved indelibly in the fly-on-the-wall documentary, 'An Impossible Job' which the England manager, who died in 2017, never entirely lived down.\n\nSo, we all know the agonies that Koeman, a Barcelona player at the time, inflicted on the England manager in the yellow-framed Rotterdam dug-out that night.\n\n'Your colleague, the referee, has got me the sack. Thank-you ever so much for that,' Taylor told the linesman. An accurate assessment.\n\nThis episode is so far in the past that Koeman's current players were bemused to be asked about it this week. 'We weren't born then,' said Cody Gakpo, grinning when the details were related to him. But it's certainly always lived with Koeman.\n\n'Every time I was in England, people shouted at me. They gave me a lot of abuse,' he related years later, admitting that it was so obviously a red that he'd apologised to Platt in the moment.\n\n'I was able to use my international status as a Barcelona player to stop the referee from sending me off and giving England a penalty,' he admitted.\n\nTaylor reflected in his memoir that he bore Koeman no ill-will. 'I don't blame him. There was no way he was going to defend against Platt fairly in that situation. Players will do what they have to do.' But he hadn't rushed to watch the Premier League teams Koeman managed - Southampton and Everton.\n\nEngland had their share of luck that night in Rotterdam but Koeman always had most of it when facing the English, against whom he never lost as a player. That included their 3-1 group stage win over Bobby Robson's team at the 1988 Euros.\n\nEngland ran the Dutch ragged at times on that occasion in Dusseldorf, with both Glenn Hoddle and Gary Lineker striking the woodwork before Marco van Basten struck an explosive hat-trick. 'Yes, we had some luck that day, too,' Koeman reflected of the win.\n\nEngland, who bombed out at that group stage, were an incidental detail in what proved to be a high summer of Koeman's career. The Dutch went into their semi-final against West Germany, in Hamburg, nursing a bitter sense of injustice about their defeat to the same host nation in the 1974 World Cup final in Munich.\n\nWhat the Dutch still call 'the lost final' had been seen as a way of avenging a still detested foe for their occupation of the Netherlands during the war.\n\nKoeman saw to it that the Dutch finally atoned for the war. He scored the equalizing penalty in the '88 semi before van Basten slid home the winner, then stood in front of the Dutch fans at the end, pretending to wipe his backside with the German shirt he'd swapped with Olaf Thon. 'Revenge', declared the Dutch paper De Telegraaf the next day.\n\nHe was always uncompromising. They nicknamed him 'Snowflake' at Barcelona because his pale complexion resembled an albino gorilla at the city zoo - not because of the word's 21st century connotation.\n\nThe extraordinary outpouring of national pride when the Dutch beat the Soviet Union in the 1988 final - with junior members of the Dutch royal family joining in a rendition of 'Can you hear the Germans sing?'- seemed to assign Koeman the status of permanent national treasure.\n\nBut 36 years on from the country's only tournament success, the Dutch have mixed feelings, because his two stints as national coach were separated by a brief and unhappy 14 months at the helm of Barcelona.\n\nFor many, his departure to the Nou Camp, was an act of unforgivable disloyalty. His side's football also bears no comparison with the long-lost days of the brilliant Oranje. De Telegraaf seems unconvinced and so, until the Dutch beat a major nation at the tournament, will the country be.\n\nOne of the more surreal discussions in the Dutch media concerns the respective merits and egos of Koeman and his predecessor Louis van Gaal. 'The question is, who has the biggest golden cock, Koeman or Van Gaal?' leading sports columnist Sjoerd Mossou has written, in classic, blunt Dutch style.\n\nBut after the austerity and discipline of van Gaal, the players clearly like Koeman's greater paternalism. He is a more sober coach than many, though after the win over Turkey on Sunday, he became the life and soul in a way few have seen before.\n\nHe danced the Dutch Horlepiep dance with his players, launched into a sideways Polonaise and bopped to the sounds of Dutch band Snollebollekes. 'It looked funny, but there was also something beautifully harmonious about it: a reddish-blond sixty-year-old, in one long line of happy young men,' observed the Dutch paper, AD.\n\n'Father Koeman', the paper called a man who, as part of a past generation of winners, has had had no compunction about criticising players at the tournament. Memphis Depay was rebuked for not making it clear in advance that he intended to wear a headband while playing. Virgil van Dijk was told he needs to communicate better. But both have taken that criticism.\n\nHe has a light touch at times. When Stefan de Vrij, man of the match against Turkey, arrived at the press conference stage on Sunday, Koeman, who had been answering questions, promptly stood up and left, to the initial confusion of the UEFA press officer. 'The stage is for Stefan. He deserves the attention now, Koeman said, placing a hand on the defender's shoulder as he walked away.\n\nKoeman is all too aware of the mixed public mood about him. 'In the Netherlands you not only have to win; you also have to play well,' he reflected last week. Yet history speaks for him. The Dutch have won one tournament with him in the team and if they double that tally, it will be with him in the dugout.\n\nSurprisingly, Koeman was willing at the weekend to address the question of who he would prefer to meet in the final. Spain, he replied, which was perhaps that Barcelona managerial heartache talking.\n\nThe small matter of England momentarily seemed to escape him, though the opponents standing in front of his side in Dortmund have an age-old injustice of their own to atone for.", "source": {"uri": "internewscast.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Internewscast Journal"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

It will feel like a long journey home.\n\nWhen Ollie Watkins' added-time goal sealed a 2-1 win for England over the Netherlands in the Euro 2024 semifinals on Wednesday, it ended the orange-clad Dutch fans' dream of a first European Championship title since 1988.\n\nAlso Read | UEFA Euro 2024: Ollie Watkins' Late Goal Put England Into Final After Beating Netherlands 2-1.\n\n\"A great goal, but then it's over, and that's difficult to accept,\" Netherlands coach Ronald Koeman said.\n\nThe journey home will not be without some bitterness after a hotly disputed penalty decision in England's favor after Dutch defender Denzel Dumfries made contact with Harry Kane while trying to block a shot.\n\nAlso Read | President Droupadi Murmu Plays Badminton with Former Olympic Medallist Saina Nehwal Ahead of Ace-Shuttler's Her Story - My Story' Lecture (Watch Video).\n\n\"In my opinion this should not have been a penalty,\" Koeman said through an interpreter. \"I think that we cannot play properly football and this is due to VAR.

The controversy arose when England were awarded a contentious penalty, which Koeman described as a factor \"breaking football.\"\n\nThe game, which saw England secure a spot in the final against Spain, was marked by a pivotal moment where England captain Harry Kane was deemed to have been fouled by Dutch defender Denzel Dumfries. Initially, the incident did not result in a penalty, but the referee changed his decision after consulting the VAR and subsequently visiting the monitor. Kane converted the penalty, levelling the score, which set the stage for a dramatic late winner by substitute Ollie Watkins.\n\nKoeman firmly stated his perspective on the incident: \"In my opinion, it should not have been a penalty. He kicked the ball, and the boots touched. I think that we cannot play properly, and this is due to VAR. It really breaks football.\" His assertion highlights a growing concern among football professionals about the impact of VAR on the flow and spirit of the game.\n\nThe sentiment was echoed by former England defender and pundit Gary Neville, who criticized the decision on ITV, calling it \"absolutely disgraceful.\" Similarly, ex-England striker Alan Shearer, speaking on BBC Radio 5 Live, argued that while there was contact, the decision to award a penalty was questionable at best.\n\nVirgil van Dijk, the captain of the Dutch team and a stalwart for Liverpool, also weighed in, indicating that the penalty was a turning point that shifted momentum in England's favour. \"I think so many decisions didn't go our way, but I don't want to speak about the referee,\" van Dijk noted, reflecting a sense of frustration but also restraint in his commentary.\n\nDespite the disappointment, Koeman showed sportsmanship by offering his support to Gareth Southgate's England team for the upcoming final against Spain. \"England showed great football in the first half after [being] 1-0 down,\" he remarked, adding, \"It is football. Maybe if you watch all of the matches of the Spanish team, maybe they are playing more offensive, great wingers and ball possession, and you need to stop that.\"\n\nSpain, having displayed formidable form throughout the tournament, will be a tough opponent, but Koeman's endorsement of England's capabilities underscores a belief in their potential to triumph. \"But England are in the final and have the possibility to win it. Spain are playing on a high level but England can stop them. Why not?\" Koeman concluded with a hopeful note on England's chances.\n\nIn this heated debate surrounding VAR's role in football, the discussions from this match will likely fuel ongoing debates about the place of technology and its implementation in sports.", "source": {"uri": "ca.sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports Canada"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Koeman", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ronald Koeman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_assistant_referee", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Video assistant referee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Kane", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Harry Kane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denzel_Dumfries", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Denzel Dumfries"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referee_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Referee (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virgil_van_Dijk", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Virgil van Dijk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Shearer", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alan Shearer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Neville", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gary Neville"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_Radio_5_Live", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "BBC Radio 5 Live"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substitute_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Substitute (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITV_(TV_network)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ITV (TV network)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ollie_Watkins", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ollie Watkins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gareth_Southgate", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gareth Southgate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spain national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "England national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool F.C."}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play-By-Mail", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play-By-Mail", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Fun", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Fun", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Officiating", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Officiating", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/gHK.Bjk3EC6Jyf.a.mWyOA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/epl_index_articles_253/bdf6e484eabe9c6d6eb838cf97e84c54", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9723399", "eventUri": "eng-9723399", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.04313725490196085, "wgt": 169, "relevance": 1}

Even the English agreed that Zwayer's decision was scandalous, especially since it was preceded by Saka's handball.\"\n\nMike Verweij wrote in De Telegraaf that the contact was \"too light\" for a penalty though his colleague Valentine Driessen admitted Dutch luck ran out, coming up against an England side that finally produced a performance worthy of their abundance of talent.\n\n\"The quality of the English finally came through,\" wrote De Telegraaf. \"With the help of 19-year-old Kobbie Mainoo and Phil Foden, England seized the initiative, meaning that almost the entire first half took place in Dutch territory.\"\n\nIn any case, the 'Curse of Koeman' has now been undone, a reference to the infamous foul by the then Dutch centre back on David Platt during Graham Taylor's time as manager.\n\n\"As brilliant as Spain are, there is a growing sense in England that the hand of football history rests on the shoulders of Gareth Southgate's lions. Late goals, refereeing strokes of luck and a favourable route to the final in Berlin. If football doesn't come home now, when will it?\"\n\nRonald Koeman used social media Thursday to issue a heartfelt thank you to his team and supporters. The Dutch returned home from their base at Wolfsburg after the 2-1 defeat with Koeman posting on X (@RonaldKoeman) a final word on the campaign in Germany.\n\n\"Our adventure came to a painful end last night in the semi-final, in a match in which our team gave everything. I am proud of this great group of players and staff, who have worked together with enormous dedication.\n\n\"The support from all Oranje fans was also unparalleled and overwhelming: wherever we went, they coloured the host cities orange. I would like to thank everyone for this wonderful trip, we showed who we are and put the Netherlands back on the map.\"\n\nKoeman is staying on as coach, with the Dutch now setting their sights on the 2026 World Cup, but they first compete in the Nations League and their next matches are at home to Bosnia in Eindhoven on Sept. 7 and Germany in Amsterdam on Sept. 10.\n\nSkipper Van Dijk will consider his future for both club and country over the next few weeks as he processes the disappointment of their Dortmund elimination.\n\nVan Dijk, who turned 33 on Monday, said he would spend the next weeks figuring out his next career steps after nine years, and 75 caps, in the Netherlands team, plus with a single season left on his contract at Liverpool.\n\n\"I haven't the slightest idea right now. I will think carefully this summer about what I want at club level and as an international player. Then we'll go for it again, but first recover from this,\" Van Dijk said.\n\n\"After a season like this, where all kinds of things have happened, it gets emotional at the end because you know it's over,.\n\n\"Especially in the second half I had the feeling the outcome would fall our way. But (Ollie) Watkins was perhaps given a little too much space and he finished well.\n\n\"It hurts a lot that we conceded this goal so late in the match and are now empty-handed. You put everything into it, everyone gives everything and if the goal comes like that in the last minute, that just sucks. Yes ... sorry.\"", "source": {"uri": "irishexaminer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Irish Examiner"}, "authors": [{"uri": "darragh_leen@irishexaminer.com", "name": "Darragh Leen", "type":

This was not just the goal that sealed England's place in the Euro final, this was not just a strike by a fellow Aston Villa player delivering triumph, for Platt that goal represented something more. This was revenge. Albeit a dish served very cold indeed.\n\nThirt-one years ago, Platt was on the end of a footballing miscarriage of justice that has lived long in the English collective consciousness. In a World Cup qualifier against the Netherlands, England's then captain had burst, with characteristic energy and resolve, forward alone, the ball at his feet. Just as he reached the edge of the Dutch area he was hauled down by the last defender. It was a tackle best described as agricultural, one of the sort now clipped on social media to demonstrate what a violent and uncompromising sport football was back then.\n\nYet somehow, the referee deemed the cynical foul on Platt worthy of no more than a free-kick. Despite the rule being in place covering the intervention of the last man, no red card was issued. England failed to capitalise, the Dutchman concerned stayed on the pitch and scored the goal that helped propel his side to victory. England consequently did not make it to the finals. And the name of the assailant? Ronald Koeman, the very man sitting in the Dutch dug out last night.\n\nIt might not have meant much to the modern viewer, indeed the Dutch players Cody Gakpo and Mickey Van de Ven were asked about the incident in the pre-match press conference and, after looking a bit bemused, pointed out that neither of them had been born when it happened. But for England followers of longer memories how glorious it was to relish the moment: justice at last. Even better was the fact that England's earlier equaliser had come in the shape of a penalty Koeman himself reckoned dubious. Now you know what it feels like, mate.\n\nIn truth, Koeman was dignified and conciliatory in defeat, refusing to rise to when a reporter in his post-match press conference suggested England were a dreadful team. \"No,\" he replied. \"I think England showed great football in the first half\". But, no amount of good grace can diminish the sense of righteous delight.\n\nThe pity was Graham Taylor was not around to enjoy the moment. In many ways Taylor's whole managerial reputation was shaped by that Koeman foul. He had invited television cameras to follow him throughout the qualifying campaign, in the belief they would be able to record a historic success, his coaching guiding the national team to the finals in the USA.\n\nInstead, that night in Rotterdam they bore witness to his emotional turmoil. On the touchline after Koeman got away with his offence, he was filmed in meltdown, telling the linesman \"the referee's got me the sack, thank him ever so much for that, won't you?\"\n\nBy the time The Impossible Job, Ken McGill's brilliant resulting film, came out, Taylor had indeed been sacked. The film's legacy was to ensure he became known as Graham \"do I not like that\" Taylor. A delightful man, full of good humour, a beaming smile never far from his lips, he may have been. But there was no doubt the shadow of that defeat hung over him for the rest of his life. After he had knee replacement surgery, he chuckled away to friends that: \"When they are in pain people say they wouldn't wish their pain on anyone else. But I'm not like that. I can think of quite a few I'd wish this pain on. Ronald Koeman for one.\"\n\nAs it happened, England quickly gained some sort of recompense for the injustice of that night three years later at Euro 96, their 4-1 victory over the Dutch as good a performance as the national side have ever delivered in competition. But the main protagonist was not involved that afternoon at Wembley. We had to wait a further 28 years for the circle to be completed.\n\nAfter they had shown highlights of England's victory last night, the BBC put together a lovely montage of how this England side, under a manager who has removed so many of the shackles that handicapped the operation in the past, have consistently progressed.

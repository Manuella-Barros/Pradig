Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has introduced articles of impeachment against Supreme Court Justices Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas.\n\nOcasio-Cortez has long criticized multiple conservative members of the Supreme Court, but the rhetoric of impeachment was amped up in the wake of recent rulings, including the court's decision on presidential immunity.\n\n\"The unchecked corruption crisis on the Supreme Court has now spiraled into a Constitutional crisis threatening American democracy writ large,\" Ocasio-Cortez said in a statement. \"Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito's pattern of refusal to recuse from consequential matters before the court in which they hold widely documented financial and personal entanglements constitutes a grave threat to American rule of law, the integrity of our democracy, and one of the clearest cases for which the tool of impeachment was designed.\"\n\nOcasio-Cortez specifically criticized gifts Thomas received from his friend, billionaire Harlan Crow.\n\n\"Clarence Thomas, in his conduct as an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States, engaged in high crimes and misdemeanors, by refusing to report the source, description, and value of gifts, and by failing to report of real estate property,\" Ocasio-Cortez wrote in the articles, going on to list gifts he did not reportedly reveal.\n\nThomas acknowledged in his latest annual financial report, released in June, that he had \"inadvertently omitted\" reimbursement for food and lodging expenses for the July 2019 travel.\n\nMORE: Clarence Thomas formally discloses 2019 trips paid for by Harlan Crow as justices' financial filings released\n\nThe articles against Thomas, who was nominated to the Supreme Court by George H.W. Bush in 1991, also cites Thomas' \"refusal to recuse from matters concerning his spouse's legal interest in cases before the court\" and \"refusal to recuse from matters involving his spouse's financial interest in cases before the court.\"\n\nThis is a developing story.

The action is unlikely to proceed in the Republican-controlled House. The move follows accusations of ethical lapses and concerns over the justices' impartiality in key rulings.\n\nLiberal Democratic U.S. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has introduced articles of impeachment against conservative U.S. Supreme Court Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito, her office said on Wednesday. The effort stands no chance of advancing in the Republican-controlled House of Representatives. To remove an official through this process, the House must vote to impeach and the Senate then must vote to convict.\n\nDemocrats for years have criticized the court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority, over rulings that advanced causes popular on the right. These have included rolling back abortion rights, expanding gun rights, rejecting race-conscious collegiate admissions and ruling that former presidents have broad immunity from prosecution for official acts in office in a decision favoring Donald Trump. Ocasio-Cortez said in a statement that Thomas and Alito's \"pattern of refusal to recuse from consequential matters before the court in which they hold widely documented financial and personal entanglements constitutes a grave threat to American rule of law.\"\n\nSome congressional Democrats have accused Thomas and Alito, two of the court's most conservative justices, of ethical lapses. Activists criticized Thomas following reports that he failed to disclose accepting travel and lodging from a wealthy benefactor and that his wife was involved in efforts to overturn Trump's 2020 election loss.

United States.\n\nDemands for Alito's recusal came in the wake of news that two flags associated with the January 6, 2021 insurrection were flown at his family's properties in Virginia and New Jersey. Alito blamed his wife for the flags and dismissed calls to step away from the case as baseless.\n\nThomas, for his part, faced calls to recuse due to his wife's role in efforts to overturn President Joe Biden's 2020 election win.\n\nAdditionally, Alito and Thomas have been the focus of recent ProPublicareporting detailing the extent to which both justices have accepted vacations and other undisclosed gifts from right-wing billionaires with interests before the court.\n\nIn response to the corruption crisis, the Supreme Court late last year unveiled an ethics code with no enforcement mechanisms -- further showing to critics that the justices could not be trusted to police themselves.\n\n\"Given the court's demonstrated inability to preserve its own legitimate conduct,\" Ocasio-Cortez said Wednesday, \"it is incumbent upon Congress to contain the threat this poses to our democracy and the hundreds of millions of Americans harmed by the crisis of corruption unfurling within the court.\"\n\nOnly one Supreme Court justice has been successfully impeached in U.S. history, and Ocasio-Cortez's articles have no chance of getting through the Republican-controlled House of Representatives.\n\nAdvocates nevertheless celebrated the impeachment effort as a necessary step toward reining in the high court.\n\n\"The framers of our Constitution called on Congress specifically to hold judicial officers, including Supreme Court justices, accountable for high crimes and misdemeanors that compromise the integrity of the court,\" Courtney Hostetler, legal director at Free Speech For People, said in a statement. \"We're proud to have worked with Rep.

It is up to Congress to defend our nation from this authoritarian capture,\" Ocasio-Cortez wrote on the social platform X last Monday. \"I intend on filing articles of impeachment upon our return.\"\n\nAhead of the Supreme Court's ruling on presidential immunity, Alito and Thomas faced calls to recuse themselves in cases related to the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol, including in last week's presidential immunity decision. Critics cited the public reports connecting the justices to the \"Stop the Steal\" movement behind the Capitol attack - even if the justices themselves maintain they have no connection to the movement.\n\nThomas's wife was a major player in the \"Stop the Steal\" movement, while Alito has recently come under fire over a flag flying over his home that has been connected to the \"Stop the Steal\" movement. Both justices have refused calls to recuse. Alito said an upside-down U.S. flag over his home was the responsibility of his wife.\n\nDemocrats have sharpened their focus on the Supreme Court after the presidential immunity ruling, hoping that a messaging blitz focused on the bench could turbocharge campaigns up and down the ballot in the lead-up to the November elections.\n\nIn addition to Ocasio-Cortez's impeachment resolution, Democrats have floated a host of reform proposals that they're hoping to adopt if voters deliver them the House majority at the polls in November.\n\nThe list includes efforts to apply term limits to Supreme Court justices;

And their refusal to recuse from the specific matters and cases before the court in which their benefactors and spouses are implicated represents nothing less than a constitutional crisis.

The ruling in question said a president has absolute immunity from prosecution for \"actions within his conclusive and preclusive constitutional authority,\" and \"presumptive immunity\" for official acts in general. The court said there is no immunity for unofficial acts.\n\nSCOTUS RULES EX-PRESIDENTS HAVE PROTECTION FROM PROSECUTION FOR OFFICIAL ACTS IN IMMUNITY CASE\n\n\"The Supreme Court has become consumed by a corruption crisis beyond its control,\" Ocasio-Cortez wrote on X following the decision. \"Today's ruling represents an assault on American democracy.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) followed through on her threat to file articles of impeachment against conservative U.S. Supreme Court Justices Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas on Wednesday, accusing them of promoting a \"corruption crisis\" on the court for failing to disclose gifts and recuse from certain cases.\n\n\"Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito's pattern of refusal to recuse from consequential matters before the court in which they hold widely documented financial and personal entanglements constitutes a grave threat to the American rule of law, the integrity of our democracy, and one of the clearest cases for which the tool of impeachment was designed,\" Ocasio-Cortez said in a statement Wednesday.\n\nThe articles are unlikely to gain traction in the GOP-led House, but the move keeps the majority-conservative court front and center as Democrats confront divisions over whether President Joe Biden should be the party's presidential nominee. It also continues Democratic efforts to hold the court accountable, along with legislation that would limit the value of gifts justices can receive.\n\nOcasio-Cortez filed two articles against Alito and three against Thomas. The accusations against Thomas include \"failure to disclose financial income, gift and reimbursements, property interests, liabilities, and transactions, among other information.\" The allegations against Alito include \"refusal to recuse from cases in which he had a personal bias or prejudice,\" after reports that Alito flew flags at his homes associated the with the movement to overturn the 2020 election. Alito has said it was his wife's decision to fly the flags.\n\nLast year, ProPublica reported that Alito did not disclose a 2008 trip with billionaire Paul Singer, nor did he recuse himself from cases that Singer's hedge fund had before the court. Alito wrote in a Wall Street Journal op-ed he had limited engagement with Singer and was under no obligation to recuse himself.\n\nThe outlet also reported that Thomas had accepted luxury vacations from GOP megadonor Harlan Crow that he had not disclosed. Thomas has called Crow and his wife \"close personal friends\" and said he was advised that he didn't need to disclose the trips they took over the course of more than 20 years.\n\nThomas also failed to disclose real estate transactions involving Crow, which the justice later amended in financial disclosure forms.\n\nThe articles also cite Ginni Thomas, Thomas' wife. Judicial activist Leonard Leo reportedly directed a conservative group to obscure a payment to Ginni Thomas for consulting work. Leo defended the move to the Washington Post as protecting Ginni Thomas' privacy for doing work that largely wasn't a secret.\n\nA spokesperson for the court did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the impeachment attempt.\n\nCo-sponsors of the articles include Reps. Jamaal Bowman (D-N.Y.), Bonnie Watson Coleman (D-N.J.), Jasmine Crockett (D-Texas), Maxwell Frost (D-Fla.), Barbara Lee (D-Calif.), Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.), Delia Ramirez (D-Ill.) and Rashida Tlaib

The effort follows calls from two US senators, Sheldon Whitehouse and Ron Wyden, for the US attorney general to appoint a special counsel to investigate potential criminal violations of federal ethics and tax laws by Thomas.\n\n\"Justice Thomas and Alito's repeated failure over decades to disclose that they received millions of dollars in gifts from individuals with business before the court is explicitly against the law. And their refusal to recuse from the specific matters and cases before the court in which their benefactors and spouses are implicated represents nothing less than a constitutional crisis,\" Ocasio-Cortez, a Democrat from New York, said in a statement.\n\nThe articles were supported by seven other Democrats in the House.\n\nOcasio-Cortez continued: \"The unchecked corruption crisis on the supreme court has now spiraled into a constitutional crisis threatening American democracy writ large.\"\n\nReporting by the news outlet ProPublica revealed that Thomas failed to disclose several luxury vacation trips that were paid for by Harlan Crow, a conservative megadonor. Thomas has also been pressed to recuse himself from cases involving the January 6 US Capitol attack and Donald Trump because his wife, Ginni, is involved with groups that were connected to the insurrection.\n\nThe resolution filed against Thomas contains three articles of impeachment. The first focuses on his failure to disclose gifts from Crow. The second two involve his refusal to recuse himself from cases connected to his wife.\n\nAlito also took a vacation with and flew on a private jet chartered by Peter Singer, a Republican billionaire. Additionally, Alito refused to recuse himself from cases involving the attack on the US Capitol after it was reported that his wife, Martha-Ann, flew an upside-down American flag associated with the insurrection at their Virginia home. Further, the Alitos flew a flag associated with Christian nationalism at a beach home in New Jersey.\n\nOcasio-Cortez filed two articles of impeachment against Alito. One focuses on his failure to disclose luxury travel and the other on his refusal to recuse himself from January 6 cases.\n\nAlito and Thomas were both part of a majority opinion earlier this month saying that former presidents have immunity from prosecution for official acts, a major win for Trump. They both also were in the majority in a case narrowing the grounds under which January 6 participants can be criminally prosecuted.\n\nSupreme court justices have wide discretion over whether to recuse themselves from a given case - something that sets them apart from other justices. Facing pressure after ProPublica's reporting, the court's nine justices formalized a code of conduct last November, a move that was seen as a step in the right direction, but still weak.", "source":

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in June 2024Jemal Countess / Getty Images for Court Accountab\n\nRep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., on Wednesday introduced articles of impeachment against Supreme Court Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito, saying that their refusal to recuse from certain prominent cases \"constitutes a grave threat to American rule of law.\"\n\nIn a statement, the New York congresswoman said that justices' refusal to step aside from cases \"in which they hold widely documented financial and personal entanglements\" has created an \"unchecked corruption crisis on the Supreme Court.\"\n\nThis, she said, \"constitutes a grave threat to American rule of law, the integrity of our democracy, and one of the clearest cases for which the tool of impeachment was designed.\"\n\nThe high court did not immediately return a request for comment.\n\nIn her statement, Ocasio-Cortez said Alito's impeachment resolution centered on his \"refusal to recuse from cases in which he had a personal bias or prejudice concerning a party in cases before the court\" and his \"failure to disclose financial income, gifts and reimbursements, property interests, liabilities, and transactions, among other information.\"\n\nThe resolutions were co-sponsored by Reps. Barbara Lee, D-Calif., Rashida Talib, D-Mich., Bonnie Watson Coleman, D-N.J., Delia Ramirez, D-Ill., Maxwell Frost, D-Fla., Ilhan Omar, D-Minn. and Jamaal Bowman, D-N.Y.\n\nThe first charge centers on two controversial flags that were flown outside his homes -- an upside-down American flag and an \"Appeal to Heaven\" flag. Both flags have each been carried in recent years by members of the \"Stop the Steal\" movement, whose supporters claim that President Joe Biden did not lawfully win the 2020 presidential election. Alito has said it was his wife's decision to fly the flags.\n\nAlito declined to recuse himself from two Trump-related cases that were pending before the court when the existence of the flags was first reported.\n\nThe second charge against Alito appears to refer to Alito's relationship with hedge fund billionaire Paul Singer, who ProPublica reported took Alito on a fishing trip to Alaska that the justice did not disclose in ethics reports. Alito later did not recuse himself from cases involving Singer.\n\nThomas' impeachment article centers on his \"failure to disclose financial income, gifts and reimbursements, property interests, liabilities, and transactions, among other information, refusal to recuse from matters concerning his spouse's legal interest in cases before the court [and] refusal to recuse from matters involving his spouse's financial interest in cases before the court.\"\n\nThomas' relationship with GOP mega-donor Harlan Crow has been the subject of intense scrutiny for months.\n\nExtensive reporting last year by ProPublica showed that Thomas has accepted lavish gifts like vacations and flights without disclosing them in official ethics forms.\n\nThomas has also drawn ire from critics over his wife Ginni Thomas' conservative political activism, particularly her role in former President Donald Trump's efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election in Arizona.\n\nIn the aftermath of the election, Ginni Thomas also sent messages to then-White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows, urging him to stand with Trump. Ginni Thomas later said she regretted sending those texts.\n\nStill, Democrats called on Clarence Thomas to recuse himself from two cases involving Trump: a constitutional challenge to the former president's re-election candidacy and Trump's presidential immunity claims. Thomas did not recuse himself from either case, both wins for Trump.", "source": {"uri": "nbcnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Two flags associated with sympathy for the \"Stop the Steal\" movement flew outside of Alito's residences -- though he blamed his wife for their presence. Thomas' wife, Virginia \"Ginni\" Thomas, was involved in post-election efforts to pressure former Vice President Mike Pence into interfering with the certification of the Electoral College.\n\nGinni Thomas was also on the payroll of conservative dark money groups who brought several matters before the court. This landed Thomas a third article of impeachment \"refusal to recuse from matters involving his spouse's financial interest in cases before the court.\"\n\nWith no existing, binding code of ethics to hold Supreme Court justices to account for their off-the-bench dealings, Democrats have pushed legislation that would \"require Supreme Court justices to adopt a code of conduct, create a mechanism to investigate alleged violations of the code of conduct and other laws, improve disclosure and transparency when a justice has a connection to a party or amicus before the Court, and require justices to explain their recusal decisions to the public.\"\n\nBut with a split Congress and little advancement down the legislative path, Ocasio-Cortez wrote that \"it is incumbent upon Congress to contain the threat this poses to our democracy and the hundreds of millions of Americans harmed by the crisis of corruption unfurling within the court.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) has filed articles of impeachment against U.S. Supreme Court Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito.\n\n\"The unchecked corruption crisis on the Supreme Court has now spiraled into a Constitutional crisis threatening American democracy writ large. Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito's pattern of refusal to recuse from consequential matters before the court in which they hold widely documented financial and personal entanglements constitutes a grave threat to American rule of law, the integrity of our democracy, and one of the clearest cases for which the tool of impeachment was designed,\" AOC said.\n\n\"The Constitution of the United States explicitly outlines a higher standard of conduct for the judiciary to meet, far surpassing its existing bars on treason, bribery, and other high crimes and misdemeanors for all civil officers: the standard of Good Behavior. Judicial ethics and rules, to which even the lowest level judges are held, make those standards clear. The lifetime appointments of Supreme Court justices make enforcement of these standards a solemn responsibility for the protection of our democracy,\" she continued.\n\n\"Justice Thomas and Alito's repeated failure over decades to disclose that they received millions of dollars in gifts from individuals with business before the court is explicitly against the law. And their refusal to recuse from the specific matters and cases before the court in which their benefactors and spouses are implicated represents nothing less than a constitutional crisis. These failures alone would amount to a deep transgression worthy of standard removal in any lower court, and would disqualify any nominee to the highest court from confirmation in the first place. Given the court's demonstrated inability to preserve its own legitimate conduct, it is incumbent upon Congress to contain the threat this poses to our democracy and the hundreds of millions of Americans harmed by the crisis of corruption unfurling within the court. Congress has a legal, moral, and democratic obligation to impeach,\" she added.\n\n\"AOC has unveiled her articles of impeachment against Justices Thomas and Alito for refusing to recuse from certain cases. Co-sponsors: Lee (Calif.), Tlaib, Watson Coleman, Ramirez (Ill.), Frost, Omar and Bowman,\" Axios reporter Andrew Solender wrote.\n\nAOC wrote in a press release:\n\nThe first impeachment resolution includes the following impeachment articles against Justice Thomas:\n\nFailure to disclose financial income, gifts and reimbursements, property interests, liabilities, and transactions, among other information. Refusal to recuse from matters concerning his spouse's legal interest in cases before the court. Refusal to recuse from matters involving his spouse's financial interest in cases before the court.\n\nThe second impeachment resolution includes the following impeachment articles against Justice Alito:\n\nRefusal to recuse from cases in which he had a personal bias or prejudice concerning a party in cases before the court. Failure to disclose financial income, gifts and reimbursements, property interests, liabilities, and transactions, among other information.\n\nThe Congresswoman maintains that such conduct -- while under a Judicial Oath to \"faithfully and impartially discharge and perform\" duties and a Constitutional Oath to \"support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic\" -- warrants impeachment, trial, removal from office, and disqualification from holding future office in the United States of America.\n\nOn June 11, 2024, Congresswoman Ocasio-Cortez and Congressman Jamie Raskin hosted an oversight roundtable with expert panelists and legislators, including Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI), entitled \"High Court, Low Standards, and Dark Money: Flagging a Supreme Court Ethics Crisis in America,\" to examine corruption on the court.\n\nOn June 20, they wrote a letter to Chief Justice John Roberts to learn what immediate action he would take to restore public trust in the Court amidst severe ethical conflicts.\n\nAdditionally, on June 25, the lawmakers introduced the High Court Gift Ban Act to prohibit Supreme Court justices from receiving gifts valued at more than $50, bringing them in line with Members of Congress and other federal officials.\n\nPOLITICO noted:\n\nThe move has slim chances of success in the GOP-controlled House, but is an escalation of Democrats' efforts to probe what they view as ethical misconduct in the nation's highest court.", "source": {"uri": "en-volve.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "enVolve"}, "authors": [{"uri": "a_m_smith@en-volve.com", "name": "A.M.

The move, an expression of liberal frustration with ethical and ideological issues on the court, has no chance of success.\n\n\"Justice Thomas and Alito's repeated failure over decades to disclose that they received millions of dollars in gifts from individuals with business before the court is explicitly against the law,\" the Bronx Democrat said.\n\n\"And their refusal to recuse from the specific matters and cases before the court in which their benefactors and spouses are implicated represents nothing less than a constitutional crisis.\"\n\nThomas pulled the court into an ethics firestorm after it was revealed he'd failed to disclose millions of dollars in luxury travel and other gifts from billionaire friends.\n\nThe impeachment articles focus on missing financial disclosures along with Thomas and Alito's refusal to recuse themselves from multiple high-profile cases. Democrats have accused both justices of being fatally biased in favor of former President Donald Trump in cases related to his attempts to overturn the 2020 election results.\n\nOcasio-Cortez' allegations against Thomas focus on his wife, Virginia \"Ginni\" Thomas, who has falsely claimed, including before the congressional committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on Congress, that the 2020 election was stolen.\n\nIn a highly anticipated decision earlier this month, the Supreme Court ordered a new review of the law behind obstruction charges filed against hundreds of defendants in the Capitol attack on Jan. 6, 2021, including Trump.\n\nOcasio-Cortez, along with fellow Democrat and ranking member of the House oversight committee Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland, has pressured the justices previously over what the lawmakers call the Court's \"deepening ethics crisis.\"\n\nThe New York lawmaker signaled her intention to file the impeachment articles last week.

He did not report the trip on his annual disclosure.\n\nAlito did not recuse himself from cases involving the billionaire's companies on multiple occasions when they later came before the court.\n\nThe impeachment resolutions for both justices cite 'failure to disclose financial income, gifts and reimbursements, property interests, liabilities, and transactions, among other information'\n\nThe Thomas disclosure charge stems from his now-widely reported relationship with billionaire Harlan Crow.

ProPublica reported that Thomas took 38 vacations on the dime of his wealthy friends, which he failed to disclose in the justices' required financial disclosure reports.\n\nThomas's wife, Ginni Thomas, has also been a problem for the judge. Ginni is a longtime right-wing activist, and in the wake of the 2020 election, she lobbied lawmakers in Arizona to overturn Joe Biden's win over Donald Trump in the state.\n\nAs for Alito, Ocasio-Cortez's statement explained that the judge's impeachment resolution centers on his \"refusal to recuse from cases in which he had a personal bias or prejudice concerning a party in cases before the Court,\" as well as his failure to make accurate financial disclosures.\n\nEarlier this year, Alito found himself in the center of a scandal. The New York Times reported that he was flying an upside-down American flag (a symbol used by the \"Stop the Steal\" movement) at his private residence in January 2021. The Times later reported that another flag, this time an \"Appeal to Heaven\" flag also popular with insurrectionists, had also been flown at Alito's home. In both cases, the justice said that his wife was the one flying flags at their home. This violated Supreme Court ethics laws, which forbids justices from engaging in political activity, let alone political activity used by people who believe that Biden stole the election from Trump. When the flag controversy arose, Alito declined to recuse himself from two Trump-related cases that were pending before the Court.\n\nThe articles of impeachment are co-sponsored by Representatives Barbara Lee, Rashida Tlaib, Bonnie Watson Coleman, Delia Ramirez, Maxwell Frost, Ilhan Omar, and Jamaal Bowman.", "source": {"uri": "thecut.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Cut"}, "authors":

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez filed articles of impeachment Wednesday against Supreme Court Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel A. Alito Jr.\n\nThe New York Democrat said the Constitution demands a higher standard than what the two high court jurists have exhibited.\n\n\"The unchecked corruption crisis on the Supreme Court has now spiraled into a Constitutional crisis threatening American democracy writ large,\" Ms. Ocasio-Cortez said in a press statement. \"Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito's pattern of refusal to recuse from consequential matters before the court in which they hold widely documented financial and personal entanglements constitutes a grave threat to American rule of law, the integrity of our democracy, and one of the clearest cases for which the tool of impeachment was designed.\"\n\nThe progressive lawmaker said the two justices have failed to disclose financial gifts and hospitality from billionaires and have not recused themselves from cases in which their spouses have had an interest.\n\n\"These failures alone would amount to a deep transgression worthy of standard removal in any lower court, and would disqualify any nominee to the highest court from confirmation in the first place,\" she said. \"Given the court's demonstrated inability to preserve its own legitimate conduct, it is incumbent upon Congress to contain the threat this poses to our democracy and the hundreds of millions of Americans harmed by the crisis of corruption unfurling within the court. Congress has a legal, moral, and democratic obligation to impeach.\"\n\nCo-sponsoring the legislation are Democratic Reps. Barbara Lee of California, Rashida Tlaib of Michigan, Bonnie Watson Coleman of New Jersey, Delia Ramirez of Illinois, Maxwell Frost of Florida, Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, Jamaal Bowman of New York and Jasmine Crockett of Texas. With Republicans holding a narrow majority in the House, the legislation is unlikely to advance.\n\nThe move comes as Democrats have complained about Justice Thomas' friendship with GOP mega-donor Harlan Crow.\n\nLast year, ProPublica published a series of articles critical of the justices -- mainly Justice Thomas -- accepting hospitality without disclosures.\n\nAt the time, there was no requirement to disclose certain hospitality and gifts for the justices, but that changed in 2023 after the Judicial Conference updated its rules, extending them to the high court.\n\nJustice Thomas and Mr. Crow have defended their friendship, and Mr. Crow has said he has not discussed Supreme Court business with Justice Thomas. Both have denied any wrongdoing.\n\nDemocratic lawmakers have called for the two GOP-appointed justices to recuse themselves from major disputes before the court this term involving Jan. 6 defendants and former President Trump's immunity.\n\nThey said Justice Thomas' wife attended the pro-Trump Stop the Steal rally and had contact with Trump allies. Virginia Thomas said she left the rally before it got violent at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6.\n\nThe Democratic lawmakers have been displeased with Justice Alito over an expensive fishing trip he took with a billionaire but failed to disclose, and then for flying flags they say are sympathetic to Jan. 6 defendants outside his homes in New Jersey and in Virginia.\n\nJustice Alito rejected the suggestion he should recuse and said his wife flew the flags.", "source": {"uri": "washingtontimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Times"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez Files Articles Of Impeachment Against Two Supreme Court Justices * 100PercentFedUp.com * by Danielle", "body": "Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) has filed articles of impeachment against U.S. Supreme Court Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito.\n\n\"The unchecked corruption crisis on the Supreme Court has now spiraled into a Constitutional crisis threatening American democracy writ large. Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito's pattern of refusal to recuse from consequential matters before the court in which they hold widely documented financial and personal entanglements constitutes a grave threat to American rule of law, the integrity of our democracy, and one of the clearest cases for which the tool of impeachment was designed,\" AOC said.\n\n\"The Constitution of the United States explicitly outlines a higher standard of conduct for the judiciary to meet, far surpassing its existing bars on treason, bribery, and other high crimes and misdemeanors for all civil officers: the standard of Good Behavior. Judicial ethics and rules, to which even the lowest level judges are held, make those standards clear. The lifetime appointments of Supreme Court justices make enforcement of these standards a solemn responsibility for the protection of our democracy,\" she continued.\n\n\"Justice Thomas and Alito's repeated failure over decades to disclose that they received millions of dollars in gifts from individuals with business before the court is explicitly against the law. And their refusal to recuse from the specific matters and cases before the court in which their benefactors and spouses are implicated represents nothing less than a constitutional crisis. These failures alone would amount to a deep transgression worthy of standard removal in any lower court, and would disqualify any nominee to the highest court from confirmation in the first place. Given the court's demonstrated inability to preserve its own legitimate conduct, it is incumbent upon Congress to contain the threat this poses to our democracy and the hundreds of millions of Americans harmed by the crisis of corruption unfurling within the court. Congress has a legal, moral, and democratic obligation to impeach,\" she added.\n\n\"AOC has unveiled her articles of impeachment against Justices Thomas and Alito for refusing to recuse from certain cases. Co-sponsors: Lee (Calif.), Tlaib, Watson Coleman, Ramirez (Ill.), Frost, Omar and Bowman,\" Axios reporter Andrew Solender wrote.\n\nThe first impeachment resolution includes the following impeachment articles against Justice Thomas:\n\nThe second impeachment resolution includes the following impeachment articles against Justice Alito:\n\nThe Congresswoman maintains that such conduct -- while under a Judicial Oath to \"faithfully and impartially discharge and perform\" duties and a Constitutional Oath to \"support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic\" -- warrants impeachment, trial, removal from office, and disqualification from holding future office in the United States of America.\n\nOn June 11, 2024, Congresswoman Ocasio-Cortez and Congressman Jamie Raskin hosted an oversight roundtable with expert panelists and legislators, including Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI), entitled \"High Court, Low Standards, and Dark Money: Flagging a Supreme Court Ethics Crisis in America,\" to examine corruption on the court.\n\nOn June 20, they wrote a letter to Chief Justice John Roberts to learn what immediate action he would take to restore public trust in the Court amidst severe ethical conflicts.\n\nAdditionally, on June 25, the lawmakers introduced the High Court Gift Ban Act to prohibit Supreme Court justices from receiving gifts valued at more than $50, bringing them in line with Members of Congress and other federal officials.", "source": {"uri": "100percentfedup.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "100

To remove an official through this process, the House must vote to impeach and the Senate then must vote to convict.\n\nDemocrats for years have criticized the court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority, over rulings that advanced causes popular on the right. These have included rolling back abortion rights, expanding gun rights, rejecting race-conscious collegiate admissions and ruling that former presidents have broad immunity from prosecution for official acts in office in a decision favoring Donald Trump.\n\nOcasio-Cortez said in a statement that Thomas and Alito's \"pattern of refusal to recuse from consequential matters before the court in which they hold widely documented financial and personal entanglements constitutes a grave threat to American rule of law.\"\n\nSome congressional Democrats have accused Thomas and Alito, two of the court's most conservative justices, of ethical lapses.\n\nActivists criticized Thomas following reports that he failed to disclose accepting travel and lodging from a wealthy benefactor and that his wife was involved in efforts to overturn Trump's 2020 election loss. Thomas has said that he regarded the travel he accepted as personal hospitality not subject to disclosure requirements.\n\nAlito similarly faced criticism after the revelation that flags associated with Trump's efforts to overturn the 2020 results were flown outside the justice's homes in Virginia and New Jersey. Alito has said it was his wife, not him, who flew the flags.\n\n(Reporting by Moira Warburton and Makini Brice in Washington; Editing by Scott Malone and Will Dunham)", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarence_Thomas", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Clarence Thomas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Alito", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Samuel Alito"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article_of_impeachment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Article of impeachment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandria_Ocasio-Cortez", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_Party_of_Australia", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Liberal Party of Australia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impeachment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Impeachment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judicial_disqualification", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Judicial disqualification"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_politics_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gun politics in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_immunity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Legal immunity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion-rights_movements", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Abortion-rights movements"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2020_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2020 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Malone", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scott Malone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rule of law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Virginia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Virginia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New Jersey"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Jersey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Property_Rights", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Property Rights", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/reuters.com/2797c28c25b59ec5ceb4aee485609d00", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9722448", "eventUri": "eng-9722448", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 181, "relevance": 1}

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., on Wednesday introduced articles of impeachment against Supreme Court Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito, saying that their refusal to recuse from certain prominent cases \"constitutes a grave threat to American rule of law.\"\n\nIn a statement, the New York congresswoman said that justices' refusal to step aside from cases \"in which they hold widely documented financial and personal entanglements\" has created an \"unchecked corruption crisis on the Supreme Court.\"\n\nThis, she said, \"constitutes a grave threat to American rule of law, the integrity of our democracy, and one of the clearest cases for which the tool of impeachment was designed.\"\n\nThe high court did not immediately return a request for comment.\n\nIn her statement, Ocasio-Cortez said Alito's impeachment resolution centered on his \"refusal to recuse from cases in which he had a personal bias or prejudice concerning a party in cases before the court\" and his \"failure to disclose financial income, gifts and reimbursements, property interests, liabilities, and transactions, among other information.\"\n\nThe resolutions were co-sponsored by Reps.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez filed separate articles of impeachment Wednesday against Supreme Court justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito.\n\nThe articles cite the failure by both justices to disclose gifts from individuals with business before the court and their refusal to recuse themselves from cases that they or their family members have close ties to.\n\n\"These failures alone would amount to a deep transgression worthy of standard removal in any lower court, and would disqualify any nominee to the highest court from confirmation in the first place,\" Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) said in a statement.\n\nThe move has slim chances of success in the GOP-controlled House, but is an escalation of Democrats' efforts to probe what they view as ethical misconduct in the nation's highest court.\n\nEarlier today the Supreme Court finally issued its much-awaited ruling on the topic of Presidential Immunity.\n\nSee that report here:\n\nBREAKING: Supreme Court Rules On Trump's Absolute Immunity Case\n\nThe Opinion was not quite a full win for President Trump (I'll be posting a full analysis on that shortly), but it definitely was a total loss for Democrats.\n\nThe biggest of which comes from Ms. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who posted this:\n\nThe Supreme Court has become consumed by a corruption crisis beyond its control.\n\nToday's ruling represents an assault on American democracy. It is up to Congress to defend our nation from this authoritarian capture.\n\nI intend on filing articles of impeachment upon our return.\n\nIf the Democrats can't stack the Courts, they'll just try to remove all the Conservative Justices!\n\nSpeaking of, she doesn't exactly say who she will be impeaching....is it all 6 of them AOC?\n\nRemember a few weeks ago when President Trump held a massive MAGA Rally in the heart of The Bronx?\n\nYou know, the place AOC said was full of Democrats and not a single person that liked or supported President Trump?\n\nAnd then she claimed the only people who showed up were bused in from other locations?\n\nWell, big shout out to my friend Mark for sending me this which confirms Trump was 100% right (again) and AOC was dead wrong (as usual).\n\nThis is MAGA Country, even in the heart of the Bronx!\n\nESPECIALLY in the heart of the Bronx!\n\nAnd speaking of that Rally, here's a lot more in case you missed it from our boots on the ground local reporters:\n\nVideo Shows MASSIVE Turnout For Trump At Bronx Rally - \"Line Stretches Back For Over a Mile!\"\n\nPresident Trump held a MASSIVE Rally yesterday in one of the BLUEST parts of New York City -- The Bronx.\n\nIn case you missed it, you can watch it right here:\n\nPresident Trump Is LIVE With a MASSIVE Rally In The Bronx! WATCH HERE!\n\nIt was massive, but you don't really understand that until you SEE it live on the ground.\n\nSo we go to our good friend Richard Citizen Journalist who was boots on the ground at the Rally and he walked around showing you a line of people stretching on for over a mile!\n\nAnd that was just the overflow people still trying to get in.\n\nIt seems nothing these Democrats do in their courtroom can get our President's spirit down!\n\nOkay, so Trump rolls into one of the Democrats strongholds.\n\nThousands upon thousands of supporters, cheering him on!\n\nHere's there reaching out to the Bronx community to secure votes.\n\nAnd it seems the people are with him.\n\nThey can see through the Manhattan circus trial and they know a winner when they see one.\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- President Trump campaigned Thursday in one of the most Democratic counties in the nation, holding a rally in the South Bronx as he tries to woo minority voters days before a Manhattan jury will begin deliberations on whether to convict him of felony charges in his criminal hush money trial.\n\nTrump, in his speech, cast himself as a better president for Black and Hispanic voters than President Joe Biden as he railed against Biden on immigration, an issue Trump has made central to his campaign. He insisted \"the biggest negative impact\" of the influx of migrants in New York is losing jobs, housing, everything they can lose.\n\nSome in the crowd responded by chanting, \"Build the wall,\" a reference to Trump's push while in the White House to build a U.S.-Mexico border barrier.\n\nWith Trump confined to New York for much of the last six weeks because of his trial, the presumptive Republican nominee's campaign has planned a series of local stops across his hometown before and after court. He visited a bodega in Harlem, dropped by a construction site and held a photo op at a local firehouse.\n\nBut the Bronx rally was his first event open to the general public as he insists he is making a play to win an overwhelmingly Democratic state that hasn't backed a Republican for president since Ronald Reagan in 1984. Besides creating a spectacle of rallygoers and protesters, the rally also gave Trump an opportunity to highlight what he argues are advantages on economic and immigration issues that could cut into key Democratic voting blocs.\n\n\"The strategy is to demonstrate to the voters of the Bronx and New York that this isn't your typical presidential election, that Donald Trump is here to represent everybody and get our country back on track,\" said Florida Republican Rep. Byron Donalds, a potential Trump running mate who grew up in Brooklyn and spoke at the rally.\n\nThe former president opened his rally with an ode to his hometown, talking about its humble beginnings as a small Dutch trading post before becoming a glamorous capital of culture that \"inspired the entire world.\" While Trump established residency in Florida in 2019, he reminisced on Thursday about his efforts to revitalize Central Park's Wollman Rink and people he knew in the real estate business.\n\n\"Everyone wanted to be here,\" he told the enthusiastic audience. \"But sadly this is now a city in decline.\"\n\n\"If a New Yorker can't save this country,\" he went on to say, \"no one can.\"\n\nHours before Trump's rally was set to begin, a long line of supporters decked out in red \"Make America Great Again\" hats and other Trump gear snaked around the park, waiting for security screening to begin. People were still entering the park well into Trump's speech, with some eager supporters sprinting up a hill toward the rally site after getting through security.\n\nThe Bronx Democratic Party protested Trump's appearance with its own event at the park.\n\nMembers of multiple unions were present, holding signs that said \"The Bronx says no to Trump\" in both English and Spanish.\n\n\"We are used to elected officials, to government officials, to opportunists of all kinds who come to our community and use our painful history,\" said Democratic State Rep. Amanda Septimo, who represents the South Bronx. \"They talk about the Bronx and everything that's wrong with it, but they never get to the part that talks about what they're going to do for the Bronx and we know that Trump is never going to get to that part in his speech.\"", "source": {"uri": "100percentfedup.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "100 Percent Fed Up"}, "authors": [{"uri":

And their refusal to recuse from the specific matters and cases before the court in which their benefactors and spouses are implicated represents nothing less than a constitutional crisis. These failures alone would amount to a deep transgression worthy of standard removal in any lower court, and would disqualify any nominee to the highest court from confirmation in the first place.\n\nGiven the court\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s demonstrated inability to preserve its own legitimate conduct, it is incumbent upon Congress to contain the threat this poses to our democracy and the hundreds of millions of Americans harmed by the crisis of corruption unfurling within the court. Congress has a legal, moral, and democratic obligation to impeach.\n\nThe resolutions themselves are devastating. The Thomas resolution is 15 pages long and lays out how Justice Thomas is corrupted, conflicted, and has failed to disclose to the American people his gift-taking, as he refused to recuse himself in cases that were impacted by his wife's political activities. The Alito resolution is ten pages long and details the Justice's failure to disclose gifts that he has taken from wealthy conservatives and his failure to recuse.\n\nBecause these are privileged resolutions, the Congresswoman can force them to be voted on in the House, but they will not be passed. The attention they will receive will shine a light on the conservative Supreme Court majority's corruption and warn the conservatives of what will be coming if Democrats take back the House majority in November.", "source": {"uri": "politicususa.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "POLITICUSUSA"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jason_easley@politicususa.com", "name": "Jason Easley", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Alito", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Samuel Alito"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarence_Thomas", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Clarence Thomas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impeachment", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Impeachment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article_of_impeachment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Article of impeachment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_impeachment_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal impeachment in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_impeachment_of_Donald_Trump", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Second impeachment of Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_impeachment_of_Donald_Trump", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "First impeachment of Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandria_Ocasio-Cortez", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judicial_disqualification", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Judicial disqualification"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advice_and_consent", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Advice and consent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incumbent", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Incumbent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutional_crisis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Constitutional crisis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Supreme court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corruption", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Corruption"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Courts", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Courts", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Laws", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Laws", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://www.politicususa.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/AOC-impeachment-hearing.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9722448", "eventUri": "eng-9722448", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 172, "relevance": 1}

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., and a group of fellow House progressives introduced articles of impeachment against Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito, accusing the two conservative Supreme Court justices of refusing to recuse themselves from cases in which they had a \"personal bias or prejudice concerning a party\" and failing to accurately disclose income and gifts from Republican megadonors.\n\nThe articles additionally charge Thomas with not recusing himself from \"matters involving his spouse's financial interest in cases before the court.\"\n\nTheir alleged improprieties have created an \"unchecked corruption crisis on the Supreme Court\" that \"constitutes a grave threat to American rule of law, the integrity of our democracy, and one of the clearest cases for which the tool of impeachment was designed,\" Ocasio-Cortez said in a statement.

Alito has also landed in trouble for pro-insurrection flags that have been flown in front of his homes in Virginia and New Jersey, calling into question his impartiality in cases related to the Jan. 6 insurrection.\n\nAmid public outcry over their paid luxury vacations and other controversies, the Supreme Court adopted a code of conduct that, while being the first of its kind in the court's history, lacks an enforcement mechanism. Efforts by Senate Democrats to open the door to investigate judicial misconduct were blocked by Republicans, who called the effort \"constitutional overreach.\"\n\nThe justices have largely dismissed and denied the reports about them, with Alito complaining that ProPublica ran a hit piece because they didn't like his rulings.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York accused Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito of failing to disclose gifts from wealthy supporters and refusing to recuse themselves from high-profile cases in which the justices had a conflict of interest.\n\n\"Justice Thomas and Alito's repeated failure over decades to disclose that they received millions of dollars in gifts from individuals with business before the court is explicitly against the law,\" Ocasio-Cortez said in a statement.\n\nFrost, 27, is a cosponsor of the impeachment articles. He's an Orlando-area Democrat who in 2022 became the first member of Generation Z to be elected to Congress.\n\nFrost's office did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe impeachment push is almost certainly dead on arrival in the Republican-controlled House of Representatives. Even if impeachment somehow won favor in the lower chamber, the U.S. Senate would have to vote by a two-thirds margin to convict the justices.\n\nSome 15 federal judges have been impeached by the House. However, just one U.S. Supreme Court justice was ever subject to the process -- in 1804. He was acquitted by the Senate.\n\nEarlier this week, two Democratic senators called for a special counsel to investigate Thomas over his undisclosed gifts. The investigative journalism site ProPublica reported last year that Thomas took dozens of vacations and private jet flights and received other expensive gifts -- all furnished by wealthy friends.

He insisted \"the biggest negative impact\" of the influx of migrants in New York is losing jobs, housing, everything they can lose.\n\nSome in the crowd responded by chanting, \"Build the wall,\" a reference to Trump's push while in the White House to build a U.S.-Mexico border barrier.\n\nWith Trump confined to New York for much of the last six weeks because of his trial, the presumptive Republican nominee's campaign has planned a series of local stops across his hometown before and after court. He visited a bodega in Harlem, dropped by a construction site and held a photo op at a local firehouse.\n\nBut the Bronx rally was his first event open to the general public as he insists he is making a play to win an overwhelmingly Democratic state that hasn't backed a Republican for president since Ronald Reagan in 1984. Besides creating a spectacle of rallygoers and protesters, the rally also gave Trump an opportunity to highlight what he argues are advantages on economic and immigration issues that could cut into key Democratic voting blocs.\n\n\"The strategy is to demonstrate to the voters of the Bronx and New York that this isn't your typical presidential election, that Donald Trump is here to represent everybody and get our country back on track,\" said Florida Republican Rep. Byron Donalds, a potential Trump running mate who grew up in Brooklyn and spoke at the rally.\n\nThe former president opened his rally with an ode to his hometown, talking about its humble beginnings as a small Dutch trading post before becoming a glamorous capital of culture that \"inspired the entire world.\" While Trump established residency in Florida in 2019, he reminisced on Thursday about his efforts to revitalize Central Park's Wollman Rink and people he knew in the real estate business.\n\n\"Everyone wanted to be here,\" he told the enthusiastic audience. \"But sadly this is now a city in decline.\"\n\n\"If a New Yorker can't save this country,\" he went on to say, \"no one can.\"\n\nHours before Trump's rally was set to begin, a long line of supporters decked out in red \"Make America Great Again\" hats and other Trump gear snaked around the park, waiting for security screening to begin. People were still entering the park well into Trump's speech, with some eager supporters sprinting up a hill toward the rally site after getting through security.\n\nThe Bronx Democratic Party protested Trump's appearance with its own event at the park.\n\nMembers of multiple unions were present, holding signs that said \"The Bronx says no to Trump\" in both English and Spanish.\n\n\"We are used to elected officials, to government officials, to opportunists of all kinds who come to our community and use our painful history,\" said Democratic State Rep. Amanda Septimo, who represents the South Bronx. \"They talk about the Bronx and everything that's wrong with it, but they never get to the part that talks about what they're going to do for the Bronx and we know that Trump is never going to get to that part in his speech.\"", "source": {"uri": "en-volve.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "enVolve"}, "authors": [{"uri": "a_m_smith@en-volve.com", "name": "A.M.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York has introduced articles of impeachment against conservative Supreme Court Justices Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas over their failure to disclose gifts they have received while serving on the court - a messaging move that will surely fail in the GOP-controlled House.\n\n\"Justice Thomas and Alito's repeated failure over decades to disclose that they received millions of dollars in gifts from individuals with business before the court is explicitly against the law,\" Ocasio-Cortez said in a statement. \"And their refusal to recuse from the specific matters and cases before the court in which their benefactors and spouses are implicated represents nothing less than a constitutional crisis.\"\n\n\"Congress has a legal, moral, and democratic obligation to impeach,\" she said.\n\nThis is the latest example of House Democrats - led by some of their highest-profile members - prioritizing the Supreme Court in their campaign year messaging. They've previously signaled that, if they regain control of the House, they'd use the power of the gavel to investigate alleged ethical lapses by the justices.\n\nAlongside Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland, the top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee, Ocasio-Cortez hosted a panel on Supreme Court ethics last month that previewed how House Democrats would ramp up investigations into the justices should they gain a Democratic majority in the chamber this fall. Raskin is not a co-sponsor to the New York Democrat's impeachment articles, but several other progressives joined her in introducing the articles. They include Reps. Barbara Lee of California, Rashida Tlaib of Michigan, Bonnie Watson Coleman of New Jersey, Delia Ramirez of Illinois, Maxwell Frost of Florida, Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, Jamaal Bowman of New York and Jasmine Crockett of Texas.\n\nOther legislation attempting to regulate the Supreme Court through an enforceable ethics code or expanding the number of justices on the bench has been introduced in the House. The bills aimed at the high court have little chance of success while Republicans control the House and can block legislation in the Senate with the filibuster.\n\nStill, Ocasio-Cortez's impeachment attempt is the most aggressive proposal by Democrats to crack down on a Supreme Court they believe is engaging in inappropriate conduct. Earlier this week, Sens. Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island and Ron Wyden of Oregon called for Attorney General Merrick Garland to appoint a special counsel to investigate whether the hospitality Thomas received from his wealthy friends violated various laws.\n\nThomas has come under fire for failing to report on annual financial disclosures luxury travel enjoyed by him and his wife that was bankrolled by a GOP megadonor. It was also revealed last year that Alito flew on a private jet in 2008 owned by a hedge fund manager who had connections to cases before the court. Both justices have denied running afoul of the ethics and financial disclosure protocols followed by the justices.\n\nLast year, under intense public and congressional pressure, the Supreme Court rolled out its own code of ethics, but the court leaves it to the individual justices to police his or her own compliance.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) speaks to journalists following a roundtable discussion on Supreme Court Ethics conducted by Democrats of the House Oversight and Accountability Committee at the Rayburn House Office Building on June 11, 2024 in Washington, DC. (Jemal Countess/Getty Images for Court Accountability)\n\nRep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., and a group of fellow House progressives introduced articles of impeachment against Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito, accusing the two conservative Supreme Court justices of refusing to recuse themselves from cases in which they had a \"personal bias or prejudice concerning a party\" and failing to accurately disclose income and gifts from Republican megadonors.\n\nThe articles additionally charge Thomas with not recusing himself from \"matters involving his spouse's financial interest in cases before the court.\"\n\nTheir alleged improprieties have created an \"unchecked corruption crisis on the Supreme Court\" that \"constitutes a grave threat to American rule of law, the integrity of our democracy, and one of the clearest cases for which the tool of impeachment was designed,\" Ocasio-Cortez said in a statement. She was joined by co-sponsors Reps. Barbara Lee, D-Calif., Rashida Tlaib D-Mich., Bonnie Watson Coleman, D-N.J., Delia Ramirez, D-Ill., Maxwell Frost, D-Fla., Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., and Jamaal Bowman, D-N.Y.\n\nThomas and Alito have been the subject of a flood of reports from investigative news outlet ProPublica that have revealed their financial ties to donors who have had business before the court, which they failed to disclose. Alito has also landed in trouble for pro-insurrection flags that have been flown in front of his homes in Virginia and New Jersey, calling into question his impartiality in cases related to the Jan. 6 insurrection.\n\nAmid public outcry over their paid luxury vacations and other controversies, the Supreme Court adopted a code of conduct that, while being the first of its kind in the court's history, lacks an enforcement mechanism. Efforts by Senate Democrats to open the door to investigate judicial misconduct were blocked by Republicans, who called the effort \"constitutional overreach.\"\n\nThe justices have largely dismissed and denied the reports about them, with Alito complaining that ProPublica ran a hit piece because they didn't like his rulings. Thomas' personal attorney claimed said last year that his client \"has always strived for full transparency and adherence to the law.\"", "source": {"uri": "salon.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York introduced articles of impeachment against Supreme Court Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito on Wednesday, ramping up Democrats' disapproval of the high court in the wake of ethics issues and a spate of major decisions at the close of its latest term.\n\nIt is all but certain that the resolutions will die in the Republican-controlled House, where GOP lawmakers have accused Democrats of mounting a campaign to undermine the court's legitimacy in response to rulings on abortion, guns and presidential power they dislike. Still, the move by Ocasio-Cortez escalates Democrats' scrutiny of the high court's conservative justices, who hold six of the nine seats. The Supreme Court did not immediately return a request for comment.\n\nThe resolution filed against Thomas claims he engaged in high crimes and misdemeanors by failing to report travel accommodations and tuition for his grandnephew provided by Republican megadonor Harlan Crow, as well as free rent and home improvements related to a 2014 real estate transaction between the justice and Crow.\n\nThe measure, which contains three articles of impeachment, accuses Thomas of undermining the \"impartiality and integrity\" of the high court by failing to include the trips on his annual financial disclosure reports.\n\nOcasio-Cortez's resolution also seeks to punish Thomas for refusing to recuse himself from cases involving the 2020 presidential election because of the activities of his wife, Ginni Thomas. Ginni Thomas, a conservative activist, corresponded with former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows about efforts to overturn the election results. She testified in 2022 that she did not discuss the legal challenges involving the election with her husband.\n\nStill, the impeachment resolution claims that Thomas \"betrayed his judicial oath\" by violating federal ethics law.\n\n\"Given the court's demonstrated inability to preserve its own legitimate conduct, it is incumbent upon Congress to contain the threat this poses to our democracy and the hundreds of millions of Americans harmed by the crisis of corruption unfurling within the court. Congress has a legal, moral, and democratic obligation to impeach,\" Ocasio-Cortez said in a statement.\n\nThomas and Crow have been friends for more than two decades, and the justice didn't believe he was required to report the trips with Crow under rules regarding personal hospitality, he said last year. Thomas pledged to comply with new disclosure guidelines from the Judicial Conference issued last March, and he included travel on Crow's private jet, as well as lodging at an Adirondacks property, on his 2022 disclosure. That report also listed the 2014 real estate transaction.\n\nThomas also reported two trips he took with Crow in 2019 to Bali, Indonesia, and Monte Rio, California, on his latest disclosure form filed in May. Democrats, though, have accused the conservative justice of omitting other gifts and income from federal forms.\n\nThe impeachment resolution targeting Alito, which contains two articles, stems in part from flags that were displayed outside his Virginia residence and New Jersey vacation home in recent years. The first, an upside-down American flag, was flown outside Alito's Virginia house in January 2021, and the second, an \"Appeal to Heaven\" flag, was displayed outside his New Jersey residence in the summer of 2023.\n\nBoth types of flags were carried by rioters who breached the U.S. Capitol building on Jan. 6, 2021, but Alito has said he was not involved in the displays outside his homes. Instead, the justice told congressional Democrats in May that his wife flew the two flags, and neither of them knew of the meanings that have been ascribed to them in recent years.\n\nBut Ocasio-Cortez's resolution claims that the flying of the flags showed a \"lack of impartiality\" by Alito and required his recusal from cases before the Supreme Court involving former President Donald Trump and the Jan. 6, 2021, assault on the Capitol.\n\nAlito had rebuffed calls to step aside from those cases, telling Democrats that a \"reasonable person who is not motivated by political or ideological considerations or a desire to affect the outcome of Supreme Court cases would conclude that this event does not meet the applicable standard for recusal.\"\n\nThe impeachment resolution also accuses Alito of failing to disclose trips funded by unnamed individuals with interests before the Supreme Court and declining to step aside from hearing cases affecting a benefactor's business interests.\n\nOcasio-Cortez's resolution does not name the individuals, but a June 2023 ProPublica report revealed Alito flew aboard a private jet for a vacation at a luxury fishing lodge in Alaska in July 2008. The jet was provided by billionaire Paul Singer, whose hedge fund and related entities had sought the Supreme Court's intervention in past disputes.\n\nThomas' travel with Crow ramped up pressure on the Supreme Court by Congress to unilaterally enact a code of conduct, which it did in November. The Senate Judiciary Committee has been investigating the ethics practices at the nation's highest court and is expected to release a report with its findings this summer.\n\nIn addition to the ethics concerns, Democrats have also denounced a number of high-profile rulings by its conservative majority. The Supreme Court last week found that a former president is entitled to immunity from federal prosecution for official acts, a decision with significant ramifications for the criminal charges against Trump. He has pleaded not guilty.", "source": {"uri": "cbsnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article_of_impeachment",

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., and other Democrats filed articles of impeachment Wednesday against Supreme Court Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito, as Democrats have railed against the conservative-leaning justices for alleged ethics violations -- though the effort to oust the justices is sure to fail.\n\nGet Forbes Breaking News Text Alerts: We're launching text message alerts so you'll always know the biggest stories shaping the day's headlines. Text \"Alerts\" to (201) 335-0739 or sign up here.\n\nThe gifts that Alito and Thomas accepted without disclosing them mean \"a reasonable person would believe that he used his public office for his own private gain or for the private gain of his donors,\" the impeachment articles against both justices state. \"In all of this, [Justices Alito and Thomas have]\n\nThe impeachment effort is all but certain to fail, as Republicans have heavily opposed Democrats' ethics criticisms of the justices and attempts to investigate them or impose reforms.\n\nImpeachment of Supreme Court justices follows the same process as presidential impeachments: the House would first determine whether to impeach the official, and then the Senate would hold a trial to decide whether they should be removed from office. Justice Samuel Chase is the only Supreme Court justice who's ever been impeached, but while the House voted to impeach him in 1805, he was then acquitted by the Senate.\n\nThomas has previously said his gifts from Crow were merely hospitality from a close friend, and did start disclosing some travel on financial disclosures in 2022 and 2023, claiming he was now obligated to do so under new rules, but wasn't before. (Senators have found several trips after the rule change that Thomas still failed to disclose.) His wife Ginni Thomas has denied her work has any impact on her husband, claiming the two do not discuss any cases. Crow has also denied any wrongdoing and said he and the justice do not discuss the court. Alito has strongly denied ethical wrongdoing, penning a Wall Street Journal op-ed before the ProPublica report came out about his relationship with Singer, claiming the outlet \"misleads its readers.\" He has also denied any involvement with the controversial flag-flying, saying it was his wife's decision and he played no role in it.\n\nThe articles of impeachment are part of a broader outrage over alleged ethics infractions by Supreme Court justices, particularly Thomas and Alito. Democrats have long called for Thomas to resign or be removed from office amid the controversies over his wife Ginni's right-wing activism and the slew of gifts he's received from wealthy friends, and the impeachment efforts come after two senators asked Attorney General Merrick Garland to appoint a special counsel to investigate the justice last week. Criticism against Alito reached a fever pitch in May as reports came out regarding he and his wife's flag-flying, though the justice had also faced previous scrutiny over his travel with Singer and a New York Times report suggesting he may have leaked the court's 2014 decision in Burwell v. Hobby Lobby. (Alito has denied sharing the decision.) Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee have attempted to hold hearings on the ethics issues -- with Chief Justice John Roberts rebuffing their request for him to testify -- and pass legislation imposing a binding code of ethics on the court, like federal judges in lower courts already have to follow. Those efforts have failed as Republicans blocked the measures, and while the Supreme Court announced its own new code of ethics in November, ethics experts have criticized it for not going far enough, as it does not impose any consequences if the justices violate it.", "source": {"uri": "forbes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Forbes"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Alito", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Samuel Alito"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarence_Thomas", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Clarence Thomas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ethics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impeachment", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Impeachment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article_of_impeachment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Article of impeachment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandria_Ocasio-Cortez", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forbes", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Forbes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ginni_Thomas", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ginni Thomas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_impeachment_trial_of_Donald_Trump", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "First impeachment trial of Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Chase", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Samuel Chase"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coming_out", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coming out"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wall_Street_Journal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Wall Street Journal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Op-ed", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Op-ed"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Roberts", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "John Roberts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burwell_v._Hobby_Lobby_Stores,_Inc.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Burwell v.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-New York) filed articles of impeachment against Supreme Court Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito, in the boldest move yet to resolve the Court's \"unchecked corruption crisis\" as it radically reshapes the U.S. government in the image of the conservative justices' right-wing allies.\n\nOcasio-Cortez said that the two justices' transgressions represent \"one of the clearest cases for which the tool of impeachment was designed\" and must be reined in for the sake of U.S. democracy.\n\n\"Justice Thomas and Alito's repeated failure over decades to disclose that they received millions of dollars in gifts from individuals with business before the court is explicitly against the law. And their refusal to recuse from the specific matters and cases before the court in which their benefactors and spouses are implicated represents nothing less than a constitutional crisis,\" Ocasio-Cortez said in a statement.\n\n\"These failures alone would amount to a deep transgression worthy of standard removal in any lower court, and would disqualify any nominee to the highest court from confirmation in the first place,\" she continued. \"Congress has a legal, moral, and democratic obligation to impeach.\"\n\nThe lawmaker filed three articles against Thomas and two against Alito, levying charges against both of refusing to recuse from cases that represented conflicts of interest for the justices as well as failing to disclose gifts they have received from special interest donors over their decades on the bench.\n\nOcsaio-Cortez's impeachment articles are cosponsored by eight House members, including Representatives Rashida Tlaib (D-Michigan), Ilhan Omar (D-Minnesota) and Jamaal Bowman (D-New York). They are also endorsed by several court watchdog and progressive groups.\n\nRecent reports have revealed that Thomas and Alito have received millions of dollars' worth of gifts while on the bench that they either failed to disclose or, many argue, should never have accepted to begin with in accordance with ethics standards. The extent of the justices' largesse from conservative donors grows each time it's scrutinized, especially in the case of Thomas, who has received more gifts than every other justice combined in his time on the bench.\n\nIn combination with the Supreme Court's string of far right rulings in recent years -- and ties that justices have maintained to groups supporting arguments in the Court -- the revelations have made clear a deep level of corruption at the nation's top court at a time when it seeks to concentrate more and more power in itself.\n\nThe Republican-dominated House is unlikely to vote to impeach the justices. However, the filing is a show of the urgency of the legitimacy crisis that the Supreme Court is facing as the justices apparently seek to legislate from the bench.\n\nDemocrats in the Senate are also seeking accountability for Thomas. On Tuesday, Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on the Federal Courts Chair Sheldon Whitehouse (D-Rhode Island) and Finance Committee Chair Ron Wyden (D-Oregon) sent a letter urging the Department of Justice to open a criminal investigation into Thomas and his benefactors for potential ethics breaches, false statements and tax fraud.\n\nThe lawmakers laid out a mountain of evidence of Thomas's misdoings, saying that the fact that Thomas has received so many gifts over such a long period of time -- and the fact that lawmakers and reporters are seemingly constantly uncovering new undisclosed gifts -- could warrant the appointment of a special counsel to conduct the probe.\n\n\"The evidence assembled thus far plainly suggests that Justice Thomas has committed numerous willful violations of federal ethics and false-statement laws and raises significant questions about whether he and his wealthy benefactors have complied with their federal tax obligations,\" the lawmakers wrote. \"Presented with opportunities to resolve questions about his conduct, Justice Thomas has maintained a suspicious silence.\"", "source": {"uri": "therussophile.org", "dataType": "news", "title":

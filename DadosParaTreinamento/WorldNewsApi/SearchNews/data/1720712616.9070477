{"id": 232058464, "title": "First Case of Sexually Transmitted Fungal Infection Has Been Found in the U.S.", "text": "A first case of a highly contagious and rare sexually transmitted fungal infection has been found in the United States. The illness, Trichophyton mentagrophytes type VII (shortened to TMVII) is a type of ringworm that is not fatal but hard to treat. It was reported by the medical journal JAMA Dermatology on Wednesday, June 5. A man from New York City in his 30s developed the infection on his limbs, buttocks and genitals following a trip to England, Greece and California, the journal said. It added that the man said he had sex with several others while he was traveling, though none of the sexual partners reported having similar skin issues. After getting diagnosed, it took over four months for the man to completely heal with the help of anti-fungal medications, NBC News reported.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 13 cases of Trichophyton mentagrophytes type VII were reported in France in 2023. Twelve of the cases stemmed from men who had sexual contact with other men, the organization said. Although the fungal infection is not fatal, it can result in permanent scarring, per JAMA Dermatology. According to a press release from the NYU Grossman School of Medicine, Trichophyton mentagrophytes type VII can look like eczema, forming in a circular pattern. Due to its appearance, it could be ignored and remain untreated for months. The rashes can spread easily on \"face and limbs (ringworm), groin (jock itch), and feet (athlete\u2019s foot),\" NYU Langone said. Dr. Avrom Caplan, an assistant professor of dermatology at the NYU Grossman School of Medicine, believes that although the public should be aware of these types of infections, there is no evidence that they are widespread.", "summary": "Trichophyton mentagrophytes type VII is a type of ringworm that can look similar to eczema", "url": "https://people.com/first-case-of-sexually-transmitted-fungal-infection-is-found-in-us-8660338", "image": "https://people.com/thmb/JDMglsry1oYHHvkDv1paC1MYcvk=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(728x365:730x367)/Petri-Dish-060724-709104bc0c57481eb2b85af4fa1323be.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 16:00:00", "author": "Marina Watts", "authors": ["Marina Watts"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": -0.266}

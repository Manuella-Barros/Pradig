So maybe there's another spark he can find at Firestone Country Club.\n\n\"There's still a lot of golf on a hard course, but I know it's there,\" he said.\n\nHe also has a slew of players not far behind him in this World Golf Championship. Rory McIlroy put together a steady round of 69 and was three shots back, along with Zach Johnson and Hideki Matsuyama, who each shot 67.\n\nThe large group at 3-under 137 included Jordan Spieth, going after his third straight victory. Spieth missed a short par putt on the 15th and was slipping behind when he faced an awkward lie from the edge of a bunker . Stumbling out of the sand backward, he nearly holed the shot and made birdie, and then he stuffed his approach to 3 feet for birdie on the 18th hole to salvage a 70.\n\nJason Day, winless in nearly 15 months, also got back into the picture despite some mild back pain. He opened with three straight birdies and shot 30 on the front nine to get back near the leaders, though two bogeys on the back nine slowed him and he shot 66. He was in the group at 137.\n\n\"The front side definitely felt like 2015, 2016,\" Day said, alluding to his best stretch of golf when he rose to No. 1 in the world. \"I was just pouring in everything. I know that it's still in there. I've just got to keep practicing hard. I know it will eventually happen.\"\n\nDay felt he was slowed by the last -- and longest -- of the rain delays. He returned to three-putt the 10th for a bogey and never got back any momentum.\n\nIt was like that for everyone who slogged through a 10-hour day.\n\nThe second round was delayed 45 minutes at the start, and then another 45 minutes when a small band of storms rolled through. A delayed of some 3 1/2 hours followed, making it feel like two separate rounds and one long day.\n\nWalker still isn't out of the woods just yet. He first thought he had mononucleosis around the Masters, and it eventually was diagnosed as Lyme's disease. He has tried to muddle through the year when his energy allowed, though there hasn't been a lot of practice.\n\nAnd even a 65, which matched his low score of the year, wasn't smooth sailing.\n\n\"It's day to day,\" he said. \"I felt pretty good all week physically, and I wake up this morning and I've just got his overall flu feeling in my body. So I take some Advil, it goes away. And then during the last break, it came back, so I took some more. Now it's gone. You just never know when it's going to spike up.\"\n\nBut he felt good enough to make birdie on both par 3s on the back nine, and drop only one shot on the round.\n\nThe scoring has been good with the rain and softer greens, and a South course that was in pristine condition to start the tournament. A strong wind arrived after the storm cleared, which kept everyone's attention.\n\nOnly two dozen players from the 76-man field remained under par.\n\nAmong those who fell back was Dustin Johnson, the world's No. 1 player still trying to find his form from a back injury that knocked him out of the Masters. He hit only one green in regulation on the front nine -- 60 feet from the hole -- and shot 40. Johnson didn't make a single birdie in his round of 75 that knocked him 10 shots out of the lead heading into the final major of the year.", "eventUri": "eng-3338758", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2017-08-05", "title": "Walker managing fatigue, builds 2-shot lead at Firestone", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-05", "id": "15472520", "extractedDates": null, "storyUri": "eng-3338758", "time": "00:16:00", "details": {}, "concepts": [{"score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Belgium"}, "id": "19", "location": {"label": {"eng": "Belgium"}, "type": "country"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgium", "type": "loc"}, {"score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Akron, Ohio"}, "id": "218915", "location": {"label": {"eng": "Akron, Ohio"}, "country": {"label": {"eng": "United States of America"}, "type": "country"}, "type": "place"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akron,_Ohio", "type": "loc"}, {"score": 5, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "label": {"eng": "Golf"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "302727"}, {"score": 4, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rain", "label": {"eng": "Rain"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "303240"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain", "label": {"eng": "Pain"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "303798"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rose", "label": {"eng": "Rose"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "304660"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rory_McIlroy", "label": {"eng": "Rory McIlroy"}, "type": "person", "id": "305030"}, {"score": 4, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Championship", "label": {"eng": "PGA Championship"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "305035"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sand", "label": {"eng": "Sand"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "306742"}, {"score": 5, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Spieth", "label": {"eng": "Jordan Spieth"}, "type": "person", "id": "309234"}, {"score": 4, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatigue_(medical)", "label": {"eng": "Fatigue (medical)"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "314884"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibuprofen", "label": {"eng": "Ibuprofen"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "318295"}, {"score": 4, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Walker", "label": {"eng": "Jimmy Walker"}, "type": "person", "id": "319891"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infectious_mononucleosis", "label": {"eng": "Infectious mononucleosis"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "320475"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza", "label": {"eng": "Influenza"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "322533"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Day", "label": {"eng": "Jason Day"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "323028"}, {"score": 4, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Par_(score)", "label": {"eng": "Par (score)"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "325635"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masters_Tournament", "label": {"eng": "Masters Tournament"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "334530"}, {"score": 4, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyme_disease", "label": {"eng": "Lyme disease"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "339295"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltusrol_Golf_Club", "label": {"eng": "Baltusrol Golf Club"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "368899"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zach_Johnson", "label": {"eng": "Zach Johnson"}, "type": "person", "id": "382270"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_golf", "label": {"eng": "Glossary of golf"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "384710"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Open_(golf)", "label": {"eng": "Canadian Open (golf)"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "408079"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WGC-Bridgestone_Invitational", "label": {"eng": "NEC World Series of Golf"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "516499"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Pieters", "label": {"eng": "Thomas Pieters"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "523044"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Golf_Championships", "label": {"eng": "World Golf Championships"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "575701"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hideki_Matsuyama", "label": {"eng": "Hideki Matsuyama"}, "type": "person", "id": "659639"}], "url": "http://www.therepublic.com/2017/08/04/glf-bridgestone-invitational-3/", "timeCrawl": "00:16:00", "image": "http://d1bdhkmqqz901h.cloudfront.net/1200x630/smart/http://s3.amazonaws.com/new-smedia/2cc3244f04fc4421a79e6d0c31e682f6/8fb239703b8e461f963e1116951c3761.jpg", "location": {"label": {"eng": "Akron, Ohio"}, "country": {"label": {"eng": "United States of America"}, "type": "country"}, "type": "place"}, "dateTime": "2017-08-05T00:16:00Z", "originalArticle": null, "sim": 0.7764706015586853}

So maybe there's another spark he can find at Firestone Country Club.\n\n\"There's still a lot of golf on a hard course, but I know it's there,\" he said.\n\nHe also has a slew of players not far behind him in this World Golf Championship. Rory McIlroy put together a steady round of 69 and was three shots back, along with Zach Johnson and Hideki Matsuyama, who each shot 67.\n\nThe large group at 3-under 137 included Jordan Spieth, going after his third consecutive victory. Spieth missed a short par putt on the 15th and was slipping behind when he faced an awkward lie from the edge of a bunker. Stumbling out of the sand backward, he nearly holed the shot and made birdie, and then he stuffed his approach to 3 feet for birdie on the 18th hole to salvage a 70.\n\nJason Day, winless in nearly 15 months, also got back into the picture despite some mild back pain. He opened with three consecutive birdies and shot 30 on the front nine to get back near the leaders, though two bogeys on the back nine slowed him and he shot 66. He was in the group at 137.\n\n\"The front side definitely felt like 2015, 2016,\" Day said, alluding to his best stretch of golf when he rose to No. 1 in the world. \"I was just pouring in everything. I know that it's still in there. I've just got to keep practicing hard. I know it will eventually happen.\"\n\nDay felt he was slowed by the last -- and longest -- of the rain delays. He returned to three-putt the 10th for a bogey and never got back any momentum.\n\nIt was like that for everyone who slogged through a 10-hour day.\n\nThe second round was delayed 45 minutes at the start, and then another 45 minutes when a small band of storms rolled through. A delayed of some 3 1/2 hours followed, making it feel like two separate rounds and one long day.\n\nWalker still isn't out of the woods just yet. He first thought he had mononucleosis around the Masters, and it eventually was diagnosed as Lyme disease. He has tried to muddle through the year when his energy allowed, though there hasn't been a lot of practice.\n\nAnd even a 65, which matched his low score of the year, wasn't smooth sailing.\n\n\"It's day to day,\" he said. \"I felt pretty good all week physically, and I wake up this morning and I've just got this overall flu feeling in my body. So I take some Advil, it goes away. And then during the last break, it came back, so I took some more. Now it's gone. You just never know when it's going to spike up.\"\n\nBut he felt good enough to make birdie on both par 3s on the back nine, and drop only one shot on the round.\n\nThe scoring has been good with the rain and softer greens, and a South course that was in pristine condition to start the tournament. A strong wind arrived after the storm cleared, which kept everyone's attention.\n\nOnly two dozen players from the 76-man field remained under par.\n\nAmong those who fell back was Dustin Johnson, the world's No. 1 player still trying to find his form after a back injury that knocked him out of the Masters. He hit only one green in regulation on the front nine -- 60 feet from the hole -- and shot 40. Johnson didn't make a single birdie in his round of 75 that knocked him 10 shots out of the lead heading into the final major of the year.", "eventUri": "eng-3338758", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2017-08-05", "title": "Walker manages fatigue to build Bridgestone lead", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-05", "id": "15510215", "extractedDates": null, "storyUri": "eng-3338758", "time": "07:23:00", "details": {}, "concepts": [{"score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Belgium"}, "id": "19", "location": {"label": {"eng": "Belgium"}, "type": "country"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgium", "type": "loc"}, {"score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Akron, Ohio"}, "id": "218915", "location": {"label": {"eng": "Akron, Ohio"}, "country": {"label": {"eng": "United States of America"}, "type": "country"}, "type": "place"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akron,_Ohio", "type": "loc"}, {"score": 5, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "label": {"eng": "Golf"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "302727"}, {"score": 4, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rain", "label": {"eng": "Rain"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "303240"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain", "label": {"eng": "Pain"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "303798"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rose", "label": {"eng": "Rose"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "304660"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rory_McIlroy", "label": {"eng": "Rory McIlroy"}, "type": "person", "id": "305030"}, {"score": 4, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Championship", "label": {"eng": "PGA Championship"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "305035"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sand", "label": {"eng": "Sand"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "306742"}, {"score": 5, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Spieth", "label": {"eng": "Jordan Spieth"}, "type": "person", "id": "309234"}, {"score": 4, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatigue_(medical)", "label": {"eng": "Fatigue (medical)"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "314884"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibuprofen", "label": {"eng": "Ibuprofen"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "318295"}, {"score": 4, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Walker", "label": {"eng": "Jimmy Walker"}, "type": "person", "id": "319891"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infectious_mononucleosis", "label": {"eng": "Infectious mononucleosis"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "320475"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza", "label": {"eng": "Influenza"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "322533"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Day", "label": {"eng": "Jason Day"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "323028"}, {"score": 4, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Par_(score)", "label": {"eng": "Par (score)"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "325635"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masters_Tournament", "label": {"eng": "Masters Tournament"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "334530"}, {"score": 4, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyme_disease", "label": {"eng": "Lyme disease"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "339295"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltusrol_Golf_Club", "label": {"eng": "Baltusrol Golf Club"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "368899"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zach_Johnson", "label": {"eng": "Zach Johnson"}, "type": "person", "id": "382270"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_golf", "label": {"eng": "Glossary of golf"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "384710"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Open_(golf)", "label": {"eng": "Canadian Open (golf)"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "408079"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WGC-Bridgestone_Invitational", "label": {"eng": "NEC World Series of Golf"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "516499"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Pieters", "label": {"eng": "Thomas Pieters"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "523044"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Golf_Championships", "label": {"eng": "World Golf Championships"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "575701"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hideki_Matsuyama", "label": {"eng": "Hideki Matsuyama"}, "type": "person", "id": "659639"}], "url": "http://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2017/aug/05/walker-manages-fatigue-to-build-bridges/", "timeCrawl": "07:23:00", "image": "http://media.arkansasonline.com/img/photos/2017/08/04/resized_272427-7cjimmywalker2colxbw_93-23415_t600.jpg?4326734cdb8e39baa3579048ef63ad7b451e7676", "location": {"label": {"eng": "Akron, Ohio"}, "country": {"label": {"eng": "United States of America"}, "type": "country"}, "type": "place"}, "dateTime": "2017-08-05T07:23:00Z", "originalArticle": null, "sim": 0.7764706015586853}

So maybe there's another spark he can find at Firestone Country Club.\n\n\"There's still a lot of golf on a hard course, but I know it's there,\" he said.\n\nHe also has a slew of players not far behind him in this World Golf Championship. Rory McIlroy put together a steady round of 69 and was three shots back, along with Zach Johnson and Hideki Matsuyama, who each shot 67.\n\nThe large group at 3-under 137 included Jordan Spieth, going after his third straight victory. Spieth missed a short par putt on the 15th and was slipping behind when he faced an awkward lie from the edge of a bunker . Stumbling out of the sand backward, he nearly holed the shot and made birdie, and then he stuffed his approach to 3 feet for birdie on the 18th hole to salvage a 70.\n\nJason Day, winless in nearly 15 months, also got back into the picture despite some mild back pain. He opened with three straight birdies and shot 30 on the front nine to get back near the leaders, though two bogeys on the back nine slowed him and he shot 66. He was in the group at 137.\n\n\"The front side definitely felt like 2015, 2016,\" Day said, alluding to his best stretch of golf when he rose to No. 1 in the world. \"I was just pouring in everything. I know that it's still in there. I've just got to keep practicing hard. I know it will eventually happen.\"\n\nDay felt he was slowed by the last - and longest - of the rain delays. He returned to three-putt the 10th for a bogey and never got back any momentum.\n\nIt was like that for everyone who slogged through a 10-hour day.\n\nThe second round was delayed 45 minutes at the start, and then another 45 minutes when a small band of storms rolled through. A delayed of some 3 1/2 hours followed, making it feel like two separate rounds and one long day.\n\nWalker still isn't out of the woods just yet. He first thought he had mononucleosis around the Masters, and it eventually was diagnosed as Lyme's disease. He has tried to muddle through the year when his energy allowed, though there hasn't been a lot of practice.\n\nAnd even a 65, which matched his low score of the year, wasn't smooth sailing.\n\n\"It's day to day,\" he said. \"I felt pretty good all week physically, and I wake up this morning and I've just got his overall flu feeling in my body. So I take some Advil, it goes away. And then during the last break, it came back, so I took some more. Now it's gone. You just never know when it's going to spike up.\"\n\nBut he felt good enough to make birdie on both par 3s on the back nine, and drop only one shot on the round.\n\nThe scoring has been good with the rain and softer greens, and a South course that was in pristine condition to start the tournament. A strong wind arrived after the storm cleared, which kept everyone's attention.\n\nOnly two dozen players from the 76-man field remained under par.\n\nAmong those who fell back was Dustin Johnson, the world's No. 1 player still trying to find his form from a back injury that knocked him out of the Masters. He hit only one green in regulation on the front nine - 60 feet from the hole - and shot 40. Johnson didn't make a single birdie in his round of 75 that knocked him 10 shots out of the lead heading into the final major of the year.\n\nCopyright 2017 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

So maybe there's another spark he can find at Firestone Country Club.\n\n\"There's still a lot of golf on a hard course, but I know it's there,\" he said.\n\nHe also has a slew of players not far behind him in this World Golf Championship. Rory McIlroy put together a steady round of 69 and was three shots back, along with Zach Johnson and Hideki Matsuyama, who each shot 67.\n\nTopeka native Gary Woodland shot a 77 and dropped to 75th, one spot ahead of Billy Horschel for last place.\n\nThe large group at 3-under 137 included Jordan Spieth, going after his third straight victory. Spieth missed a short par putt on the 15th and was slipping behind when he faced an awkward lie from the edge of a bunker. Stumbling out of the sand backward, he nearly holed the shot and made birdie, and then he stuffed his approach to 3 feet for birdie on the 18th hole to salvage a 70.\n\nJason Day, winless in nearly 15 months, also got back into the picture despite some mild back pain. He opened with three straight birdies and shot 30 on the front nine to get back near the leaders, though two bogeys on the back nine slowed him and he shot 66. He was in the group at 137.\n\n\"The front side definitely felt like 2015, 2016,\" Day said, alluding to his best stretch of golf when he rose to No. 1 in the world. \"I was just pouring in everything. I know that it's still in there. I've just got to keep practicing hard. I know it will eventually happen.\"\n\nDay felt he was slowed by the last -- and longest -- of the rain delays. He returned to three-putt the 10th for a bogey and never got back any momentum.\n\nIt was like that for everyone who slogged through a 10-hour day.\n\nThe second round was delayed 45 minutes at the start, and then another 45 minutes when a small band of storms rolled through. A delayed of some 3 1/2 hours followed, making it feel like two separate rounds and one long day.\n\nWalker still isn't out of the woods just yet. He first thought he had mononucleosis around the Masters, and it eventually was diagnosed as Lyme's disease. He has tried to muddle through the year when his energy allowed, though there hasn't been a lot of practice.\n\nAnd even a 65, which matched his low score of the year, wasn't smooth sailing.\n\n\"It's day to day,\" he said. \"I felt pretty good all week physically, and I wake up this morning and I've just got his overall flu feeling in my body. So I take some Advil, it goes away. And then during the last break, it came back, so I took some more. Now it's gone. You just never know when it's going to spike up.\"\n\nBut he felt good enough to make birdie on both par 3s on the back nine, and drop only one shot on the round.\n\nThe scoring has been good with the rain and softer greens, and a South course that was in pristine condition to start the tournament. A strong wind arrived after the storm cleared, which kept everyone's attention.\n\nOnly two dozen players from the 76-man field remained under par.\n\nAmong those who fell back was Dustin Johnson, the world's No. 1 player still trying to find his form from a back injury that knocked him out of the Masters. He hit only one green in regulation on the front nine -- 60 feet from the hole -- and shot 40. Johnson didn't make a single birdie in his round of 75 that knocked him 10 shots out of the lead heading into the final major of the year.", "eventUri": "eng-3338758", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2017-08-05", "title": "Walker builds 2-shot lead at Bridgestone", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-05", "id": "15476515", "extractedDates": null, "storyUri": "eng-3338758", "time": "01:01:00", "details": {}, "concepts": [{"score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Belgium"}, "id": "19", "location": {"label": {"eng": "Belgium"}, "type": "country"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgium", "type": "loc"}, {"score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Akron, Ohio"}, "id": "218915", "location": {"label": {"eng": "Akron, Ohio"}, "country": {"label": {"eng": "United States of America"}, "type": "country"}, "type": "place"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akron,_Ohio", "type": "loc"}, {"score": 5, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "label": {"eng": "Golf"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "302727"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain", "label": {"eng": "Pain"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "303798"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rory_McIlroy", "label": {"eng": "Rory McIlroy"}, "type": "person", "id": "305030"}, {"score": 4, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Championship", "label": {"eng": "PGA Championship"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "305035"}, {"score": 5, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Spieth", "label": {"eng": "Jordan Spieth"}, "type": "person", "id": "309234"}, {"score": 4, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatigue_(medical)", "label": {"eng": "Fatigue (medical)"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "314884"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibuprofen", "label": {"eng": "Ibuprofen"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "318295"}, {"score": 4, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Walker", "label": {"eng": "Jimmy Walker"}, "type": "person", "id": "319891"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infectious_mononucleosis", "label": {"eng": "Infectious mononucleosis"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "320475"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza", "label": {"eng": "Influenza"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "322533"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Day", "label": {"eng": "Jason Day"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "323028"}, {"score": 4, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Par_(score)", "label": {"eng": "Par (score)"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "325635"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masters_Tournament", "label": {"eng": "Masters Tournament"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "334530"}, {"score": 4, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyme_disease", "label": {"eng": "Lyme disease"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "339295"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltusrol_Golf_Club", "label": {"eng": "Baltusrol Golf Club"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "368899"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zach_Johnson", "label": {"eng": "Zach Johnson"}, "type": "person", "id": "382270"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_golf", "label": {"eng": "Glossary of golf"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "384710"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Open_(golf)", "label": {"eng": "Canadian Open (golf)"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "408079"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Woodland", "label": {"eng": "Gary Woodland"}, "type": "person", "id": "425992"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billy_Horschel", "label": {"eng": "Billy Horschel"}, "type": "person", "id": "456077"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WGC-Bridgestone_Invitational", "label": {"eng": "NEC World Series of Golf"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "516499"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Pieters", "label": {"eng": "Thomas Pieters"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "523044"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Golf_Championships", "label": {"eng": "World Golf Championships"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "575701"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firestone_Country_Club", "label": {"eng": "Firestone Country Club"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "608245"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hideki_Matsuyama", "label": {"eng": "Hideki Matsuyama"}, "type": "person", "id": "659639"}], "url": "http://cjonline.com/sports/2017-08-04/walker-builds-2-shot-lead-bridgestone", "timeCrawl": "01:01:00", "image": "http://cjonline.com/sites/default/files/cjonline-logo.png", "location": {"label": {"eng": "Akron, Ohio"}, "country": {"label": {"eng": "United States of America"}, "type": "country"}, "type": "place"}, "dateTime": "2017-08-05T01:01:00Z", "originalArticle": null, "sim": 0.7647058963775635}

So maybe there's another spark he can find at Firestone Country Club.\n\n\"There's still a lot of golf on a hard course, but I know it's there,\" he said.\n\nHe also has a slew of players not far behind him in this World Golf Championship. Rory McIlroy put together a steady round of 69 and was three shots back, along with Zach Johnson and Hideki Matsuyama, who each shot 67.\n\nThe large group at three-under 137 included Jordan Spieth, going after his third straight victory. Spieth missed a short par putt on the 15th and was slipping behind when he faced an awkward lie from the edge of a bunker. Stumbling out of the sand backward, he nearly holed the shot and made birdie, and then he stuffed his approach to within three feet for birdie on the 18th hole to salvage a 70.\n\nJason Day, winless in nearly 15 months, also got back into the picture despite some mild back pain. He opened with three straight birdies and shot 30 on the front nine to get back near the leaders, though two bogeys on the back nine slowed him and he shot 66. He was in the group at 137.\n\nI.K. Kim leads Women's British Open\n\nI.K. Kim, the best player in women's golf right now, emerged from the cold and wet with a 4-under 68 to build a two-shot lead in the Women's British Open going into the weekend.\n\nA two-time winner on the LPGA Tour over the last two months, Kim dropped only one shot in some of the worst conditions at Kingsbarns Links and reached the halfway point at 11-under 133. She was two shots clear of Lexi Thompson and Georgia Hall of England.\n\nKim displayed a remarkable fortitude in weather that veered erratically toward the end of the day between bright sunshine and torrential downpours. The 29-year-old from South Korea atoned for her lone bogey with three birdies and an eagle on the 538-yard 11th hole.\n\nPerhaps the most significant move came from Thompson, the No. 2 player in the world. Two-over par and birdie-free after nine-holes, the big-hitting Floridian played the homeward nine in 30 with six birdies -- five in succession. In addition, she found time to add a new phrase to golf's already voluminous terminology.\n\nFirst-round leader Michelle Wie did not fare so well. The 27-year old American made only one birdie in a 76 that leaves her seven shots off the pace and in a tie for 21st. Wie has not won since the 2014 U.S. Women's Open at Pinehurst No. 2.\n\nPerry's 65 good for a share of the lead\n\nTwo-time tournament winner Kenny Perry shot a seven-under 65 to hold a share of the lead after the first round of the PGA Tour Champions event just outside of Minneapolis-St. Paul.\n\nPerry, who won in Minnesota in 2014 and 2015, opened his round with six consecutive birdies. He finished with another one to join Mike Goodes atop the leaderboard at TPC Twin Cities.\n\nScott Verplank, Marco Dawson, Gene Sauers and Jay Haas finished at six-under. Steve Flesch and Colin Montgomerie were among the golfers to card 67s. Brandt Jobe leads a host of golfers who shot opening-round 68s, three shots off the lead.", "eventUri": "eng-3338758", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2017-08-05", "title": "Golf roundup: Jimmy Walker

So maybe there's another spark he can find at Firestone Country Club.\n\n\"There's still a lot of golf on a hard course, but I know it's there,\" he said.\n\nHe also has a slew of players not far behind him in this World Golf Championship. Rory McIlroy put together a steady round of 69 and was three shots back, along with Zach Johnson and Hideki Matsuyama, who each shot 67.\n\nThe large group at 3-under 137 included Jordan Spieth, going after his third straight victory. Spieth missed a short par putt on the 15th and was slipping behind when he faced an awkward lie from the edge of a bunker . Stumbling out of the sand backward, he nearly holed the shot and made birdie, and then he stuffed his approach to 3 feet for birdie on the 18th hole to salvage a 70.\n\nJason Day, winless in nearly 15 months, also got back into the picture despite some mild back pain. He opened with three straight birdies and shot 30 on the front nine to get back near the leaders, though two bogeys on the back nine slowed him and he shot 66. He was in the group at 137.\n\nI.K. Kim Takes charge at British Open\n\nST. ANDREWS, Scotland -- I.K. Kim, the best player in women's golf right now, emerged from the cold and wet with a 4-under 68 to build a two-shot lead in the Women's British Open going into the weekend.\n\nA two-time winner on the LPGA Tour over the last two months, Kim dropped only one shot in some of the worst conditions at Kingsbarns Links and reached the halfway point at 11-under 133. She was two shots clear of Lexi Thompson and Georgia Hall of England.\n\nKim displayed a remarkable fortitude in weather that veered erratically toward the end of the day between bright sunshine and torrential downpours. The 29-year-old from South Korea atoned for her lone bogey with three birdies and an eagle on the 538-yard 11th hole.\n\nBLAINE, Minn. -- Two-time tournament winner Kenny Perry shot a 7-under 65 to hold a share of the lead after the first round of the PGA Tour Champions event just outside of Minneapolis-St. Paul.\n\nPerry, who won in Minnesota in 2014 and 2015, opened his round with six consecutive birdies. He finished with another one to join Mike Goodes atop the leaderboard at TPC Twin Cities.\n\nScott Verplank, Marco Dawson, Gene Sauers and Jay Haas finished at 6-under. Steve Flesch and Colin Montgomerie were among the golfers to card 67s.\n\nBrandt Jobe leads a host of golfers who shot opening-round 68s, three shots off the lead.", "eventUri": "eng-3338758",

He later suffered from the effects, pulling tee shots left into trees and rough, and made his way gingerly to the finish.\n\nWalker is winless this season and has struggled since being diagnosed with Lyme disease in April. He has been unable to make an impact at the big events, finishing tied for 54th at the British Open, tied for 56th at The Players and missing the cut at the U.S. Open.\n\nThe Texan said it had been a very long day, beginning two hours early in hopes of getting done ahead of expected thunderstorms, but just what he needed.\n\n\"It did feel like a marathon, but was a great day. Played solid, hit it well, made some putts,\" said Walker, who has been plagued by bouts of fatigue among other disease symptoms.\n\n\"It's just important for me to have a good week. I haven't had too many this year.\"\n\nWalker took the lead with a birdie following one of his trademark, high-arcing iron shots that landed two feet from the cup at the par-three 12th.\n\n\"It's been kind of rough. Things have been trending, I feel like, and hopefully it's shades of things to come,\" he said.\n\n\"It's still there,\" he said of the effect of the Lyme disease. \"I still deal with it. It's better than it was, but it's still there. It affects different parts of your daily life. I just keep plugging away.\"\n\nFor all the latest Sports News, download Indian Express App", "eventUri": "eng-3338758", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2017-08-05", "title": "Jimmy Walker strides into

So maybe there's another spark he can find at Firestone Country Club.\n\n\"There's still a lot of golf on a hard course, but I know it's there,\" he said.\n\nHe also has a slew of players not far behind him in this World Golf Championship. Rory McIlroy put together a steady round of 69 and was three shots back, along with Zach Johnson and Hideki Matsuyama, who each shot 67.\n\nThe large group at 3-under 137 included Jordan Spieth, going after his third straight victory. Spieth missed a short par putt on the 15th and was slipping behind when he faced an awkward lie from the edge of a bunker. Stumbling out of the sand backward, he nearly holed the shot and made birdie, and then he stuffed his approach to 3 feet for birdie on the 18th hole to salvage a 70.\n\nST. ANDREWS, Scotland -- I.K. Kim, the best player in women's golf, emerged from the cold and wet with a 4-under 68 to build a two-shot lead in the Women's British Open going into the weekend.\n\nA two-time winner on the LPGA Tour over the last two months, Kim dropped only one shot in some of the worst conditions at Kingsbarns Links and reached the halfway point at 11-under 133. She was two shots clear of Lexi Thompson and Georgia Hall.\n\nPerhaps the most significant move came from Thompson, the No. 2 player in the world.\n\nTwo-over par and birdie-free after nine-holes, the big-hitting Floridian played the homeward nine in 30 with six birdies -- five in succession. She found time to add a new phrase to golf's voluminous terminology.\n\n\"I ball-striked it out there,\" she said. That was fair enough, if grammatically flawed. The eight-time winner struck her shots with an authority few in the women's game can match.\n\nFirst-round leader Michelle Wie made only one birdie in a 76 that leaves her seven shots off the pace and in a tie for 21st with two rounds remaining.\n\nBLAINE, Minn. -- Two-time tournament winner Kenny Perry shot a 7-under 65 to hold a share of the lead after the first round of the PGA Tour Champions event just outside of Minneapolis-St. Paul.\n\nPerry, who won the 3M Championship in 2014 and 2015, opened at TPC Twin Cities with six straight birdies. He finished with another one to join Mike Goodes atop the leaderboard.\n\nScott Verplank, Marco Dawson, Gene Sauers and Jay Haas finished at 6-under. Steve Flesch, Colin Montgomerie and Brandt Jobe were among the golfers to card 67s.\n\nPerry, who won the U.S. Senior Open this season by two shots, finished his front nine Friday at 7-under 29.\n\nHAYWARD, Calif. -- Stephen Curry was certain to miss the cut against professional golfers one notch below the PGA Tour.\n\nBut not before leaving some of golf's best players impressed that a two-time MVP for the Golden State Warriors could enter their arena and look respectable.\n\nCurry opened with a 4-over 74 on the TPC Stonebrae and needed a career round to stay for the weekend on the Web.com Tour. Instead, he shot 39 on the front nine Friday. He was 8 over for the tournament with six holes to play and was well below the projected cut at the Ellie Mae Classic.\n\n\"That was awesome what he did [Thursday],\" British Open champion Jordan Spieth said Friday at the Bridgestone Invitational. \"I think he certainly beat most everybody's expectations, but I don't think that really surprised him. It was pretty cool -- really cool -- to see. You see him fist-pumping out there, and just him talking about how nervous he was when he heard his name called, it just makes us feel a little better when sometimes some of the stuff he does looks like a robot.\"\n\nOne of the highlights for Curry in the opening round was a long birdie putt and telling his caddie to \"Go get that\" from the cup. That was the line Spieth said to his caddie at Royal Birkdale two weeks ago after a 50-foot eagle putt to take the lead.\n\n\"I think it's pretty special for a two-time MVP to be able to shoot 74 at a pro event and beat other pros,\" former PGA champion Jason Day said.", "eventUri": "eng-3338758", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2017-08-05", "title": "Golf roundup: Walker builds two-shot lead at

Justin Rose shot a 69 but is one over par for the tournament.\n\nLast year's Masters champion Danny Willett's miserable form continued as he added a 74 to his 76, leaving him on 10 over par.\n\nFormer World No.1 Jason Day of Australia had earlier outshone playing partners Open champion Jordan Spieth and McIlroy as a four-under round saw him finish on three under par.\n\nDay - who will have one eye on the US PGA next week, which he won in 2015 - had managed to birdie the first hole in that time and carried on where he left off when play resumed, picking up shots on the second, third, fifth and ninth to cover the front nine in 30, despite appearing in some discomfort due to a back problem.\n\nThat took the 29-year-old Australian to four under par and just a shot off the lead shared by Walker and Pieters, but as Day, Spieth and McIlroy prepared to play their second shots to the 10th, the siren sounded to suspend play once again.\n\nSpieth, who is seeking his third win in succession after victories in the Travelers Championship and Open Championship, had also birdied the par-five second but carded three bogeys and a birdie in a four-hole stretch from the fourth to lie two under.\n\nBefore the first suspension Knox had surged into a two-shot lead thanks to birdies on the first three holes, but the 32-year-old Scot bogeyed the fifth and seventh when play resumed. A birdie on the ninth took Knox, who won the WGC-HSBC Champions in November 2015, out in 33, only for further dropped shots on the 11th and 12th to leave him alongside Day on four under.\n\nMeanwhile, Basketball star Stephen Curry played a solid opening round at the Ellie Mae Classic.\n\nThe Golden State Warriors guard took time out of the NBA off-season when he accepted a sponsor's invitation to play in the event and carded a respectable four over par 74.\n\nAfter a round which included three birdies, five bogeys and one double bogey at TPC San Francisco Bay, the 29-year-old told reporters afterwards: \"It was an amazing experience.\n\n\"I've been looking forward to this and to finally hit my first shot in tournament play was a really, really nervous moment - but it was everything that I hoped for.\n\n\"As soon as he said my name on the first tee I could barely feel my hands, I had to try to take a deep breath.\n\n\"I don't think I could prepare myself for that moment but after the third or fourth hole it was golf as normal for me, just try to hit some good shots.\n\n\"If you told me I was going to shoot 74 going into the first round, I would take that all day, every day.\n\n\"I'm happy with it.

(AP Photo/Tony Dejak)\n\n\"It hadn't been a lot of fun this year,\" Walker said. \"But it's nice to see some putts go in and make some solid swings and keep rounds going, make par putts, just the stuff I haven't been doing.\"\n\nHe was at 7-under 133, two shots ahead of Thomas Pieters of Belgium, who had a 70.\n\nWalker didn't have a lot going last year until he finished well in the Canadian Open, and then went wire-to-wire at Baltusrol the next week to win the PGA Championship.

Rory McIlroy put together a steady round of 69 and was three shots back, along with Zach Johnson and Hideki Matsuyama, who each shot 67.\n\nThe large group at 3-under 137 included Jordan Spieth, going after his third straight victory. Spieth missed a short par putt on the 15th and was slipping behind when he faced an awkward lie from the edge of a bunker . Stumbling out of the sand backward, he nearly holed the shot and made birdie, and then he stuffed his approach to 3 feet for birdie on the 18th hole to salvage a 70.\n\nJason Day, winless in nearly 15 months, also got back into the picture despite some mild back pain. He opened with three straight birdies and shot 30 on the front nine to get back near the leaders, though two bogeys on the back nine slowed him and he shot 66. He was in the group at 137.\n\n\"The front side definitely felt like 2015, 2016,\" Day said, alluding to his best stretch of golf when he rose to No. 1 in the world. \"I was just pouring in everything. I know that it's still in there. I've just got to keep practicing hard. I know it will eventually happen.\"\n\nDay felt he was slowed by the last - and longest - of the rain delays. He returned to three-putt the 10th for a bogey and never got back any momentum.\n\nIt was like that for everyone who slogged through a 10-hour day.\n\nThe second round was delayed 45 minutes at the start, and then another 45 minutes when a small band of storms rolled through. A delayed of some 3 1/2 hours followed, making it feel like two separate rounds and one long day.\n\nWalker still isn't out of the woods just yet. He first thought he had mononucleosis around the Masters, and it eventually was diagnosed as Lyme's disease. He has tried to muddle through the year when his energy allowed, though there hasn't been a lot of practice.\n\nAnd even a 65, which matched his low score of the year, wasn't smooth sailing.\n\n\"It's day to day,\" he said. \"I felt pretty good all week physically, and I wake up this morning and I've just got his overall flu feeling in my body. So I take some Advil, it goes away. And then during the last break, it came back, so I took some more. Now it's gone. You just never know when it's going to spike up.\"\n\nBut he felt good enough to make birdie on both par 3s on the back nine, and drop only one shot on the round.\n\nThe scoring has been good with the rain and softer greens, and a South course that was in pristine condition to start the tournament. A strong wind arrived after the storm cleared, which kept everyone's attention.\n\nOnly two dozen players from the 76-man field remained under par.\n\nAmong those who fell back was Dustin Johnson, the world's No. 1 player still trying to find his form from a back injury that knocked him out of the Masters. He hit only one green in regulation on the front nine - 60 feet from the hole - and shot 40. Johnson didn't make a single birdie in his round of 75 that knocked him 10 shots out of the lead heading into the final major of the year.\n\nJimmy Walker reacts after missing a birdie putt on the 16th hole during the second round of the Bridgestone Invitational golf tournament at Firestone Country Club, Friday, Aug. 4, 2017, in Akron, Ohio.

Walker was tied for ninth with a 68 after Round 1 but roared back Friday with four birdies in his first nine holes (Nos. 2, 3, 5 and 8).

The long day satisfied Walker, who is battling Lyme Disease.\n\n\"The [Lyme Disease] is still there but better than it was,\" Walker said. \"It affects parts of your life but I will continue to plug away. [Round 2] did feel like a marathon but it was a great day because I was solid when I hit some putts.\"\n\nWalker won the PGA Championship in New Jersey last year. It was his first victory in a major in his career. Walker, who won the event by one stroke over Jason Day, will get a chance to defend that title next week.\n\n\"Hopefully this is a [preview] of things to come,\" Walker said. \"It's real important. I mean, it hadn't been a lot of fun this year. I had a few okay finishes, a lot of 30th, high 20s, just stuff that's not moving me around. But it's nice to see some putts go in and make some solid swings and keep rounds going, make some par putts, just the stuff I haven't been doing.\"\n\nPieters started the second round with a one-shot lead over Russell Knox, but an even par 70 on Friday slipped him to No. 2 at 135.\n\n\"I played decent,\" Pieters said. \"I hit plenty of greens, I think a bit less than yesterday.

Missed a couple short ones on 17 and 18, but rolling the putter nicely, so looking forward to this weekend.\"\n\nJordan Spieth and Jason Day, playing in a threesome with McIlroy, are tied with Charley Hoffman, Adam Hadwin, Alex Noren and Knox at 4-under.\n\nSaturday's third round is scheduled to start at 7:50 a.m. Walker and Pieters are the final pairing, scheduled to tee off at 2 p.m.", "eventUri": "eng-3338758", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2017-08-05", "title": "Jimmy Walker takes lead with solid second round at WGC-Bridgestone Invitational 2017: (photos, video)", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-05", "id": "15472460", "extractedDates": null, "storyUri": "eng-3338758", "time": "00:09:00", "details": {}, "concepts": [{"score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New Jersey"}, "id": "216558", "location": {"label": {"eng": "New Jersey"}, "country": {"label": {"eng": "United States of America"}, "type": "country"}, "type": "place"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey", "type": "loc"}, {"score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Akron, Ohio"}, "id": "218915", "location": {"label": {"eng": "Akron, Ohio"}, "country": {"label": {"eng": "United States of America"}, "type": "country"}, "type": "place"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akron,_Ohio", "type": "loc"}, {"score": 4, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rory_McIlroy", "label": {"eng": "Rory McIlroy"}, "type": "person", "id": "305030"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Championship", "label": {"eng": "PGA Championship"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "305035"}, {"score": 1, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Spieth", "label": {"eng": "Jordan Spieth"}, "type": "person", "id": "309234"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Walker", "label": {"eng": "Jimmy Walker"}, "type": "person", "id": "319891"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Day", "label": {"eng": "Jason Day"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "323028"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyme_disease", "label": {"eng": "Lyme disease"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "339295"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zach_Johnson", "label": {"eng": "Zach Johnson"}, "type": "person", "id": "382270"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_Knox", "label": {"eng": "Russell Knox"}, "type": "person", "id": "502131"}, {"score": 4, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WGC-Bridgestone_Invitational", "label": {"eng": "NEC World Series of Golf"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "516499"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Pieters", "label": {"eng": "Thomas Pieters"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "523044"}, {"score": 4, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firestone_Country_Club", "label": {"eng": "Firestone Country Club"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "608245"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hideki_Matsuyama", "label": {"eng": "Hideki Matsuyama"}, "type": "person", "id": "659639"}], "url": "http://www.cleveland.com/golf/index.ssf/2017/08/jimmy_walker_wgc_bridgestone_invitational_2017.html", "timeCrawl": "00:15:00", "image": "http://image.cleveland.com/home/cleve-media/width620/img/plain-dealer/photo/2017/08/04/23182037-large.jpg", "location": {"label": {"eng": "Akron, Ohio"}, "country": {"label": {"eng": "United States of America"}, "type": "country"}, "type": "place"}, "dateTime": "2017-08-05T00:09:00Z", "originalArticle": null, "sim": 0.6745098233222961}

For Jordan Spieth, it was more of the same with two long putts and another comment filled with bravado directed at his caddie.\n\nBoth of them opened with a 3-under 67 at the Bridgestone Invitational, leaving them two shots behind Thomas Pieters of Belgium.\n\nPieters, playing only for the sixth time since he challenged briefly at the Masters this year, holed a 30-foot birdie putt on his final hole at Firestone to finish a day of good scoring with a one-shot lead over Russell Knox.\n\nThe opening two rounds were moved up to the morning because of a forecast of thunderstorms in the afternoon.\n\nMcIlroy split with J.P. Fitzgerald, his caddie of nine years, after the British Open. He decided to use Harry Diamond, who played amateur golf for Ireland and was the best man at McIlroy's wedding, for the Bridgestone Invitational and the PGA Championship next week.\n\nIt didn't have much bearing on McIlroy's game, which was fine. McIlroy won at Firestone the last time he played it in 2014.\n\n\"We both did the numbers and I sort of consulted him a couple of times. Yeah, it was good,\" McIlroy said. \"There was a couple of shots that I hit or a couple of clubs that I pulled that I maybe should have just thought a little bit more about.\"\n\nOne of them was at No. 9, his last hole, when he went some 50 feet long on his approach and three-putted for bogey. Even so, it was a solid start, and that's what has held back McIlroy in recent months when he missed three cuts in four tournaments, and then started poorly at the British Open.\n\nSpieth has no such concerns, having won two consecutive events going into this World Golf Championship with an eye toward next week at the PGA Championship and his shot at becoming the youngest player to complete the Grand Slam.\n\nWinning a major turned this into a great year for Spieth, regardless of what happens at the PGA Championship.\n\nHe said he is feeling as good as ever about his game, particularly the way he finished off Royal Birkdale with the amazing escape on the 13th hole and the birdie-eagle-birdie-birdie stretch that followed.\n\nThe opening round was no place to lose ground in such good scoring conditions. Dustin Johnson did his part with a 68.\n\nHe hasn't won since the Match Play just two weeks before his staircase injury that knocked him out of the Masters.\n\nJohnson only wants to give himself a chance to win, and he said all the parts are in working order for that.", "eventUri": "eng-3338758", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2017-08-04", "title": "Pieters leads Bridgestone Invitational by stroke", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-04", "id": "15400274", "extractedDates": null, "storyUri": "eng-3338758", "time": "16:08:00", "details": {}, "concepts": [{"score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Belgium"}, "id": "19", "location": {"label": {"eng": "Belgium"}, "type": "country"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgium", "type": "loc"}, {"score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States of America"}, "id": "233", "location": {"label": {"eng": "United States of America"}, "type": "country"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc"}, {"score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}, "id": "112932", "location": null, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland", "type": "loc"}, {"score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Akron, Ohio"}, "id": "218915", "location": {"label": {"eng": "Akron, Ohio"}, "country": {"label": {"eng": "United States of America"}, "type": "country"}, "type": "place"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akron,_Ohio", "type": "loc"}, {"score": 4, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "label": {"eng": "Golf"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "302727"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "304427"}, {"score": 5, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rory_McIlroy", "label": {"eng": "Rory McIlroy"}, "type": "person", "id": "305030"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Championship", "label": {"eng": "PGA Championship"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "305035"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Open_Championship", "label": {"eng": "The Open Championship"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "305039"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wedding", "label": {"eng": "Wedding"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "305401"}, {"score": 1, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dustin_Johnson", "label": {"eng": "Dustin Johnson"}, "type": "person", "id": "306252"}, {"score": 5, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Spieth", "label": {"eng": "Jordan Spieth"}, "type": "person", "id": "309234"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masters_Tournament", "label": {"eng": "Masters Tournament"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "334530"}, {"score": 4, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caddy", "label": {"eng": "Caddy"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "376875"}, {"score": 4, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firestone_Tire_and_Rubber_Company", "label": {"eng": "Firestone Tire and Rubber Company"}, "type": "org", "id": "446232"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_Knox", "label": {"eng": "Russell Knox"}, "type": "person", "id": "502131"}, {"score": 4, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WGC-Bridgestone_Invitational", "label": {"eng": "NEC World Series of Golf"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "516499"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Pieters", "label": {"eng": "Thomas Pieters"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "523044"}, {"score": 1, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Birkdale_Golf_Club", "label": {"eng": "Royal Birkdale Golf Club"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "528058"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Golf_Championships", "label": {"eng": "World Golf Championships"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "575701"}], "url": "http://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2017/aug/04/pieters-leads-bridgestone-invitational-stroke/", "timeCrawl": "16:08:00", "image": "http://media.arkansasonline.com/img/photos/2017/08/03/resized_250499-6cthomaspietersmugxcolorbw_83-23411_t600.jpg?4326734cdb8e39baa3579048ef63ad7b451e7676", "location": {"label": {"eng": "Akron, Ohio"}, "country": {"label": {"eng": "United States of America"}, "type": "country"}, "type": "place"}, "dateTime": "2017-08-04T16:08:00Z", "originalArticle": null, "sim": 0.6549019813537598}

Indeed, by the time McIlroy and playing partners Jason Day and Jordan Spieth finished their second rounds it was almost 10 hours since they originally teed off.\n\nIt was a similar story on the back nine and, by the end of the round, he had hit drives of over 300 yards at every hole bar the par threes.\n\nIf only the approach play - particularly with the wedges - was as impressive.\n\nFrustration proved the order of the back nine as McIlroy had to settle for mid-range birdie putts, many of which shaved the hole and stayed out. However, as he pointed to after the British Open at Birkdale, his putting looks much improved and, if the approach play can give some better opportunities of birdies at the weekend, he could well be lifting his second Bridgestone Invitational title.\n\nHis solitary birdie came at the par five 16th and didn't even require the putter as he chipped in from over the back of the green to get to four under.\n\nIt was at that mark he would finish but remains well in contention on the tough Firestone layout.\n\nMcIlroy sits alongside Hideki Matsuyama and Zach Johnson in a tie for third with Thomas Pieters one shot better off and two behind leader Jimmy Walker who fired six birdies on his way to a round of 65.\n\nOne behind McIlroy lies playing partners Spieth and Day after contrasting rounds. Open champion Spieth had to show all of his battling qualities to finish with consecutive birdies for a level par 70 while Day threatened a course record at one stage.\n\nNursing a problematic back the Australian blitzed the front nine in just 30 strokes before stalling somewhat on the way in the eventually sign for a 66.", "eventUri": "eng-3338758", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2017-08-05", "title": "Rory McIlroy lurking dangerously after marathon day at Firestone", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-05", "id": "15472695", "extractedDates": null, "storyUri": "eng-3338758", "time": "00:17:00", "details": {}, "concepts": [{"score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Akron, Ohio"}, "id": "218915", "location": {"label": {"eng": "Akron, Ohio"}, "country": {"label": {"eng": "United States of America"}, "type": "country"}, "type": "place"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akron,_Ohio", "type": "loc"}, {"score": 5, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rory_McIlroy", "label": {"eng": "Rory McIlroy"}, "type": "person", "id": "305030"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Open_Championship", "label": {"eng": "The Open Championship"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "305039"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Spieth", "label": {"eng": "Jordan Spieth"}, "type": "person", "id": "309234"}, {"score": 1, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Walker", "label": {"eng": "Jimmy Walker"}, "type": "person", "id": "319891"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Day", "label": {"eng": "Jason Day"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "323028"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Par_(score)", "label": {"eng": "Par (score)"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "325635"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caddy", "label": {"eng": "Caddy"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "376875"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zach_Johnson", "label": {"eng": "Zach Johnson"}, "type": "person", "id": "382270"}, {"score": 5, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Par_(score)#Birdie", "label": {"eng": "Birdie (golf)"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "413745"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firestone_Tire_and_Rubber_Company", "label": {"eng": "Firestone Tire and Rubber Company"}, "type": "org", "id": "446232"}, {"score": 4, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WGC-Bridgestone_Invitational", "label": {"eng": "NEC World Series of Golf"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "516499"}, {"score": 1, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Pieters", "label": {"eng": "Thomas Pieters"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "523044"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firestone_Country_Club", "label": {"eng": "Firestone Country Club"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "608245"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hideki_Matsuyama", "label": {"eng": "Hideki Matsuyama"}, "type": "person", "id": "659639"}], "url": "http://www.irishtimes.com/sport/golf/rory-mcilroy-lurking-dangerously-after-marathon-day-at-firestone-1.3177410", "timeCrawl": "00:17:00", "image": "http://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3177409.1501889764!/image/image.jpg", "location": null, "dateTime": "2017-08-05T00:17:00Z", "originalArticle": null, "sim": 0.6392157077789307}

ANDREWS, Scotland -- I.K. Kim, the best player in women's golf right now, emerged from the cold and wet with a 4-under 68 to build a two-shot lead in the Women's British Open going into the weekend.\n\nA two-time winner on the LPGA Tour over the last two months, Kim dropped only one shot in some of the worst conditions at Kingsbarns Links and reached the halfway point at 11-under 133. She was two shots clear of Lexi Thompson and Georgia Hall of England.\n\nKim displayed a remarkable fortitude in weather that veered erratically toward the end of the day between bright sunshine and torrential downpours. The 29-year-old from South Korea atoned for her lone bogey with three birdies and an eagle on the 538-yard 11th hole.\n\n\"The eagle was very unexpected,\" Kim said. \"I think this was kind of as bad as the weather could get. I expected rain, but not like this. It's not easy to play in this kind of weather. But I feel really good about my game. I've been hitting the ball very well and I'm starting to make some putts. That's when I shoot low scores.\"\n\nThompson, the No. 2 player in the world, also shot a 68.\n\nTwo-over par and birdie-free after nine-holes, the big-hitting Floridian played the homeward nine in 30 with six birdies - five in succession.\n\nFirst-round leader Michelle Wie was seven back after a 76.\n\nPGA: Jimmy Walker endured rain delays of nearly five hours and shot a 5-under 65 to build a two-shot lead at the Bridgestone Invitational in Akron, Ohio.\n\nWalker finally saw some good results in a year marked by coping with Lyme disease and bouts of fatigue. The timing couldn't be better for Walker, who defends his PGA Championship title next week.\n\nHe made birdie from short range on both par 3s on the back nine at Firestone and finished two rounds at 7-under 133.\n\nThomas Pieters of Belgium missed a 6-foot birdie chance on the 18th hole and shot 70. He was two shots behind.\n\nRory McIlroy had a 69 and was among those three shots behind, while Jordan Spieth finished with two straight birdies and was four behind.\n\nCHAMPIONS TOUR: Kenny Perry opened with six consecutive birdies and shot a 7-under 65 to hold a share of the lead after the first round of the 3M Championship in Blaine, Minnesota.\n\nShare\n\nSend questions/comments to the editors.\n\nWant the news vital to Maine?

So maybe there's another spark he can find at Firestone Country Club.\n\n\"There's still a lot of golf on a hard course, but I know it's there,\" he said.\n\nHe also has a slew of players not far behind him in this World Golf Championship. Rory McIlroy put together a steady round of 69 and was three shots back, along with Zach Johnson and Hideki Matsuyama, who each shot 67.\n\nThe large group at 3-under 137 included Jordan Spieth, going after his third straight victory. Spieth missed a short par putt on the 15th but birdied the 18th hole to salvage a 70.\n\nPGA: Richy Werenski accumulated 15 points to lead in the Barracuda Championship with 26 points in Reno, Nev.

The 27-year old American made only one birdie in a 76 that leaves her seven shots off the pace and in a tie for 21st with two rounds remaining. Wie has not won since the 2014 U.S. Women's Open at Pinehurst No. 2.\n\nChampions: Two-time tournament winner Kenny Perry shot a 7-under 65 to hold a share of the lead after the first round of the PGA Tour Champions event just outside of Minneapolis-St. Paul. Scott Verplank, Marco Dawson, Gene Sauers and Jay Haas finished at 6-under.\n\nCurry misses cut: Stephen Curry missed the cut against professional golfers one notch below the PGA Tour. Curry shot his second straight 4-over 74 on the TPC Stonebrae course to miss the cut by 11 shots at the Ellie Mae Classic.

He led by one stroke from Scotsman Russell Knox, who bogeyed the last.\n\n\"I only had two putts from above the hole. The others were pretty straightforward putts,\" Pieters said after heading the select 76-player field in his first competitive round on the course.\n\n\"I was pretty terrible from the tee, but managed to hit a lot of greens. Kind of a stress-free round.\"\n\nSpieth, showing no signs of a let-down following his British Open triumph two weeks ago at Royal Birkdale, was two shots off the pace along with four-times major winner McIlroy, playing alongside new caddie Harry Diamond.\n\nThe Northern Irishman split with his caddie of nine years, J.P. Fitzgerald, following the British Open.\n\n\"It was good. A little weird at the start,\" McIlroy said about the new partnership with best friend Diamond. \"Obviously, it's been nine years since I've had anyone else on my bag.\"\n\nShort-game master Spieth wielded his magic putter to sink consecutive monster birdies late in his round, before ending his day with a sand save at the last, holing a seven-footer for par.\n\n\"I really scrambled nicely, and made a couple of really long putts back-to-back in the middle of the round that put us at three (under) when I felt like I played a one or two-under round,\" said Spieth, winner of his last two events.\n\nJoining Spieth and McIlroy on 67 were double Masters winner Bubba Watson, Englishman Ross Fisher, Spaniard Jon Rahm and American Kevin Kisner in a round that was played two hours earlier than originally planned to avoid threatening thunderstorms in the forecast.\n\nAnother shot away was world number one Dustin Johnson, who bombed a 439-yard drive on his way to a birdie at the downhill par-five 16th hole.\n\nKnox vaulted up the leaderboard boosted by an eagle at the par-five second, his 11th hole, when his 76-yard pitch shot trickled back into the cup.\n\n\"I hit a poor drive and just laid up,\" he said. \"I was able to judge the distance right and it kind of rolled up to the top of the hill and trickled back and went in.

For Jordan Spieth, it was more of the same with two long putts and another comment filled with bravado directed at his caddie.\n\nBoth of them opened with a 3-under 67 at the Bridgestone Invitational, leaving them two shots behind Thomas Pieters of Belgium.\n\nPieters, playing only for the sixth time since he challenged briefly at the Masters this year, holed a 30-foot birdie putt on his final hole at Firestone to finish a day of good scoring with a one-shot lead over Russell Knox.\n\nThe opening two rounds were moved up to the morning because of a forecast of thunderstorms in the afternoon.\n\nMcIlroy split with J.P. Fitzgerald, his caddie of nine years, after the British Open. He decided to use Harry Diamond, who played amateur golf for Ireland and was the best man at McIlroy's wedding, for the Bridgestone Invitational and the PGA Championship next week.\n\nIt didn't have much bearing on McIlroy's game, which was fine. McIlroy won at Firestone the last time he played it in 2014.\n\nSpieth has won two straight events going into this World Golf Championship with an eye toward next week at the PGA Championship and his shot at becoming the youngest player to complete the Grand Slam.\n\nSpieth got into range of the lead with a 30-foot birdie putt on No. 5 and a 50-foot birdie putt on the next hole that got him to 3 under. But he was in trouble at No. 8, well right of the fairway with trees blocking his view of the green. He did see about a 3-foot gap way up in the trees. And he was feeling it.\n\nHis caddie, Michael Greller, got the yardage.\n\n\"I said, 'Michael, just put the bag over there, stand over there and watch this,'\" Spieth said. \"I split a hole that was 60 yards in front of me and cut it to get onto the green.\"\n\nBubba Watson, also showing signs of getting his game turned around, also was in the group at 67 that included Kevin Kisner and Jon Rahm.\n\nRENO, Nev. -- John Huh made plenty of putts in the Barracuda Championship, which leads to good results no matter how the score is kept.\n\nHuh took only 24 putts at Montreaux Golf and Country Club, the last one from 6 feet for his eighth birdie on his final hole to give him 15 points and a one-point lead over Stuart Appleby and Miguel Angel Carballo.\n\nAppleby also had eight birdies against two bogeys, while Carballo made up ground with a pair of eagles, one in which he holed out from 160 yards on No. 17.\n\nThis is the only PGA Tour event that uses the modified Stableford format that awards five points for an eagle and three points for a birdie, while deducting one point for a bogey and three points for a double bogey or worse.\n\nSix players were at 13 points, a group that included former North Texas player Ryan Palmer. He needs to win to get into the PGA Championship next week at Quail Hollow. The PGA is holding a spot for a player who wins at Montreaux that is not already eligible.\n\nST. ANDREWS, Scotland -- Finishing fast after a slow start, Michelle Wie birdied her last three holes for an 8-under 64 for a one-shot lead in the Women's British Open.\n\nWie bogeyed the par-5 second hole at Kingsbarns Links, and that was the last of her mistakes. The 27-year-old American shot 30 on the back nine and wound up one shot ahead of I.K. Kim of South Korea.\n\nLindy Duncan was another shot behind at 66, with Lexi Thompson among those at 67.\n\nWie, showing no sign of the neck spasms that forced her to withdraw from last month's U.S Women's Open, posted nine birdies during a morning round played in almost perfect weather on the eastern coast of Scotland.\n\nOnly later did torrential downpours and the threat of lightning twice disrupt play for a total of 74 minutes.\n\nSo Yeon Ryu, the No. 1 player in the world, opened with a 71.\n\nHAYWARD, Calif. -- Stephen Curry pumped his right fist, raised his arms in the air with club in hand and gave a firm shoulder bump to caddie Jonnie West, his golf partner on road trips with the Golden State Warriors.\n\nAfter three bogeys in five holes of his professional golf debut, a birdie was worthy of celebration.\n\nThere was the animated, confident Steph that NBA fans know so well, the two-time league MVP finally feeling it and making the tough shots on the challenging course at TPC Stonebrae while competing one step below the PGA Tour.\n\nWith a bogey on the last hole, he had a respectable 4-over 74.\n\nCurry drew 300-plus fans to the Web.com Tour's Ellie Mae Classic, where Hall of Fame wide receiver Jerry Rice has played in the past.\n\nThe top 65 and ties from the 156-player field will make the cut. Curry, playing on a sponsor exemption and one of three amateurs in the field, was tied for 142nd and was six shots below the cut line going into Friday.\n\nFormer UNT star Carlos Ortiz was one shot out of the lead after a 64.\n\nST. ALBANS, Mo. -- Akshay Bhatia has won the Boys Junior PGA Championship and shattered a scoring record that had stood for 24 years.\n\nBhatia, a 15-year-old from Wake Forest, North Carolina, closed with a 5-under 67 at The Country Club of St. Albans for a three-shot victory. He finished at 22-under 266, breaking by five shots the record Pat Perez set in 1993 at Pinehurst No. 4.\n\nBhatia won by five over Reid Davenport, a 17-year-old from Austin who briefly tied Bhatia on the back nine until a late bogey.\n\nFEATURED PHOTO: Rory McIlroy, left, and Jordan Spieth stand on the ninth green during the Bridgestone Invitational on Thursday in Akron, Ohio.

The others were pretty straightforward putts,\" Pieters said after heading the select 76-player field in his first competitive round on the course.\n\n\"I was pretty terrible from the tee, but managed to hit a lot of greens. Kind of a stress-free round.\"\n\nSpieth, showing no signs of a let-down following his British Open triumph two weeks ago at Royal Birkdale, was two shots off the pace along with four-times major winner McIlroy, playing alongside new caddie Harry Diamond.\n\nThe Northern Irishman split with his caddie of nine years, J.P. Fitzgerald, following the British Open.\n\n\"It was good. A little weird at the start,\" McIlroy said about the new partnership with best friend Diamond. \"Obviously, it\u00b4s been nine years since I\u00b4ve had anyone else on my bag.\"\n\nShort-game master Spieth wielded his magic putter to sink consecutive monster birdies late in his round, before ending his day with a sand save at the last, holing a seven-footer for par.\n\n\"I really scrambled nicely, and made a couple of really long putts back-to-back in the middle of the round that put us at three (under) when I felt like I played a one or two-under round,\" said Spieth, winner of his last two events.\n\nJoining Spieth and McIlroy on 67 were double Masters winner Bubba Watson, Englishman Ross Fisher, Spaniard Jon Rahm and American Kevin Kisner in a round that was played two hours earlier than originally planned to avoid threatening thunderstorms in the forecast.\n\nAnother shot away was world number one Dustin Johnson, who bombed a 439-yard drive on his way to a birdie at the downhill par-five 16th hole.\n\nKnox vaulted up the leaderboard boosted by an eagle at the par-five second, his 11th hole, when his 76-yard pitch shot trickled back into the cup.\n\n\"I hit a poor drive and just laid up,\" he said. \"I was able to judge the distance right and it kind of rolled up to the top of the hill and trickled back and went in. Obviously, it was a huge bonus to make eagle.\" (Reporting by Larry Fine in Safety Harbor, Florida; Editing by Frank Pingue and Andrew Both)", "eventUri": "eng-3338758", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2017-08-03", "title": "Golf-Pieters leads way, Spieth and McIlroy close behind", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-03", "id": "15227256", "extractedDates": [{"imp": true, "textStart": 0, "amb": false, "textEnd": 5, "date": "2017-08-03"}], "storyUri": "eng-3338758", "time": "22:40:00", "details": {}, "concepts": [{"score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States of America"}, "id": "233", "location": {"label": {"eng": "United States of America"}, "type": "country"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc"}, {"score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "id": "84296", "location": {"label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "country"}, "type": "place"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "type": "loc"}, {"score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Northern Ireland"}, "id": "85555", "location": {"label": {"eng": "Northern Ireland"}, "country": {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "country"}, "type": "place"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland", "type": "loc"}, {"score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Akron, Ohio"}, "id": "218915", "location": {"label": {"eng": "Akron, Ohio"}, "country": {"label": {"eng": "United States of America"}, "type": "country"}, "type": "place"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akron,_Ohio", "type": "loc"}, {"score": 2, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "id": "242110", "location": {"label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "country"}, "type": "place"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc"}, {"score": 1, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}, "type": "org", "id": "302588"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "label": {"eng": "Golf"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "302727"}, {"score": 5, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rory_McIlroy", "label": {"eng": "Rory McIlroy"}, "type": "person", "id": "305030"}, {"score": 4, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Open_Championship", "label": {"eng": "The Open Championship"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "305039"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dustin_Johnson", "label": {"eng": "Dustin Johnson"}, "type": "person", "id": "306252"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf_course", "label": {"eng": "Golf course"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "307398"}, {"score": 4, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Spieth", "label": {"eng": "Jordan Spieth"}, "type": "person", "id": "309234"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sink", "label": {"eng": "Sink"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "318088"}, {"score": 4, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Par_(score)", "label": {"eng": "Par (score)"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "325635"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masters_Tournament", "label": {"eng": "Masters Tournament"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "334530"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubba_Watson", "label": {"eng": "Bubba Watson"}, "type": "person", "id": "342383"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caddy", "label": {"eng": "Caddy"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "376875"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamemaster", "label": {"eng": "Gamemaster"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "384491"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ross_Fisher", "label": {"eng": "Ross Fisher"}, "type": "person", "id": "391946"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_Knox", "label": {"eng": "Russell Knox"}, "type": "person", "id": "502131"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WGC-Bridgestone_Invitational", "label": {"eng": "NEC World Series of Golf"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "516499"}, {"score": 4, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Pieters", "label": {"eng": "Thomas Pieters"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "523044"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Birkdale_Golf_Club", "label": {"eng": "Royal Birkdale Golf Club"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "528058"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Golf_Championships", "label": {"eng": "World Golf Championships"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "575701"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firestone_Country_Club", "label": {"eng": "Firestone Country Club"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "608245"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Kisner", "label": {"eng": "Kevin Kisner"}, "type": "person", "id": "644044"}], "url": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/~/article-4759192/index.html", "timeCrawl": "22:40:00", "image": null, "location": null, "dateTime": "2017-08-03T22:40:00Z", "originalArticle": null, "sim": 0.6196078658103943}

been delayed due to a passing storm over Firestone Country Club and just over two hours' play was possible before the threat of lightning caused another 45-minute delay.\n\nDay had managed to birdie the first hole in that time and carried on where he left off when play resumed, picking up shots on the second, third, fifth and ninth to cover the front nine in 30, despite appearing in some discomfort due to a back problem.\n\nThat took the 29-year-old Australian to four under par and just a shot off the lead shared by Jimmy Walker and Thomas Pieters, but as Day, Spieth and McIlroy prepared to play their second shots to the 10th, the siren sounded to suspend play once again.\n\nPlaying his first event since splitting from long-time caddie JP Fitzgerald, McIlroy had made the ideal start with a birdie on the second, but bogeyed the ninth following a wild drive to fall back to three-under.\n\nSpieth, who is seeking his third win in succession after victories in the Travelers Championship and Open Championship, had also birdied the par-five second but carded three bogeys and a birdie in a four-hole stretch from the fourth to lie two under.\n\nBefore the first suspension Russell Knox had surged into a two-shot lead thanks to birdies on the first three holes, but the 32-year-old Scot bogeyed the fifth and seventh when play resumed.\n\nA birdie on the ninth took Knox, who won the WGC-HSBC Champions in November 2015, out in 33, only for further dropped shots on the 11th and 12th to leave him alongside Day on four under.\n\nLeona Maguire lies seven shots off the lead, held by South Korean In-Kyung Kim, after the second round of the Women's British Open at Kingsbarns in Scotland.\n\nThe Cavan girl, the current number one amateur in the world, carded a one-under-par 71 yesterday, which included three birdies and two bogeys.\n\nMaguire posted an opening 69 on Thursday and is now four-under ahead of the final two rounds over the weekend.\n\nTandragee,

For Jordan Spieth, it was more of the same with two long putts, much like the his championship in the British Open.\n\nBoth of them opened with a 3-under 67 at the Bridgestone Invitational, leaving them two shots behind Thomas Pieters of Belgium.\n\nPieters, playing only for the sixth time since he challenged briefly at the Masters this year, holed a 30-foot birdie putt on his final hole at Firestone to finish a day of good scoring with a one-shot lead over Russell Knox.\n\nThe opening two rounds were moved up to the morning because of a forecast of thunderstorms in the afternoon.\n\nMcIlroy split with J.P. Fitzgerald, his caddie of nine years, after the British Open. He decided to use Harry Diamond, who played amateur golf for Ireland and was the best man at McIlroy's wedding, for the Bridgestone Invitational and the PGA Championship next week.\n\nIt didn't have much bearing on McIlroy's game, which was fine. McIlroy won at Firestone the last time he played it in 2014.\n\n\"We both did the numbers and I sort of consulted him a couple of times. Yeah, it was good,\" McIlroy said. \"There was a couple of shots that I hit or a couple of clubs that I pulled that I maybe should have just thought a little bit more about. It's been a while since I've paced yardages off and written notes in my book.\"\n\nSpieth got back into range of the lead with a 30-foot birdie putt on No. 5 and a 50-foot birdie putt on the next hole that got him to 3 under.\n\nBubba Watson, also showing signs of getting his game turned around, was also in the group at 67 that included Kevin Kisner and Jon Rahm.\n\nWomen's British Open\n\nFinishing fast after a slow start, Michelle Wie birdied her last three holes for an 8-under 64 for a one-shot lead at St. Andrews, Scotland.\n\nWie bogeyed the par-5 second hole at Kingsbarns Links, and that was the last of her mistakes. The 27-year-old American shot 30 on the back nine and wound up one shot ahead of I.K. Kim of South Korea.\n\nLindy Duncan was another shot behind at 66, with Lexi Thompson among those at 67.\n\nWie, showing no sign of the neck spasms that forced her to withdraw from last month's U.S Women's Open, posted nine birdies during a morning round played in almost perfect weather on the eastern coast of Scotland.\n\nCurry's Pro Debut\n\nStephen Curry pumped his right fist, raised his arms in the air with club in hand and gave a firm shoulder bump to caddie Jonnie West, his golf partner on road trips with the Golden State Warriors.\n\nAfter three bogeys in five holes of his professional golf debut at Hayward, Calif., a birdie was worthy of celebration.\n\nThere was the animated, confident Steph that NBA fans know so well, the two-time league MVP finally feeling it and making the tough shots on the challenging course at TPC Stonebrae while competing in a tournament one step below the PGA Tour.\n\nWith a bogey on the last hole, he had a respectable 4-over 74.\n\nCurry drew 300-plus fans to the Web.com Tour's Ellie Mae Classic, where Hall of Fame wide receiver Jerry Rice has played a few times in the past.\n\nThe top 65 and ties from the 156-player field will make the cut. Curry, playing on a sponsor exemption and one of three amateurs in the field, was outside the top 140 and five shots below the cut line as the first round was headed for a conclusion.", "eventUri":

Three delays hit during the second round, as inclement weather, storms and lightning caused suspensions in play. Tee times were moved up for a reason, though, so despite hours of delays, second-round play was indeed completed. Walker fired a 5-under 65 to move to 7 under, earning him a two-shot lead through 36 holes. His form appears to be coming around just in time, as Walker gets set to defend his PGA Championship title next week. The 38-year-old has six PGA Tour wins overall but hasn't had a top 10 since January (when he posted a T-9 at the SBS Tournament of Champions). Now, he's in position to get back in the winner's circle.\n\nCHASING: Thomas Pieters bogeys his opening hole but battles to an even-par 70. The first-round leader drops two back. But even bigger stars lurk behind him. Rory McIlroy (second-round 69) is tied for third at 4 under, as are Zach Johnson (67) and Hideki Matsuyama (67). Jordan Spieth (70) and Jason Day (66) are both T-6 at 3 under. Day birdied four of his first five holes Friday and went out in 5-under 30 before cooling off. Still, he's in contention.\n\nSHOT OF THE DAY: Spieth was on his way to a tough round until he finished birdie-birdie to salvage a 70. It was precipitated by this incredible near hole-out on the approach at the par-4 17th.\n\nAwkward stance.\n\nNearly falls over.\n\nNearly jars it.@JordanSpieth does it again.#QuickHits pic.twitter.com/3opJes9hot\n\n-- PGA TOUR (@PGATOUR) August 4, 2017\n\nQUOTABLE: \"I think I made three birdies with 6-iron in my hand. That's not normal.\" - Zach Johnson, on his second round approach play\n\nSHORT SHOTS: Adam Scott hit a 435-yard drive Friday in a second-round 71 that saw him drop to a tie for 13th at 1 under. ... Rickie Fowler and Justin Rose are tied for 30th at 1 over. ... Dustin Johnson and Phil Mickelson are both tied for 40th at 3 over. Johnson plummeted 31 spots with a second-round 75. ... Jon Rahm had it even rougher. The Spaniard dropped 49 spots to a tie for 52nd at 4 over after a Friday 77.\n\nUP NEXT: Golf Channel will air third-round coverage from 12-1:30 p.m. Eastern before CBS takes over from 2-6 p.m. Follow all the action live on Golfweek.com and our Facebook and Twitter feeds.", "eventUri": "eng-3338758", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2017-08-05", "title": "Jimmy Walker leads by 2 after long day at WGC-Bridgestone Invitational", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-05", "id": "15488999", "extractedDates": [{"date": "2017-08-04", "textStart": 1653, "amb": false, "textEnd": 1667}], "storyUri": "eng-3338758", "time": "03:38:00", "details": {}, "concepts": [{"score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Akron, Ohio"}, "id": "218915", "location": {"label": {"eng": "Akron, Ohio"}, "country": {"label": {"eng": "United States of America"}, "type": "country"}, "type": "place"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akron,_Ohio", "type": "loc"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}, "type": "org", "id": "302546"}, {"score": 1, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Mickelson", "label": {"eng": "Phil Mickelson"}, "type": "person", "id": "305029"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rory_McIlroy", "label": {"eng": "Rory McIlroy"}, "type": "person", "id": "305030"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Championship", "label": {"eng": "PGA Championship"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "305035"}, {"score": 1, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dustin_Johnson", "label": {"eng": "Dustin Johnson"}, "type": "person", "id": "306252"}, {"score": 4, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Spieth", "label": {"eng": "Jordan Spieth"}, "type": "person", "id": "309234"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Tour", "label": {"eng": "PGA Tour"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "314267"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rickie_Fowler", "label": {"eng": "Rickie Fowler"}, "type": "person", "id": "314271"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Walker", "label": {"eng": "Jimmy Walker"}, "type": "person", "id": "319891"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Day", "label": {"eng": "Jason Day"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "323028"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Rose", "label": {"eng": "Justin Rose"}, "type": "person", "id": "342378"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zach_Johnson", "label": {"eng": "Zach Johnson"}, "type": "person", "id": "382270"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Scott_(golfer)", "label": {"eng": "Adam Scott (golfer)"}, "type": "person", "id": "396634"}, {"score": 5, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firestone_Tire_and_Rubber_Company", "label": {"eng": "Firestone Tire and Rubber Company"}, "type": "org", "id": "446232"}, {"score": 4, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WGC-Bridgestone_Invitational", "label": {"eng": "NEC World Series of Golf"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "516499"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Pieters", "label": {"eng": "Thomas Pieters"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "523044"}, {"score": 4, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firestone_Country_Club", "label": {"eng": "Firestone Country Club"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "608245"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hideki_Matsuyama", "label": {"eng": "Hideki Matsuyama"}, "type": "person", "id": "659639"}], "url": "http://golfweek.com/2017/08/04/jimmy-walker-leads-by-2-after-long-day-at-wgc-bridgestone-invitational/", "timeCrawl": "03:38:00", "image": "https://usatgolfweek.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/jimmy-walker-leads.jpg?w=640", "location": null, "dateTime": "2017-08-05T03:38:00Z", "originalArticle": null, "sim": 0.5607843399047852}

But he also shot 67 to leave them two strokes behind early leader Pieters, whose 65 gave him a one-shot lead over Russell Knox, as McIlroy and Spieth shared third with Kevin Kisner, Ross Fisher, Bubba Watson, and Jon Rahm.\n\n\"It was good,\" McIlroy said of a round in which he scrambled six times out of seven for par. \"I kept in good spirits out there and it was good to have my best friend on the bag.\n\n\"It's different. You are hearing a different voice. But I stuck to it today pretty well and I guess it's the start of a new chapter in my career and we'll go from here.\"\n\nStarting on the back nine, McIlroy rolled in a birdie putt from 26 feet at the 11th to continue the good putting streak he began at Royal Birkdale with a share of fourth behind Spieth.\n\nOne of his biggest problem in recent seasons has been his erratic wedge play and he admitted he's looking to sharpen up that aspect of his game before next week's US PGA at one of his pet venues, Quail Hollow. \"Just good signs in my game,\" he said of his ambitions for the week. \"Go out and hopefully see little improvements as the week goes on.\n\n\"Obviously I would love to win, I would love to go into next week with a lot of confidence. But I feel like my confidence is building. I just need to see my game get a little bit sharper, especially the wedges.\" What pleased him most was his putting, especially over the last 11 holes.\n\n\"I've been working hard at it, trying to blend something I have been working on with a little bit of feel as well and I feel like it is coming together,\" McIlroy said.\n\n\"I think I finished fourth in the stats at Birkdale and obviously had a good putting day today.\n\n\"So it's definitely moving in the right direction and definitely something to build on.\"\n\nA par putt from 10 feet at the 17th seemed to inspire him and after made a four footer for birdie at the 18th to turn in one under, he was more impressive on his back nine.\n\nAfter getting up and down from sand short of the green at the par-five second for another birdie, he then hit another wedge to four feet at the third to move within one stroke of the lead on three-under. If the par putt he made on the 17th was huge for his confidence, the 18 footer he made for par at the fourth, where he pulled his approach 30 yards left down a slope but escaped unscathed, was even bigger.\n\nHaving watch Spieth hole a 33 footer for birdie at the fifth, McIlroy looked on as The Open champion made another from 50 feet at the sixth and promptly rolled in a 13 footer of his own there to move to four under. Looking forward to building momentum for a crack at a fifth major in next week's US PGA, he was happy with his start.\"It would have been nice to finish four-under but 67 was a fair reflection of how I played,\" he said.", "eventUri": "eng-3338758", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2017-08-04", "title": "Rory McIlroy enjoying 'new chapter' with new bagman Harry Diamond", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-04", "id": "15240603", "extractedDates": null, "storyUri": "eng-3338758", "time": "00:22:00", "details": {}, "concepts": [{"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "label": {"eng": "Golf"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "302727"}, {"score": 5, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rory_McIlroy", "label": {"eng": "Rory McIlroy"}, "type": "person", "id": "305030"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Open_Championship", "label": {"eng": "The Open Championship"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "305039"}, {"score": 5, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Spieth", "label": {"eng": "Jordan Spieth"}, "type": "person", "id": "309234"}, {"score": 5, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Par_(score)", "label": {"eng": "Par (score)"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "325635"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-shot_(comics)", "label": {"eng": "One-shot (comics)"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "337083"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_Golfers'_Association_of_America", "label": {"eng": "Professional Golfers' Association of America"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "339458"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubba_Watson", "label": {"eng": "Bubba Watson"}, "type": "person", "id": "342383"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ross_Fisher", "label": {"eng": "Ross Fisher"}, "type": "person", "id": "391946"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_Knox", "label": {"eng": "Russell Knox"}, "type": "person", "id": "502131"}, {"score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Birkdale"}, "id": "512330", "location": null, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birkdale", "type": "loc"}, {"score": 4, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Pieters", "label": {"eng": "Thomas Pieters"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "523044"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Birkdale_Golf_Club", "label": {"eng": "Royal Birkdale Golf Club"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "528058"}, {"score": 4, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firestone_Country_Club", "label": {"eng": "Firestone Country Club"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "608245"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Kisner", "label": {"eng": "Kevin Kisner"}, "type": "person", "id": "644044"}], "url": "http://www.irishexaminer.com/sport/golf/rory-mcilroy-enjoying-new-chapter-with-new-bagman-harry-diamond-456354.html", "timeCrawl": "00:22:00", "image": "http://www.irishexaminer.com/remote/media.central.ie/media/images/r/RoryMcIlroyWithCaddieHarryDiamondAug17_large.jpg?width=648&s=ie-456354", "location": null, "dateTime": "2017-08-04T00:22:00Z", "originalArticle": null, "sim": 0.5568627715110779}

What must be exciting the Northern Irishman is the impressive state of his short game.\n\nOn a stop-start second day at the WGC-Bridgestone Invitational, with three separate suspensions for lightning, the 28 year old stood first in sand saves, third in overall scrambling and sixth in putting.\n\nMcIlroy has talked often recently of taking more responsibility for his game rather than relying on outside voices and the DIY approach appears to be having a beneficial effect.\n\nSpieth is seeking third win in a row after the Travelers Championship and Open Championship\n\nThe only reason he was two shots off the pace in sixth place following the third suspension and not leading was his wedge play, which was again sub-standard. Time and again over the first 27 holes he failed to take advantage of drives that were finishing 40 yards past his playing partner, Open Champion Jordan Spieth.\n\nIf he can summon a tick in that box over the weekend he will head to Charlotte, North Carolina, bristling with confidence he can end his three year drought at the majors.\n\nOver the first two days the threesome of McIlroy, Spieth and Jason Day provided a rich level of entertainment that certainly whetted the appetite for next week. Walking down the first Day was moving so gingerly you wouldn't have given tuppence for his chances, either here or in Charlotte. His chronic back problem had flared up again and he was struggling for power to such an extent his drive finished 100 yards behind McIlroy's.\n\nFormer world No 1 Jason Day outshone playing partners Spieth and McIlroy on Friday\n\nYet only one of them walked off the green with a birdie - and it wasn't McIlroy. So began an extraordinary nine holes from Day, one where he barely hit a decent shot and yet made the turn in an incredible 30 blows. It helped, of course, when he followed the 30-footer he holed at the first with two more of similar length at the second and third. He then holed another at the ninth, and looked almost upset when play was suspended for lightning as they made their way to the 10th tee. Talk about the restorative power of a magical day on the greens. Somehow, he had crept a shot ahead of McIlroy into third place and two in front of Spieth.\n\nDisputing top spot were Jimmy Walker, who will defend his USPGA title next week, and Belgian Thomas Pieters, with Scot Russell Knox tied third with Day. Tommy Fleetwood was leading Englishman, alongside Spieth in ninth place with six to play.\n\nEngland's Georgia Hall is just two shots off the lead in the Ricoh Women's British Open at Kingsbarns.

It's surprising because Walker is only about halfway back to health as he deals with the sporadic effects of Lyme disease.\n\n\"I still have to deal with it, and it's better than it was, but it's still there,\" said Walker, who was diagnosed with the tick-borne bacterial illness in April, but has no idea when he contracted it. \"It affects different parts of your daily life. I just keep plugging away.\"\n\nThat he did Friday at the arduous South Course at Firestone Country Club, as he managed his game amid a series of weather delays to fire a five-under-par 65 and take a two-stroke lead over Thomas Pieters, the first-round leader. Walker, 38, completed 36 holes in seven-under 133. Pieters had a 70 Friday for 135, while Zach Johnson, Rory McIlroy and Hideki Matsuyama were next at 4-under 136.\n\nThe lanky Texan said that he already has taken one course of antibiotics but might have to have another. He manages his symptoms, mainly flu-like maladies, with supplements and Advil. The latter came in handy when Walker woke up Friday feeling achy and ill. He felt another spell coming on after the day's final delay of three hours, 23 minutes and reached for the Advil again to get him to the finish line.\n\nBecause of the malady, Walker has endured a difficult season in which he has posted just one top-10 finish, that coming in the SBS Tournament of Champions in January. His best showing in the first three majors this year is T-18 at the Masters.\n\nAsked Thursday if he was ready to defend his PGA title, Walker paused before saying, \"Honestly, I don't know. Because I don't know how I'll feel day to day.\"\n\nFriday's round has buoyed his hopes. Last year Walker had a strong showing in the RBC Canadian Open, T14, before capturing his first major title at Baltusrol Golf Club. Perhaps he can ride a similar type of momentum.\n\n\"That would be awesome. It was definitely a feel-good weekend for me there [last year] seeing some putts go in, hitting some shots, driving it well,\" he said. \"That's what I've done the last two days here. So yeah, that would be great. Whatever happens next week is next week but I'm still just looking forward to going out and doing it again tomorrow. I know it's going to be a challenge and it's been a while, so there's some emotions going on out there, and the hard work, and still dealing with what I'm dealing with.\n\n\"It's always important to have a good week. I haven't had too many this year, it's kind of rough. But things have been trending, I kind of feel like, and hopefully this is shades of things to come.\"", "eventUri": "eng-3338758", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2017-08-05", "title": "Jimmy Walker's precarious lead:'I don't know how I'll feel day to day' - Golf Digest", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-05", "id": "15477398", "extractedDates": null, "storyUri": "eng-3338758", "time": "01:13:00", "details": {}, "concepts": [{"score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Charlotte, North Carolina"}, "id": "192553", "location": {"label": {"eng": "Charlotte, North Carolina"}, "country": {"label": {"eng": "United States of America"}, "type": "country"}, "type": "place"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte,_North_Carolina", "type": "loc"}, {"score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "id": "199444", "location": {"label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"label": {"eng": "United States of America"}, "type": "country"}, "type": "place"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc"}, {"score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Akron, Ohio"}, "id": "218915", "location": {"label": {"eng": "Akron, Ohio"}, "country": {"label": {"eng": "United States of America"}, "type": "country"}, "type": "place"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akron,_Ohio", "type": "loc"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria", "label": {"eng": "Bacteria"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "302525"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibacterial", "label": {"eng": "Antibacterial"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "303485"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rory_McIlroy", "label": {"eng": "Rory McIlroy"}, "type": "person", "id": "305030"}, {"score": 4, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Championship", "label": {"eng": "PGA Championship"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "305035"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Men's_major_golf_championships", "label": {"eng": "Men's major golf championships"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "309229"}, {"score": 4, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Tour", "label": {"eng": "PGA Tour"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "314267"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibuprofen", "label": {"eng": "Ibuprofen"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "318295"}, {"score": 4, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Walker", "label": {"eng": "Jimmy Walker"}, "type": "person", "id": "319891"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza", "label": {"eng": "Influenza"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "322533"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Par_(score)", "label": {"eng": "Par (score)"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "325635"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masters_Tournament", "label": {"eng": "Masters Tournament"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "334530"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyme_disease", "label": {"eng": "Lyme disease"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "339295"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tick-borne_disease", "label": {"eng": "Tick-borne disease"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "348202"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltusrol_Golf_Club", "label": {"eng": "Baltusrol Golf Club"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "368899"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-stroke_engine", "label": {"eng": "Two-stroke engine"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "381568"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zach_Johnson", "label": {"eng": "Zach Johnson"}, "type": "person", "id": "382270"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Open_(golf)", "label": {"eng": "Canadian Open (golf)"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "408079"}, {"score": 4, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WGC-Bridgestone_Invitational", "label": {"eng": "NEC World Series of Golf"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "516499"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Pieters", "label": {"eng": "Thomas Pieters"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "523044"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firestone_Country_Club", "label": {"eng": "Firestone Country Club"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "608245"}, {"score": 4, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quail_Hollow_Club", "label": {"eng": "Quail Hollow Club"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "619171"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hideki_Matsuyama", "label": {"eng": "Hideki Matsuyama"}, "type": "person", "id": "659639"}], "url": "https://www.golfdigest.com/story/jimmy-walkers-precarious-leadi-dont-know-how-ill-feel-day-to-day", "timeCrawl": "01:13:00", "image": "https://media.golfdigest.com/photos/598509861125241370011388/master/pass/Jimmy-Walker.jpg", "location": {"label": {"eng": "Akron, Ohio"}, "country": {"label": {"eng": "United States of America"}, "type": "country"}, "type": "place"}, "dateTime": "2017-08-05T01:13:00Z", "originalArticle": null, "sim": 0.5098039507865906}

{"categories": [], "lang": "eng", "source": {"uri": "golfweek.com", "id": "10279", "title": "Golfweek"}, "uri": "703947183", "body": "Here is a recap of the first round of the WGC-Bridgestone Invitational, played at Firestone Country Club's South Course in Akron, Ohio:\n\nLEADING: Thomas Pieters was flawless Thursday, firing a 5-under 65 around the tight South Course. The Belgian wasn't flashy on this day, but he's beating everyone. Pieters birdied No. 14 (his fifth hole), would add another at the 16th, two more at Nos. 1 and 2 and close with another at the ninth to grab the solo lead. The 25-year-old has yet to win on the PGA Tour, but then again this is just his 16th career start on the circuit. The former Illini star went back to Europe after leaving school early and turning pro, and he picked up three European Tour wins between 2015 and '16. Pieters has focused more on the U.S. this season, as this is his 11th start on the PGA Tour this season after five total in his career prior to 2016-17. He has three top 10s on the PGA Tour this year, with his best finish being a T-2 at the Genesis Open. Pieters has long been predicted for stardom and was a breakout in a strong four-point performance as a Ryder Cup rookie last fall. A long way to go in this one, but this is a strong start for the World No. 34.\n\nCHASING: Russell Knox was in line for the lead before a bogey at the last (No. 9) dropped him to 4 under. Still, a heady start for Knox, who is probably a bit more relaxed this week with this being a no-cut event. (The Scot entered the week having missed his last three cuts.) A gaggle of big names are tied for third at 3 under. That list includes a guy with a new caddie in Rory McIlroy, Jordan Spieth, determined to let you know what really happened in his Open win, Jon Rahm, Bubba Watson, Kevin Kisner and Ross Fisher.\n\nSHOT OF THE DAY: A 439-yard drive? Really?\n\nWe don't care that this landed in the rough, nothing tops this drive from Dustin Johnson on Thursday.\n\n439 yards. \u1f680\u1f680@DJohnsonPGA just hit the longest drive on TOUR since 2013.#QuickHits pic.twitter.com/bNnA6lzQlq\n\n-- PGA TOUR (@PGATOUR) August 3, 2017\n\nQUOTABLE: \"Sometimes I wish my 5-footers were 50-footers.\" - Jordan Spieth, after a round in which he made putts over 30 feet on back-to-back holes\n\nSHORT SHOTS: Johnson, by the way, birdied that hole on his way to a solid opening 70. He's T-9 at 2 under. ... Fresh off a playoff loss at the RBC Canadian Open, Charley Hoffman also shoots 70. Same for Adam Scott, who was actually in the lead at 5 under before four late bogeys. We may not see much more of Scott this season after next week, for the record. ... Jhonattan Vegas, the Canadian Open winner, is T-15 at 1 under. ... Rickie Fowler is T-22 at even par. ... Jason Day, Phil Mickelson and Brooks Koepka are all notables in a tie for 33rd at 1 over.\n\nUP NEXT: Golf Channel will air second-round coverage from 1-6 p.m. Eastern (but remember that tee times are moved up for Round 2 like they were Thursday).

I've played with him countless times, it's nothing out of the ordinary.\"\n\nPieters began the third round two shots off the lead held by US PGA champion Jimmy Walker, but stormed into a three-shot lead with five birdies in his first eight holes.\n\nAfter a 330-yard drive helped set up a birdie from eight feet on the first, Pieters hooked his drive on the par-five second so far off line that it finished in the middle of the third fairway.\n\nBut from 250 yards away the big-hitting Belgian fired his approach onto the green to set up a two-putt birdie, before almost spinning his approach to the third back into the hole.\n\nPieters, who won a record four points on his Ryder Cup debut at Hazeltine last year after being given a wild card by European captain Darren Clarke, then birdied the fifth and eighth before dropping his first shot of the day on the ninth.\n\nThe 25-year-old responded immediately with another birdie on the 10th and although he bogeyed the 13th, 14th and 17th, birdies on the 16th and 18th completed an eventful 66.\n\n\"Anywhere I have a chance to win I'll definitely take it,\" said Pieters, who has won three times on the European Tour. \"All I want is a chance to be in contention on Sunday afternoon and we'll see what happens.\"\n\nWalker, who will defend his US PGA title at Quail Hollow next week, was six over par for the front nine before birdies on the 15th and 16th salvaged a 74 to leave him six off the pace on three under.", "eventUri": "eng-3338758", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2017-08-05", "title": "Zach Johnson shows Rory McIlroy the

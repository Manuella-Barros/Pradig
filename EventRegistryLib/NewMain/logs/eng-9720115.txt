Now, with less than two years until the tournament kicks off, a daunting challenge awaits U.S. Soccer -- and its future men's head coach -- to prepare a squad that can perform to expectations in the world's biggest sporting event.\n\n\"I want to thank Gregg for his hard work and dedication to U.S. Soccer and our Men's National Team,\" said U.S. Soccer President Cindy Parlow Cone.\n\nThe U.S. men's national team has long struggled on the world stage. The men's best finish in the modern era of the FIFA World Cup was a quarterfinal appearance in 2002.\n\nBut with the U.S. set to co-host the tournament in 2026, along with Canada and Mexico, hopes were high for Berhalter to lead the U.S. to match that quarterfinal finish -- or better. This summer's Copa Am\u00e9rica was viewed as the last major opportunity for his team to gain experience in a high-level international tournament before 2026, and the No. 11-ranked U.S. was widely expected to at least reach the quarterfinals, if not the semifinals.\n\nInstead, the U.S. was eliminated in the group stage. The team managed a win only against lowly Bolivia, ranked No. 84 internationally, before suffering a crushing loss to No. 43 Panama that was due in part to an uncharacteristic red card on winger Tim Weah early in the game that forced the U.S. to play shorthanded for most of the match. Then, on July 1, the U.S. lost yet again to No. 14 Uruguay.\n\n\"We're bitterly disappointed with the results. We know that we're capable of more. And in this tournament, we didn't show it. It's really as simple as that,\" Berhalter said in a press conference immediately after the loss to Uruguay.\n\nAsked whether he was still the right person to lead the team into the 2026 World Cup, Berhalter answered with one word: \"Yes.\"\n\nBut as the days passed, calls mounted to remove Berhalter as coach, including by former USMNT stars like Clint Dempsey, who said after the game that Berhalter was \"wasting\" the current generation of players. The American Outlaws, an organized fan group of the U.S. national soccer fans, wrote in a statement that the U.S. \"cannot miss this incredible chance to create a lasting impact on the game of soccer in this country\" by allowing Berhalter to stay on as coach through the World Cup.\n\nHis termination ends a rocky tenure for Berhalter. After the USMNT failed to qualify for the 2018 World Cup in Russia, he was brought on to lead the team. He helped rebuild the squad with new, younger players and guided them through the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, in which the team made it to the knockout round but was defeated by the Netherlands in the round of 16.\n\nBerhalter's original contract expired that year. Not long after the team's loss in the World Cup, U.S. Soccer began an investigation of Berhalter after a domestic violence accusation surfaced involving a 1991 incident between Berhalter and the woman that would become his wife that took place outside a bar in North Carolina while both were freshmen at the University of North Carolina.\n\nThe accusation, it was later revealed, had come from the parents of a promising USMNT player, Gio Reyna, who had played very little during the Qatar tournament. Reyna's parents -- one-time USMNT star Claudio Reyna and women's national team member Danielle Reyna -- had long been friends of the Berhalters.\n\nMonths after opening the investigation, U.S. Soccer cleared Berhalter, and he was eventually reappointed as coach. After the USMNT's early exit in this month's Copa America tournament - a tournament being hosted in the United States for the first time - there were renewed calls for his ouster. He even lost the support of the fan group American Outlaws which has steadfastly backed him over the years.\n\n\"There needs to be accountability and a plan to move forward for the USMNT. It's time to make a change in the head coaching position,\" the group said.", "source": {"uri": "npr.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "NPR"}, "authors": [{"uri": "russell_lewis@npr.org", "name":

But, he kept finding ways to keep his job, sometimes by the skin of his teeth.\n\nThe USMNT crashed out of Copa America 2024 in the group stage last Monday after a humiliating 2-1 defeat to Panama and a less-humiliating 1-0 defeat to Uruguay in a must-win match. At that point, anti-Berhalter sentiment reached an all-time high.\n\nFinally, nine days after their elimination, US Soccer has given us the news that we've all been waiting for. Gregg Berhalter has been fired from his duties as USMNT coach.\n\nThat's according to reports from Fox Soccer's Doug McIntyre.\n\nAccording to McIntyre, US Soccer declined comment.\n\nThis is welcome news to anyone who cares about USA Soccer ahead of the 2026 World Cup that will be hosted here. Yes, Gregg Berhalter did get out of the group stage of the 2022 World Cup, but it's not like the team looked particularly great doing it. A draw against England was the high point, but the draw against Scotland a narrow win against Iran weren't super impressive, and they were thoroughly outplayed in the Round of 16 by Netherlands, losing 3-1.\n\nThen, scandal erupted when star player Gio Reyna's dad, longtime USMNT member and former friends of Berhalter's, Claudio Reyna and his wife, leaked to the press that Berhalter had kicked his now-wife back in 1991 as revenge for Reyna not getting enough playing time. US Soccer decided to rehire Berhalter anyways despite rumors of much better candidates being interested.\n\nUltimately outside of his dominance over Mexico, Berhalter had few signature wins in his nearly six-year tenure with the USMNT. The team looked great last year while the job was being held by interim BJ Callaghan, and looked worse as soon as Berhalter was back in charge.\n\nNow, US Soccer is tasked with doing what they should've done a long time ago, which is go find the best coach whatever their highest possible budget number is could buy. If that means putting the federation in debt, so be it. It's a once-in-a-generation lifetime to match up a home World Cup with arguably the best crop of players we've ever had, and that's what's in front of us in 2026. Gregg Berhalter would've surely bungled the 2026 World Cup.\n\nTo their credit, they just did this on the women's side, hiring arguably the best women's manager in the world in former Chelsea manager Emma Hayes following last summer's massive disappointment in the Women's World Cup for the USWNT. While a top-flight men's coach will come at a higher price tag than Hayes did, the same strategy should apply.\n\nFor his USMNT managerial career, he was 44-13-17, with the vast majority of wins coming against overmatched CONCACAF countries.", "source": {"uri": "brobible.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "BroBible"}, "authors": [{"uri": "garrett_carr@brobible.com", "name": "Garrett Carr", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregg_Berhalter", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gregg Berhalter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Soccer_Federation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Soccer Federation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_men's_national_soccer_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States men's national soccer team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claudio_Reyna", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Claudio Reyna"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copa_Am\u00e9rica", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Copa Am\u00e9rica"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uruguay", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Uruguay"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Uruguay"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panama", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Panama"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Panama"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giovanni_Reyna", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Giovanni Reyna"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Iran national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "England national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-elimination_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Single-elimination tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emma_Hayes", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Emma Hayes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_Women's_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FIFA Women's World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CONCACAF", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CONCACAF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelsea_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chelsea F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_women's_national_soccer_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States women's national soccer team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONCACAF", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONCACAF", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Competitions", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONMEBOL", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONMEBOL", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Coaching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://brobible.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Gregg-Berhalter2.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9720115", "eventUri": "eng-9720115", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 196, "relevance": 1}

U.S. Soccer had hoped to build momentum toward that World Cup with an impressive Copa America showing. Instead, the program was forced to make a major change in leadership.\n\nBerhalter finishes his nearly six-year USMNT tenure with a coaching record of 44 wins, 17 losses and 13 draws in 74 matches. During Berhalter's tenure, the USMNT won two Concacaf Nations League titles, the 2021 Concacaf Gold Cup and advanced out of the group stage of the 2022 World Cup. However, the squad -- hailed as a \"golden generation\" featuring players such as Christian Pulisic, Weston McKennie, Tim Weah and Sergi\u00f1o Dest -- could not attain a signature win against a world soccer powerhouse during Berhalter's tenure.\n\nFollowing the 2022 World Cup, Berhalter's contract was allowed to expire after the parents of Gio Reyna, unhappy with their son's playing time, reported to U.S. Soccer and then went public with details of a 30-year-old domestic violence incident involving Berhalter and his then-girlfriend, now wife, Rosalind. U.S. Soccer launched an investigation into the incident, which occurred in 1992 when both Berhalters were soccer players at North Carolina. Berhalter was cleared to remain a candidate for the USMNT coaching job after a U.S. Soccer investigation, and in June 2023 Berhalter was back as USMNT coach.\n\nBerhalter was coach of Major League Soccer's Columbus Crew from 2014-2018 before being hired as USMNT coach.\n\nTheir fate was decided in a matter of five minutes. The U.S. men's national soccer team gained a slight sense of hope to advance in the tournament when their game against Uruguay remained scoreless and Bolivia tied Panama 1-1 in Orlando, which would give the Americans a tiebreaking edge.\n\nFive minutes later, Uruguay scored. Panama scored quickly after, and once more, to make the cut deeper and beat Bolivia 3-1.\n\nUruguay and Panama advanced to the Copa America quarterfinals out of Group C. Argentina and Canada advanced out of Group A, while Venezuela and Ecuador edged Mexico in Group B, and Colombia and Brazil advanced out of Group D to the quarterfinals.\n\nThe USMNT made a splash in its Copa America opener, beating Bolivia 2-0 following a goal and assist by Pulisic.\n\nBut the Americans' game against Uruguay was a must-win after a chaotic 2-1 loss to Panama in their second group game. Standout midfielder Timothy Weah earned a red card in the 18 minute, forcing USMNT to play 10 vs. 11 for most of the Panama match. Although Folarin Balogun scored his second goal of the tournament in the 22 minute, Panama scored in the 26 and 83 minutes to steal the victory.\n\nPlaying against Uruguay without Weah and injured goalie Matt Turner, the U.S. kept the game scoreless for the first half. Uruguay's Math\u00edas Olivera scored in the 66 minute.\n\nPrior to the tournament, the USMNT played two drastically different friendly matches -- a 5-1 loss to Colombia on June 8 and a 1-1 draw against Brazil on June 12.\n\nThe matches were a precursor to a frustrating Copa America run, leaving USMNT in search for new leadership at a critical time for the sport in the country.\n\nContributing: Nancy Armour, USA TODAY", "source": {"uri": "ca.sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports Canada"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Berhalter saw success in continental competitions, winning Nations League titles and the Gold Cup, but faced criticism for playing style. The federation will now conduct a coaching search to replace Berhalter, who had mixed results during his time in charge.\n\nGregg Berhalter will not continue as manager of the United States National Team, the federation announced Wednesday.\n\nThe USMNT were eliminated in the group stage at the Copa America, a huge disappointment considering expectations. Their group consisted of Bolivia and Panama as well as Uruguay.\n\n\"I want to thank Gregg for his hard work and dedication to U.S. Soccer and our Men's National Team,\" U.S. Soccer President Cindy Parlow Cone said in a statement. \"We are now focused on working with our Sporting Director Matt Crocker and leveraging his experience at the highest levels of the sport to ensure we find the right person to lead the USMNT into a new era of on-field success.\"\n\nDuring his tenure, the United States excelled in continental competition. They won two Nations League titles (2020, 2024) as well as the Gold Cup in 2021. The USMNT also won the Nations League in 2023, but Berhalter was not the manager as the federation were deciding whether or not to bring him back after the 2022 World Cup.\n\nAt the World Cup in Qatar, Berhalter led his side to the quarterfinals, where they were eliminated by the Netherlands. His contract expired after the tournament and was not immediately renewed, as the federation needed to hire a new sporting director first, then conduct a coaching search in which Berhalter was eventually brought back. Matt Crocker was named sporting director and retained Berhalter after a coaching search.\n\nGregg Berhalter USMNT Overview (2018 - 2024)\n\nStat\n\nTotal\n\nUSMNT All-Time Manager Rank\n\nMatches\n\n74\n\n5th\n\nRecord\n\n44W-17D-13L\n\n3rd-Most Wins\n\nWin %\n\n59.45\n\n1st (Min. 18 Games Managed)\n\nTime in Post (Cumulative)\n\n1834 Days\n\n3rd\n\nAll Stats via Transfermarkt\n\n\"We are deeply grateful to Gregg for his commitment the past five years to the Men's National Team and to U.S. Soccer,\" said Crocker. \"Gregg has earned the respect of everyone within our organization and has played a pivotal role in bringing together a young team and moving the program forward. We wish Gregg all the best in his future endeavors, and we know he will find success in his next coaching position.\"\n\nBerhalter was initially hired by the federation at the end of 2018 with his debut match coming in January 2019.\n\nUnder his reign, the USMNT has had ups and downs. The ups were the continental trophies and securing commitments from several high-profile dual-nationals, including Folarin Balogun, Yunus Musah and Ricardo Pepi. He inherited a program at rock bottom after failing to qualify for the 2018 World Cup.\n\nThere were plenty of lowlights as well, the worst of which was the team's performance at the Copa America with heightened expectations. A more defensively-sound, conservative possession-based playstyle drew criticism from fans. His relationship with Gio Reyna, and then a feud that turned public with Reyna's father, Claudio Reyna, a USMNT legend and someone who used to be very close with Berhalter, further tainted his perception.\n\nThe federation will conduct a coaching search to replace Berhalter now. They considered hiring Jesse Marsch in 2023, but ultimately stuck with Berhalter. Marsch ended up taking the Canadian national team job and, in his first tournament, led his side to the semifinals at this year's Copa America.\n\n\"Our immediate focus is on finding a coach who can maximize our potential as we continue to prepare for the 2026 World Cup, and we have already begun our search process,\" said Crocker.", "source": {"uri": "givemesport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GiveMeSport"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregg_Berhalter", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gregg Berhalter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Nations_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Nations League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Soccer_Federation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Soccer Federation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_men's_national_soccer_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States men's national soccer team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sporting_director", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sporting director"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CONCACAF_Gold_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "CONCACAF Gold Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Crocker", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Matt Crocker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cindy_Parlow_Cone", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cindy Parlow Cone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolivia_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bolivia national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghana_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ghana national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uruguay_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Uruguay national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copa_Am\u00e9rica", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Copa Am\u00e9rica"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panama", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Panama"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Panama"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qatar", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Qatar"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Qatar"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yunus_Musah", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Yunus Musah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folarin_Balogun", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Folarin Balogun"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giovanni_Reyna", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Giovanni Reyna"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ricardo_Pepi", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ricardo Pepi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada_men's_national_soccer_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Canada men's national soccer team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesse_Marsch", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jesse Marsch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claudio_Reyna", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Claudio Reyna"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cheerleading", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cheerleading", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONMEBOL", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONMEBOL", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Coaching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Non-FIFA_Nations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Non-FIFA Nations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://static0.givemesportimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/gregg_berhalter_usmnt.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9720115", "eventUri": "eng-9720115", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2019-01-", "textStart": 2593, "textEnd": 2605}], "sentiment": 0.2862745098039217, "wgt": 194, "relevance": 1}

Six reasons US Soccer reportedly dismissed USMNT head coach two years before 2026 World Cup", "body": "After a disastrous early elimination from the 2024 Copa America, the U.S. Soccer Federation has dismissed men's head coach Gregg Berhalter, according to a report by Doug McIntyre of Fox Sports.\n\nThe 50-year-old American was in his second stint in charge of the USMNT. He took charge of the side through the previous World Cup cycle and was re-hired last summer to lead the all-important run-up to the 2026 tournament.\n\nAfter his re-hiring, though, Berhalter made it just a single year before it all fell apart, leading the side to an embarrassing group stage exit from CONMEBOL's championship tournament on home soil.\n\nWith the 2026 FIFA World Cup just two years away, U.S. Soccer Sporting Director Matt Crocker will embark on another search to find the coach who will take charge ahead of the coming World Cup on home soil.\n\nThe Sporting News details the reasons why Berhalter was dismissed with such a pivotal two years ahead for the USMNT.\n\nMORE: Top candidates to replace Gregg Berhalter as USMNT head coach\n\nBerhalter's dismissal was not only because of the 2024 Copa America disaster, but it certainly starts there.\n\nThe USMNT was eliminated in the group stage of the competition on home soil, seeing the United States become the first Copa America host not to reach the knockout stage in the current format of the competition dating back to 1975.\n\nThe most glaring result was the 2-1 defeat to Panama, which saw the U.S. play a man down for over 70 minutes thanks to Tim Weah's early red card. While it's easy to blame the defeat on a fluky incident, ultimately the result falls at the feet of the head coach. Chalking up Weah's lack of discipline to the rogue actions of a single player is reductive, as it is Berhalter's job to prepare his side for the obvious wind-up tactics Panama employed.\n\nFurthermore, the U.S. could still have taken the game to Panama down a man but decided instead to bunker and absorb pressure. After the loss, Berhalter peddled that the tactic largely worked -- but the result ended in defeat, and thus his approach failed.\n\nElimination from the Copa America group stage with the most talented team the U.S. has ever had is unacceptable, and his reaction after the match proves Berhalter is too process-oriented to handle a tournament where results are all that matter.\n\nMORE: Breaking down Gregg Berhalter's record as USMNT head coach\n\nThe 2024 Copa America was the final chance before the coming World Cup for the United States men to prove themselves capable of a signature win against top global contenders in a competitive environment.\n\nAnd they blew it.\n\nThe USMNT got one game as desperate underdogs against Uruguay and fell short, unable to even secure another opportunity against one of the top CONMEBOL nations on their side of the bracket.\n\nNow, stuck without any competitive football (barring the CONCACAF Nations League and Gold Cup) until the 2026 World Cup begins, the U.S. must press forward knowing they've wasted their only chances for true growth.\n\nWhile Berhalter has largely led the USMNT to North American control, especially by establishing dominance over Mexico, the most glaring hole in his head coaching tenure is the lack of a signature competitive win on the global stage.\n\nBerhalter's two most impressive results as USMNT head coach are both draws -- one a scoreless draw against England in the 2022 World Cup group stage and the other a 1-1 draw against Brazil in the Copa America warmup matches. Meanwhile, he has failed to secure a single victory against any nation in the top 15 of the FIFA rankings not named Mexico.\n\nWith the U.S. set to host the 2026 FIFA World Cup with Mexico and Canada, the USMNT had aimed to be a legitimate global contender by this stage in the process. Instead, the team has yet to break into the upper echelon of football nations.\n\nNobody expects the U.S. to be on the level of France, Spain, or Argentina, but proving they are capable of beating nations such as those on a given night is essential heading into the most important tournament of the federation's existence. They have yet to do so -- Berhalter had ample time to build towards that goal, but he couldn't manage it.\n\nWhile questions have begun to creep in the aftermath of the early Copa America exit, make no mistake -- this is the most talented USMNT team that has ever taken the field.\n\nIn a friendly against Colombia earlier this summer, the United States men deployed a starting lineup of 11 players all contracted to clubs in Big 5 European leagues, which had never happened in the team's history. That doesn't happen by accident -- the players have earned their places at that level.\n\nYet it feels as if this crop of players has hit a proverbial ceiling with the national team. Weston McKennie has stagnated despite a bright season with Juventus. Folarin Balogun hasn't lit up the scoresheets as anticipated. And Chris Richards has not been able to translate his growth at Crystal Palace to growth at the national team.\n\nIt seems as if only Christian Pulisic has managed to translate his strong club form to the national team level, while Gio Reyna is the only player whose USMNT form has been immune to struggles at the club level.\n\nOne of Berhalter's biggest strengths as USMNT head coach has been an ability to secure the commitment of talented dual nationals over other international sides, but his ability to then get the most out of their ability has been shaky at best.\n\nOne of the most glaring revelations from the USMNT's early Copa America exit came in the mixed zone as Tim Ream chatted with reporters after defeat to Uruguay left them out in the cold.\n\nThe 36-year-old defender, a veteran of the U.S. national team, was asked what the team was missing from its day-to-day activities. His answer was a -- likely unintended -- glaring condemnation of the Berhalter regime.\n\n\"I think we need more focus, more intensity from every single training session, demanding more from each other,\" he said. \"I think we need more guys who are willing to step forward and take over games. It's a fantastic group as everybody knows, and one that's very very close, but sometimes the intensity falls through the cracks.\n\n\"We just have to continue to put our heads down and continue to work, and continue to be humble enough to know that there are things that we can continue to improve every single day, every single training session, every single game. If guys have that mindset, they can continue to be on an upward trajectory -- when we start to think that we're a finished product then guys are going to start to stagnate and stay at the level they're at instead of pushing on and stepping up again.\"\n\nEssentially, Ream is insinuating that the team has become so close-knit that they have let their guard down and lacked the desire to improve further.\n\nOne of the biggest arguments for retaining Berhalter last summer was that the players vociferously backed their World Cup boss, and their voices eventually won the day. It appears as if their comfort level with Berhalter is actually becoming a negative, as the head coach has failed to sufficiently put the players under pressure to continue improving.\n\nOne common theme often spouted by detractors of national team coaches is that handing an international boss a second (or third or fourth) cycle is a losing proposition. It's a reductive argument that's nearly impossible to support, but it is rooted in some kind of warped truth.\n\nWhile coaches can be tasked with multiple World Cup cycles, coaches are often incapable of achieving multiple steps of growth within a national team's long-term plan.\n\nBerhalter successfully achieved a number of objectives directly in front of him at the time he was hired, including building a talented pool of young players and achieving dominance within CONCACAF.\n\nDetractors like to point out that the U.S. finished third in 2022 World Cup qualifying and saw Canada progress further in the Copa America, which are both truths in a vacuum. But the U.S. has managed to overpower Mexico, Canada and nearly every other CONCACAF nation in the region when the larger picture is reviewed.\n\nYet with that step of the growth process achieved, expecting Berhalter to then lead the charge toward the next rung on the ladder was a losing battle.\n\nTo put it bluntly, U.S. Soccer cannot get anything wrong in the lead-up to the 2026 FIFA World Cup.\n\nThe coming tournament on home soil is the most important men's competition in the federation's history. This is the chance to blow the sport wide open in this country and energize a fanbase at a level never previously reached in the United States -- but they can only achieve that goal with a positive performance.\n\nA flop at the 2026 World Cup would be a devastating missed opportunity for the sport's growth in this country, leaving the trajectory of the national team twisting in the wind and decades behind where it could have been.\n\nThus, while Berhalter is a good coach who has plenty of merits as USMNT boss, the recent shortcomings left U.S. Soccer with no choice but to make a change, as failure in two years' time is quite simply not an option. Now it's up to the federation to nail the coming hire and take this sport in the United States to a level that's never before been achieved.", "source": {"uri": "sportingnews.com", "dataType": "news",

Doug McIntyre of FOX Sports was the first to report the news.\n\nThe 50-year-old former USMNT player had been a lightning rod of controversy since late 2022 despite leading his country back to the FIFA Men's World Cup and into the knockout stage of the tournament that year.\n\nDespite a controversy surrounding midfielder Gio Reyna and his parents, Berhalter's former USMNT teammate Claudio and longtime Berhalter family friend Danielle, after that World Cup run, Berhalter was re-hired to his job by new U.S. Soccer Federation sporting director Matt Crocker in June 2023. The U.S. had a mixed run of results in the 13 months since, however, capped off by a disastrous group stage exit in the 2024 Copa Am\u00e9rica on home soil.\n\nStill, \"FOX Soccer Now\"'s Melissa Ortiz said Berhalter deserves credit for how he ushered in the current generation of USMNT stars and returning the team back to the World Cup after the U.S. infamously missed qualification in 2018. Despite that, she's not surprised by the move given what happened in Berhalter's last few games at the helm and the urgency around the team less than two years away from the 2026 FIFA Men's World Cup, which the U.S. will co-host.\n\n\"Based off the performance of the U.S. Men's National Team, it was a failure in this Copa Am\u00e9rica. They expected to go, clearly at least to the the semifinal, and they didn't do it,\" Ortiz said. \"At the end of the day, I think we have to respect U.S. Soccer's decision. I bet a lot of fans are happy with it just from what we see on the internet.\n\n\"But you have to applaud Gregg Berhalter's time for what he did with these players. He put this young roster together and made it to the World Cup after not being in the World Cup [in 2018]. But I think U.S. Soccer took the right steps forward to ... lead into the most important tournament in the world hosted on on home soil.\"\n\nOrtiz's co-host, former USMNT defender Jimmy Conrad, said that according to people from within U.S. Soccer, Berhalter also had detractors from within the federation. Additionally, Conrad pointed out, Berhalter ultimately failed to silence his critics on the field the way England's oft-criticized manager Gareth Southgate has by returning his side to a second consecutive European Championship final.\n\n[Related: England advances to Euro 2024 finals on thrilling injury-time goal]\n\n\"What's interesting for Gregg is had he left this position right after the World Cup [and not returned], I think his stock would have been pretty high,\" Conrad said. \"He had a young team, the youngest team at the 2022 World Cup, got them out of the group, had them get into the round of 16, where they lost to a very good [Netherlands] team. And I feel like he could have maybe parlayed that into something bigger back on the club scene, whatever it may be. Now, I feel like there is some negativity swirling around him.\n\n\"There were people claiming within U.S. Soccer that that Gregg was 'radioactive,' that he's a lightning rod -- you like him or you don't like him, there's really no in between. And so they ultimately made a decision and had cause to do that we didn't get out of our group [at Copa Am\u00e9rica], but Gareth Southgate on the flip side is getting England to the [Euro 2020 and 2024] finals. So despite all that criticism, his teams are still performing, which the U.S. didn't have.\"\n\nNow, all eyes turn to who Crocker and the U.S. Soccer Federation will hire to replace Berhalter and guide the USMNT into arguably the most important World Cup in its history.", "source": {"uri": "foxsports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "FOX Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregg_Berhalter", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gregg Berhalter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Soccer_Federation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Soccer Federation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_men's_national_soccer_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States men's national soccer team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giovanni_Reyna", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Giovanni Reyna"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melissa_Ortiz", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Melissa Ortiz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sporting_director", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sporting director"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Conrad", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jimmy Conrad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Sports", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fox Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cap_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cap (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Broadcasting_Company", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fox Broadcasting Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copa_Am\u00e9rica", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Copa Am\u00e9rica"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-elimination_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Single-elimination tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gareth_Southgate", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gareth Southgate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "England national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_European_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "UEFA European Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONCACAF", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONCACAF", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Competitions", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONMEBOL", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONMEBOL", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Non-FIFA_Nations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Non-FIFA Nations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://a57.foxsports.com/statics.foxsports.com/www.foxsports.com/content/uploads/2024/07/1408/814/GGGOut.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9720115", "eventUri": "eng-9720115", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 192, "relevance": 1}

But throughout the first 10 months of his second stint, it became clear that the USMNT had stagnated.\n\nAs the team trudged toward an earlier-than-expected Copa Am\u00e9rica exit, fans chanted: \"Fire Gregg!\" At least two official U.S. supporters' groups, the American Outlaws and Barra 76, soon called for Berhalter's ouster.\n\nAfter what it called a \"comprehensive\" post-tournament review, U.S. Soccer, led by sporting director Matt Crocker, relieved Berhalter of his duties.\n\nThey will now search for a replacement to lead the USMNT toward and at the 2026 World Cup, which the United States is co-hosting, and which represents an opportunity to, as Berhalter would often say, \"change soccer in America forever.\"\n\nFans will fantasize about a big-name hire, such as J\u00fcrgen Klopp, who recently left Liverpool and said he \"probably will not be a manager again.\" Others who'll be mentioned include Thierry Henry and Mauricio Pochettino.\n\nAmong the more reasonable candidates would be domestic coaches like Steve Cherundolo or experienced international coaches like Herv\u00e9 Renard, the Frenchman who has said he will leave the France women's national team after the upcoming Olympics because he is eying a third men's World Cup. (He coached Morocco and Saudi Arabia at the last two.)\n\nBerhalter, meanwhile, will most likely return to club soccer, in MLS or abroad. He also could look for another national team job outside the U.S.\n\nHe first took charge of the USMNT in December 2018, one year after its modern-era nadir, the failure to qualify for the 2018 World Cup. In his first year on the job, he struggled to adapt to the international game, and to fill gaps in a player pool that had arguably sunk to its weakest point in over a decade. The U.S. lost to Jamaica and Venezuela that June; lost to Mexico in the Gold Cup final; got embarrassed by Mexico in a friendly two months later, and then by Canada in the CONCACAF Nations League a month after that.\n\nThen came the COVID-19 pandemic, and a mostly empty 2020. By the time international soccer fully resumed, those gaps in the player pool had begun to fill in. Christian Pulisic, Weston McKennie and Tyler Adams had matured. Gio Reyna, Tim Weah and eventually others emerged. A so-called \"golden generation\" took shape.\n\nTo some extent, it fell into Berhalter's lap. But he also worked intentionally to usher it into the national team and build strong chemistry, a \"brotherhood,\" within it and around it. He recruited multi-nationals like Sergi\u00f1o Dest and Yunus Musah to join it. In June 2021, they broke through, beating Mexico in a chaotic Nations League final -- the first of what would become three consecutive titles in that competition, and the first of seven games unbeaten against their archrival.\n\nIn World Cup qualifiers beginning that fall, they wobbled, but responded when necessary in Honduras and at home. They went to Qatar for the 2022 World Cup, drew England and Wales, beat Iran, and lost to the Netherlands in the Round of 16. It was an acceptable result. To some, including then-U.S. Soccer sporting director Earnie Stewart, it had been a successful campaign. Berhalter left Qatar as a favorite to retain the job for a second cycle.\n\nWhat happened next came to define, delay and linger over his now-terminated second cycle. He went to a leadership summit in New York and told a now-infamous story about Reyna. He didn't name Reyna, but when the story got published (without Berhalter's knowledge or permission), dots got connected. Reyna's parents went to Berhalter's boss, Stewart. Their mention of a decades-old domestic violence incident involving Berhalter and his then-girlfriend, now-wife, sparked an investigation, and left Berhalter in limbo for six months.\n\nBerhalter's first contract expired at the end of 2022. As the investigation played out, Stewart left U.S. Soccer, leaving the federation's sporting department rudderless. As it searched for Stewart's successor, who would lead the now-on-hold USMNT coaching search -- and even after it settled on Crocker in April 2023 -- the external assumption was that Berhalter would not be rehired.\n\nBut in June, after a murky search heavy on buzzwords and light on known candidates -- and as interim coach B.J. Callaghan, a Berhalter assistant, was leading the USMNT to a Nations League title -- U.S. Soccer brought Berhalter back.\n\nHe retook charge in August. But throughout the fall and spring, he failed to meet rising expectations.\n\n\"If we continue to develop in the way that we have,\" Berhalter said at his reintroductory news conference last June, and \"if this group continues to go where we think they can go, the sky's the limit.\" Instead, they flat-lined, or perhaps even regressed. They had grown from the 34th best team in the world at the onset of the Berhalter era to 14th, per Elo ratings, entering 2022. They are now back down to No. 31.\n\nThey lost to Germany in their first big second-cycle test. They needed a \"miraculous\" own goal to save face against Jamaica in March. They beat Mexico again, but it has since become apparent that this Mexico team, which also slumped out of its Copa Am\u00e9rica group, is the worst in decades.\n\nA 5-1 loss to Colombia followed. It was a \"wake-up call\" that shouldn't have been necessary. A 1-1 draw with Brazil stabilized the USMNT entering Copa Am\u00e9rica. But a quarterfinal berth was the minimum expectation. The U.S. didn't meet it. The failure was heavily influenced by Tim Weah's red card against Panama. But the trend had become obvious. And now, the Berhalter era is over.", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Here are 16 replacements for Berhalter", "body": "It's clear the U.S. men's national team needs a new direction. Since the 2022 World Cup, when the USMNT exited in the round of 16 against a superior Netherlands side, there has been little to no evidence of progression. In fact, it looks like the USMNT has been regressing over the past two years.\n\nRecent subpar results have been largely papered over, and everyone continued to believe the talent level of this U.S. side alone is enough. A second-leg loss to Trinidad & Tobago in the Concacaf Nations League didn't matter because the USMNT advanced on aggregate anyway. A terrible performance against Jamaica in the Nations League ended with the Americans being bailed out by a last-minute Jamaica own goal. The 5-1 shellacking by Colombia was \"only\" a pre-Copa America friendly.\n\nBut after the USMNT got knocked out in the group stage of the Copa America following losses to Panama and Uruguay -- plus a not-big-enough win over lowly Bol\u00edvia -- those previous poor performances look like ignored warning signs.\n\nWhenever the discussion of moving on from head coach Gregg Berhalter has come up, it has inevitably turned to: \"Well, who is going to replace him?\" The prevailing narrative has been that there aren't any coaches better than Berhalter whom the U.S. Soccer Federation can try to hire.\n\nWith that in mind, ESPN reporters/analysts Jeff Carlisle, Luis Miguel Echegaray, Cesar Hernandez, Lizzy Becherano, Tim Vickery, Caitlin Murray and Bill Connelly offer up 16 candidates U.S. Soccer should consider as possible replacements for Berhalter. With a World Cup on U.S. soil coming quickly in 2026, U.S. Soccer has little time to spare.\n\nJurgen Klopp has just about everything U.S. Soccer could wish for in a manager. He has been successful everywhere he has gone, he speaks perfect English and he is as charismatic as they come. He seems precisely the kind of man who will get fans -- both die-hards and those new to the game -- galvanized about the World Cup.\n\nHe's also available after leaving Liverpool at the end of this past season, the 57-year-old stating he no longer had the requisite energy needed to fight for trophies at the highest level of the game. But a national team gig might be a decent fit for him. There wouldn't be the daily demands that a club job would have, and the USMNT is currently at a low ebb, leaving plenty of upside with what is still viewed as a talented roster.\n\nNow, to be clear, hiring Klopp is still the stuff of fantasy, even if former U.S. goalkeeper Tim Howard, in a column for The Daily Mail, said he'd be willing to \"personally fly to Spain\" in order to convince Klopp to take the job. Klopp's recent Instagram post wishing Americans a happy Fourth of July -- which sent USMNT fans into a tizzy -- probably didn't mean anything.\n\nEven if Klopp were interested, his hiring would almost certainly require the U.S. Soccer to back up the Brinks truck and unload a pile of cash larger than the federation has ever paid a manager. Is that possible? One source with knowledge of U.S. Soccer's thinking said it is, and likened it to college sports in the U.S., where the main entity pays a head coach a base salary and sponsors make up the rest.\n\nBut thinking of something in theory and actually executing a plan are two different things, and the word on the street is that Klopp would still cost way more than U.S. Soccer is willing to spend. If you're U.S. Soccer general manager Matt Crocker, yeah, go ahead and make the call, to be sure. Just don't get your hopes up. -- Jeff Carlisle\n\nIf you can't get Klopp, why not go for one of his proteges? Wagner and Klopp were teammates when the two were at Mainz, and Wagner joined Klopp's staff when the latter joined Borussia Dortmund.\n\nWagner's professional managerial experience has been filled with highs and lows. He took Huddersfield Town into the English Premier League and kept them up for a season, but he couldn't sustain it. There was the brutal spell with Schalke, when the club set records for futility, but that seemed mostly because of the club's upper hierarchy. He was mostly recently with Norwich City but was fired after losing in the promotion playoffs to Leeds United.\n\nMore critically, Wagner, 52, has a connection to the USMNT, having made eight appearances for the squad in the 1990s as one of the team's original dual nationals. He wouldn't be the splashiest hire, but he has plenty of experience, and his preferred high-tempo style of play would seem to be a fit for the USMNT. -- Carlisle\n\nOf the domestic candidates, Cherundolo boasts one of the stronger r\u00e9sum\u00e9s. He spent his entire playing career in Germany with Hannover 96, becoming the \"Mayor of Hannover\" after making over 400 appearances for the club. He was an utterly dependable right back for the U.S. national team, playing in two World Cups.\n\nHe then underwent a lengthy apprenticeship, spending years coaching in the youth ranks before coaching the Las Vegas Lights of the USL Championship before taking over LAFC in 2022. Cherundolo was an immediate hit, leading LAFC to a Supporters' Shield and MLS Cup double in 2022. The following season was tougher, with LAFC losing three finals, but Cherundolo has LAFC back among the league's elite this year.\n\nThe one downside of 45-year-old Cherundolo is he's never been a national team manager, and his r\u00e9sum\u00e9 isn't as varied as others on this list, so he'd be learning on the job to a degree. The team needs someone who can hit the ground running and get ready for the World Cup. -- Carlisle\n\nIf the U.S. wants to stick within the parameters of hiring someone who understands the domestic game and the Concacaf region, then Wilfried Nancy is an obvious choice. He won MLS Cup (the first Black coach to do so) in his first season as Columbus Crew, and he is able to create an exciting type of soccer that thrives on zero excuses mixed with a disciplined, killer-instinct mentality.\n\nBut his immediate and historic success with the Crew is not why I think he would be a good fit. It's the identity that he has instilled with the team. Nancy's strength is that he makes his players become accustomed to the uncomfortable. As the 47-year-old said last year: \"This is something that we do all the time on the pitch: repetition, with clear situations, and also a structure, a defined structure. But within the structure, a lot of creativity within that.\"\n\nIf the USMNT truly wants to beat the very best, the biggest priority is to get comfortable with the uncomfortable. If you want to stick with someone who knows how to do that as well as knows full well what it takes to develop North American talent, then that's Nancy. -- Luis Miguel Echegaray\n\nIf Berhalter was able to make the leap from MLS to the USMNT, then why not Jim Curtin?\n\nThe Philadelphia Union coach has become one of the mainstays of the league and has a knack for making his squads well balanced and greater than the sum of their parts. It's no wonder that of the past four winners of the league's Coach of the Year Award, Curtin has earned the honors twice.\n\nAnd by the way, unlike Berhalter's time on the MLS sideline, 45-year-old Curtin has a Supporters' Shield in hand -- a much more difficult trophy to win than MLS Cup. (Under Curtain, Philly reached the final of MLS Cup in 2022.) At the tournament level, one also shouldn't overlook Curtin's three runs into the U.S. Open Cup finals.\n\nAll that said, the timing would be a bit awkward when you consider just how poor Philadelphia have been in the current MLS season. The Union haven't won since May and are playing far below expectations. The blame shouldn't just be focused on Curtin, but it's undoubtedly not a good look either way. -- Cesar Hernandez\n\nPerez has one of the more intriguing backgrounds among U.S. coaches. Born in the Salvadoran city of Moraz\u00e1n, he spent his youth in both countries before a snub from El Salvador saw him cast his international lot with the U.S., where he went on to make 73 appearances.\n\nHis background as a coach is no less interesting. Perez, 60, managed the U.S. U15 national team from 2012-14, a group that included Christian Pulisic and Tyler Adams. He stressed playing the ball on the ground, something that Pulisic has credited for his technical development.\n\nPerez did some scouting as well, but a falling out with U.S. Soccer saw him depart with some hurt feelings. He later went on to manage El Salvador and the Cuscatlecos punched above their weight for a while, getting to the final round of qualifying during the 2022 cycle before he was fired in 2023.\n\nHis lack of club experience makes for a hole in his r\u00e9sum\u00e9, but his international experience and ties to the U.S. are big pluses. -- Carlisle\n\nPremier League coaches may attract all the attention, with many dreaming of Klopp or Pep Guardiola. But the USMNT needs a coach that possesses the balance of international experience and knowledge of the intricacy of Concacaf. Former Mexican national team head coach Javier Aguirre will never be the obvious choice, but his resume insists he should be considered.\n\nAguirre just led the Spanish team to the Copa del Rey final, mustering the unimpressive roster to compete against Spain's best to reach the last game of the tournament. He saved the team from relegation on three occasions, proving the key to success in football doesn't always have to live and die with individual talent. Maybe he can find a way for the USMNT attack and backline to finally work in perfect unison.\n\nThe 65-year-old previously coached Atletico Madrid, Espanyol and Osasuna, where he was named coach of the year in 2006 by UEFA for his efforts. Aguirre's time in LaLiga obligated him to prepared to face the likes Real Madrid and FC Barcelona at their peak.\n\nAs a player and coach for the Mexican national team, Aguirre understands Concacaf. But it was his experience in taking over the Mexican project twice just months ahead of the World Cup -- and reaching the knockout stage on both occasions in 2002 and 2010 -- that may serve U.S. Soccer best.\n\nWith two years left until the United States hosts the 2026 edition, Aguirre may be one of the few who knows how to take over and succeed. And with Mexican Football Federation currently eyeing Aguirre, the U.S. Soccer may get to enjoy the luxury of stealing a candidate from a direct rival. -- Lizzy Becherano\n\nWhether it be due to his track record of success in Mexico, Greece and South America, or his ability to unify teams and thrive in tournament scenarios, there's a lot to like about Matias Almeyda. The 50-year-old is currently coaching AEK Athens with a contract renewed through 2028, but the draw of leading the U.S. ahead of a home World Cup should be enough to lure him away.\n\nHis profile in North America grew through a few trophies with powerhouse Chivas from 2015 to 2018, netting him coaching awards in Liga MX and Concacaf. It wasn't too long ago when countless fans pushed for him to lead Mexico's national team, which never came to pass.\n\nHe's a motivator, he has titles under his belt, and he already has experience in American soccer, too --- which, to be fair, didn't go as planned as his San Jose Earthquakes side twice missed playoffs. That's the problem for the highly disciplined leader: He has been known to incorporate samurai philosophies, like in his time at MLS.\n\nBut there's a significant difference between the roster depth Almeyda had with the Earthquakes versus what we was up against. Still, many in the American soccer world (and perhaps those in charge at U.S. Soccer as well) won't forget the numerous chaotic matches he found himself in with San Jose. -- Hernandez\n\nGallardo won just about every South American trophy there is to win as manager of River Plate, 14 titles in all, and twice claiming the Copa Libertadores, as well as the Argentine Primera Division in 2021.\n\nThe 48-year-old is something of a tactical chameleon, but with one overarching principle, \"protagonismo,\" which means to take charge of the game.\n\nHe's available after an 18-month stint with Saudi Arabian side Al Ittihad. It seemed a curious landing spot given he was thought to be Europe-bound. He did the same thing as a player, landing with D.C. United for a brief spell late in his career before injuries cut his time short.\n\nMaybe another unexpected choice could see him land with the USMNT. Like Klopp, it would cost U.S. soccer a ton of cash. -- Carlisle\n\nU.S. Soccer is often criticized for being too insular and unwilling to bring in outside hires, instead cycling through the same group of people already within the federation's orbit. So hiring Tab Ramos, a journeyman within U.S. Soccer, wouldn't change any minds about that, but it would follow the playbook that the federation is most comfortable with.\n\nRamos himself has said U.S. Soccer should hire a foreign manager. Last week he told Soccer America: \"We just need somebody to come in for 18 months who knows the World Cup and can prepare this team the best he can to give this team the best shot at having a great World Cup. That's it. No learning-on-the-job person.\"\n\nAside from not being a foreign coach, his argument could apply to himself, too. He led the USMNT U20s to three straight World Cup quarterfinals, the best and most consistent run in the program's history. He has experience coaching some of the players on the senior team right now.\n\nIf there's a reason not to consider him, it's that, since leaving U.S. Soccer shortly after Berhalter was hired at the end of 2018, his stints as head coach at the Houston Dynamo and the Hartford Athletic have not been roaring successes. He's now an assistant coach at the New England Revolution. But just as some great club coaches can't translate their best work to the international game, the opposite can be true. Maybe the international game is where Ramos belongs. -- Caitlin Murray\n\nFew managers are as experienced at international level as the Argentine. He managed Argentina at the 2006 World Cup, and his substitution of Juan Roman Riquelme in the quarterfinal defeat against Germany remains a sore spot with the country's fans, but that team was widely praised for its style.\n\nP\u00e9kerman went on to take the helm of Colombia for the 2014 and 2018 tournaments, where on both occasions he led the Cafeteros to the knockout stages. P\u00e9kerman is unemployed after falling out with the Venezuela Football Federation in 2023.\n\nP\u00e9kerman also led Argentina to the FIFA U-20 World Cup on three different occasions, showing an ability to work with young players. Given that this young generation of U.S. players has seemed to have plateaued at the moment, a wise head like 74-year-old P\u00e9kerman might be what is needed to get the group back on an upward trajectory. -- Carlisle\n\nAnother candidate who ticks a few boxes is Patrick Vieira. He's been a club coach for over eight years, meaning he's no neophyte when it comes to managing in the professional game.\n\nTwo-and-a-half of those eight years were spent in MLS with New York City FC. That familiarity with the U.S. system and its idiosyncrasies is a plus. He's also spent time coaching in Manchester City's academy, as well as their reserve team, giving him a window into player development.\n\nThat said, Vieira's record at club level has seen endure his share of struggles, and last season led Strasbourg to a 13th place finish in Ligue 1.\n\nWould that be enough for U.S. Soccer? The federation did approach Vieira a little over a year ago during the process in which Berhalter was rehired. He was interested in the job, but Vieira told ESPN back then that talks didn't progress. Perhaps he'll get another look this time. -- Carlisle\n\nHerv\u00e9 Renard might seem like a left-field choice because his latest gig was with the French women's national team, where he steered them to a World Cup quarterfinal last year. But prior to that, he's been a men's soccer coach, perhaps most memorably leading the Saudi Arabia side that beat Lionel Messi's Argentina in the 2022 World Cup. (Argentina went on to win the whole tournament.)\n\nHe's coached all over the world, with a mix of club and international experience, including leading Zambia and Ivory Coast to wins at the Africa Cup of Nations in 2012 and 2015, respectively. Perhaps more important than his r\u00e9sum\u00e9, he's been lauded for his player management -- something it seems like the USMNT needs with its recent string of players getting silly red cards out of anger. It also feels like U.S. Soccer wants to skew younger for the USMNT manager, and at 55, Renard is at the stage of his career where he has plenty of experience but shouldn't be out of touch with his players, either.\n\nIt has felt that, ever since Jurgen Klinsmann's mercurial time at the helm, U.S. Soccer has preferred an American coach, but the federation ought to prioritize a coach with a proven track record in international soccer who understands the rhythm of big tournaments. -- Murray\n\nIt is hard to think of a better choice to step in as U.S. national team coach than Mauricio Pochettino. He ticks all the boxes, with the added advantage of being available after parting ways with Chelsea in May and, after a few years of accumulating frustrations as a club coach, he could well be open to the prospect of taking charge of a national team.\n\nIn his time in the Premier League, Pochettino has acquired the prerequisite knowledge of working in the Anglo-Saxon world. Combined with his Argentine roots and his experience working with top class players from all over the world, Pochettino should be a very interesting candidate for a team like the U.S.\n\nPersonal relations have often been his strong point. The Copa America serves as a foretaste and as a warning of the pressures of playing at home in a World Cup -- a big friendly bear-like figure, Pochettino would ease the pressure on a young team. He has an excellent track record with young players -- and this is a youthful USA team -- and his front-footed tactical approach is a nice fit with the type of football the side are capable of playing.\n\nPlus -- always an asset at international level -- he has experience of tournament life as a player. The USA could do much worse than appoint 52-year-old Pochettino -- and it is hard to see how they could do much better. -- Tim Vickery\n\nThomas Tuchel has never given any indication that he would be interested in a national team gig, much less a gig in the States. But such a job would fit him like a glove.\n\nTaking over the USMNT would emphasize maybe his single greatest strength: coming up with a strong tactical plan for a specific match or matchup. And it would mitigate what sure seems to have become his most frustrating trait from a club perspective: complaining incessantly about what his team lacks and nagging his bosses to fix it.\n\nYou have what you have at the national team level, and Tuchel would be forced to build tactics to suit the team's strengths and weaknesses. What's not to like about that (aside from the money it would probably take to get his attention)?\n\nIt's obvious why U.S. Soccer would want him -- leading teams to winning the UEFA Champions League, the Bundesliga and Ligue 1 is just the start. But as unlikely as this seems, it's not impossible to think Tuchel, 50, could get on board with it, too. He is available after leaving Bayern Munich. -- Bill Connelly\n\nLet's be clear about something: The Premier League's elite, like Klopp or Guardiola, is not happening. Forget about it. But what if I told you that even though the best managers in the game are out of reach, you can still get someone who at the very least manages at the highest levels of the game and suits everything the USMNT wants to do on the pitch?\n\nPresenting: Thomas Frank. Yes, I know. He has a contract with Brentford until 2027 so it's not the most realistic situation. But is it impossible? The federation has to be ambitious and gamble because they really can't afford to get it wrong in 2026. Speaking of which, seeing as they don't have to qualify for the World Cup, maybe there's some time to persuade Brentford -- a club who is always three steps ahead -- to consider something.\n\nIn terms of tactics, this is a no-brainer. Frank, 50, easily adapts between 4-3-3 and 3-5-2, loves to use his wing backs both out wide and in central positions (Antonee Robinson would thrive here), and prioritizes a strong triangle in the middle with energetic box-to-box midfielders. The likes of Yunus Musah, Weston McKennie and Tyler Adams would benefit tremendously. -- Echegaray", "source": {"uri": "espn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ESPN.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

(AP Photo/Julio Cortez)NEW YORK (AP) - Gregg Berhalter was fired as U.S. men's soccer coach on Wednesday after his team's first-round exit from the Copa America flamed doubts he was the right person to remain in charge for the 2026 World Cup, a person familiar with the decision told The Associated Press. The person spoke on condition of anonymity Wednesday because the U.S. Soccer Federation had not yet made the announcement. The person said an announcement was likely for later Wednesday. Berhalter's second term as coach was cut short 10 months after he returned to the bench with high hopes and proclaimed the team's goal was \"to change soccer in America forever.\"\u009d The U.S. had seven wins, six losses and one draw in his second stint, leaving his overall record at 44 wins, 17 losses and 13 draws. Sporting director Matt Crocker rehired Berhalter and also will make the recommendation on his replacement. The team next plays in September friendlies against Canada and New Zealand. J\u00c3\u00bcrgen Klopp, Thierry Henry and Marcelo Bielsa are among those being speculated about as candidates to replace Berhalter, along with Jesse Marsch, Hugo P\u00e9rez, Pellegrino Matarazzo, David Wagner, Steve Cherundolo, Jim Curtain, Massimiliano Allegri and Mauricio Pochettino. Salary could be an issue. Berhalter earned $2,291,136 in 2022, including $900,000 in bonuses for the Americans qualifying for the World Cup and reaching the second round. A top-level men's coach could put pressure on the USSF to increase the salary of newly hired women's coach Emma Hayes. Just 23 months remain before the World Cup comes to the United States for the second time and the Americans play their opener at Inglewood, California, on June 12, 2026. The only competitive matches with the full player pool before then likely will be in the CONCACAF Nations League. Berhalter, who turns 51 on Aug. 1, was the first American to coach the national team after playing for the team at a World Cup. He was hired to coach the U.S. in December 2018 after stints with Sweden's Hammarby (2011-13) and Major League Soccer's Columbus Crew (2013-18). He led the U.S. to titles in the CONCACAF Nations League in 2020, 2023 and 2024 and to another with a B team in the 2021 CONCACAF Gold Cup. His players strongly supported Berhalter, saying he fostered a culture that bound the group. That support led to Crocker rehiring Berhalter five months after his initial contract expired amid an investigation of a decades-old domestic violence allegation that was brought to the USSF's attention by the Reyna family, which was upset that Berhalter limited Gio Reyna's playing time at the World Cup. A law firm retained by the USSF said there was no legal obstacle to bringing Berhalter back. His detractors cited lack of success against teams outside the region and struggles on the road against Central American rivals. The U.S. gained the region's final automatic World Cup berth on goal difference, and it had the second-youngest team at the 2022 tournament in Qatar. The U.S. wasted a second-half lead in a 1-1 draw with Wales, tied England 0-0 and defeated Iran 1-0 to reach the knockout stage, where the Americans played poorly in a 3-1 loss to the Netherlands. Players exhibited a lack of discipline: Defender Sergi\u00c3\u00b1o Dest got a red card last November at Trinidad and Tobago for arguing with a referee and winger Tim Weah was ejected from the Panama match for punching an opponent on the head. U.S. coaches have not fared well in a second cycle. Bruce Arena led the team to a quarterfinal appearance in 2002, its best since 1930, then failed to advance past the group stage in 2006. Bob Bradley's team reached the second round in 2010, earning him a four-year contract extension only for the USSF to fire him 11 months later after the Americans wasted a two-goal lead and lost to Mexico in the CONCACAF Gold Cup final. Jurgen Klinsmann replaced him and led the team to the second round of the 2014 World Cup, then was fired after opening the final round of 2018 qualifying with a 2-1 home loss to Mexico and a 4-0 defeat at Costa Rica. Arena returned and the U.S. lost at Trinidad and Tobago on the final day of qualifying, ending a run of seven straight World Cup appearances. While the new coach inherits players such as Christian Pulisic, Weston McKennie and Tyler Adams who have thrived with European clubs, goalkeepers Matt Turner and Ethan Horvath and Reyna have failed to gain playing time with first-tier teams. ___ AP soccer:", "source": {"uri": "medicinehatnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Medicine Hat News"}, "authors": [{"uri":

They see this potential move as a way to galvanize the United States to go from an otherwise boring and lackluster team to a side with an identity. He did that at Liverpool, as the Reds finished in the top three clubs in goal-scoring in each of Klopp's full seasons at Anfield. His method of achieving that feat can translate well to the USMNT, which may have the squad to suit his noted playing style.\n\nAt Borussia Dortmund, the German tactician paved the way with Gegenpressing, an aggressive form of defending where a team slams the opposition in their half. In other words, as soon as Dortmund or Liverpool would lose the ball, Klopp's tactics would heavily press the opposition in the opposition's half. Fast and physical players like Roberto Firmino, Sadio Mane and Mohamed Salah were equally important to the defense as they were their attack. In Klopp's words, the philosophy is that it makes the opponent instantly vulnerable. They fail to get players behind the ball, and their defense is more open to attack.\n\nThe United States men's national team has the potential to use much of the same tactics that Klopp used at Liverpool. Some of Gregg Berhalter's tactics with the USMNT wanted to press like Klopp. In an ideal world under Berhalter, that would have made the USMNT a force. However, Berhalter has always been someone to lean on the side of defense. Perhaps it is the fear of making a mistake, but Berhalter has prioritized defensive stability and possession while the athleticism of the United States does not suit this style.\n\nKlopp would not be afraid to take risks with the USMNT. He certainly was not with Liverpool, and it paid major dividends. The immediate concern is if the USMNT has the players that can work under Klopp's system. In many ways, that answer is yes.\n\nAt Liverpool, it would be relatively easy for Liverpool to go out and buy a player that fits Klopp's eye. It did so with Luis Diaz when Sadio Mane left for Bayern Munich. Moreover, in the midfield, Fabinho's ability to tackle and stop any attacks before they reached the Liverpool defense was pivotal. There are many similarities between the teams that won the lot with Liverpool and the current crop of USMNT players. Albeit this is without the same top-tier talent.\n\nA front three of Salah-Firmino-Mane dominated Europe and the Premier League. That trifecta had a willingness to run and press at any opportunity, which is vital to Klopp. For the USMNT, Christian Pulisic is, like Mohamed Salah, the side's best player. While he is offensively gifted, Pulisic's tenacity can work wonders in Klopp's system. Upon winning the ball back, Pulisic is direct. He does not squander the opportunity for an attack by looking to pass the ball to his defense or midfield. His 131 progressive carries in Serie A last season ranked fourth in the league.\n\nThe challenge will be filling the other three sides of that triumvirate. Roberto Firmino had the uncanny ability to defend in Klopp's system, a trait that modern strikers often lack. Klopp often called Firmino one of the most important players he had at his disposal despite Mane and Salah earning the plaudits. The knack for pressing, off-ball running and his role as a connector, as Klopp put it, were far more important than his goal output.\n\nThe USMNT will struggle to find a player who is so willing to defend. Although there are several options, Balogun could remain the option. Sometimes missing the scoring touch, Balogun has thrived in off-ball movement. He can get into the scoring chances, even if they do not succeed every time.\n\nOn the final side of the front three, Tim Weah is a natural fit. He spent time as a wing-back in his first season at Juventus, so defense is not an issue. He can fit the Gegenpressing narrative that Klopp preaches.\n\nWhile the front three has been crucial, it is not alone in Klopp's success. Liverpool sprayed balls into the box to create opportunities via the sensational play from Andry Robertson and Trent Alexander-Arnold. This is another area where Klopp can easily shift to the United States. Antonee Robinson and Sergi\u00f1o Dest are two of the USMNT's standout players. Like Robertson and Alexander-Arnold, Robinson and Dest are often subject to defensive miscues as they focus on going forward. However, for Klopp's purposes, it is sensible.\n\nFor each of the past five seasons, Liverpool has either been first or second in total crosses in the Premier League. It led that category in a three-season stretch before this most recent campaign. Much of that comes from Alexander-Arnold and Robertson. The full-back duo have each featured in the top ten crosses in Premier League play for three of the last four seasons.\n\nRobinson did not have the same quantity of crosses as those two, as he is more known as a one-on-one defender. Still, 132 crosses for Fulham is a strong statistic. He has shown a willingness to press forward in the attack in the same way Robertson has done for Liverpool.\n\nOn the right, Dest and Alexander-Arnold both look more like midfielders or wingers than they do defenders. For Alexander-Arnold, that stems from an otherworldly passing ability. Dest relies more on individual flair, a trait that Klopp has not overly thrived on. Regardless, Dest is crucial to the USMNT attack, and Klopp could make necessary changes to his squad to incorporate Dest.\n\nThere are inherent inefficacies in the USMNT squad if Klopp were to take over. An uneasy defense is apparent, particularly compared to a player like Virgil van Dijk who was a wall in Klopp's side. Some of the USMNT players may not be as willing to press in the opponent's half. Additionally, Klopp will not have the same time that he had at club level to install his tactics with the USMNT.\n\nHowever, if there is one thing to learn, it is that the idea of pressing and being aggressive across the pitch works. Marcelo Bielsa is having success with Uruguay with his tactics, which are similar to Klopp, that unseated the USMNT. By comparison, Berhalter's propensity to possess the ball backfired with a defense that struggled to make effective passes. Klopp can change their fortunes around with the group of players that would be at his disposal for the 2026 World Cup.\n\nLast but not least, perhaps Klopp's greatest strength is man management. The players respect him and work tirelessly to accomplish his goals. Sometimes that means making tough decisions, but the players respect that. With Berhalter, there were many too incidents where players acted out in games which ultimately hurt the entire team. Klopp won't tolerate that in his squad. Instead, he'll garner more from his squad.", "source": {"uri": "worldsoccertalk.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "World Soccer Talk"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The U.S. won two CONCACAF Nations League finals and one Gold Cup under Berhalter, who finished with an 44-17-13 record in five years as coach.\n\n\"I want to thank Gregg for his hard work and dedication to U.S. Soccer and our men's national team,\" U.S. Soccer president Cindy Parlow Cone said in a statement.\n\n\"We are now focused on working with our sporting director Matt Crocker and leveraging his experience at the highest levels of the sport to ensure we find the right person to lead the USMNT into a new era of on-field success.\"\n\n\"Our immediate focus is on finding a coach who can maximize our potential as we continue to prepare for the 2026 World Cup, and we have already begun our search process,\" Crocker said in a statement as part of the federation's announcement.\n\nThe U.S. team went into the Copa Am\u00e9rica with huge hopes to build momentum ahead of the 2026 World Cup. The Americans were expected to emerge from a group that included CONMEBOL minnow Bolivia, CONCACAF rival Panama and tournament heavyweight Uruguay. The U.S. downed Bolivia, 2-0, in the opening group stage game, but fell to Panama, 2-1, in the second game after Tim Weah was red carded in the 18th minute. A 1-0 loss to Uruguay in the group finale eliminated the U.S. from the competition.\n\nThe U.S. is the first host country of the Copa Am\u00e9rica since the tournament went to a single host country in 1987 to be eliminated in the group stage.\n\nAfter the tournament, Crocker issued a statement saying, \"Our tournament performance fell short of our expectations. We must do better. We will be conducting a comprehensive review of our performance in Copa America and how best to improve the team and results as we look towards the 2026 World Cup.\" That review took approximately nine days to complete, and in the end Crocker decided to part ways with the coach he brought back only one year ago.\n\nThe question now pivots to where Crocker will look to replace Berhalter. While fans took to social media to hope for former Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp, that seems more fantasy than reality. There could be some intriguing names out there for the U.S. to chase, including Patrick Vieira, who coached in MLS with NYCFC and is now at Strasbourg in France's Ligue 1; England manager Gareth Southgate, whose team is in the European Championship semifinals, and former Spurs, Paris Saint-Germain and Chelsea manager Mauricio Pochettino.\n\n\"I think now we're in a better place to have much more of a targeted search where I'll be more inclined to go hard and go early with specific candidates that I feel meet the criteria that we're looking for,\" Crocker said in an interview with a small group of reporters on Wednesday. He said the aim is to have a coach in place in time for the September window. He has a contingency plan in place, he said, if that isn't possible, but the plan is to aggressively go after candidates with that goal in mind.\n\nCrocker said he spoke with the heads of all departments within the men's national team program, as well as the player leadership group to inform them of the announcement.\n\nWhen asked why he determined Berhalter was no longer the right voice to lead the program forward, he pointed to results as the main factor. \"Five years is a long time and there's been a lot of building blocks that have been put in place,\" Crocker said.\n\n\"It was a very, very young group originally and there has been progress made, but now is the time to turn that progress into winning. So when I specifically looked at the results in Copa Am\u00e9rica -- and we could all turn around and make excuses that I'm not going to make around certain decisions that didn't go our way in that tournament -- but ultimately we needed to have found a way to win. We did have some clear benchmarks of where we wanted to get to in that tournament, and we didn't achieve that. Ultimately that had a significant weight on my decision.\"\n\nBerhalter's initial contract with the U.S. ran through the end of 2022. Berhalter led the U.S. through the last cycle, qualified for the World Cup after the U.S. missed the tournament in 2018, and the team advanced to the round of 16 before falling to the Netherlands\n\nBerhalter's return came as a surprise to some considering the circumstances of his departure. While the U.S. performance in Qatar was largely praised Berhalter's contract was allowed to expire after the World Cup in part because of issues with one of the team's young stars. Winger Gio Reyna was nearly sent home from the World Cup due to his behavior after being informed he would not be a starter in the opening game against Wales. Reyna's lack of effort in subsequent training sessions nearly led to his dismissal from the team, but Berhalter opted to keep him in Qatar.\n\nAfter the tournament, however, he spoke about those issues without naming Reyna during the Q&A portion of a leadership conference that was operating under Chatham House rules, which typically meant any comments were off the record. Those comments were published, however, and The Athletic reported that Reyna was the player about whom Berhalter spoke.\n\nAfter those stories, Reyna's parents, former U.S. national players Claudio and Danielle Reyna, longtime friends of Berhalter and his wife, Rosalind Berhalter, reported to former U.S. Soccer sporting director Earnie Stewart an incident from 30 years prior in which Berhalter kicked Rosalind during an argument when the two were freshmen at the University of North Carolina.\n\nThat prompted a U.S. Soccer investigation. The independent investigation eventually found that Berhalter was cleared to be re-hired by U.S. Soccer.\n\nThe U.S. struggled over the past year since Berhalter returned, however.\n\nThey lost to Germany in a friendly in October 2023, fell to Trinidad and Tobago on the road in the Nations League in November 2023, and then needed a late goal and extra time to salvage a win over Jamaica in the Nations League semifinal in March -- though they won the tournament with a 2-0 victory over rival Mexico. A 5-1 friendly loss to Colombia ahead of the Copa Am\u00e9rica set off alarm bells, and though the U.S. bounced back with a 0-0 draw against Brazil, the Copa results fell far short of expectations.\n\nIn the end, the U.S. lost six of the 14 games under Berhalter since he returned to the sidelines in September 2023.\n\nThe win over Bolivia was Berhalter's 44th win as U.S. manager, moving him past Bob Bradley into sole possession of third all-time. He trails only Bruce Arena (81 wins/148 games) and Jurgen Klinsmann (55 wins/98 games). Berhalter finished with a 29-9-7 record in 45 matches in official competition.\n\nAfter his side's elimination from the Copa, Berhalter said: \"We know we're capable of more and in this tournament we didn't show it, it's as simple as that. We look at the stage with the fans and the high level of competition and we should have done better. We'll do a review and figure out what went wrong but it's an empty feeling for now for sure.\"\n\nAsked by The Athletic if he still believed he was the right man and voice to lead the group, Berhalter replied: \"Yes.\"\n\nCaptain Christian Pulisic, who scored in the opening win over Bolivia said the team needed to find a way to rebound after the tournament.\n\n\"It's about getting some rest, regrouping and finding an identity again,\" he said.\n\nThat identity will now be built by a new manager.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"},

The team next plays in September friendlies against Canada and New Zealand.\n\n\"Our immediate focus is on finding a coach who can maximize our potential as we continue to prepare for the 2026 World Cup, and we have already begun our search process,\" Crocker said in a statement.\n\nCrocker and USSF president Cindy Parlow Cone issued statements, but did not immediately make themselves available to media for questions.\n\nJ\u00fcrgen Klopp, Thierry Henry and Marcelo Bielsa are among those being speculated about as candidates to replace Berhalter, along with Jesse Marsch, Hugo P\u00e9rez, Pellegrino Matarazzo, David Wagner, Steve Cherundolo, Jim Curtain, Massimiliano Allegri and Mauricio Pochettino.\n\nSalary could be an issue.\n\nBerhalter earned $2,291,136 in 2022, including $900,000 in bonuses for the Americans qualifying for the World Cup and reaching the second round. A top-level men's coach could put pressure on the USSF to increase the salary of newly hired women's coach Emma Hayes.\n\nJust 23 months remain before the World Cup comes to the United States for the second time and the Americans play their opener at Inglewood, California, on June 12, 2026. The only competitive matches with the full player pool before then likely will be in the CONCACAF Nations League.\n\nBerhalter, who turns 51 on Aug. 1, was the first American to coach the national team after playing for the team at a World Cup. He was hired to coach the U.S. in December 2018 after stints with Sweden's Hammarby (2011-13) and Major League Soccer's Columbus Crew (2013-18).\n\nHe led the U.S. to titles in the CONCACAF Nations League in 2020, 2023 and 2024 and to another with a B team in the 2021 CONCACAF Gold Cup. His players strongly supported Berhalter, saying he fostered a culture that bound the group.\n\nThat support led to Crocker rehiring Berhalter five months after his initial contract expired amid an investigation of a decades-old domestic violence allegation that was brought to the USSF's attention by the Reyna family, which was upset that Berhalter limited Gio Reyna's playing time at the World Cup. A law firm retained by the USSF said there was no legal obstacle to bringing Berhalter back.\n\nHis detractors cited lack of success against teams outside the region and struggles on the road against Central American rivals. The U.S. gained the region's final automatic World Cup berth on goal difference, and it had the second-youngest team at the 2022 tournament in Qatar. The U.S. wasted a second-half lead in a 1-1 draw with Wales, tied England 0-0 and defeated Iran 1-0 to reach the knockout stage, where the Americans played poorly in a 3-1 loss to the Netherlands.\n\nPlayers exhibited a lack of discipline: Defender Sergi\u00f1o Dest got a red card last November at Trinidad and Tobago for arguing with a referee and winger Tim Weah was ejected from the Panama match for punching an opponent on the head.\n\n\"Gregg has earned the respect of everyone within our organization and has played a pivotal role in bringing together a young team and moving the program forward,\" Crocker said in his statement.\n\nU.S. coaches have not fared well in a second cycle.\n\nBruce Arena led the team to a quarterfinal appearance in 2002, its best since 1930, then failed to advance past the group stage in 2006.\n\nBob Bradley's team reached the second round in 2010, earning him a four-year contract extension only for the USSF to fire him 11 months later after the Americans wasted a two-goal lead and lost to Mexico in the CONCACAF Gold Cup final.\n\nJurgen Klinsmann replaced him and led the team to the second round of the 2014 World Cup, then was fired after opening the final round of 2018 qualifying with a 2-1 home loss to Mexico and a 4-0 defeat at Costa Rica. Arena returned and the U.S. lost at Trinidad and Tobago on the final day of qualifying, ending a run of seven straight World Cup appearances.\n\nWhile the new coach inherits players such as Christian Pulisic, Weston McKennie and Tyler Adams who have thrived with European clubs, goalkeepers Matt Turner and Ethan Horvath and Reyna have failed to gain playing time with first-tier teams.\n\n___\n\nAP

The team next plays in September friendlies against Canada and New Zealand.\n\nJ\u00fcrgen Klopp, Thierry Henry and Marcelo Bielsa are among the candidates being speculated as potential replacements for Berhalter, along with Jesse Marsch, Hugo P\u00e9rez, Pellegrino Matarazzo, David Wagner, Steve Cherundolo, Jim Curtain, Massimiliano Allegri and Mauricio Pochettino.\n\nSalary could be a problem, though. Berhalter earned $2.2m in 2022, including $900,000 in bonuses for the Americans qualifying for the World Cup and reaching the second round. A top-level men's coach could put pressure on US Soccer to increase the salary of newly hired women's coach Emma Hayes.\n\nJust 23 months remain before the World Cup comes to the US for the second time and the Americans play their opener at Inglewood, California, on 12 June 2026. The only competitive matches with the full player pool before then likely will be in the Concacaf Nations League.\n\nBerhalter was the first American to coach the national team after playing for the team at a World Cup. He was hired to coach the US in December 2018 after stints with Sweden's Hammarby (2011-13) and Major League Soccer's Columbus Crew (2013-18).\n\nHe led the US to titles in the Concacaf Nations League in 2020, 2023 and 2024 and to another with a B team in the 2021 Concacaf Gold Cup. His players strongly supported Berhalter, saying he fostered a culture that bound the group.\n\nThat support led to Crocker rehiring Berhalter five months after his initial contract expired amid an investigation of a decades-old domestic violence allegation that was brought to the US Soccer's attention by the Reyna family, which was upset that Berhalter limited Gio Reyna's playing time at the World Cup. A law firm retained by US Soccer said there was no legal obstacle to bringing Berhalter back.\n\nHis detractors cited lack of success against teams outside the region and struggles on the road against Central American rivals. Under Berhalter, the US failed to beat a team in the top 25 of Fifa's rankings outside Concacaf.\n\nThe US gained the region's final automatic World Cup berth on goal difference, and it had the second-youngest team at the 2022 tournament in Qatar. The US wasted a second-half lead in a 1-1 draw with Wales, tied England 0-0 and defeated Iran 1-0 to reach the knockout stage, where the US played poorly in a 3-1 loss to the Netherlands.\n\nPlayers exhibited a lack of discipline: Defender Sergi\u00f1o Dest received a red card last November at Trinidad and Tobago for arguing with a referee and winger Tim Weah was sent-off against Panama in a pivotal game at Copa Am\u00e9rica for punching an opponent.\n\nIn general, US coaches have not fared well in a second cycle. Bruce Arena led the team to a quarter-final appearance in 2002, the best since 1930, then failed to advance past the group stage in 2006. Bob Bradley's team reached the second round in 2010, earning him a four-year contract extension only for the US Soccer to fire him 11 months later after the US wasted a two-goal lead and lost to Mexico in the Concacaf Gold Cup final.\n\nJ\u00fcrgen Klinsmann replaced Bradley and led the team to the second round of the 2014 World Cup, then was fired after opening the final round of 2018 qualifying with a 2-1 home loss to Mexico and a 4-0 defeat at Costa Rica. Arena returned and the US lost at Trinidad and Tobago on the final day of qualifying, ending a run of seven straight World Cup appearances.\n\nWhile the new coach inherits players such as Christian Pulisic (Milan), Weston McKennie (Juventus) and Tyler Adams (Bournemouth) who have thrived with European clubs, goalkeepers Matt Turner (Nottingham Forest) and Ethan Horvath (Cardiff) and Reyna (Borussia Dortmund) have failed to gain playing time with first-tier teams.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

How do we do better?\" Berhalter said.\n\n\"It's not the aspirations that we have as a group.

Though many U.S. players play in Europe's highest-profile leagues, in recent national team games they've lacked the required intensity and discipline in big moments.\n\nAs such, there was a growing sense that Berhalter wouldn't be able to get any more out of them. And if you're going to change a manager before a World Cup, especially one you're co-hosting, you can't wait much longer than two years out to do it so that the next boss has enough time.\n\n\" READ MORE: U.S. Soccer had a big decision to make about Gregg Berhalter's future as USMNT manager after the Copa Am\u00e9rica flop\n\nBerhalter departs with a record of 44-13-17 over 74 matches in five and a half years. His wins total ranks No. 3 all time, trailing Bruce Arena's 81 (from 1998-2006 and a brief return from late 2016-17) and Jurgen Klinsmann's 55 (2011-16).\n\nAfter Klinsmann's downfall and Arena's emergency stint, Berhalter inherited a program that had fallen into major trouble. Not only had it failed to qualify for a World Cup for the first time since 1986, but the chemistry and fighting spirit honed over decades on and off the field was gone. Though the U.S. often had less talent than its opponents in World Cups and other big games, it made up for that with intangibles that delivered memorable results from the 1990 World Cup through 2014.\n\nBerhalter took over in December 2018, and his hiring was controversial from the start. His brother Jay was U.S. Soccer's longtime chief commercial officer back then. All involved insisted that Jay was kept out of the process of Gregg's hiring, but Jay had been involved in the hiring of Earnie Stewart as the men's national team's new general manager earlier in the year. (Stewart, a Hall of Fame U.S. player from 1990-2004, had been the Union's sporting director before taking the U.S. men's job.)\n\n\" READ MORE: Why U.S. Soccer was fine with having brothers Gregg and Jay Berhalter hold two of the most important positions in the sport\n\nBerhalter was able to leave that behind by qualifying the U.S. for the 2022 World Cup, and winning many regional tournament titles. He also fixed the chemistry issues and created a rock-solid internal team culture, which took a lot of hard work, and was a successful recruiter of multi-national players including Folarin Balogun, Sergi\u00f1o Dest, and Malik Tillman.\n\nBerhalter further benefitted from U.S. players finally breaking through at big European leagues, including Hershey's Christian Pulisic, Medford's Brenden Aaronson, Weston McKennie, Gio Reyna, Tyler Adams, and more.\n\nWhen the Americans got to the 2022 World Cup, they achieved the same results as their predecessors from 2010 and '14: advancement from the group stage and a loss in the round of 16. Ever since then, there's been an expectation that the team should be able to do more in 2026 with so many of its players in Europe.\n\nOne of those players, Reyna, became the centerpiece of a scandal that led to Berhalter's removal from the helm for the first seven months of 2023. Reyna's poor work ethic two years ago infuriated Berhalter and other players, and nearly led to Reyna's expulsion once the team was already in Qatar.\n\nWhen Berhalter revealed that in a speech to a corporate leadership summit that he thought was off the record, the American soccer community exploded -- and that was just the start. Reyna's parents, former U.S. men's team star Claudio and U.S. women's team player Danielle, threatened to expose a decades-old domestic violence incident committed by Berhalter against his then-future-wife, Rosalind, when she and Danielle were college roommates at the University of North Carolina.\n\nBerhalter confessed to it publicly in January 2023. He had told U.S. Soccer privately the month before, and the governing body launched an investigation. That March, the results were published. It confirmed Berhalter's story, and also exposed the Reynas' many years of trying to unduly influence U.S. Soccer officials on Gio's behalf.\n\n\" READ MORE: A timeline of the Reyna-Berhalter scandal that rocked U.S. soccer\n\nBerhalter's bosses cleared him to return to the job, and some of the team's biggest star players -- including Pulisic, Tim Weah, and Antonee Robinson -- publicly lobbied for his return. Sporting director Matt Crocker was less than two months into his job, deferred to their desire, and reinstalled Berhalter in June 2023.\n\nThat raised the pressure on a team which hasn't often had much of it, whether on the manager or players. When the Copa Am\u00e9rica flameout happened -- a win over lowly Bolivia and losses to Panama and Uruguay -- Berhalter knew his seat was hot.\n\n\"We know that we're capable of more, and in this tournament, we didn't show it,\" he said after the Uruguay game ended the run. \"It is really as simple as that. ... You look at the stage that was set, with the fans in this tournament, with the high level of competition in this tournament, and we should have done better.\"\n\nBerhalter promised the program would review what went wrong, and Crocker made the same promise in a brief statement. Crocker has yet to offer anything other than written statements since the end of the Copa.\n\nIt bears saying that the flop didn't just call Berhalter's tenure into question. It also asked whether many of these much-hyped players are actually better than those of the past.\n\nIf they are to get there, it will be under a new boss.", "source": {"uri": "inquirer.com",

It was also the first time that the USMNT was eliminated from the group stage of a World Cup, Copa Am\u00e9rica or Gold Cup that it hosted.\n\nThe hope had been that the USMNT would use the tournament as a springboard to greater success at the 2026 World Cup, which the U.S. is co-hosting with Canada and Mexico. Instead, the performances at the Copa Am\u00e9rica revealed how little progress the USMNT has made since the 2022 World Cup.\n\nThe decision to remove Berhalter was made by U.S. Soccer sporting director Matt Crocker after a 10-day review process. The process included consultations with president Cindy Parlow Cone, CEO JT Batson, sporting director Matt Crocker, VP of sporting Oguchi Onyewu and members of the Board of Directors.\n\nSources tell ESPN that review included Michael Karon -- who according to the USSF website is a member of the USSF's Professional Leagues Task force -- polling Board members over the last few days to see where they stood as it related to Berhalter's performance and if he should stay.\n\n\"I want to thank Gregg for his hard work and dedication to U.S. Soccer and our Men's National Team,\" said U.S. Soccer President Cindy Parlow Cone. \"We are now focused on working with our Sporting Director Matt Crocker and leveraging his experience at the highest levels of the sport to ensure we find the right person to lead the USMNT into a new era of on-field success.\"\n\nCrocker will lead and has begun the search for Berhalter's replacement.\n\n\"We are deeply grateful to Gregg for his commitment the past five years to the Men's National Team and to U.S. Soccer,\" said Crocker. \"Gregg has earned the respect of everyone within our organization and has played a pivotal role in bringing together a young team and moving the program forward.\n\n\"We wish Gregg all the best in his future endeavors, and we know he will find success in his next coaching position. U.S. Soccer is committed to doing what is necessary to ensure our success on the pitch and we are dedication to fostering a culture that leads to winning.\n\n\"Our immediate focus is on finding a coach who can maximize our potential as we continue to prepare for the 2026 World Cup, and we have already begun our search process.\"\n\nThe failure at the Copa took on even more significance given that as hosts, there will be no World Cup qualifying matches to help the team prepare for the tournament. The Copa Am\u00e9rica was the last opportunity for the U.S. to play competitive fixtures against teams from outside the Concacaf region.\n\nThe only other tournament that the U.S. will participate in between now and 2026 is the 2025 Concacaf Gold Cup. The upcoming September international window will see the U.S. square off against Canada and New Zealand.\n\nExpectations for the USMNT have increased since its respectable showing at the 2022 World Cup, when the U.S. reached the round of 16 with the youngest team in the tournament weighted by minutes played.\n\nBerhalter was re-hired as coach in June 2023 on a contract through the 2026 World Cup, following a six-month investigation sparked by a rift with the Reyna family. But since then the U.S. has struggled to show improvement.\n\nThe USMNT barely got by Jamaica in the semifinals of the Concacaf Nations League last March, when an own-goal in second half stoppage time helped the U.S. escape with a victory in extra time. It also fell to Trinidad & Tobago in the second leg of the quarterfinals of that competition, though the U.S. progressed on aggregate.\n\nThese results, taken together, have increased calls for Berhalter to be replaced. On the night of the U.S. team's elimination, Crocker, who wasn't present at the Uruguay match due to a long-planned family commitment, announced that a review process would commence to evaluate the performance of Berhalter and the team.\n\nUltimately, Crocker decided to relieve Berhalter.\n\nBerhalter, a former U.S. international as a player, was hired in December of 2018, after having spent the previous five seasons with the Columbus Crew. But he was hired while his brother, Jay, was the chief commercial officer at the U.S. Soccer Federation, raising questions about a potential conflict of interest.\n\nFollowing the USMNT's failure to qualify for the 2018 World Cup, Berhalter set about rebuilding the team with a new generation of players, and a new style based heavily on possession. The results were uneven, but ultimately positive.\n\nThe U.S. lost the 2019 Concacaf Gold Cup final to Mexico, and also lost during the group stage to Canada in the 2020 Concacaf Nations League. Thanks to an evolution to a more pragmatic style, the U.S. ultimately recovered to claim that title, as well as the two subsequent CNL crowns.\n\nWorld Cup qualifying had similar difficulties. The team ultimately qualified for the 2022 World Cup, though that wasn't secured until the final day of qualifying, with the U.S. finishing third in Concacaf qualifying on goal differential.\n\nYet Berhalter and the team have failed to build on the promise of the 2022 World Cup, and now he finds himself out of a job.", "source": {"uri": "espn.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "ESPN"}, "authors":

But the United States almost never beat top teams in the Berhalter era and has appeared to stagnate despite arguably having the best young generation of players in USMNT history, led by Christian Pulisic.\n\nThat was compounded by the rough showing at the Copa Am\u00e9rica, a result that led to major USMNT supporter groups calling for Berhalter's firing. A tipping point had been reached.\n\n\"Our tournament performance fell short of our expectations,\" the United States Soccer Federation said in a statement at the time. \"We must do better. We will be conducting a comprehensive review of our performance in Copa America and how best to improve the team and results as we look towards the 2026 World Cup.\"\n\nThere was also the fact that Berhalter was out of the job for six months in 2022 after his contract ran out, as the USSF investigated claims from Danielle and Claudio Reyna that Berhalter assaulted his now-wife, Rosalind, while the pair were in college.\n\nHe was ultimately rehired in June 2023. And despite a number of supporters and pundits believing he should have been replaced far earlier than now, he also had his allies, namely among the players.\n\n\"I see no issue with the direction we're heading,\" goalkeeper Matt Turner told reporters after the Copa Am\u00e9rica debacle. \"When you have a fight like that on the pitch in every single game we're in in this tournament, it speaks volumes to how the manager prepares us.\"\n\n\"I believe we all have a comfort with Gregg and we all understand him and we've had him for a long time,\" Weston McKennie added. \"He's progressed the team very far from where we started off four or five years ago. I think the connection that we have with him is what's important, in having a coach that players that would run through a brick wall for him, players that listen to him.\"\n\nA new era for United States soccer is coming, as the country searches for the right manager to prepare the squad for the 2026 World Cup.

The person said an announcement was likely for later Wednesday.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBerhalter's second term as coach was cut short 10 months after he returned to the bench with high hopes and proclaimed the team's goal was \"to change soccer in America forever.\" The U.S. had seven wins, six losses and one draw in his second stint, leaving his overall record at 44 wins, 17 losses and 13 draws.\n\nSporting director Matt Crocker rehired Berhalter and also will make the recommendation on his replacement. The team next plays in September friendlies against Canada and New Zealand.\n\nJ\u00fcrgen Klopp, Thierry Henry and Marcelo Bielsa are among those being speculated about as candidates to replace Berhalter, along with Jesse Marsch, Hugo P\u00e9rez, Pellegrino Matarazzo, David Wagner, Steve Cherundolo, Jim Curtain, Massimiliano Allegri and Mauricio Pochettino.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSalary could be an issue.\n\nSports Roundup\n\nGet the latest D-FW sports news, analysis, scores and more.\n\nSIGN UP\n\nOr with:\n\nGoogleFacebook\n\nBy signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy\n\nBerhalter earned $2,291,136 in 2022, including $900,000 in bonuses for the Americans qualifying for the World Cup and reaching the second round. A top-level men's coach could put pressure on the USSF to increase the salary of newly hired women's coach Emma Hayes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJust 23 months remain before the World Cup comes to the United States for the second time and the Americans play their opener at Inglewood, California, on June 12, 2026. The only competitive matches with the full player pool before then likely will be in the CONCACAF Nations League.\n\nBerhalter, who turns 51 on Aug. 1, was the first American to coach the national team after playing for the team at a World Cup. He was hired to coach the U.S. in December 2018 after stints with Sweden's Hammarby (2011-13) and Major League Soccer's Columbus Crew (2013-18).\n\nHe led the U.S. to titles in the CONCACAF Nations League in 2020, 2023 and 2024 and to another with a B team in the 2021 CONCACAF Gold Cup. His players strongly supported Berhalter, saying he fostered a culture that bound the group.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat support led to Crocker rehiring Berhalter five months after his initial contract expired amid an investigation of a decades-old domestic violence allegation that was brought to the USSF's attention by the Reyna family, which was upset that Berhalter limited Gio Reyna's playing time at the World Cup. A law firm retained by the USSF said there was no legal obstacle to bringing Berhalter back.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHis detractors cited lack of success against teams outside the region and struggles on the road against Central American rivals. The U.S. gained the region's final automatic World Cup berth on goal difference, and it had the second-youngest team at the 2022 tournament in Qatar. The U.S. wasted a second-half lead in a 1-1 draw with Wales, tied England 0-0 and defeated Iran 1-0 to reach the knockout stage, where the Americans played poorly in a 3-1 loss to the Netherlands.\n\nPlayers exhibited a lack of discipline: Defender Sergi\u00f1o Dest got a red card last November at Trinidad and Tobago for arguing with a referee and winger Tim Weah was ejected from the Panama match for punching an opponent on the head.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nU.S. coaches have not fared well in a second cycle.\n\nBruce Arena led the team to a quarterfinal appearance in 2002, its best since 1930, then failed to advance past the group stage in 2006.\n\nBob Bradley's team reached the second round in 2010, earning him a four-year contract extension only for the USSF to fire him 11 months later after the Americans wasted a two-goal lead and lost to Mexico in the CONCACAF Gold Cup final.\n\nJurgen Klinsmann replaced him and led the team to the second round of the 2014 World Cup, then was fired after opening the final round of 2018 qualifying with a 2-1 home loss to Mexico and a 4-0 defeat at Costa Rica. Arena returned and the U.S. lost at Trinidad and Tobago on the final day of qualifying, ending a run of seven straight World Cup appearances.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile the new coach inherits players such as Christian Pulisic, Weston McKennie and Tyler Adams who have thrived with European clubs, goalkeepers Matt Turner and Ethan Horvath and Reyna have failed to gain playing time with first-tier teams.\n\nRelated StoriesView MoreCanada beats Venezuela in penalty kicks, reaches semifinals of Copa AmericaWhy Dallas fought so hard for FIFA's International Broadcast Center\n\nFind more FC Dallas

Jesse Marsch takes merciless jab at USMNT and Berhalter: Do you want the job?\n\nThe US Men's National Team (USMNT) finds itself at a pivotal juncture, teetering between the potential for a bright future and the haunting echoes of past disappointments. The nation that once treated soccer as an exotic import is now drawing massive crowds for Copa America and showing a growing enthusiasm for the beautiful game. Yet, the Stars and Stripes' recent lackluster performance in the combined competition at home has sparked intense scrutiny and calls for change.\n\nThe current USMNT head coach, Gregg Berhalter, is facing a chorus of critics who are clamoring for his dismissal. In the same breath, there's a rising clamor to bring in Jurgen Klopp, the charismatic former Liverpool boss known for his high-energy style and tactical genius. But experts are already highlighting the considerable hurdles involved in luring Klopp from Europe to the American soccer scene.\n\nOne of the most surprising objections comes from a former USMNT superstar. Kasey Keller, the former goalkeeper turned ESPN FC pundit, has pointed to equal pay as a potential sticking point.. It seems that US Soccer's commitment to pay parity could be the very thing that stymies the pursuit of Klopp, despite the keen interest shown by the German.\n\nKeller didn't mince words on ESPN FC's Futbol Americas. When reporter Sebastian Salazar asked him, \"So you think Klopp would not consider it not that US Soccer?\" Keller's response was direct: \"I think US soccer would consider a heartbeat if they could get him for 2 million.\" According to Keller, that's the budget available for Klopp, thanks to the equal pay policy. He further elaborated, \"If we have more money for one, we've said we will spend equal or roughly equal the amount on the other.\"\n\nThis equal pay principle has been a cornerstone of US Soccer since last year. It began with player salaries and was solidified into law, ensuring no discrimination between male and female athletes. The policy was then applied to coaching hires, with Emma Hayes of the US Women's National Team reportedly earning $2 million per year. Keller believes the same financial constraint would apply to Klopp.\n\nNot everyone agrees with Keller's assessment. Ali Krieger, a legend of the US Women's National Team, and other experts have dismissed the idea that equal pay would be a barrier. Krieger suggested, \"Let's find more sponsorship money for Emma Hayes.\" Salazar chimed in, saying that the issue should be clarified by US Soccer head Cindy Parlow Cone or Matt Crocker.\n\nMeanwhile, former USMNT striker Herculez Gomez offered a different perspective. He argued that the allure of life in America might outweigh financial considerations for potential coaches. \"What's the one thing all these players and coaches ask us about? It's life in America,\" Gomez emphasized.\n\nAmidst all this speculation, Jurgen Klopp himself has added a twist. On July 4th, the German manager tweeted fondly about his experiences in the USA during Liverpool's tours. This has fueled rumors that he could be interested in a national team role, with Germany or the USA as his top choices.\n\nAs the USMNT grapples with its identity and future direction, the question remains: Will US Soccer part ways with Berhalter and make a serious bid for Klopp? The debate is heating up, and the stakes are higher than ever.\n\nWhat do you think? Should US Soccer pull out all the stops to bring Klopp stateside? Or is Berhalter the right man to lead the Stars and Stripes forward?", "source": {"uri": "marca.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MARCA"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kasey_Keller", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kasey Keller"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J\u00fcrgen_Klopp", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "J\u00fcrgen Klopp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_men's_national_soccer_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States men's national soccer team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregg_Berhalter", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gregg Berhalter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Soccer_Federation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Soccer Federation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesse_Marsch", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jesse Marsch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copa_Am\u00e9rica", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Copa Am\u00e9rica"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emma_Hayes", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Emma Hayes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ali_Krieger", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ali Krieger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN_FC", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ESPN FC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pundit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pundit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "UEFA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Americas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Americas"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goalkeeper_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Goalkeeper (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_women's_national_soccer_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States women's national soccer team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cindy_Parlow_Cone", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cindy Parlow Cone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herculez_Gomez", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Herculez Gomez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_Day_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Independence Day (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Philanthropy", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Philanthropy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Coaching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://phantom-marca.unidadeditorial.es/b27373c08cb24f61abf0d3668abb82e5/resize/1200/f/webp/assets/multimedia/imagenes/2024/07/08/17203939277329.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9720115", "eventUri": "eng-9720115", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-04", "textStart": 2950, "textEnd": 2958}], "sentiment": 0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 185, "relevance": 1}

The U.S. Men's National Team finally parted ways with its head coach after a disastrous Copa Am\u00e9rica that saw the USMNT fail to move past the group stage.\n\nThe Americans came out strong at the Copa Am\u00e9rica, winning their first match. They looked almost guaranteed to reach the quarterfinals.\n\nBut a brutal loss against Panama that included an undisciplined red card by Tim Weah early in the match put the USMNT in peril.\n\nThey needed to defeat Uruguay in the third match to reach the next stage of the tournament, but they lost again.\n\nThat set Berhalter's already hot seat on fire and on Wednesday USMNT made the decision that many U.S. Soccer fans have wanted for years.\n\nFox Sports' Doug McIntyre was the first to report the news.\n\nWith Copa Am\u00e9rica now in the rear view mirror, the USMNT's attention turns to the 2026 World Cup.\n\nIt's a huge tournament for the United States squad, as the majority of the matches will be contested on U.S. soil.\n\nThere are 16 cities across the United States, Canada and Mexico that will host World Cup matches, including 11 located in the U.S. As the host countries, all three of the North American nations are already qualified for the tournament.\n\nThe final match of the World Cup will be hosted by MetLife Stadium in New Jersey on July 19, 2026.\n\nExpect the USMNT to run an exhaustive search for its next head coach. It absolutely has to get this decision right after the disaster that was the Gregg Berhalter tenure.\n\nThe United States hasn't reached the semifinal of the World Cup since 1930 when it finished in third place. The Americans reached the quarterfinals only once since then, reaching the final eight in 2002.\n\nThey've managed to reach the Round of 16 in three of the past four World Cups, with the only miss coming from the 2018 debacle. That was the year in which America failed to even qualify for the World Cup.\n\nFollowing the 2018 failure, USMNT fired J\u00fcrgen Klinsmann and hired Berhalter.\n\nThe team expected Berhalter to finally bring United States soccer to relevance, like fans have been promised for decades.

The team next plays in September friendlies against Canada and New Zealand.\n\nJ\u00fcrgen Klopp, Thierry Henry, and Marcelo Bielsa are among those being speculated about as candidates to replace Berhalter, along with Jesse Marsch, Hugo P\u00e9rez, Pellegrino Matarazzo, David Wagner, Steve Cherundolo, Jim Curtain, Massimiliano Allegri, and Mauricio Pochettino.\n\nSalary could be an issue.\n\nBerhalter earned $2,291,136 in 2022, including $900,000 in bonuses for the Americans qualifying for the World Cup and reaching the second round. A top-level men's coach could put pressure on the USSF to increase the salary of newly hired women's coach Emma Hayes.\n\nJust 23 months remain before the World Cup comes to the United States for the second time and the Americans play their opener at Inglewood, Calif., on June 12, 2026. The only competitive matches with the full player pool before then likely will be in the CONCACAF Nations League.\n\nBerhalter, who turns 51 on Aug. 1, was the first American to coach the national team after playing for the team at a World Cup. He was hired to coach the US in December 2018 after stints with Sweden's Hammarby (2011-13) and Major League Soccer's Columbus Crew (2013-18).\n\nHe led the US to titles in the CONCACAF Nations League in 2020, 2023, and 2024 and to another with a B team in the 2021 CONCACAF Gold Cup. His players strongly supported Berhalter, saying he fostered a culture that bound the group.\n\nThat support led to Crocker rehiring Berhalter five months after his initial contract expired amid an investigation of a decades-old domestic violence allegation that was brought to the USSF's attention by the Reyna family, which was upset that Berhalter limited Gio Reyna's playing time at the World Cup. A law firm retained by the USSF said there was no legal obstacle to bringing Berhalter back.\n\nHis detractors cited lack of success against teams outside the region and struggles on the road against Central American rivals. The US gained the region's final automatic World Cup berth on goal difference, and it had the second-youngest team at the 2022 tournament in Qatar. The US wasted a second-half lead in a 1-1 draw with Wales, tied England, 0-0, and defeated Iran, 1-0, to reach the knockout stage, where the Americans played poorly in a 3-1 loss to the Netherlands.\n\nPlayers exhibited a lack of discipline: Defender Sergi\u00f1o Dest got a red card last November at Trinidad and Tobago for arguing with a referee and winger Tim Weah was ejected from the Panama match in Copa Am\u00e9rica last month for punching an opponent on the head.\n\nUS coaches have not fared well in a second cycle.\n\nBruce Arena led the team to a quarterfinal appearance in 2002, its best since 1930, then failed to advance past the group stage in 2006.\n\nBob Bradley's team reached the second round in 2010, earning him a four-year contract extension, only for the USSF to fire him 11 months later after the Americans wasted a two-goal lead and lost to Mexico in the CONCACAF Gold Cup final.\n\nJurgen Klinsmann replaced him and led the team to the second round of the 2014 World Cup, then was fired after opening the final round of 2018 qualifying with a 2-1 home loss to Mexico and a 4-0 defeat at Costa Rica. Arena returned and the US lost at Trinidad and Tobago on the final day of qualifying, ending a run of seven straight World Cup appearances.", "source": {"uri": "bostonglobe.com", "dataType": "news",

The decision comes after the US failed to get out of the group stage at the Copa America despite being the host country.\n\nBerhalter has been the head coach of the USMNT since 2018.

Berhalter was never particularly popular with fans in the first place, as his teams struggled to score goals and often seemed content to skate by on results that barely qualified as good enough.\n\nIt is not clear who might be targeted as Berhalter's replacement.

The talking point started as a demand to improve after the failure to qualify for the 2018 World Cup and the program eventually lived up to the billing, ushering in a talented group of new players that made the knockout rounds of the 2022 World Cup. That trip to Qatar was supposed to freshen the call to action of an upward trajectory, teasing that it was just the start of something special. A year and a half since, though, the promise of progress remains glaringly unfulfilled.\n\nAnd so, the U.S. Soccer Federation's decision to fire coach Gregg Berhalter on Wednesday feels justified in the wake of the USMNT's group stage exit from the Copa America. The tournament did not go according to plan at all for the U.S., who hoped a berth at this expanded edition of the South American championship would serve as a proving ground for their aspirations and eyed a deep run after being placed in a favorable group. Instead, the USMNT were unable to string together a single performance that would convince onlookers that this was a team well and truly on the rise, losing twice in three games including an ill-fated matchup against underdogs Panama.\n\nThe blame does not rest on Berhalter's shoulders alone, but the last 10 months of work essentially erased the undeniable strides the team made during his first three years in the job. The head coach's second stint in charge, which began last September after his initial contract expired at the end of 2022, demonstrated the stark difference between starting from scratch and reaching the next level. There was little Berhalter could do to take his team to the next gear and long before they failed at the Copa America, the cracks began to show.\n\nFirst came a 2-1 loss to Trindad and Tobago in the Concacaf Nations League quarterfinals last November. The deficit was not costly enough to their aggregate score but Sergino Dest's reckless red card derailed the USMNT's performance, which was unspectacular despite being the heavy favorites in that match. Then came a 3-1 win in extra time over Jamaica in the semifinals in March, when the U.S. conceded in the first minute and needed an own goal in the final minute to force extra time and win the game. Just a month ago, a 2-0 deficit against Colombia just 20 minutes into a friendly turned into a 5-1 loss by the final whistle. The loss to Panama was a death knell rather than the first sign of trouble, and it is difficult to expunge that string of performances from Berhalter's record.\n\nDespite having the benefit of familiarity with a player pool that he has worked with since 2019, Berhalter seemed unable to tactically elevate his group to become greater than the sum of their parts. They seemed instead to regress in recent months, failing on occasions in which they were the favorites and crumbling under the pressure against top-ranked opponents. It is hard to credit Berhalter with any major accomplishments -- as much optimism has followed the group of players he coached, this team merely met expectations. They never found a way to go one step further, as Berhalter's paltry record against top 20 teams will demonstrate -- he has just five wins against teams in that category, four of which came against Mexico and the fifth came against Iran. Overperforming expectations is a difficult task with an imperfect player pool and considering the things outside of Berhalter's control, such as the players' club situations. Rising above those challenges, though, is ultimately the job of the USMNT coach, especially one who aimed \" to do something that no U.S. team has done before\" at the 2026 World Cup on home soil.\n\nBerhalter's poor showings, though, mean blame also falls to the U.S. Soccer higher-ups who re-hired him last summer. Despite Berhalter's work during his first spell in charge, his return to the national team was not universally praised -- in fact, many responded to the news by admitting he had work to do to prove he deserved to resume the role. After the doomed Copa America experience, it feels like U.S. Soccer wasted two years, first waiting to re-hire Berhalter and then to see him demonstrate that he was not up for the job. The failed Berhalter experiment of the last year ultimately forces questions of the recruitment process, too.\n\nIt was the first big coaching hire from new U.S. Soccer sporting director Matt Crocker, who joined the federation last April and reportedly deferred to the players after they publicly advocated for Berhalter's return. It remains unclear how many high-caliber coaches were in the running, though new Canada manager Jesse Marsch said he \"wasn't treated very well\" by U.S. Soccer as they explored their options. His run to the semifinals with Canada just weeks after taking that job will sting for many in U.S. Soccer circles because he accomplished the improbable task of punching above the team's weight in record time.\n\nMarsch is perhaps not the only candidate that may have been a good fit, but he was arguably the only person who felt both realistic and exciting. The drab reality is that U.S. Soccer is unlikely to do much better than him, either. Many have spent the last week name-dropping Jurgen Klopp as if they can manifest his arrival, but it feels unlikely even if U.S. Soccer can come up with the funds to make it happen.\n\nIt is worth remembering that a high-profile coach will not be able to fix the problems that are bigger than Berhalter. That, though, is not to suggest that the USMNT cannot solve their issues in time for the 2026 World Cup, but the solution is unlikely to be a glamorous one, nor does it have to be. Finding a better tactician than Berhalter is paramount and so is someone who can address the feelings of comfort that have plagued the USMNT in recent years, something veteran defender Tim Ream admitted following the team's Copa America exit. \"It's a fantastic group, as everybody knows,\" he said, per Univision, \"It's very, very close but sometimes, the intensity falls through the cracks.\"\n\nIt will require U.S. Soccer to do something it has not done in a little while, though -- make a choice that raises few questions, and quickly. U.S. Soccer took a year-plus to hire Berhalter, a process that will always have an asterisk next to it because his brother Jay was the federation's chief commercial officer at the time. It also took the federation six months to reinstate Berhalter, delayed by the changing sporting directors and an investigation into a decades-old domestic violence incident that came up in Berhalter's family feud with ex-national team players Claudio and Danielle Reyna.\n\nWith less than two years left on the clock before the U.S. welcomes the world's best teams for the World Cup, the onus is on the federation to live up to the expectations they set for themselves -- and do away with the sour taste of disappointment from the last two years.", "source": {"uri": "cbssports.com", "dataType":

The news comes just over one week after the USMNT suffered group stage elimination from the 2024 Copa America.\n\nFox Soccer originally broke the news earlier on Wednesday. USSF Sporting Director Matt Crocker will lead and has launched a search for Berhalter's replacement.\n\n\"We are deeply grateful to Gregg for his commitment the past five years to the Men's National Team and to U.S. Soccer,\" said Crocker. \"Gregg has earned the respect of everyone within our organization and has played a pivotal role in bringing together a young team and moving the program forward. We wish Gregg all the best in his future endeavors, and we know he will find success in his next coaching position.\"\n\n\"Our immediate focus is on finding a coach who can maximize our potential as we continue to prepare for the 2026 World Cup, and we have already begun our search process,\" added Crocker.\n\nBerhalter, 50, was rehired by U.S. Soccer in June 2023 after the federation conducted a full investigation on him following a past domestic violence incident involving him and his wife, Rosalind.\n\nA former USMNT player, Berhalter's first spell as head coach began in 2018. He led the Americans back to the FIFA World Cup in 2022 before reaching the Round of 16 in that tournament.\n\nBerhalter also led the USMNT to a pair of CONCACAF Nations League titles and one CONCACAF Gold Cup. Several dual-nationals also committed to the USMNT during Berhalter's two spells as head coach including Yunus Musah, Sergino Dest, Folarin Balogun, and Malik Tillman.\n\n\"I want to thank Gregg for his hard work and dedication to U.S. Soccer and our Men's National Team,\" said U.S. Soccer President Cindy Parlow Cone. \"We are now focused on working with our Sporting Director Matt Crocker and leveraging his experience at the highest levels of the sport to ensure we find the right person to lead the USMNT into a new era of on-field success.\"\n\nBoth Anthony Hudson and B.J.

Instead, the USMNT exited in the group stage after losses to Panama and Uruguay.\n\nThe early elimination leaves Berhalter's future with the national team as shaky as ever.\n\nStill, the U.S. Soccer Federation is taking time to contemplate its decision. Leadership is likely weighing the impact of parting with Berhalter and what type of replacement they could get for the solid coach.\n\nThus, while a change may seem necessary to some, Berhalter isn't guaranteed to be looking for work in the near future.\n\nHere's a look back at Berhalter's USMNT tenure and his coaching record to this point as fans await word on his future with the squad.\n\nMORE: Candidates to replace Gregg Berhalter as USMNT coach\n\nBerhalter has posted a record of 44-13-17 over 74 matches with the U.S. men's national team. His 44 wins are the third-most by a USMNT manager of all time, trailing only Bruce Arena (81) and Jurgen Klinsmann (55).\n\nBerhalter helped lead the U.S. back to the World Cup in 2022 after the country shockingly missed out on the tournament in 2018. The team fared well in CONCACAF competition and improved from 25th in the world at the time of Berhalter's takeover to 11th in FIFA's most recent rankings.\n\nStill, the USMNT hasn't closed the gap on other world powers despite boasting one of its most talented rosters in recent memory. That -- along with an exit before the knockout rounds in the 2024 Copa America -- could be enough to doom Berhalter.\n\nMORE: Why U.S. Soccer should move on from head coach Gregg Berhalter\n\nBerhalter had eight years of managerial experience before joining the USMNT. He got his start at Hammarby in the Swedish League from 2011-13 before becoming the Columbus Crew's manager for the 2013 MLS season.\n\nBerhalter held his role with the Crew until 2018, when he was named head coach of the USMNT.\n\nBerhalter had a combined record of 92-66-81 during his time with Hammarby and Columbus. Below is a breakdown of his performance at each club, as well as his USMNT stints:\n\nBerhalter also had plenty of playing experience, playing 18 years across several years and earning 44 caps for the USMNT. That made him an ideal fit to take on the job in 2018, and while things may not end well for him, he still has had a solid run.\n\nMORE: Explaining Jay Berhalter's job with MLS, role in hiring USMNT coach\n\nBerhalter is presently the third-winningest coach in USMNT history. Below is a look at how he stacks up with the team's other former managers who coached at least 15 matches.\n\nWhile Berhalter's tenure in the United States hasn't gone as planned of late, he still provided the team with many bright moments. Now, it's just a matter of seeing whether the USMNT wants to give him one last chance to right the ship or if it looks to greener pastures for a new leader.", "source": {"uri": "sportingnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sporting News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregg_Berhalter", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gregg Berhalter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_men's_national_soccer_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States men's national soccer team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copa_Am\u00e9rica", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Copa Am\u00e9rica"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uruguay_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Uruguay national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Soccer_Federation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Soccer Federation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hammarby_Fotboll", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hammarby Fotboll"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J\u00fcrgen_Klinsmann", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "J\u00fcrgen Klinsmann"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Arena", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bruce Arena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CONCACAF", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "CONCACAF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FIFA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-elimination_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Single-elimination tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbus_Crew_SC", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Columbus Crew SC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allsvenskan", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Allsvenskan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cap_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cap (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Soccer", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Major League Soccer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbus,_Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Columbus, Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Columbus, Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Coaching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cheerleading/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cheerleading/Organizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://library.sportingnews.com/styles/twitter_card_120x120/s3/2024-06/GettyImages-2158917798.jpg?itok=YwnSZGBE", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9720115", "eventUri": "eng-9720115", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 180, "relevance": 1}

The Stars and Stripes previously entered Copa America 2024 with high hopes. After all, the tournament is being played on home soil and the team appeared ready to make their mark in such a prestigious competition. Nevertheless, the Americans embarrassingly failed to qualify for the knockout round.\n\nAs a result of the debacle, many USMNT fans are calling for Gregg Berhalter to be fired. The current head coach came back to the USMNT last summer after US Soccer previously allowed his contract to expire. The move has since backfired as evident in the team's Copa America display.\n\nWhile bringing back Berhalter was a mistake, a former USMNT head coach predicted a bigger issue at US Soccer. Jurgen Klinsmann previously coached the Americans from 2011 to 2016. With the German in charge, the Americans experienced both highs and lows during the five years.\n\nFollowing his dismissal, however, Klinsmann could see that the USMNT would struggle in the future. This was, according to the coach, due to the organization prioritizing money over actual results.\n\nThree years after US Soccer fired Klinsmann, he sat down to conduct an interview with ESPN. Looking back at the discussion, the German coach's analysis foreshadowed a lot of the problems that the USMNT is currently suffering from.\n\nFor instance, Klinsmann told the news outlet that the USMNT needs to schedule more friendlies against the top teams in the world. \"I think the biggest challenge for the United States, or even Mexico or Costa Rica, is that you don't really have the highest competition,\" stated Klinsmann. \"When you just play within your system [CONCACAF], you don't have the big matches against European or South American countries in order to grow your program.\"\n\n\"You need to play Argentina, Brazil, Germany, Holland and England,\" continued the coach, who also added that it's \"almost impossible for the USA or Mexico to get better\" by mostly playing just CONCACAF teams.\n\nKlinsmann also labeled the CONCACAF Nations League as \"a waste of time\" because it blocks the USMNT from playing the top teams in the world. Established in 2018, the competition was created to help avoid 'meaningless' friendlies. Nevertheless, the tournament is not exactly seen as a serious competition by many soccer fans.\n\nAnother issue, according to Klinsmann, is the fact that the USMNT plays too many matches at home against weaker opponents. The move by US Soccer is seen as a way to rake in as much revenue as possible. The German coach went on to claim in the interview that the Americans should have scheduled more away matches in Europe.\n\nFive years later, this issue is still plaguing the USMNT. Since the end of 2018, the Stars and Stripes have played 32 total friendlies. Twenty-five of these fixtures (78%) have been in the United States. The remaining seven games were across Europe.\n\nNevertheless, none of these matchups on foreign soil came against teams considered to be extremely tough opponents. For instance, the USMNT played Japan, Saudi Arabia, Jamaica, Northern Ireland, Switzerland, Wales, and Panama in Europe during this timeframe.\n\nAlthough the Klinsmann interview was from 2019, it is as if the coach is speaking in the present time. While Berhalter remains an issue with the USMNT, US Soccer also needs to overhaul its scheduling process. This, however, will not change in the immediate future. The Americans face Canada, New Zealand, and Panama in their next three friendlies. All three of the games are this fall in the United States.", "source": {"uri": "worldsoccertalk.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "World Soccer Talk"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

How do we do better?\" Berhalter said.\n\n\"It's not the aspirations that we have as a group.

A return to the sideline, however, would probably be in European club soccer, where he would command a massive contract.\n\nAt Liverpool, Klopp earned more than $50 million annually in salary and other guarantees. In the USSF's most recent tax filing (2022), Berhalter made about $2.3 million, including $900,000 in bonuses after the World Cup.\n\nThe decision by Crocker to rehire Berhalter last year came after Berhalter's contract had expired and amid a messy situation involving midfielder Gio Reyna's parents and an investigation into Berhalter kicking his now-wife during an argument when they were attending the University of North Carolina.\n\nWith arguably the most talented roster in program history, the U.S. team this year continued to fare well in regional competition but stumbled under this summer's bright lights. Expected to advance to Copa Am\u00e9rica's knockout stage, the Americans were eliminated in group play after losing their last two matches, to Panama and Uruguay.\n\nCopa Am\u00e9rica was the biggest test for the U.S. team leading up to the 2026 World Cup, which will be staged in the United States, Mexico and Canada.\n\nThe USSF sees the World Cup as an opportunity for the national team to make breakthrough gains on the field and grow the sport's popularity. The catchphrase used by Berhalter and his players the past year has been \"Change soccer in America forever.\"\n\nThe Copa Am\u00e9rica results were a bitter disappointment to the governing body, which, shortly after the team's elimination, said it would \"conduct a comprehensive review.\" The statement did not cite Berhalter but clearly was directed at a coach who had not gotten the most out of his players.\n\nThe U.S. failure came as Canada, under Marsch, a Wisconsin native, was making a run to the Copa Am\u00e9rica semifinals.\n\nLast year, many U.S. players effusively backed Berhalter's return, a sentiment that seemed to weigh heavily in Crocker's decision. A former U.S. World Cup defender who had coached in Sweden and MLS, Berhalter established a fresh culture upon his appointment in 2018 and built a promising roster following the program's failure to qualify for the World Cup that year.\n\nHe introduced many young players into the program, created a strong bond among the players and staff, and implemented a proactive playing style. Through growing pains, the team qualified for the 2022 World Cup and fielded the youngest starting lineup in Qatar.\n\nAs the roster matured -- and players joined prominent European clubs -- expectations soared. The results this year, though, did not follow. The U.S. team did win the Concacaf Nations League for the third consecutive year, extending its dominance over rival Mexico, but in a Copa Am\u00e9rica tuneup last month, a 5-1 defeat to Colombia was its worst setback in eight years.\n\nIn group play, the Americans defeated Bolivia, the worst team in the tournament, but were shorthanded most of the game against Panama after winger Tim Weah received a red card. Still, the U.S. team took the lead and was tied late before conceding the winning goal. Needing to beat Uruguay and receive help in the other group game, the United States lost, 1-0.\n\nNot since the 108-year-old tournament went to a single host country in 1987 had the home team failed to advance. Beyond that indignity, the U.S. squad was not making progress under Berhalter.\n\n\"I want to thank Gregg for his hard work and dedication,\" USSF President Cindy Parlow Cone said in a statement. \"We are now focused on working with [Crocker] and leveraging his experience at the highest levels of the sport to ensure we find the right person to lead the USMNT into a new era of on-field success.\"",

The person said an announcement was likely for later Wednesday.\n\nBerhalter's second term as coach was cut short 10 months after he returned to the bench with high hopes and proclaimed the team's goal was \"to change soccer in America forever.\" The U.S. had seven wins, six losses and one draw in his second stint, leaving his overall record at 44 wins, 17 losses and 13 draws.\n\nSporting director Matt Crocker rehired Berhalter and also will make the recommendation on his replacement. The team next plays in September friendlies against Canada and New Zealand.\n\nJ\u00fcrgen Klopp, Thierry Henry and Marcelo Bielsa are among those being speculated about as candidates to replace Berhalter, along with Jesse Marsch, Hugo P\u00e9rez, Pellegrino Matarazzo, David Wagner, Steve Cherundolo, Jim Curtain, Massimiliano Allegri and Mauricio Pochettino.\n\nRelated Story: England Beats Netherlands and Advances to the European Championship\n\nBerhalter earned $2,291,136 in 2022, including $900,000 in bonuses for the Americans qualifying for the World Cup and reaching the second round. A top-level men's coach could put pressure on the USSF to increase the salary of newly hired women's coach Emma Hayes.\n\nJust 23 months remain before the World Cup comes to the United States for the second time and the Americans play their opener at Inglewood, California, on June 12, 2026. The only competitive matches with the full player pool before then likely will be in the CONCACAF Nations League.\n\nBerhalter, who turns 51 on Aug. 1, was the first American to coach the national team after playing for the team at a World Cup. He was hired to coach the U.S. in December 2018 after stints with Sweden's Hammarby (2011-13) and Major League Soccer's Columbus Crew (2013-18).\n\nRelated Story: Booted out of NBA, Former Player Jontay Porter Due in Court in Betting Case\n\nHe led the U.S. to titles in the CONCACAF Nations League in 2020, 2023 and 2024 and to another with a B team in the 2021 CONCACAF Gold Cup. His players strongly supported Berhalter, saying he fostered a culture that bound the group.\n\nThat support led to Crocker rehiring Berhalter five months after his initial contract expired amid an investigation of a decades-old domestic violence allegation that was brought to the USSF's attention by the Reyna family, which was upset that Berhalter limited Gio Reyna's playing time at the World Cup. A law firm retained by the USSF said there was no legal obstacle to bringing Berhalter back.\n\nHis detractors cited lack of success against teams outside the region and struggles on the road against Central American rivals. The U.S. gained the region's final automatic World Cup berth on goal difference, and it had the second-youngest team at the 2022 tournament in Qatar. The U.S. wasted a second-half lead in a 1-1 draw with Wales, tied England 0-0 and defeated Iran 1-0 to reach the knockout stage, where the Americans played poorly in a 3-1 loss to the Netherlands.\n\nPlayers exhibited a lack of discipline: Defender Sergi\u00f1o Dest got a red card last November at Trinidad and Tobago for arguing with a referee and winger Tim Weah was ejected from the Panama match for punching an opponent on the head.\n\nRelated Story: Novak Djokovic Gets to His 13th Wimbledon Semifinal via Walkover. 2022 Champ ...\n\nU.S. coaches have not fared well in a second cycle.\n\nBruce Arena led the team to a quarterfinal appearance in 2002, its best since 1930, then failed to advance past the group stage in 2006.\n\nBob Bradley's team reached the second round in 2010, earning him a four-year contract extension only for the USSF to fire him 11 months later after the Americans wasted a two-goal lead and lost to Mexico in the CONCACAF Gold Cup final.\n\nJurgen Klinsmann replaced him and led the team to the second round of the 2014 World Cup, then was fired after opening the final round of 2018 qualifying with a 2-1 home loss to Mexico and a 4-0 defeat at Costa Rica. Arena returned and the U.S. lost at Trinidad and Tobago on the final day of qualifying, ending a run of seven straight World Cup appearances.\n\nWhile the new coach inherits players such as Christian Pulisic, Weston McKennie and Tyler Adams who have thrived with European clubs, goalkeepers Matt Turner and Ethan Horvath and Reyna have failed to gain playing time with first-tier teams.", "source":

However, Klopp could see it as a golden opportunity to remain in coaching while only overseeing a dozen or so matches each year.\n\nWilfried Nancy is another name that's been brought up numerous times by USMNT fans. The current Columbus Crew head coach has revived one of Major League Soccer's original clubs with an entertaining playing style that saw them lift MLS Cup in his first season.\n\nNancy could be eager to continue to prove himself by moving up a level with the USMNT, and it's no secret that the US has picked from MLS coaches in the past.\n\nBringing back Bruce Arena would be a controversial option given his resignation from New England Revolution, but if there's one coach who knows how to stabilize a team, it's Arena.\n\nYes, his last tenure with the Stars and Stripes was completely embarassing as it was his team that failed to get past Trinidad and Tobago in November 2017 to qualify for the 2018 World Cup. However, he would probably still be a better option than the current coach in charge.\n\nAnother name that has been brought in the MLS/USMNT mix is LAFC head coach Steve Cherundolo.\n\nIt would certainly be a big step up for Cherundolo -- who is a former USA international -- but his style of play would suit the US going into tournaments. His LAFC side might not play the most entertaining style of soccer, but they definitely know how to rack up points with their effective counter-attacking system.\n\nPat Noonan has completely turned around MLS expansion team FC Cincinnati in his two-and-a-half years at the club.\n\nLike Cherundolo, Noonan is also a former USMNT player that has brought stability to a club that had finished at the bottom of MLS prior to hiring the 43-year-old. Like Cherundolo, Noonan also deploys a more pragmatic style of play by soaking up pressure and hitting teams on the counter, and it could bring success at the international level if the US takes a gamble.", "source": {"uri": "90min.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "90min.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregg_Berhalter", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gregg Berhalter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Soccer_Federation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Soccer Federation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J\u00fcrgen_Klopp", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "J\u00fcrgen Klopp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copa_Am\u00e9rica", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Copa Am\u00e9rica"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_men's_national_soccer_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States men's national soccer team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Soccer", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Major League Soccer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilfried_Nancy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wilfried Nancy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbus_Crew_SC", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Columbus Crew SC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Cherundolo", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Steve Cherundolo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MLS_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "MLS Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Arena", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bruce Arena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Cincinnati", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FC Cincinnati"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_FC", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles FC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Noonan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pat Noonan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expansion_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Expansion team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England_Revolution", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New England Revolution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinidad_and_Tobago", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Trinidad and Tobago"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Trinidad and Tobago"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONCACAF", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONCACAF", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cheerleading", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cheerleading", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Coaching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_4059,h_2283,x_0,y_0/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/GettyImages/mmsport/90min_en_international_web/01j2ep8z7t9syrb0gemv.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9720115", "eventUri": "eng-9720115", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2017-11-", "textStart": 1876, "textEnd": 1889}], "sentiment": 0.1529411764705881, "wgt": 175, "relevance": 1}

The team's only win came against Bolivia, the lowest ranked team in the tournament. After making it out of the group stage at the 2022 FIFA World Cup, this was a massive setback for the next World Cup host.\n\nBerhalter was first hired back in 2018 after USA failed to qualify for the World Cup in Russia. The team won three consecutive Concacaf Nations League titles, but Copa America was supposed to be a show of progression and improvement. Instead, it seems the U.S. Soccer Federation is opting for a new approach with 2026 rapidly approaching.\n\nFrom the team's first friendly against Colombia, something wasn't right this summer. Many complaints from fans was a distinct lack of a style of play for the Stars and Stripes. A better showing against a star-studded Brazil built some hope in the eyes of the fans, but things started to quickly unravel in the group stage.\n\nUSA lost 2-1 to Panama after Juventus forward Tim Weah received a red card. Folarin Balogun opened the scoring, but Panama equalized quickly and won the game in the second half. Then, in USA's final game against Uruguay the team never looked like it stood a chance. The team could've gotten by with some help from Bolivia, but in the end it was shock and failure for USMNT this summer.\n\nFox Sports analysts Carli Lloyd, Clint Dempsey and Alexi Lalas all shared their disdain for the head coach after losing to Uruguay. At the minimum, having a new face leading the group will bring some sort of bounce.\n\nBerhalter departs USMNT with a 44-15-13 record, the highest winning percentage of any tenured USMNT coach. The team will likely want to name a new head coach with friendlies coming up in September.\n\nThe next manager must come in and install a style of play with intent of making a mark in two summers. 2026, on home soil, with a golden generation of players, is the biggest opportunity for USA to do something special in a World Cup.", "source": {"uri": "90min.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "90min.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregg_Berhalter", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gregg Berhalter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_men's_national_soccer_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States men's national soccer team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Soccer_Federation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Soccer Federation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copa_Am\u00e9rica", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Copa Am\u00e9rica"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panama", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Panama"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Panama"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Sports", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fox Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uruguay", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Uruguay"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Uruguay"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolivia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bolivia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bolivia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Nations_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Nations League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Russia national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exhibition_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Exhibition game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brazil national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colombia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Colombia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Colombia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folarin_Balogun", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Folarin Balogun"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timothy_Weah", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Timothy Weah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clint_Dempsey", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Clint Dempsey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_card", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Penalty card"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_generation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Golden generation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexi_Lalas", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alexi Lalas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carli_Lloyd", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Carli Lloyd"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juventus_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Juventus F.C."}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Airsoft/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Airsoft/Teams", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONMEBOL", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONMEBOL", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Coaching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_6440,h_3622,x_0,y_0/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/GettyImages/mmsport/90min_en_international_web/01j2fbj5a5cx3qcg8mgm.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9720115", "eventUri": "eng-9720115", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 175, "relevance": 1}

He's overseen a \"golden generation\" of American players, a young core the majority of which plays at the highest levels in Europe.\n\nA former USMNT player himself, Berhalter as manager won two continental championships -- the Nations League title in 2021 and the 2021 CONCACAF Gold Cup, both times defeating Mexico in the final.\n\nHis team qualified for the 2022 World Cup, where the team subsequently reached the Round of 16 before falling to the Netherlands.\n\nBerhalter's contract expired following the World Cup in December, 2022. After a search for a new manager, the USSF announced in June, 2023 that Berhalter was returning as manager.\n\nBut in his first major tournament since being re-hired, the Copa America, the USMNT was humiliated. After beating Bolivia in the opener, the USMNT lost to Panama and Uruguay and became the first-ever host nation to be eliminated in the group stage in tournament history.\n\nThe USSF announced following the team's exit that it would evaluate the head-coaching position. And on Monday, they decided for a new chapter.\n\nBerhalter's tenure was also marred by a brief scandal. After one of the team's more promising players, Gio Reyna, did not receive much playing time at the 2022 World Cup, Berhalter, while speaking at a leadership conference, alluded to a player he had to discipline and nearly send home due to bad behavior. Berhalter did not name Reyna by name, but it was clear the latter was whom Berhalter was referring to.\n\nBerhalter claimed he believed he was speaking off-the-record, but Reyna subsequently blasted Berhalter and claimed that the ex-coach told him the incident would remain in-house.\n\nAnd soon after, the USSF found that Reyna's parents, Claudio and Danielle, attempted to retaliate against Berhalter. Danielle contacted the USSF about an alleged fight Berhalter got into with his now-wife, Rosalind, 30 years prior when the two were teammates at the University of North Carolina. Danielle Reyna played with Rosalind Berhalter at North Carolina, while Berhalter and Claudio Reyna were teammates on the USMNT.\n\nBerhalter claimed he was being blackmailed by the Reynas. And the USSF's investigation and a report by a law firm determined that Berhalter did not improperly withhold information about that 1992 incident, paving the way for him to be re-hired in 2023.\n\nReyna was a staple in Berhalter's lineups at the Copa America, but now the two will no longer be intertwined.\n\nThe USMNT now looks for its new manager as Jesse Marsch, an American manager whom the USMNT snubbed last year in favor of bringing back Berhalter, leads Canada to the Copa America semifinal.\n\nPerhaps the most important cycle in USMNT history lies ahead in the near future.",

Would the U.S. win a World Cup?", "body": "Ryan O'Hanlon is a staff writer for ESPN.com. He's also the author of \"Net Gains: Inside the Beautiful Game's Analytics Revolution.\"\n\nDeep within the hivemind of the U.S. men's national team fan base, there has always been this lingering thought: \"What if? What if we just hired one of the best soccer coaches in the world to coach our soccer team? That would be what puts us over the top.\"\n\nIt already happened once -- sort of. In 2006, Jurgen Klinsmann led a reenergized and rebooted Germany to extra time of the semifinals of the World Cup. The former national team star brought fresh ideas and a new perspective to a program that was seemingly being held back by tradition.\n\nAfter the tournament, fans decided that he was the guy to lead the USMNT, and so too did the U.S. Soccer Federation. But talks eventually broke down much to the disappointment of almost everyone, and Bob Bradley was appointed the interim and eventual-full-time coach. Bradley then led the team through perhaps its most successful modern period: winning the Gold Cup final against Mexico for the first time in 2007, taking down all-conquering superpower Spain in the semifinals of the Confederations Cup in 2009 and winning a World Cup group that included England in 2010.\n\nEventually, though, Klinsmann did come, replacing Bradley in 2011. It's just that he turned out to be more of a salesman than a savior. He talked a big game about getting players out of their comfort zones and reconceptualizing how this country viewed soccer, but there was no progress.\n\nThe team got out of its group at the 2014 World Cup, before hanging on for dear life in an extra-time loss to Belgium. In 2015, the Americans were eliminated in the semifinals of the Gold Cup by Jamaica, and after an unlikely run to the semifinals of the 2016 Copa America bought him some more time, Klinsmann was fired later that year with the U.S. at the bottom of the World Cup qualifying standings.\n\nNow, you wouldn't necessarily be wrong to think that this process was right in theory, but wrong in practice. As the succession of post-USMNT failures suggests, Klinsmann is simply just not a good coach. And with the USMNT's disastrous group stage exit under Gregg Berhalter, plenty of U.S. fans and former players are now telling themselves that the team hired the wrong Jurgen.\n\nSo, let's just say that U.S. Soccer went out and actually hired arguably the best coach in the world: former Liverpool and Borussia Dortmund manager Jurgen Klopp. What would it look like, and what might actually happen?\n\nIgnoring how expensive it might be to actually hire Klopp, doesn't it just seem pretty unlikely that the U.S. would go from Berhalter, previous manager of the Columbus Crew, to one of the -- I don't know -- five or 10 most legendary coaches in the history of the sport? If Klopp is a realistic option, then wouldn't one of the, what, 100 or 200 other coaches with a better track record than Berhalter be coaching the team right now?\n\nBut OK, sure. Berhalter did get hired when his brother was a top-ranking executive at U.S. Soccer, and it's not like large institutions are immune to irrational biases when hiring people in positions of power. And fine, Klopp did recently post on Instagram about how much he enjoyed Liverpool's preseason trips to the United States. \"U.S. fans are electric!\" Klopp said in his post.\n\nKlopp has also talked about feeling burnt out from the constant pressure of day-to-day training and club management. Managing the USMNT would scratch the management itch while not requiring him to train every day and live and die with multiple kicks of the ball, multiple times of the week.\n\nSo, let's say this actually happens. Let's see how it would look ...\n\nU.S. Soccer decides to dig into its cash reserves, or Jerome Powell decides to mint a Klopp Coin that allows the federation to pay the German coach more than any soccer coach has ever made.\n\nOn Aug. 1, U.S. Soccer announces that it has hired Jurgen Klopp on a short-term deal through the end of the 2026 World Cup. LeBron James tweets something about how this was all part of his plan when he became a micro-minority owner at Liverpool 15 years ago. Klopp sits at the podium at his opening news conference, flashes those veneers and talks about how this is the biggest challenge of his career.\n\n\"At Liverpool, I only had to turn a city from doubters to believers. Now, I must do it with an entire country,\" he says. He pinches both hands together on either side of his head and makes an exploding motion with both hands. \"Phwoah! But I know, if we trust each other, we can do it.\"\n\nIn a nation steeped in the gruff, performatively rude coaching styles of Bill Belichick and Nick Saban, sports fans across the country immediately fall in love with Klopp's emotional intelligence, his endearingly imperfect English and the fact that he seems to genuinely care about his players. A nation wonders: Are coaches really allowed to do that?\n\nThe dilemma for all national-team players, coaches and executives is that there simply are not enough competitive matches to truly understand the quality of your team.\n\nStudies have shown that it takes about 10 games in the Premier League for a team's past performance to become predictive of future results. And even that takes a little more nuance to understand.\n\nIt's not that past results are predictive of future results. Instead, the most predictive metric of future results is a team's expected-goal (or xG) difference.\n\nFor the uninitiated, xG puts a conversion percentage on every shot a team takes and concedes, based on a historical database of thousands of shots with similar characteristics. Over time, most teams and players will regress toward their xG so their actual goals line up with expected goals. Some outliers will overperform or underperform over a large sample, but the degree of over-or-under-performance is still relatively minor.\n\nSo, you need a decent sample of games to know how good you are, and you need to understand that results don't really matter when compared to the underlying performance. National teams never get 10 matches in a row of consistent lineups and consistent opponents. And the nature of the competitions themselves don't allow for much long-term thinking. You're eliminated from competition well before your results catch up to your performances.\n\nThis summer's Copa America for the USMNT was a perfect example of both problems. The team played only three games, which means that things like poor goalkeeping, inaccurate finishing, great finishing from your opponent, bad refereeing, a one-off bad game or an out-of-nowhere red card can have an outsized effect on your results. And well, pretty much all of that happened for the USMNT.\n\nRicardo Pepi attempted seven shots worth 2.27 xG at the Copa America ... and he scored zero goals. This has nothing to do with bad coaching, and it also doesn't say anything about Pepi beyond \"he just didn't score.\" Seven shots isn't anywhere close to enough shots -- think, like 500 -- to have any confidence in Pepi's finishing ability. And yet if, say, he converts his wide-open header in the 81st minute against Panama, the U.S. probably wins the game and definitely gets out of the group.\n\nEach attempt is sized by its xG value -- the bigger the circle, the higher the xG:\n\nIn the second game, Tim Weah's red card forced the U.S. to play a man down for 70 minutes against an inferior team -- essentially leveling the playing field between the two sides. Panama didn't really even create that many great chances: just 0.77 xG across the match.\n\nBased on where the shots ended up on the goal frame, we can estimate the likelihood that all of Panama's attempts would lead to a goal. The four shots that hit the target would typically lead to 0.93 goals, per Stats Perform's model. The combination of Matt Turner and Ethan Horvath in goal, though, allowed those attempts to turn into two goals.\n\nAnd then, in the last match against Uruguay, the referee was simply in way over his head. The USMNT didn't play particularly well, but who knows how things might have gone if there were a more experienced official who controlled the game and didn't, say, let Uruguay have a breakaway while the referee was giving a yellow card to Chris Richards.\n\nAll of these problems are now amplified by the current situation, where, as hosts and automatic qualifiers, the USMNT doesn't have many competitive matches before the 2026 World Cup. There are, of course, friendlies, but these aren't competitive games that you're supposed to win.\n\nKlopp knows this. At Liverpool, he would constantly change lineups across friendlies and frequently swap out nearly an entire eleven at halftime. Results were not the point.\n\nSo, what would the early days of Klopp's tenure with the U.S. men's national team look like? Well ...\n\nAcross his first three matches as USMNT manager, Klopp experiments with a number of different lineups and player configurations. There's one where Christian Pulisic plays as a midfielder. There's another where Yunus Musah plays right back. Malik Tillman starting over Gio Reyna? Sure. Jordan Morris back in the fold? Why not?\n\nBurnley's Luca Koleosho commits his future to the USMNT and makes his debut against Canada in September and then features against New Zealand a few days later. Thanks to Klopp's constant tinkering and heavy rotation, the USMNT loses to Canada and draws with New Zealand. Then, with USMNT fans desperate for revenge against Panama in an October friendly, the U.S. goes into halftime with a 2-0 lead, but then draws the match 2-2 after rotating nearly their entire lineup in the second half.\n\nWith no wins from his first three matches, some fans and commentators begin to wonder whether Klopp actually \"gets\" American soccer. Doesn't he know that we want to win every game that we play? Some fringe commentators and former USMNT players wonder aloud whether we really should've hired someone who never played for the team before.\n\nKlopp is asked about these comments, and the news conference eventually has to be canceled because he can't control his laughter. Every time he attempts to speak, he starts to giggle even louder. \"The Klopp Challenge\" becomes a thing on TikTok as Zoomers everywhere try to figure out how to activate a sense of humor that unleashes a string of organic, unstoppable laughter that lasts for at least five minutes straight.\n\nIn November, the first \"competitive\" games of the Klopp era are played: the Nations League quarterfinals. In a rematch against Trinidad & Tobago from the previous tournament's quarterfinals, Klopp chooses a similar lineup to Berhalter's preferred set up in the Copa America. The main differences: Koleosho steps in for Gio Reyna as part of the front three, Tillman replaces Yunus Musah in the midfield, and Weah starts at right back.\n\nAt home, the U.S. destroys T&T in the first leg 4-0, then they win 2-1 in the away match. Rather than acknowledging that the U.S. outshoot Trinidad 26-1 in the home matchup under Berhalter and that the only real difference between the two away legs is that an injured Sergi\u00f1o Dest wasn't sent off for punting a ball into the stands under Klopp, fans and commentators hold up these games as clear progress for the program.\n\nA few months later, the U.S. does what it always does: wins the Nations League, for the fourth time in a row. By winning the thing that they've never lost, Klopp's USMNT has American soccer fans dreaming bigger than ever before ahead of the World Cup.\n\nThe dirty little secret of international soccer is that managers can only do so much. That's also the dirty little secret of club soccer -- or any sport, really.\n\nIn October 2019, Klopp said as much: \"In football, there are two ways to improve. One is to sign good players and the second is training.\" After a string of disappointing results midway through his first Liverpool season when a few key players were out injured and/or playing poorly, Klopp said, \"I am not David Copperfield.\" He might have to be, though, to match the expectations that would come with him taking over the USMNT.\n\nIf training and signing players are the two ways to improve a team, then there's really not much he can do. Outside of convincing a handful of dual nationals to play for the United States, the player pool is the player pool. Your two best players are goalkeepers? You can't transfer one out and bring in a striker with the funds. Klopp wouldn't be able to acquire Andy Robertson, Mohamed Salah, Virgil van Dijk, Fabinho, and Alisson in consecutive transfer windows, like he did at Liverpool.\n\nAnd as USMNT manager, Klopp wouldn't really be able to improve the players much, either. These guys are all spending the vast majority of their time getting trained and coached by people who are not the coach of the USMNT. If we accept that coaches can improve players and most of that improvement comes at the training ground, the managers of AC Milan and Borussia Dortmund and PSV Eindhoven will have a far bigger effect on the quality of the U.S. player pool than Klopp would with his 20 or 30 training sessions a year.\n\nThe quality of managers in international soccer is way lower than in the club game -- mainly because it doesn't pay as well and the best coaches want to be training every day and signing new players -- so maybe a great coach has a bigger marginal impact internationally than he does in the club game. But from a pure managing perspective, international managers have less of an influence on team performance than club managers. And club managers don't have as much of an influence as you think.\n\nDon't take it from me, either. \"I've said it many times: We, the managers, are overrated in our influence\" -- that's a quote from none other than Pep Guardiola, the most influential manager of the 21st century. Or how about the most influential manager of all time, Johan Cruyff: \"If your players are better than your opponents, 90% of the time you will win.\" And what about the guy who just won the Champions League for a record fifth time, Real Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti?\n\n\"The most important role is never that of the coach,\" he said in April. \"I am very clear about one thing, and that is that there are two types of coaches: those who do nothing and those who do a lot of damage. I try to be the first. The game belongs to the players and you can tell them a certain strategy, convince them, but then they decide their quality and commitment. A technician has to focus on making the group understand the importance of teamwork.\"\n\nMost analysis suggests that a great manager can improve a team by a couple points per season, and that lines up with the economics of the sport. \"A few points per season\" is generally the value of the best players, and salaries for the best managers are in line with those of the best players.\n\nWere Klopp able to have the same kind of impact with the USMNT, it wouldn't even be perceptible in the same way. Although he's been the coach (mostly) since 2018, Berhalter has only managed 45 competitive matches for the U.S. -- just slightly more than a full Premier League season. If Klopp added, say, five points to the USMNT's performance over a 38-game sample when compared to Berhalter, that'd be less than two-tenths of a point per match. On a game-to-game basis, Klopp's influence would be a barely perceptible increase in a few percentage points of win probability.\n\nKlopp, again, is fully aware of this. So, let's check in with how our alternate reality is playing out...\n\nWith the USMNT's golden generation almost all firmly in their primes, the dominant Nations League performances, the games at home and Klopp on the sideline, even some non-Americans are convincing themselves that the USMNT could be a dark horse to go all of the way in the 2026 World Cup. The manager, though, tries to pump the brakes a few days before the tournament starts.\n\n\"When you look at the talent of France and England -- even my Germany -- it's not realistic to think that we could compete with those countries. Look at Germany: they win it all then don't even get out of the group at the next two World Cups,\" Klopp says. \"Anything can happen in knockout football, both good and bad. You see Belgium's super-super-talented players -- so many superstars, at so many big clubs, [Eden] Hazard, [Mousa] Dembele, [Thibaut] Courtois -- never make it past a semifinal at a major tournament. You also saw Morocco make the semifinals in Qatar. We shouldn't be judged on three or four games, but I understand this is how football works. All I can guarantee is that we'll give it our best.\"\n\nKlopp knows that his organization and motivation can only take his players so far. When he took over in 2024, various estimates put the talent level of the team at somewhere between the 15th-to-30th best in the world. The overall estimated market value of American players is the 16th highest in the world, while the consultancy Twenty First Group ranks the 25 best American players as the 30th-best group in the world.\n\nCome 2026, there's been internal improvement among the American player pool. Gio Reyna has stayed at Borussia Dortmund and churned out a couple 1,500-minute seasons in a row. Folarin Balogun has become one of the best strikers in France. Sergino Dest has recovered from his ACL injury and is once again attracting interest from the biggest clubs in the world after another great season at PSV. Malik Tillman has become a starter at Inter Milan.\n\nAt the same time, not everything has panned out. No center back has emerged capable of filling in for Tim Ream, who is 38 when the World Cup starts. Matt Turner has moved back to MLS after a rough stretch with Nottingham Forest, and there's no clear successor in goal, either.\n\nThen, in the lead-up to the World Cup, Tyler Adams injures his hamstring and is ruled out for the entire event. If there's one criticism to be had of Klopp, it's that he pushes his players too hard in training, and it finally backfired for the USMNT after his first prolonged training camp with the team.\n\nGiven the internal improvement among the attackers, the respect for the coach, and the potential for home-field advantage, the U.S. enters the tournament as the 12th-biggest favorite to win it all. With an easy group thanks to the expanded field and its status as a seeded team, the USMNT has no trouble advancing from its group. After an opening 1-1 draw against Egypt that pitted Klopp against his former star player, Mohamed Salah, the Americans win their next two matches, 3-1 against Albania and 2-1 against Paraguay.\n\nIn the round of 32, they brush aside Canada, 2-0, after Jesse Marsch's team qualified as the third-place side from Group B. This sets up a round of 16 match with ... France.\n\nWinners of Group G, France are flying high under new manager Zinedine Zidane, who has empowered more of the team's attacking talent than previous manager, Didier Deschamps, ever did. Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 has just scored 40 goals in LaLiga for Real Madrid, while the midfield of Warren Za\u00efre-Emery, Eduardo Camavinga, and Aur\u00e9lien Tchouam\u00e9ni is looking like one of those trios we'll be talking about for decades. Behind them, new Real Madrid record signing William Saliba is universally considered the best center back in the world, while his more passive style is matched perfectly by the aggression of Liverpool's Ibrahima Konat\u00e9, who finally stopped getting injured after Klopp left the club.\n\nIn the match, the USMNT goes up early, when a clever diagonal ball from Dest finds Pulisic, who beats Jules Kound\u00e9 to the endline, and then squares for Balogun, who nips in front of Konate to slide the ball past goalkeeper Mike Maignan.\n\nOne of the things that have made Klopp such a great manager is that he doesn't suffer from the conservatism that afflicts most coaches across most sports. His teams create chances and score tons of goals by embracing risk. And this holds true even after they score -- Klopp's teams don't try to hold onto one-goal wins by going into a defensive shell. No, they know that their best path to victory is taking that lead up to two. In the long run, it leads to more wins and more trophies -- even if it doesn't always work out.\n\nAfter taking the lead, the U.S. continues to attack against France, but without Adams to clean everything up, Mbappe continues to find space on the left wing after the French midfield gets up a head of speed once they break through the USMNT's press. Mbappe scores one right before half to tie the score. In the second half, the U.S. keeps attacking -- and then Mbappe scores again. And again. France win 3-1, and the USMNT is eliminated in the round of 16 for the second World Cup in a row.\n\nWhile some applaud the Americans and their attempt to keep attacking France, most commentators and fans in the U.S. see it as a kind of fatal naivete. They tell Klopp that this isn't Liverpool, that Sadio Man\u00e9 and Virgil van Dijk aren't walking through that door. They convince themselves that, for all of his success at every other team he's coached at, Klopp actually wasn't the right fit for this team.\n\nCommentators and fans don't see any progress in the team's results. All that the best generation of American soccer players is left with: two round-of-16 exits at the World Cup, one under Berhalter, one under Klopp. And as it always does, the disappointing results fall at the feet of the coach.", "source": {"uri": "insider.espn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ESPN.com (Insider)"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The team next plays in September friendlies against Canada and New Zealand.\n\n\"Our immediate focus is on finding a coach who can maximize our potential as we continue to prepare for the 2026 World Cup, and we have already begun our search process,\" Crocker said in a statement.\n\nCrocker and USSF president Cindy Parlow Cone issued statements, but did not immediately make themselves available to media for questions.\n\nJ\u00fcrgen Klopp, Thierry Henry and Marcelo Bielsa are among those being speculated about as candidates to replace Berhalter, along with Jesse Marsch, Hugo P\u00e9rez, Pellegrino Matarazzo, David Wagner, Steve Cherundolo, Jim Curtain, Massimiliano Allegri and Mauricio Pochettino.\n\nSalary could be an issue.\n\nBerhalter earned $2,291,136 in 2022, including $900,000 in bonuses for the Americans qualifying for the World Cup and reaching the second round. A top-level men's coach could put pressure on the USSF to increase the salary of newly hired women's coach Emma Hayes.\n\nJust 23 months remain before the World Cup comes to the United States for the second time and the Americans play their opener at Inglewood, California, on June 12, 2026.

The United States Men's National Team (USMNT) could not even get past their group as they only managed to win one of their three matches, losing to both Panama and Uruguay to finish behind them.\n\nHopes were not too high in a tournament in which the USMNT was far from the strongest team, but qualifying for the knockouts was the bare minimum expectation. The team's failure to meet that has unsurprisingly led to a lot of dissatisfaction among fans, who wish to see changes made to improve the side. Upon closer inspection, though, it should become clear that there is no easy fix for the USMNT's issues.\n\nBefore getting into the potential changes, it is worth analyzing what went wrong in the Copa Am\u00e9rica.\n\nThe USMNT entered the tournament in decent shape as they won the CONCACAF Nations League earlier in the year, defeating Mexico in the final. In the process, they seem to find the starting XI formula they would use for the Copa, clearing up some selection doubts. Even so, they were clearly weaker than the four South American favorites, but they looked in strong shape to win their first two group games against Bolivia and Panama and reach the quarterfinals.\n\nThey got off to a strong start in a commanding 2-0 win over Bolivia, but it all quickly unravelled with Timothy Weah's silly sending off just 18 minutes into the match against Panama. Folarin Balogun did still manage to score an opener soon thereafter, but the USMNT quickly conceded an equaliser and lost the game by conceding again in the 83rd minute.\n\nAs a result, their final group game against Uruguay became a must-win. Marcelo Bielsa's side themselves needed a point to be sure of their knockout spot, so he fielded a full-strength XI that made the task even tougher for the hosts. A great battle ensued, but ultimately it was the South Americans who emerged victorious as they imposed their physicality, posed a significant threat from set pieces and ultimately took one chance that made the difference.\n\nIn truth, the only thing this run shows is the unpredictable nature of tournament football. The USMNT would most likely have defeated Panama if not for Weah's entirely unnecessary red card, making their final group game a dead rubber. They would then have come up against Colombia in the quarterfinal, where a loss would not have been too unexpected.\n\nGregg Berhalter has received a fair bit of criticism in his five-plus years in charge of the USMNT, but their failure at this Copa Am\u00e9rica cannot be pinned on him. Of course, he could have done a few things better such as his game management against Panama, but on the whole, a coach cannot be blamed for losing a match in which their team played with a numerical disadvantage for over seventy minutes. The defeat to Uruguay thereafter was simply a case of the better group of players winning, which is again something the national team head coach is not culpable for.\n\nIn fact, Berhalter's overall tournament record in charge of the USMNT is quite impressive. They have won all three CONCACAF Nations Leagues, reached the semi-finals of all three CONCACAF Gold Cups (making the final twice and bringing one trophy home) and gotten to the knockouts of the FIFA World Cup. He has made his fair share of questionable selection and tactical decisions, but at the end of the day, such a record is hard to argue against.\n\nAdd to that the fact that there is no obvious candidate to replace Berhalter and do a significantly better job than this, and it should become clear why sacking him would be a very tough call. If someone like J\u00fcrgen Klopp is actually up for a national team job then most federations in the world would ditch their current coach in a heartbeat, but it is quite unlikely that he will take up such a job right now.\n\nBesides, even if Klopp was in charge of the USMNT going into this tournament, they would not have been among the favorites. The most important thing for a national team is quite simply to have good players, for which a well-structured and well-implemented nationwide youth development setup is necessary. The reason Uruguay were better than the USMNT is mostly down to the fact that a great proportion of kids in the States never get the chance to have a shot at professional football thanks to the pay-to-play system in the country.\n\nThe harsh reality is that there is no quick fix to the USMNT's issues. Unless the national approach to football-particularly at the youth levels-does not change, no coach in the world can make them one of the world's best teams.", "source": {"uri": "forbes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Forbes"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copa_Am\u00e9rica", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Copa Am\u00e9rica"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_men's_national_soccer_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States men's national soccer team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panama", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Panama"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Panama"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-elimination_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Single-elimination tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uruguay", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Uruguay"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Uruguay"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolivia", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bolivia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bolivia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timothy_Weah", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Timothy Weah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CONCACAF_Nations_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CONCACAF Nations League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_card", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Penalty card"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mexico national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folarin_Balogun", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Folarin Balogun"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregg_Berhalter", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gregg Berhalter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcelo_Bielsa", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marcelo Bielsa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colombia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Colombia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Colombia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CONCACAF_Gold_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CONCACAF Gold Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J\u00fcrgen_Klopp", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "J\u00fcrgen Klopp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CONCACAF", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CONCACAF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Flying_Discs/Ultimate_Frisbee", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Flying Discs/Ultimate Frisbee", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Softball/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Softball/Organizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONMEBOL", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONMEBOL", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Non-FIFA_Nations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Non-FIFA Nations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 76}], "image": "https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/668d25ebad52fa90907196be/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=600&width=1200&fit=bounds", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9720115", "eventUri": "eng-9720115", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2705882352941176, "wgt": 171, "relevance": 1}

According to Doug McIntyre of Fox Sports, U.S. Soccer made the decision to sack manager Gregg Berhalter just over one year after it announced that he would come back to lead the team following the expiration of his contract and a lengthy search for his replacement.\n\nThe decision was made after the USMNT flamed out of the group stage at Copa America, which was widely viewed as an opportunity to show that the team took a step forward following its elimination in the round of 16 at the 2022 World Cup in Qatar. Back then, Berhalter led the team through a tricky group before falling to European power The Netherlands.\n\nThis time around, the Americans fumbled their final opportunity to make any sort of major statement in a competitive international tournament ahead of 2026. The team started off group play with a 2-0 win against Bolivia that was defined by their inability to finish off chances and run up the score, before a shambolic game against Panama in which standout winger Timothy Weah received an inexplicable red card 18 minutes in. While Folarin Balogun was able to put them ahead despite being a man down not long after, the U.S. almost immediately conceded, then spent the entire second half letting Panama have the ball before Jos\u00e9 Fajardo scored with about 10 minutes left in the game.\n\nIt put the team in a situation where they needed to beat South American juggernaut Uruguay, one of the favorites to win the entire tournament, and hope Panama did not obliterate Bolivia if they were to go through to the knockout stage. Try as they might, the Americans could not break down the resilient Uruguayan defense, and thanks to a controversial goal on a free kick, Uruguay was able to secure a 1-0 win that sent the United States home.\n\nThe calls for Berhalter's job began almost immediately. Whether it was the Fox Sports panel after the game, USMNT fans on Twitter who have been skeptical of Berhalter since the convoluted process that led to his initial hiring in 2018, or those in attendance in Kansas City who chanted \"Fire Berhalter,\" American fans wanted someone to take responsibility for this, and because you can't trade out the players from the so-called \"golden generation\" who have struggled to live up to that reputation once they step outside of North American competition, the obvious choice was the manager whose stated goal from day one has been to change the way the world views American soccer.\n\nIn a way, that has happened during the Berhalter era, but not in the way he imagined. For years, the USMNT has been defined by a willingness to play as a collective, to run through a brick wall if it meant being the first player to get to the ball, in running fast and trying hard and white knuckling it against more talented teams that hammer you, but finding a way through sheer determination to get the goal(s) that you need to gut out a result. It's not the most aesthetically pleasing style of play in the world, and at some point their luck would run out and they'd get blitzed by Argentina or Belgium or someone, but you knew when the United States stepped onto the pitch, the other team was going to have to earn a result after 90 absolutely miserable minutes of being dragged into the mud.\n\nBerhalter wanted the team to take a more progressive, front foot approach that resembles some of the top club teams in the world. He spoke frequently about the team's system, which was designed to create chances by having players do their jobs, and if they managed to piece everything together within said system, opportunities to score goals would come. The games where this worked looked beautiful, but too often, the team would line up against top teams and come up short, and the benchmark for an international team -- how you perform in major tournaments -- looked pretty similar to how it's always looked once the team got outside of CONCACAF if you just looked at the results. Much was made about the lack of a signature win against a team other than the least talented Mexico team in decades during Berhalter's tenure.\n\nThere must, of course, be responsibility put on the players, and the necessary criticism that comes from, well, everything. The golden generation moniker has been thrown around for years, and while most of the players who make up said golden generation have yet to enter their primes, it's nevertheless a collection of talented individuals who have spent years playing alongside one another in both the youth and senior national team set-ups. And yet, when the games kick off, the chemistry that you'd presume was built up for years over years never seems to be there.\n\nThe question is whether that is the fault of the players, the fault of Berhalter, the fault of their clubs, the fault of U.S. Soccer as an institution, the fault of the fans or the pundit class or god knows whomever else. Maybe it's everyone and everything, all formed into one disgusting blob of hope and aspiration that ran into the harsh reality that men's soccer in this country is not -- and never will be, based on our current trajectory -- as good as we'd like. Or maybe it was just because Gregg Berhalter wasn't a good enough manager for a national team. At the very least, we'll figure out if that was the singular thing holding the USMNT back. And if more went into it, well, maybe U.S. Soccer will spend the next two years before anything and everything it does gets put under the most intense microscope in the sport trying to fix those problems, too.", "source": {"uri": "uproxx.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "UPROXX"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregg_Berhalter", "type": "person", "score":

You have a team that you're rooting on and you want to do well... but where have we come since 2022?\n\n'You qualify for the World Cup, get out of the group... and where have we progressed? We haven't. That's the most frustrating part.\n\nClint Dempsey didn't hold back in his assessment of the US Men's National Team on Monday\n\nUSA fans are desperate for Jurgen Klopp to get the job now that Berhalter has been fired\n\n'This is our golden generation and it looks like we're wasting it. 2026 is coming up, you're never going to get this opportunity again. '94 we had it, we're going to have it here, but then you don't know when that next time is going to come.'\n\nAlongside him, Alexi Lalas also weighed in and slammed manager Berhalter after another poor showing.\n\n'If this is as good as it gets, it's not good enough,' the ex-USA midfielder said.

U.S. Soccer had hoped to build momentum toward that World Cup with an impressive Copa America showing. Instead, the program was forced to make a major change in leadership.\n\nBerhalter finishes his nearly six-year USMNT tenure with a coaching record of 44 wins, 17 losses and 13 draws in 74 matches. During Berhalter's tenure, the USMNT won two Concacaf Nations League titles, the 2021 Concacaf Gold Cup and advanced out of the group stage of the 2022 World Cup. However, the squad -- hailed as a \"golden generation\" featuring players such as Christian Pulisic, Weston McKennie, Tim Weah and Sergi\u00f1o Dest -- could not attain a signature win against a world soccer powerhouse during Berhalter's tenure.\n\nFollowing the 2022 World Cup, Berhalter's contract was allowed to expire after the parents of Gio Reyna, unhappy with their son's playing time, reported to U.S. Soccer and then went public with details of a 30-year-old domestic violence incident involving Berhalter and his then-girlfriend, now wife, Rosalind. U.S. Soccer launched an investigation into the incident, which occurred in 1992 when both Berhalters were soccer players at North Carolina. Berhalter was cleared to remain a candidate for the USMNT coaching job after a U.S. Soccer investigation, and in June 2023 Berhalter was back as USMNT coach.\n\nTheir fate was decided in a matter of five minutes. The U.S. men's national soccer team gained a slight sense of hope to advance in the tournament when their game against Uruguay remained scoreless and Bolivia tied Panama 1-1 in Orlando, which would give the Americans a tiebreaking edge.\n\nFive minutes later, Uruguay scored. Panama scored quickly after, and once more, to make the cut deeper and beat Bolivia 3-1.\n\nUruguay and Panama advanced to the Copa America quarterfinals out of Group C. Argentina and Canada advanced out of Group A, while Venezuela and Ecuador edged Mexico in Group B, and Colombia and Brazil advanced out of Group D to the quarterfinals.\n\nThe USMNT made a splash in its Copa America opener, beating Bolivia 2-0 following a goal and assist by Pulisic.\n\nBut the Americans' game against Uruguay was a must-win after a chaotic 2-1 loss to Panama in their second group game. Standout midfielder Timothy Weah earned a red card in the 18 minute, forcing USMNT to play 10 vs. 11 for most of the Panama match. Although Folarin Balogun scored his second goal of the tournament in the 22 minute, Panama scored in the 26 and 83 minutes to steal the victory.\n\nPlaying against Uruguay without Weah and injured goalie Matt Turner, the U.S. kept the game scoreless for the first half. Uruguay's Math\u00edas Olivera scored in the 66 minute.\n\nPrior to the tournament, the USMNT played two drastically different friendly matches -- a 5-1 loss to Colombia on June 8 and a 1-1 draw against Brazil on June 12.\n\nThe matches were a precursor to a frustrating Copa America run, leaving USMNT in search for new leadership at a critical time for the sport in the country.", "source":

But the United States almost never beat top teams in the Berhalter era and has appeared to stagnate despite arguably having the best young generation of payers in USMNT history, led by Christian Pulisic.\n\nThat was compounded by the rough showing at the Copa Am\u00e9rica, a result that led to major USMNT supporter's groups calling for Berhalter's firing. A tipping point had been reached.\n\n\"Our tournament performance fell short of our expectations,\" the United States Soccer Federation said in a statement at the time. \"We must do better. We will be conducting a comprehensive review of our performance in Copa America and how best to improve the team and results as we look towards the 2026 World Cup.\"\n\nThere was also the fact that Berhalter was out of the job for six months in 2022 after his contract ran out, as the USSF investigated claims from Danielle and Claudio Reyna that Berhalter assaulted his now-wife, Rosalind, while the pair were in college.\n\nHe was ultimately rehired in June 2023. And despite a number of supporters and pundits believing he should have been replaced far earlier than now, he also had his allies, namely among the players.\n\n\"I see no issue with the direction we're heading,\" goalkeeper Matt Turner told reporters after the Copa Am\u00e9rica debacle. \"When you have a fight like that on the pitch in every single game we're in in this tournament, it speaks volumes to how the manager prepares us.\"\n\n\"I believe we all have a comfort with Gregg and we all understand him and we've had him for a long time,\" Weston McKennie added. \"He's progressed the team very far from where we started off four or five years ago. I think the connection that we have with him is what's important, in having a coach that players that would run through a brick wall for him, players that listen to him.\"\n\nThe USSF -- and many more fans and pundits -- clearly disagreed. A new era for United States soccer is coming, as the country searches for the right manager to prepare the squad for the 2026 World Cup.

The 50-year-old is out as head coach, as first reported by FOX Sports' Doug McIntyre.\n\nBerhalter's exit comes after USMNT's disappointing show at this year's tournament where they tallied just three points in the group stage and failed to move on to the quarterfinals. The search for a new head coach ahead of the 2026 World Cup - which the U.S. will jointly host with Canada and Mexico - will begin immediately.\n\nThe New Jersey native took over as the national team's head coach in 2018, after Bruce Arena resigned from the position after a brief second stint. Berhalter went on to lead the team to a CONCACAF Nations League win in 2019-20, a CONCACAF Gold Cup win in 2021 and a 2022 World Cup run to the round of 16. U.S. Soccer initially chose not to renew his contract after 2022, though it re-hired Berhalter the following June.\n\nAfter giving Berhalter five years in total at the helm, U.S. Soccer has ultimately decided to move in a different direction. All we can do for right now is speculate, but here are three candidates we think the federation could consider for the newly open USMNT head coach job.\n\nBerhalter out: Gregg Berhalter fired as US men's national soccer team coach, per report\n\nCallaghan was most recently the assistant coach of the U.S. Men's National Team under Berhalter. In 2023, he served as one of the team's interim head coaches during the first time the U.S. Soccer Federation searched for a Berhalter replacement.\n\nThe United States lost just one game during Callaghan's stint as interim head coach: a penalty shootout loss to Panama in the 2023 CONCACAF Gold Cup. In addition, it was Callaghan who led the team to wins in the 2023 Nations League Finals semi-finals (3-0 over Mexico) and championship game (2-0 over Canada).\n\nThe sample size is admittedly small, but Callaghan has experience and success as the leader of this exact squad. The U.S. Soccer Federation would not have to go far to find a replacement for Berhalter if they think they have a good option in-house.\n\nCOPA AMERICA: Messi enjoying 'last battles' to fullest as Argentina reaches Copa America final\n\nIf U.S. Soccer wants an \"in-house\" option that isn't Callaghan, Curtin is one of its best options. He has been the head coach of the Philadelphia Union (of the USSF-sanctioned MLS) since 2014 and has established himself as one of the league's best coaches.\n\nCurtin led the Union to three U.S. Open Cup finals (2014, 2015, 2018) and the MLS Cup final in 2022. He earned MLS Coach of the Year honors in 2020 and 2022, and has a 164-106-126 record with a +114 goal differential as the Union's head coach over his decade-long tenure.\n\nU.S. Soccer has a history of hiring successful MLS coaches as the head coach of the national team. The federation did it with Berhalter - formerly of the Columbus Crew - in 2018 and with Arena - once the head coach of D.C. United - in 1998. Curtin has one of the best track records of MLS head coaches right now and would fit the mold established by previous hiring practices.\n\nRenard, a 55-year-old Frenchman and the head coach of France's national women's team, has something of a reputation for pushing national teams to a higher level.\n\nIn 2012, Renard led Zambia to its first victory in the African Cup of Nations (AFCON), a full 38 years after the team's first tournament appearance. Three years later, he led Ivory Coast to its second-ever AFCON win and first since 1992, becoming the first head coach to win an AFCON tournament with two different countries. In 2018, Renard got Morocco into the 2018 World Cup for their first time qualifying since 1998.\n\nTwo years ago, it was Renard who coached Saudi Arabia to a 2-1 World Cup-opening win over eventual champions Argentina.\n\nAttempts to draw Renard to the United States will be more difficult than either of the other candidates. In January of this year, Ivory Coast attempted to bring him back \"on loan\" from the French women's national team for this year's AFCON tournament, but the French Football Federation rejected their request.\n\nEURO 2024: UEFA Euro 2024 bracket: England vs. Spain in Sunday's final\n\nJ\u00fcrgen Klopp is never going to be the head coach of the United States men's national team, but it is a fun dream to have. An all-time great manager coming to coach up the American team after stepping down from his decade-long job at Liverpool? Of course that's an exciting concept.\n\nKlopp himself once likened his teams' style of play to heavy metal in that they are highly aggressive, with an inclination to immediately press opposing teams after losing possession. Using his tactics, Klopp's Liverpool teams over the last 10 years have been among the Premier League's most successful, winning the league in 2019-20, the FA Cup in 2021-22 and the EFL (formerly Carabao Cup) in 2021-22 and this year.\n\nThe German coaching mastermind is one of the best coaches in the world. Given his price point and recently stated desire to take a break from managing soccer teams, he's nothing but a pipe dream for USMNT fans.", "source": {"uri": "ca.sports.yahoo.com", "dataType":

After already bringing in one of the best coaches in the world in Emma Hayes to lead the U.S. women, U.S. Soccer has shown that the best managers can be attracted to America but there are questions about if the men's job is as attractive of a role even with a World Cup on home soil in 2026. Because of that, I've broken possible managerial candidates out by starting with the dream names before moving into more realistic targets with U.S. Soccer reportedly set to address Berhalter's future this week.\n\nLet's take a look:\n\nThe dream pick\n\nJurgen Klopp (last club: Liverpool): While Jurgen Klopp has stepped down as manager of Liverpool and plans to take time away from management, U.S. Soccer wouldn't be doing their due diligence if they didn't call him and see if there was a chance that he'd like to lead the USMNT during the 2026 World Cup. There's no bigger name available on the market right now and Klopp's drive and style are things that would suit the side to take this group of players to the next level. While unlikely, why not call and see what happens? He also coached Christian Pulisic at Borussia Dortmund and seems very fond of the player.\n\nProven international coaches\n\nJoachim Low (last team: Germany): A World Cup winner with Germany, Low's attacking style would be a stark departure from Berhalter's principles in a good way. This team needs to find its way as an attacking force to lean into the fact that most of the best players are on the attacking side of the pitch. Having coached some of the world's best, Low is someone who could come in and immediately demand respect while restoring excitement ahead of the 2026 World Cup.\n\nHerve Renard (France women's national team): Architect of one of the biggest World Cup upsets ever as Saudi Arabia defeated Argentina at the 2022 World Cup, the current manager of the French women's international side is set to depart following the Olympics. International sides have improved under Renard as he has now led Zambia, Angola, the Ivory Coast, Morocco, Saudi Arabia, and now France, so could he add another international side?\n\nGareth Southgate (England): Alright, so there could be a situation where Southgate wins Euros and rides off into the sunset departing England. While he was linked to Manchester United, they've opted to keep Ten Hag creating another situation of why not call when the worst that you'd hear is no? And if you are mocking him as being called proven, just remember he's gotten to a World Cup semifinal and a Euro final before Euro 2024.\n\nExperience coaching the big boys\n\nMauricio Pochettino (last club: Chelsea): The former Chelsea manager has a wealth of experience while also being well-liked by most of his players. But when you're on the outs of Pochettino's side, he has been someone not afraid to address it, demanding more from his teams. The accountability factor and proven track record with improving young players are things that could be important for helping this group grow. Like Klopp, attainability could be the issue as Pochettino will still be in the mix for club jobs and could also be a suitor for the England job if it were to open.\n\nFrank Lampard (last club: Chelsea): Reportedly being in the running for the Canada job before Jesse Marsch was brought in, Lampard is someone who has had a middling time managing in club soccer with Chelsea but being a good club manager doesn't always mean that someone will be a good national team manager. This is in no way advocating for Lampard to get the role but when considering who could end up on a list for U.S. Soccer, Lampard could come up in discussions.\n\nZinedine Zidane (last club: Real Madrid): No one knows what the former Real Madrid manager wants to do next as he could be waiting for the France job to open but it's another situation where it doesn't hurt to make the call. Both a legend himself and with experience managing other legends of the game, Zidane could bring a perspective to the USMNT that these players have never experienced which is something that could help push them to the next level.\n\nMax Allegri (last club: Juventus): Having managed Tim Weah and Weston McKennie, there's already a sense of familiarity with the USMNT for the former Juventus boss. Someone with plenty of experience in his career, Allegri has finished as a runner-up for Champions League twice while winning Serie A six times. Allegri could have quite a few suitors for his services but a shift to the United States could make sense.\n\nThomas Tuchel (last club: Bayern Munich): With Erik ten Hag staying at Manchester United, Tuchel is still without a job after departing Bayern Munich. Like Klopp, the United States getting Tuchel would probably be a pipe dream but with his attacking ideas and familiarity with Pulisic, there are few managers who could get more out of the USMNT attack in a short period of time.\n\nMarcelo Gallardo (last club: Al-Ittihad): Gallardo has had quite a ride since departing River Plate. It seemed like he was destined for a top European role but it just hasn't materialized. If a job like the United States were to open, Gallardo does have pedigree and an attacking style which could suit the team. He's also familiar with the United States having played for D.C. United.\n\nGraham Potter (last club: Chelsea): After departing Chelsea in 2023, Potter has been a free agent since. Linked to Ajax, nothing ended up coming together for the Englishman but similarly to Julian Nagelsmann, a short term move to international management could be what the doctor ordered.\n\nStefano Pioli (last club: Milan): Of the current free agents, Pioli could be the one who makes the most sense for the USMNT. Getting the best out of Pulisic for Milan despite the club struggling as a whole, Pioli has had links to clubs like Marseille but they haven't led to the Italian finding a role. Flexible in his style, could the USMNT be that next step?\n\nDavid Moyes (last club: West Ham): In a similar boat to Pioli, Moyes departed West Ham United at the end of the season. With the Hammers, Moyes has been able to do more with less winning the Europa Conference League for the club's first major trophy since 1980. At 61, there could be a chance that Moyes would want to take a step back from the game for a little but his experience is well-suited.\n\nRudi Garcia (last club: Napoli): Another manager with experience in Saudi Arabia who could be looking for a new role, Garcia has plenty of experience having coached at Lille, Napoli, Roma, and Marseille. It was a disappointing spell at Napoli after they won the Scudetto but that isn't all down to what Garcia did with the club.\n\nMLS' best\n\nWilfried Nancy (Columbus Crew): The best coach currently in Major League Soccer, Nancy has been linked to European roles and may find one of those to be more attractive than taking a role with the USMNT, but he's another manager where in doing due diligence, he needs to be called and offered an interview. Employing different tactical styles with the Columbus Crew and also playing on the front foot, Nancy is someone who would endear himself to USMNT fans quickly.\n\nJim Curtin (Philadelphia Union): A former United States international who got into coaching through MLS, there are similarities between Berhalter and the current Philadelphia Union boss but that's where they end. Season after season, Curtin has done more with less in Philadelphia while turning the team into one where everyone knows how they should play. Also known for improving young players and having coached current members of the U.S. setup, Curtin is someone who would likely be looked at if the role is open.\n\nSteve Cherundolo (Los Angeles FC): An extremely accomplished player, Cherundolo cut his teeth in Germany with Hannover 96 and has found success coming stateside with Los Angeles FC. Playing attractive soccer and also managing stars with the Black and Gold, his star is quickly rising in the coaching ranks, but the only question would be does he have enough experience for the role? Being a former international, that likely wouldn't matter, however, as those ties to the U.S. are always worth something.\n\nPat Noonan (FC Cincinnati): While similar to Curtin in MLS play, the attack of Noonan's FC Cincinnati side is something to behold. Even after losing Brandon Vazquez to Monterrey, they're atop the Eastern Conference with one of the best goal differences in MLS. Cincinnati's system has been one that leads to goals and it could suit the USMNT setup as well, especially if his star becomes a U.S. citizen.\n\nGary Smith (last club: Nashville SC): Smith had an impressive run with Nashville SC as their first coach ever but that has come to an end leaving him as a free agent. Another coach who has done more with less, Smith has coached Walker Zimmerman and Shaq Moore while also managing Canadian international Jacob Shaffleburg. Smith's attention to detail would translate well to the international game but there are questions of if the lack of attacking punch in his Nashville sides were because of players or his style.\n\nOther American coaches\n\nDavid Wagner (last club: Norwich): If you can't get Klopp, there are worse ideas than calling someone who worked under him. This is where we get into more attainable options even if they may not be as attractive as some of the non-domestic names. Wagner has done good things with Huddersfield Town but also had his fair share of managerial disappointments which could detract from him becoming a serious contender for the role.\n\nPelligrino Matarazzo (Hoffenheim): Out of the American coaches, Matazzaro is one who could have the least interest in a role with the United States due to being in a strong role currently with Hoffenheim. Joining in February of 2023, Matarazzo led them to a Europa League spot so it'd be down to -- is the USMNT job a bigger role than managing a European contender in Europe?\n\nBruce Arena (last club: New England Revolution): Spell three of Bruce Arena with the USMNT feels like one too many but the 72-year-old is still interested in being a manager even after his dismissal from the New England Revolution for discriminatory remarks. An appointment with Arena would need to come with some transparency of why he was dismissed but when he has been one of the most successful USMNT managers ever and was the person who the federation turned to with the 2018 World Cup on the line, there are reasons why he could be an emergency hire ahead of 2026, though highly unlikely.\n\nCrocker connections\n\nRuben Selles (Reading): While Selles hasn't had much top-level managerial experience, this is where experience with Crocker comes into play. Selles has twice been the caretaker manager of Southampton during Crocker's time at the club and has been in management since age 23, gaining experience all over the world at such a young age. While it hasn't led to a top role yet, it could be putting Selles on the road to international management.\n\nRalph Hasenhuttl (Wolfsburg): Keeping with managers who have worked under Crocker, Hasenhuttl is another unlikely name to coach the USMNT but his style would work well. Pressing and being aggressive are when the USMNT are at their best and it's something that he would have the team doing while utilizing their wing backs to create space and strengthen the midfield.", "source": {"uri": "cbssports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "chuck_booth@cbssports.com", "name": "Chuck Booth", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregg_Berhalter", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gregg Berhalter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Lampard", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Frank Lampard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Soccer_Federation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Soccer Federation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "England national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J\u00fcrgen_Klopp", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "J\u00fcrgen Klopp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mauricio_Pochettino", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mauricio Pochettino"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_men's_national_soccer_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States men's national soccer team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelsea_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chelsea F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Arabia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Pulisic", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Christian Pulisic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herv\u00e9_Renard", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Herv\u00e9 Renard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gareth_Southgate", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gareth Southgate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stefano_Pioli", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Stefano Pioli"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France_women's_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "France women's national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcelo_Gallardo", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Marcelo Gallardo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Tuchel", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Thomas Tuchel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massimiliano_Allegri", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Massimiliano Allegri"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Moyes", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "David Moyes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Madrid_CF", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Real Madrid CF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graham_Potter", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Graham Potter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S.S.C._Napoli", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "S.S.C.

The person said an announcement was likely for later Wednesday.\n\nBerhalter's second term as coach was cut short 10 months after he returned to the bench with high hopes and proclaimed the team's goal was \"to change soccer in America forever.\" The U.S. had seven wins, six losses and one draw in his second stint, leaving his overall record at 44 wins, 17 losses and 13 draws.\n\nSporting director Matt Crocker rehired Berhalter and also will make the recommendation on his replacement. The team next plays in September friendlies against Canada and New Zealand.\n\nJ\u00fcrgen Klopp, Thierry Henry and Marcelo Bielsa are among those being speculated about as candidates to replace Berhalter, along with Jesse Marsch, Hugo P\u00e9rez, Pellegrino Matarazzo, David Wagner, Steve Cherundolo, Jim Curtain, Massimiliano Allegri and Mauricio Pochettino.\n\nBerhalter earned $2,291,136 in 2022, including $900,000 in bonuses for the Americans qualifying for the World Cup and reaching the second round. A top-level men's coach could put pressure on the USSF to increase the salary of newly hired women's coach Emma Hayes.\n\nJust 23 months remain before the World Cup comes to the United States for the second time and the Americans play their opener at Inglewood, California, on June 12, 2026. The only competitive matches with the full player pool before then likely will be in the CONCACAF Nations League.\n\nBerhalter, who turns 51 on Aug. 1, was the first American to coach the national team after playing for the team at a World Cup. He was hired to coach the U.S. in December 2018 after stints with Sweden's Hammarby (2011-13) and Major League Soccer's Columbus Crew (2013-18).\n\nHe led the U.S. to titles in the CONCACAF Nations League in 2020, 2023 and 2024 and to another with a B team in the 2021 CONCACAF Gold Cup. His players strongly supported Berhalter, saying he fostered a culture that bound the group.\n\nThat support led to Crocker rehiring Berhalter five months after his initial contract expired amid an investigation of a decades-old domestic violence allegation that was brought to the USSF's attention by the Reyna family, which was upset that Berhalter limited Gio Reyna's playing time at the World Cup. A law firm retained by the USSF said there was no legal obstacle to bringing Berhalter back.\n\nHis detractors cited lack of success against teams outside the region and struggles on the road against Central American rivals. The U.S. gained the region's final automatic World Cup berth on goal difference, and it had the second-youngest team at the 2022 tournament in Qatar. The U.S. wasted a second-half lead in a 1-1 draw with Wales, tied England 0-0 and defeated Iran 1-0 to reach the knockout stage, where the Americans played poorly in a 3-1 loss to the Netherlands.\n\nPlayers exhibited a lack of discipline: Defender Sergi\u00f1o Dest got a red card last November at Trinidad and Tobago for arguing with a referee and winger Tim Weah was ejected from the Panama match for punching an opponent on the head.\n\nU.S. coaches have not fared well in a second cycle.\n\nBruce Arena led the team to a quarterfinal appearance in 2002, its best since 1930, then failed to advance past the group stage in 2006.\n\nBob Bradley's team reached the second round in 2010, earning him a four-year contract extension only for the USSF to fire him 11 months later after the Americans wasted a two-goal lead and lost to Mexico in the CONCACAF Gold Cup final.\n\nJurgen Klinsmann replaced him and led the team to the second round of the 2014 World Cup, then was fired after opening the final round of 2018 qualifying with a 2-1 home loss to Mexico and a 4-0 defeat at Costa Rica. Arena returned and the U.S. lost at Trinidad and Tobago on the final day of qualifying, ending a run of seven straight World Cup appearances.\n\nWhile the new coach inherits players such as Christian Pulisic, Weston McKennie and Tyler Adams who have thrived with European clubs, goalkeepers Matt Turner and Ethan Horvath and Reyna have failed to gain playing time with first-tier teams.", "source":

The person said an announcement was likely for later Wednesday.\n\nBerhalter's second term as coach was cut short 10 months after he returned to the bench with high hopes and proclaimed the team's goal was \"to change soccer in America forever.\" The U.S. had seven wins, six losses and one draw in his second stint, leaving his overall record at 44 wins, 17 losses and 13 draws.\n\nSporting director Matt Crocker rehired Berhalter and also will make the recommendation on his replacement. The team next plays in September friendlies against Canada and New Zealand.\n\nJ\u00fcrgen Klopp, Thierry Henry and Marcelo Bielsa are among those being speculated about as candidates to replace Berhalter, along with Jesse Marsch, Hugo P\u00e9rez, Pellegrino Matarazzo, David Wagner, Steve Cherundolo, Jim Curtain, Massimiliano Allegri and Mauricio Pochettino.\n\nSalary could be an issue.\n\nBerhalter earned $2,291,136 in 2022, including $900,000 in bonuses for the Americans qualifying for the World Cup and reaching the second round. A top-level men's coach could put pressure on the USSF to increase the salary of newly hired women's coach Emma Hayes.\n\nJust 23 months remain before the World Cup comes to the United States for the second time and the Americans play their opener at Inglewood, California, on June 12, 2026. The only competitive matches with the full player pool before then likely will be in the CONCACAF Nations League.\n\nBerhalter, who turns 51 on Aug. 1, was the first American to coach the national team after playing for the team at a World Cup. He was hired to coach the U.S. in December 2018 after stints with Sweden's Hammarby (2011-13) and Major League Soccer's Columbus Crew (2013-18).\n\nHe led the U.S. to titles in the CONCACAF Nations League in 2020, 2023 and 2024 and to another with a B team in the 2021 CONCACAF Gold Cup. His players strongly supported Berhalter, saying he fostered a culture that bound the group.\n\nThat support led to Crocker rehiring Berhalter five months after his initial contract expired amid an investigation of a decades-old domestic violence allegation that was brought to the USSF's attention by the Reyna family, which was upset that Berhalter limited Gio Reyna's playing time at the World Cup. A law firm retained by the USSF said there was no legal obstacle to bringing Berhalter back.\n\nHis detractors cited lack of success against teams outside the region and struggles on the road against Central American rivals. The U.S. gained the region's final automatic World Cup berth on goal difference, and it had the second-youngest team at the 2022 tournament in Qatar. The U.S. wasted a second-half lead in a 1-1 draw with Wales, tied England 0-0 and defeated Iran 1-0 to reach the knockout stage, where the Americans played poorly in a 3-1 loss to the Netherlands.\n\nPlayers exhibited a lack of discipline: Defender Sergi\u00f1o Dest got a red card last November at Trinidad and Tobago for arguing with a referee and winger Tim Weah was ejected from the Panama match for punching an opponent on the head.\n\nU.S. coaches have not fared well in a second cycle.\n\nBruce Arena led the team to a quarterfinal appearance in 2002, its best since 1930, then failed to advance past the group stage in 2006.\n\nBob Bradley's team reached the second round in 2010, earning him a four-year contract extension only for the USSF to fire him 11 months later after the Americans wasted a two-goal lead and lost to Mexico in the CONCACAF Gold Cup final.\n\nJurgen Klinsmann replaced him and led the team to the second round of the 2014 World Cup, then was fired after opening the final round of 2018 qualifying with a 2-1 home loss to Mexico and a 4-0 defeat at Costa Rica. Arena returned and the U.S. lost at Trinidad and Tobago on the final day of qualifying, ending a run of seven straight World Cup appearances.\n\nWhile the new coach inherits players such as Christian

Would the U.S. win a World Cup?", "body": "Ryan O'Hanlon is a staff writer for ESPN.com. He's also the author of \"Net Gains: Inside the Beautiful Game's Analytics Revolution.\"\n\nDeep within the hivemind of the U.S. men's national team fan base, there has always been this lingering thought: \"What if? What if we just hired one of the best soccer coaches in the world to coach our soccer team? That would be what puts us over the top.\"\n\nIt already happened once -- sort of. In 2006, Jurgen Klinsmann led a reenergized and rebooted Germany to extra time of the semifinals of the World Cup. The former national team star brought fresh ideas and a new perspective to a program that was seemingly being held back by tradition.\n\nAfter the tournament, fans decided that he was the guy to lead the USMNT, and so too did the U.S. Soccer Federation. But talks eventually broke down much to the disappointment of almost everyone, and Bob Bradley was appointed the interim and eventual-full-time coach. Bradley then led the team through perhaps its most successful modern period: winning the Gold Cup final against Mexico for the first time in 2007, taking down all-conquering superpower Spain in the semifinals of the Confederations Cup in 2009 and winning a World Cup group that included England in 2010.\n\nEventually, though, Klinsmann did come, replacing Bradley in 2011. It's just that he turned out to be more of a salesman than a savior. He talked a big game about getting players out of their comfort zones and reconceptualizing how this country viewed soccer, but there was no progress.\n\nThe team got out of its group at the 2014 World Cup, before hanging on for dear life in an extra-time loss to Belgium. In 2015, the Americans were eliminated in the semifinals of the Gold Cup by Jamaica, and after an unlikely run to the semifinals of the 2016 Copa America bought him some more time, Klinsmann was fired later that year with the U.S. at the bottom of the World Cup qualifying standings.\n\nNow, you wouldn't necessarily be wrong to think that this process was right in theory, but wrong in practice. As the succession of post-USMNT failures suggests, Klinsmann is simply just not a good coach. And with the USMNT's disastrous group stage exit under Gregg Berhalter, plenty of U.S. fans and former players are now telling themselves that the team hired the wrong Jurgen.\n\nSo, let's just say that U.S. Soccer went out and actually hired arguably the best coach in the world: former Liverpool and Borussia Dortmund manager Jurgen Klopp. What would it look like, and what might actually happen?", "source": {"uri": "espn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ESPN.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_men's_national_soccer_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States men's national soccer team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J\u00fcrgen_Klinsmann", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "J\u00fcrgen Klinsmann"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Bradley_(soccer)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Michael Bradley (soccer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN.com", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ESPN.com"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Germany national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Overtime (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Bradley", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bob Bradley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CONCACAF_Gold_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "CONCACAF Gold Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_Confederations_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FIFA Confederations Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Soccer_Federation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Soccer Federation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "England national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregg_Berhalter", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gregg Berhalter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup_qualification", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup qualification"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copa_Am\u00e9rica_Centenario", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Copa Am\u00e9rica Centenario"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J\u00fcrgen_Klopp", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "J\u00fcrgen Klopp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borussia_Dortmund", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Borussia Dortmund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaica", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgium", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Belgium"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Belgium"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Competitions", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONMEBOL", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONMEBOL", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Coaching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2024%2F0709%2Fr1356574_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9720115", "eventUri": "eng-9720115", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 151, "relevance": 1}

The game was marred by a Tim Weah red card after he threw a punch at a Panamanian player. The infraction left the U.S. team team down a man only 18 minutes into the game. Jos\u00e9 Fajardo scored in the 83rd minute to seal the game for Panama.\n\nThe U.S. was then bounced from the tournament after a 1-0 loss on July 1 to perennial South American powerhouse Uruguay, a 15-time Copa America champion.\n\nThe loss fueled speculation about Berhalter's future with the team before the 2026 World Cup, which will be hosted in the U.S., Mexico and Canada.\n\nAfter its loss to Uruguay, U.S. Soccer technical director Matt Crocker released the following statement indicating changes might be afoot:\n\n\"Our tournament performance fell short of our expectations. We must do better. We will be conducting a comprehensive review of our performance in Copa America and how best to improve the team and results as we look towards the 2026 World Cup.\"", "source": {"uri": "nbcnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregg_Berhalter", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gregg Berhalter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copa_Am\u00e9rica", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Copa Am\u00e9rica"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_men's_national_soccer_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States men's national soccer team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panama", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Panama"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Panama"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Soccer_Federation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Soccer Federation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Crocker", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Matt Crocker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cindy_Parlow_Cone", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cindy Parlow Cone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_America", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "South America"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caribbean", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Caribbean"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_America", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Central America"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "North America"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolivia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bolivia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bolivia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos\u00e9_Fajardo_(footballer)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jos\u00e9 Fajardo (footballer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timothy_Weah", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Timothy Weah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_card", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Penalty card"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uruguay", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Uruguay"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Uruguay"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Flying_Discs/Ultimate_Frisbee", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Flying Discs/Ultimate Frisbee", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONCACAF", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONCACAF", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Softball/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Softball/Organizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Airsoft/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Airsoft/Teams", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1024-512,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2024-07/240710-Gregg-Berhalter-ew-645p-275cac.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9720115", "eventUri": "eng-9720115", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-27", "textStart": 125, "textEnd": 132, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-01", "textStart": 1500, "textEnd": 1506}], "sentiment": -0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 150, "relevance": 1}

He led the U.S. back to soccer's marquee competition and into the round of 16, and was rehired for the 2026 World Cup cycle last June by Matt Crocker, who had become the federation's sporting director two months earlier.\n\nThe USMNT would've been eliminated in the Nations League semis by Jamaica if not for a 95th-minute own goal by the Reggae Boyz. They lost in Trinidad late last year and at home to Panama in this year's Copa Am\u00e9rica, failing to recover from gratuitous red cards in each games, both of which they led. The Americans were also outclassed by Germany in a 3-1 friendly loss last October and humiliated in a pre-Copa exhibition against Colombia, a 5-1 shellacking that was the program's most lopsided defeat in 13 years.\n\nNeeding a win and some help to advance to the Copa quarterfinals, the U.S. lost to Uruguay on July 1 -- the first time the country failed to advance from group play at a major tournament since 2007.\n\nBerhalter finishes his U.S. tenure with 44 wins, 15 losses and 13 ties. He holds the highest winning percentage of any permanent USMNT coach. It wasn't enough to save his job in the end.

This creates an opportunity for U.S. Soccer technical director Matt Crocker to determine what the future holds for the United States men's national team ahead of the 2026 World Cup.\n\nAfter previously bringing in one of the best coaches in the world, Emma Hayes, to lead the women's squad, U.S. Soccer has shown that the best managers can be attracted to America. Still, there are questions about whether the men's job is as attractive of a role even with a World Cup on home soil in 2026.\n\nWith so much regarding USMNT up in the air, let's take a look at the top managerial candidates to take over for Berhalter. We'll start with a dream option before moving into perhaps more realistic targets.\n\nIdeal choice\n\nJurgen Klopp, former Liverpool manager: While Klopp stepped down from Liverpool and plans to take time away from management, U.S. Soccer wouldn't be doing their due diligence if they didn't call him and see if there was a chance that he'd like to lead the USMNT during the 2026 World Cup. There's no bigger name available on the market right now, and Klopp's drive and style are things that would suit the side to take this group of players to the next level. While unlikely, why not call and see what happens? He also coached Christian Pulisic at Borussia Dortmund and seems fond of the player.\n\nProven international coaches\n\nJoachim Low, former Germany manager: A World Cup winner with Germany, Low's attacking style would be a stark departure from Berhalter's principles in a good way. This team needs to find its way as an attacking force to lean into the fact that most of the best players are on the attacking side of the pitch. Having coached some of the world's best, Low is someone who could come in and immediately demand respect while restoring excitement ahead of the 2026 World Cup.\n\nHerve Renard, France women's manager: Architect of one of the biggest World Cup upsets ever as Saudi Arabia defeated Argentina at the 2022 World Cup, the current manager of the French women's international side is set to depart following the Olympics. International sides have improved under Renard as he has now led Zambia, Angola, the Ivory Coast, Morocco, Saudi Arabia, and now France, so could he add another international side?\n\nGareth Southgate, England manager: Alright, so there could be a situation where Southgate wins Euros and rides off into the sunset departing England. While he was linked to Manchester United, they've opted to keep Ten Hag creating another situation of why not call when the worst that you'd hear is no? And if you are mocking him as being called proven, just remember he's gotten to a World Cup semifinal and a Euro final before Euro 2024.\n\nExperience coaching the big boys\n\nMauricio Pochettino, former Chelsea manager: Pochettino has a wealth of experience while also being well-liked by most of his players. But when you're on the outs with Pochettino, he has been someone not afraid to address it, demanding more from his teams. The accountability factor and proven track record with improving young players are things that could be important for helping this group grow. Like Klopp, attainability could be the issue as Pochettino will still be in the mix for club jobs and could also be a suitor for the England job if it were to open.\n\nFrank Lampard, former Chelsea manager: Reportedly being in the running for the Canada job before Jesse Marsch was brought in, Lampard is someone who has had a middling time managing in club soccer with Chelsea but being a good club manager doesn't always mean that someone will be a good national team manager. This is in no way advocating for Lampard to get the role but when considering who could end up on a list for U.S. Soccer, Lampard could come up in discussions.\n\nZinedine Zidane, former Real Madrid manager: No one knows what the former Real Madrid manager wants to do next as he could be waiting for the France job to open but it's another situation where it doesn't hurt to make the call. Both a legend himself and with experience managing other legends of the game, Zidane could bring a perspective to the USMNT that these players have never experienced which is something that could help push them to the next level.\n\nMax Allegri, former Juventus manager: Having managed Tim Weah and Weston McKennie, there's already a sense of familiarity with the USMNT for the former Juventus boss. Someone with plenty of experience in his career, Allegri has finished as a runner-up for Champions League twice while winning Serie A six times. Allegri could have quite a few suitors for his services but a shift to the United States could make sense.\n\nThomas Tuchel, former Bayern Munich manager: With Erik ten Hag staying at Manchester United, Tuchel is still without a job after departing Bayern Munich. Like Klopp, the United States getting Tuchel would probably be a pipe dream but with his attacking ideas and familiarity with Pulisic, there are few managers who could get more out of the USMNT attack in a short period of time.\n\nMarcelo Gallardo, former Al-Ittihad manager: Gallardo has had quite a ride since departing River Plate. It seemed like he was destined for a top European role but it just hasn't materialized. If a job like the United States were to open, Gallardo does have pedigree and an attacking style which could suit the team. He's also familiar with the United States having played for D.C. United.\n\nGraham Potter, former Chelsea manager: After departing Chelsea in 2023, Potter has been a free agent since. Linked to Ajax, nothing ended up coming together for the Englishman but similarly to Julian Nagelsmann, a short term move to international management could be what the doctor ordered.\n\nStefano Pioli, former Milan manager: Of the current free agents, Pioli could be the one who makes the most sense for the USMNT. Getting the best out of Pulisic for Milan despite the club struggling as a whole, Pioli has had links to clubs like Marseille but they haven't led to the Italian finding a role. Flexible in his style, could the USMNT be that next step?\n\nDavid Moyes, former West Ham manager: In a similar boat to Pioli, Moyes departed West Ham United at the end of the season. With the Hammers, Moyes has been able to do more with less winning the Europa Conference League for the club's first major trophy since 1980. At 61, there could be a chance that Moyes would want to take a step back from the game for a little but his experience is well-suited.\n\nRudi Garcia, former Napoli manager: Another manager with experience in Saudi Arabia who could be looking for a new role, Garcia has plenty of experience having coached at Lille, Napoli, Roma, and Marseille. It was a disappointing spell at Napoli after they won the Scudetto but that isn't all down to what Garcia did with the club.\n\nBest of the MLS\n\nWilfried Nancy, Columbus Crew manager: The best coach currently in Major League Soccer, Nancy has been linked to European roles and may find one of those to be more attractive than taking a role with the USMNT, but he's another manager where in doing due diligence, he needs to be called and offered an interview. Employing different tactical styles with the Columbus Crew and also playing on the front foot, Nancy is someone who would endear himself to USMNT fans quickly.\n\nJim Curtin, Philadelphia Union manager: A former United States international who got into coaching through MLS, there are similarities between Berhalter and the current Philadelphia Union boss but that's where they end. Season after season, Curtin has done more with less in Philadelphia while turning the team into one where everyone knows how they should play. Also known for improving young players and having coached current members of the U.S. setup, Curtin is someone who would likely be looked at if the role is open.\n\nSteve Cherundolo, Los Angeles FC manager: An extremely accomplished player, Cherundolo cut his teeth in Germany with Hannover 96 and has found success coming stateside with Los Angeles FC. Playing attractive soccer and also managing stars with the Black and Gold, his star is quickly rising in the coaching ranks, but the only question would be does he have enough experience for the role? Being a former international, that likely wouldn't matter, however, as those ties to the U.S. are always worth something.\n\nPat Noonan, FC Cincinnati manager: While similar to Curtin in MLS play, the attack of Noonan's FC Cincinnati side is something to behold. Even after losing Brandon Vazquez to Monterrey, they're atop the Eastern Conference with one of the best goal differences in MLS. Cincinnati's system has been one that leads to goals and it could suit the USMNT setup as well, especially if his star becomes a U.S. citizen.\n\nGary Smith, former Nashville SC manager: Smith had an impressive run with Nashville SC as their first coach ever but that has come to an end leaving him as a free agent. Another coach who has done more with less, Smith has coached Walker Zimmerman and Shaq Moore while also managing Canadian international Jacob Shaffleburg. Smith's attention to detail would translate well to the international game but there are questions of if the lack of attacking punch in his Nashville sides were because of players or his style.\n\nOther American coaches\n\nDavid Wagner, former Norwich manager: If you can't get Klopp, there are worse ideas than calling someone who worked under him. This is where we get into more attainable options even if they may not be as attractive as some of the non-domestic names. Wagner has done good things with Huddersfield Town but also had his fair share of managerial disappointments which could detract from him becoming a serious contender for the role.\n\nPelligrino Matarazzo, Hoffenheim manager: Out of the American coaches, Matazzaro is one who could have the least interest in a role with the United States due to being in a strong role currently with Hoffenheim. Joining in February of 2023, Matarazzo led them to a Europa League spot so it'd be down to -- is the USMNT job a bigger role than managing a European contender in Europe?\n\nBruce Arena, former USMNT manager: Spell three of Arena with the USMNT feels like one too many but the 72-year-old is still interested in being a manager even after his dismissal from the New England Revolution for discriminatory remarks. An appointment with Arena would need to come with some transparency of why he was dismissed but when he has been one of the most successful USMNT managers ever and was the person who the federation turned to with the 2018 World Cup on the line, there are reasons why he could be an emergency hire ahead of 2026, though highly unlikely.\n\nCrocker connections\n\nRuben Selles, Reading manager: While Selles hasn't had much top-level managerial experience, this is where experience with Crocker comes into play. Selles has twice been the caretaker manager of Southampton during Crocker's time at the club and has been in management since age 23, gaining experience all over the world at such a young age. While it hasn't led to a top role yet, it could be putting Selles on the road to international management.\n\nRalph Hasenhuttl, Wolfsburg manager: Keeping with managers who have worked under Crocker, Hasenhuttl is another unlikely name to coach the USMNT but his style would work well. Pressing and being aggressive are when the USMNT are at their best and it's something that he would have the team doing while utilizing their wing backs to create space and strengthen the midfield.", "source": {"uri": "cbssports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "chuck_booth@cbssports.com", "name": "Chuck Booth", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregg_Berhalter", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gregg Berhalter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Lampard", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Frank Lampard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Soccer_Federation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Soccer Federation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "England national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J\u00fcrgen_Klopp", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "J\u00fcrgen Klopp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mauricio_Pochettino", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mauricio Pochettino"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_men's_national_soccer_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States men's national soccer team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelsea_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chelsea F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Arabia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Pulisic", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Christian Pulisic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herv\u00e9_Renard", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Herv\u00e9 Renard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gareth_Southgate", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gareth Southgate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stefano_Pioli", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Stefano Pioli"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcelo_Gallardo", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Marcelo Gallardo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Tuchel", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Thomas Tuchel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massimiliano_Allegri", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Massimiliano Allegri"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Moyes", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "David Moyes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Madrid_CF", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Real Madrid CF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graham_Potter", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Graham Potter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France_women's_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "France women's national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Sports", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fox Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S.S.C._Napoli", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "S.S.C.

The early fan favorite is certainly former Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp, while MLS coaches such as Columbus Crew's Wilfried Nancy and LAFC's Steve Cherundolo are also names to watch.\n\nCBS Sports will have more on this breaking news story.", "source": {"uri": "cbssports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "roger_gonzalez@cbssports.com", "name": "Roger Gonzalez", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregg_Berhalter", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gregg Berhalter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_men's_national_soccer_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States men's national soccer team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Sports", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fox Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copa_Am\u00e9rica", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Copa Am\u00e9rica"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uruguay", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Uruguay"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Uruguay"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panama", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Panama"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Panama"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morocco_2026_FIFA_World_Cup_bid", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Morocco 2026 FIFA World Cup bid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolivia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bolivia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bolivia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_Men's_World_Ranking", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FIFA Men's World Ranking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilfried_Nancy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wilfried Nancy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_FC", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles FC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbus_Crew_SC", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Columbus Crew SC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Cherundolo", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Steve Cherundolo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Iran national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS_Sports", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CBS Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Soccer", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Major League Soccer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J\u00fcrgen_Klopp", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "J\u00fcrgen Klopp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zinedine_Zidane", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Zinedine Zidane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "France national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos\u00e9_Mourinho", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jos\u00e9 Mourinho"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Competitions", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONMEBOL", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONMEBOL", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Coaching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Non-FIFA_Nations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Non-FIFA Nations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2024/07/10/018bd688-5c92-4f2d-aafc-135d1b2d495d/thumbnail/1200x675/f9690c99a80af6a376714c4deb6a34aa/untitled-design-2024-07-10t204646-116.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9720115", "eventUri": "eng-9720115", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 123, "relevance": 1}

With a record of 44-15-13, he leaves with the best winning percentage of any coach who worked more than seven matches with the national team.\n\nBut he was undone by a poor performance in this summer's Copa Am\u00e9rica, which the U.S. exited in the group stage after losing to Panama and Uruguay. That marked the first time in 20 global or continental tournaments the U.S. has hosted that the national team has gone out in the group stage. It was also the first time a Copa Am\u00e9rica host failed to advance.\n\nOnly Bruce Arena (81) and Jurgen Klinsmann (55) won more games with the U.S. than Berhalter, but the team has struggled lately, winning three of its last nine games dating to last November. So after the 1-0 loss to Uruguay last week, Crocker issued a statement promising a thorough examination of the national team program.\n\n\"We must do better,\" he said. \"We will be conducting a comprehensive review of our performance in Copa Am\u00e9rica and how best to improve the team and results as we look towards the 2026 World Cup.\"\n\nBerhalter, a former Galaxy player and assistant coach and the only former World Cup player to coach the U.S. in the tournament, was popular in the locker room and several of his players voiced their support for the coach after the Copa Am\u00e9rica debacle.\n\n\"I see no issue with the direction we're heading,\" goalkeeper Matt Turner said. \"When you have a fight like that on the pitch in every single game we're in in this tournament, it speaks volumes to how the manager prepare us.\"\n\nMidfielder Weston McKennie, meanwhile, said players would \"run through a brick wall\" for Berhalter. What they apparently couldn't do for him, however, was score a goal. The U.S. was held to one or fewer goals during seven of their past nine games.\n\nAnd that was enough for some players to realize change was needed.\n\n\"Look, we have a good relationship with him,\" captain Christian Pulisic said after the loss to Uruguay. \"Whatever the next step looks like, it's not my job to decide.\"\n\nBerhalter survived an earlier challenge to his job after former teammate Claudio Reyna and his wife Danielle, upset over Berhalter's treatment of their son Gio during the 2022 World Cup, informed U.S. Soccer of a 30-year-old physical confrontation between Berhalter and the woman who would become his wife.\n\nThe federation launched a months-long investigation into the incident before clearing Berhalter in the spring of 2023. Crocker then rehired him 13 months ago for the current World Cup cycle.\n\nThe U.S. has gone 7-6-1 under Berhalter since then.\n\nThe team Berhalter inherited in 2018, one built largely by former Galaxy assistant Dave Sarachan, the interim U.S. coach, was among the youngest in national team history. During his year in charge, Sarachan gave gave a record 23 players -- including McKennie, Tyler Adams, Tim Weah, Zack Steffen and Antonee Robinson -- their national team debuts along the likes of Pulisic.\n\nTo that Berhalter added Reyna, Sergi\u00f1o Dest, Yunus Musah, Haji Wright and Folarin Balogun. Twenty of the 23 players Berhalter called up for the Copa Am\u00e9rica play in Europe, a record for a U.S. national team.\n\nAnd at first that team performed under Berhalter, losing just twice in 22 games in 2021, then reaching the round of 16 in the World Cup a year later. But aside from Mexico -- which also exited the Copa Am\u00e9rica after three games -- the U.S. has beaten just one team ranked inside the top 20 since 2015 and is 0-5-5 in the Berhalter era against non-Mexican teams ranked in the top 15 by FIFA.\n\nThere was no word Wednesday on a successor although former Liverpool coach Jurgen Klopp, current LAFC manager Steve Cherundolo and Thierry Henry, manager of France's Olympic team, have been mentioned.\n\n\"Our immediate focus is on finding a coach who can maximize our potential as we continue to prepare for the 2026 World Cup, and we have already begun our search process,\" Crocker said.", "source": {"uri": "latimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Los Angeles Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Now, with less than two years until the tournament kicks off, a daunting challenge awaits U.S. Soccer -- and its future men's head coach -- to prepare a squad that can perform to expectations in the world's biggest sporting event.\n\n\"I want to thank Gregg for his hard work and dedication to U.S. Soccer and our Men's National Team,\" said U.S. Soccer President Cindy Parlow Cone, who added that federal officials would now work to \"find the right person to lead the USMNT into a new era of on-field success.\"\n\nThe U.S. men's national team has long struggled on the world stage. The men's best finish in the modern era of the FIFA World Cup was a quarterfinal appearance in 2002.\n\nBut with the U.S. set to co-host the tournament in 2026, along with Canada and Mexico, hopes were high for Berhalter to lead the U.S. to match that quarterfinal finish -- or better. This summer's Copa Am\u00e9rica was viewed as the last major opportunity for his team to gain experience in a high-level international tournament before 2026, and the No. 11-ranked U.S. was widely expected to at least reach the quarterfinals, if not the semifinals.\n\nInstead, the U.S. was eliminated in the group stage. The team managed a win only against lowly Bolivia, ranked No. 84 internationally, before suffering a crushing loss to No. 43 Panama that was due in part to an uncharacteristic red card on winger Tim Weah early in the game that forced the U.S. to play shorthanded for most of the match. Then, on July 1, the U.S. lost yet again to No. 14 Uruguay.\n\n\"We're bitterly disappointed with the results. We know that we're capable of more. And in this tournament, we didn't show it. It's really as simple as that,\" Berhalter said in a press conference immediately after the loss to Uruguay.\n\nAsked whether he was still the right person to lead the team into the 2026 World Cup, Berhalter answered with one word: \"Yes.\"\n\nBut as the days passed, calls mounted to remove Berhalter as coach, including by former USMNT stars like Clint Dempsey, who said after the game that Berhalter was \"wasting\" the current generation of players. The American Outlaws, an organized fan group of the U.S. national soccer supporters, wrote in a statement that the U.S. \"cannot miss this incredible chance to create a lasting impact on the game of soccer in this country\" by allowing Berhalter to stay on as coach through the World Cup.\n\nHis termination ends a rocky tenure for Berhalter. After the USMNT failed to qualify for the 2018 World Cup in Russia, he was brought on to lead the team. He helped rebuild the squad with new, younger players and guided them through the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, in which the team made it to the knockout round but was defeated by the Netherlands in the round of 16.\n\nBerhalter's original contract expired that year. Not long after the team's loss in the World Cup, U.S. Soccer began an investigation of Berhalter after a domestic violence accusation surfaced involving a 1991 incident between Berhalter and the woman that would become his wife that took place outside a bar in North Carolina while both were freshmen at the University of North Carolina.\n\nThe accusation, it was later revealed, had come from the parents of a promising USMNT player, Gio Reyna, who had played very little during the Qatar tournament. Reyna's parents -- one-time USMNT star Claudio Reyna and women's national team member Danielle Reyna -- had long been friends of the Berhalters.\n\nMonths after opening the investigation, U.S. Soccer cleared Berhalter, and he was eventually reappointed as coach. In total, he compiled a 44-17-13 record in 74 matches as the team's head coach.\n\nAfter the USMNT's early exit in this month's Copa America tournament -- a tournament being hosted in the United States for the first time -- there were renewed calls for his ouster.\n\nIn its announcement, U.S. Soccer said the federation \"is committed to doing what is necessary to ensure our success on the pitch and we are dedicated to fostering a culture that leads to winning.\" The search for a new coach has already begun, the statement added.\n\nSpeculation over who could be the team's next head coach has included names such as outgoing Liverpool manager J\u00fcrgen Klopp, Canadian national team coach Jesse Marsch and Los Angeles FC head coach Steve Cherundolo.", "source": {"uri":

A European diplomat said 20 EU member states would boycott the event, but that seven others were expected to send a representative. Apart from France, Hungary and Slovakia were both expected to attend, two diplomatic sources said.\n\nGermany's Foreign Ministry said it would not attend. 'NO DESIRE FOR REGIME CHANGE'\n\nUnderscoring the divisions over how to deal with Russia, a Paris diplomatic source said: \"France will be represented by its ambassador to Russia.\" Speaking alongside China's president on Monday, French President Emmanuel Macron said: \"We are not at war with Russia or the Russian people, and we have no desire for regime change in Moscow.\"\n\nThe source said France had previously condemned the context of repression in which the election was held, depriving voters of a real choice, as well as the organisation of elections in Ukrainian territories occupied by Russia, which France considers a violation of international law and the United Nations Charter.

The EPP Group expects a clear and straightforward recommendation to all the foreign ministers of the Member States of the European Union in this sense, states the letter sent today by the Members of the EPP Group to Josep Borrell, the Vice-President/High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy.\n\n\"The presidential \"election\" in Russia was undemocratic and has no legitimacy, and therefore Vladimir Putin's presidency is illegitimate. But the supply of words on the world market has exceeded the demand. Now, deeds need to follow. Following our decision to recognise Russia as a state sponsor of terrorism, we should not give Vladimir Putin any occasion to institute his \"legitimacy\". That's why the EU and its Members States should boycott the inauguration ceremony,\" stresses Manfred Weber MEP, Chairman of the EPP Group.\n\n\"The participation of EU diplomats in Putin's \"inauguration\" is a total farce and a disgrace. They will be forced to congratulate him on his 're-election' and applaud his neo-imperialist statements, which include open threats to Western democracies. The Europeans deserve a better defence of their values by their diplomats,\" adds Andrius Kubilius MEP and EPP Group spokesperson on Russia.\n\nIn the letter, Members also urge the international community to stop referring to Vladimir Putin as president of the Russian Federation once his current term of office expires on 7 May 2024. They also advocate to cease all contact with Vladimir Putin, as he will have no political or moral mandate to enter into any further contractual relations on behalf of the Russian Federation, and as he is the subject of an arrest warrant issued by the International Criminal Court for his responsibility for alleged war crimes in Ukraine and unlawful deportations of Ukrainian citizens, in particular children. They also recall that that the \"election\" was held in the illegally occupied territories of Ukraine, which constitutes a flagrant breach of Ukrainian sovereignty and is a distinct violation of international law and in particular the UN Charter. Even within Russia, the \"election\" was neither free nor fair. It did not meet the basic international electoral standards and thus lacked any democratic legitimacy.\n\nFollowing the atrocities carried out by Vladimir Putin's regime against Ukrainian civilians, the Eurppean Parliament in November 2022, already recognised Russia as a state sponsor of terrorism and called for further isolation of the regime.", "source": {"uri": "eppgroup.eu", "dataType":

It called on foreign states, international organisations and the public not to recognise the results of the Russian pseudo-elections and the legitimacy of Russian dictator Vladimir Putin,", "source": {"uri": "censor.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "\u0426\u0435\u043d\u0437\u043e\u0440.\u041d\u0415\u0422"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Foreign_Affairs_(Poland)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Poland)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russian language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poland", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Poland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Poland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Putin", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Vladimir Putin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictator", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dictator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukrinform", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ukrinform"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyiv", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kyiv"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Foreign_Affairs_(Ukraine)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Ukraine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikol_Pashinyan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nikol Pashinyan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Armenia", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of Armenia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithuania", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lithuania"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Lithuania"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latvia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Latvia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Latvia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estonia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Estonia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Estonia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Czech_Republic", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Czech Republic"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Czech Republic"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Call_Centers", "label": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Call Centers", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Russian", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Russian", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Foreign_Ministries", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Foreign Ministries", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Telephony", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Telephony", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://images.cnscdn.com/9/c/1/c/9c1cfdd1a0c97d2662529e566c5ceaf3/640x336.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542785", "eventUri": "eng-9542785", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-07", "textStart": 827, "textEnd": 832}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-06", "textStart": 1097, "textEnd": 1102}], "sentiment": -0.1058823529411764, "wgt": 145, "relevance": 1}

Similar demands have already been made by representatives of the Russian opposition in exile, including Yulia Navalny.\n\nWhile this text has no direct consequences, several Western countries have announced that their representatives will not attend the May 7 inauguration.\n\nAccording to Radio Liberty, the Baltic states, the Czech Republic, the UK and Canada have joined the outright refusal to attend the ceremony, with Germany recalling its ambassador for consultations following Moscow's accusations of hacking attacks on the SPD in January 2023. The diplomat will reportedly stay in Berlin for a week.\n\nDmitry Peskov, Kremlin spokesman, did not disclose the list of foreign guests in the Andreyevsky Hall of the Grand Kremlin Palace, RIA Novosti reported.\n\nOver the past few weeks, Russia has been intensifying its offensive against Ukrainian forces in the Donetsk region, while Kyiv is experiencing a shortage of men and ammunition. At the same time, the shelling of Russian border regions by drones and missiles has continued.\n\nAnalysts say the Kremlin aims to 'please' the domestic Z-public and capture Chasov Yar in time for Victory Day on May 9.\n\nThe Russian president is expected to renew the government at the beginning of his next term: under the constitution, the cabinet resigns after inauguration.\n\nPutin can both reappoint current technocrat Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin and key government members including Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu, in the Duma and make new appointments to continue the militarisation of the Russian economy.\n\nExperts believe that now that Putin has six more years in power, the government may take unpopular steps: raising taxes to finance the war and sending more men into the army.", "source": {"uri": "euronews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Euronews English"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Putin", "type": "person",

Putin won a landslide victory in a presidential election in March just weeks after his most prominent opponent, Alexei Navalny, died in jail.\n\nWestern governments condemned the re-election as unfair and undemocratic, and Ukraine blasted Putin as the architect of Russia's invasion. \"Ukraine sees no legal grounds for recognising him as the democratically elected and legitimate president of the Russian Federation,\" the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry said in a statement.\n\nTuesday's swearing-in ceremony, it said, sought to create \"the illusion of legality for the nearly lifelong stay in power of a person who has turned the Russian Federation into an aggressor state and the ruling regime into a dictatorship.\" A senior Kremlin official said it had invited the heads of all the foreign diplomatic missions in Moscow to attend Putin's inauguration, the Interfax news agency reported.\n\nAn EU spokesperson said the bloc's ambassador to Russia would not attend the ceremony, in keeping with the position of most of the bloc's member states. A European diplomat said 20 EU member states would boycott the event, but that seven others were expected to send a representative. Apart from France, Hungary and Slovakia were both expected to attend, two diplomatic sources said.\n\nGermany's Foreign Ministry said it would not attend. 'NO DESIRE FOR REGIME CHANGE'\n\nUnderscoring the divisions over how to deal with Russia, a Paris diplomatic source said: \"France will be represented by its ambassador to Russia.\" Speaking alongside China's president on Monday, French President Emmanuel Macron said: \"We are not at war with Russia or the Russian people, and we have no desire for regime change in Moscow.\"\n\nThe source said France had previously condemned the context of repression in which the election was held, depriving voters of a real choice, as well as the organisation of elections in Ukrainian territories occupied by Russia, which France considers a violation of international law and the United Nations Charter. Franco-Russian relations have deteriorated in recent months as Paris has increased its support for Ukraine.\n\nJust last week Macron did not rule out sending troops to Ukraine, saying if Russia broke through Ukrainian front lines it would be legitimate to consider it if Kyiv requested the support. The Baltic states, which no longer have envoys in Moscow, have categorically ruled out attending the inauguration.\n\n\"We believe that the isolation of Russia, and especially of its criminal leader, must be continued,\" Lithuania's Foreign Minister Gabrielius Landsbergis said. \"Participation in Putin's inauguration is not acceptable for Lithuania. Our priority remains support for Ukraine and its people fighting against Russian aggression.\"\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)",

And how much will the West risk in an effort to depose 'Modern Hit... - Russia News Now", "body": "It's time we stop the charade and get to the bottom of this. Is Putin really a modern Hitler trying to take over Europe and potentially the world? If not, what is the real reason he is so hated?\n\nSome very prominent conservatives still make their living using unfounded scare tactics to spread Russophobic hate with a fervor that has nearly surpassed that seen during the Cold War, a period when it was very much deserved. Vladimir Putin in their eyes is no different than Breznev or Stalin, and maybe worse. He's a naked communist wanting to \"restore the old Soviet Empire\" and take over the world. In short, Putin is a \"modern Hitler\" who must be stopped at all costs. This is rubbish and I'll explain why.\n\nIf that were true, why do all the international communists in America, Canada and Western Europe hate Putin so much and want to see him replaced? Shouldn't they see him as an ally, someone to be emulated?\n\nThese folks will say, well, why is Putin aligned with China, North Korea and Iran if he is not a communist? I would argue that US policy has driven Russia into the arms of China by isolating Putin and trying to punish him for maintaining the country's only warm-water port in Crimea and shoring up his border with neighboring Ukraine, which only became a country in 1991 and has always been in the Russian orbit. The fact is, Putin expressed interest in joining NATO in January 2001 but was rebuffed by the United States. If Putin wanted to challenge NATO and take over Europe why is he only now, after 24 years in office, making his play for the continent? Did Hitler wait 24 years to invade Poland?\n\nWhether they realize it or not, the vitriolic rhetoric of anti-Russia conservatives plays right into the hands of the leftist globalists and their affiliated neocon-neolib war-hawk politicians who thrive on perpetual war and profits for the military-industrial complex. I believe there is more to the globalists' hatred of Russia than just the fact that Russian society still adheres to a more traditional cultural and religious structure -- economics and the desire to strip Russia of its vast natural resources is also a factor that drives Western disdain of the current Russian regime. They seek regime change for that reason alone and I have covered that angle in previous articles.\n\nBut the article below about Tucker Carlson's recent interview with Russian philosopher Aleksandr Dugin is also enlightening. It explains the great cultural divide that also permeates the world today and does go a long way toward explaining the West's obsession with getting rid of Putin, not just on economic grounds but on social-cultural grounds. The WEF puppet leaders in London, Paris, Berlin, Brussels, Washington, New York and Ottawa are desperate to bring Russia in line with the generally decadent value system that rules the US/EU/Canada/Australia. They call this system \"democracy\" but it's really marked by a hatred of humanity and Luciferian nihilism. These Western leaders are so blinded by hate for Russia that they are willing to go to World War III, and risk nuclear Armageddon, in their efforts to depose Putin, balkanize his country and steal its resources. If you think I'm kidding, check out this article about a congressional hearing that took place in Washington in June 2023.\n\nSo Ukraine is not the issue. Ukraine is just a tool being used to get at this imagined Hitler. The truth runs much deeper. And when Ukraine has been used up -- it's getting close -- the U.S./U.K./NATO will send your boys to fight Russians and die. Read more below as we explore further.\n\nArticle Via RT\n\nThe ever-growing anti-Russia sentiment in the West stems from the fact that Russia adheres to traditional values that Western \"progressives\" are trying to destroy, philosopher and political commentator Aleksandr Dugin said in an interview with journalist Tucker Carlson that was posted on the latter's YouTube channel on Monday.\n\nDuring the interview, Dugin laid out his view of the contemporary Western world and what he sees as the historical origins of its current ideology. He explained that the West has moved from \"classical liberalism\" - which professed individual freedom and democracy as understood as the rule of the majority - to a \"new liberalism\" defined by the rule of minorities and woke-ism. Rather than emphasizing freedom of the individual, the new incarnation of liberalism prescribes adherence to certain progressive values that are completely at odds with traditional values and in fact seeks to abolish them.\n\nCarlson asked Dugin why many Westerners, even those who previously supported the Soviet Union, turned against Russia when President Vladimir Putin came to power in the early 2000s and started professing Russophobic ideas. The philosopher said that \"Putin is a traditional leader\" who defends traditional values, which run counter to those currently in vogue in the West.\n\n\"When [Putin] came to power, from the very beginning, he started to extract Russia from global influence. He started to contradict the global progressive agenda... tried with success to restore traditional values - sovereignty of the state, Christianity, traditional family,\" he said, explaining that Western progressives saw these developments as being in opposition to their values.\n\nThis hatred is not something casual... it's metaphysical. If your main task and main goal is to destroy traditional values - traditional family, traditional state, traditional relations, traditional beliefs - and someone with a nuclear weapon... stands strong defending traditional values you are going to abolish - they have some basis for this Russophobia and hatred for Putin.\n\nIn 2022, Dugin's daughter Darya was killed in a car bombing in Moscow, which the Russian authorities claim was orchestrated by Ukrainian agents, a version also expressed by the US government. Darya, a journalist and political activist in her own right, was a vocal supporter of Russia's military operation against Kiev.\n\nRussophobic sentiment has been growing exponentially in light of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, the outbreak of which in 2022 the West has blamed squarely on Russia. NATO has branded Russia the \"most significant and direct threat\" to its members' peace and security, and many Western leaders have claimed that Moscow would attack Europe if it secures victory in Ukraine.\n\nRussia has repeatedly said it has no such plans, with Putin last month dismissing such claims as \"nonsense.\" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov last week called such ideas \"horror stories\" made up to divert attention from domestic problems in the West.\n\nLeoHohmann.com is 100 percent reader supported and not beholden to any corporate ads or sponsorships.

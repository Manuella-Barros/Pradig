Three Lions fans arrive in Dusseldorf ahead of crunch Euros match against...", "text": "England fans have begun arriving in Dusseldorf for the crunch knock-out Euro '24 match with Slovakia full of hope and seeking glory. The first of an expected 30,000 England supporters, who will be cheering the team, descended on Dusseldorf today choosing to give Gelsenkirchen, where the match will be played at the Arena AufSchalke, a miss until kick- off. Fans suggested Dusseldorf, which is less than an hour from where England will play on Sunday evening in front of 60,000 spectators, had more restaurants, bars and hotels. Problems of fans travelling from the ground in Gelsenkirchen and onto public transport after England played Serbia in the first group match there on 16 June, has also helped fans decide to converge on Dusseldorf. One England fan Ollie Doyle, 33, from Bedford, said: 'I am travelling with my brother Jordan and a friend and we had accommodation booked and paid for in Gelsenkirchen. 'But we got there and realised there was not much to do and decided to come and stay here, even though it means paying for new hotel rooms.' Of England's clash with Slovakia, he said: 'We just need one great performance and that could set us on our way. 'The draw has opened up for us, and we don't have to face any of the bigger nations until, and if, we can reach the final. We may play Italy and of course we would love to get one over on them after they beat us in the last final. 'I hope we can go all the way and bring home a trophy for the first time since 1966 which was long before I was born.' His brother Jordan, 28, a property developer, added: 'I do believe we can put the first three games, which we didn't play very well in, well behind us on Sunday. 'I think the players will have had a look at themselves and realise that every England supporter wants them to do well. 'Sometimes this can get lost in all the criticism that flies around, but the opportunity is ours now.' Manchester City fan Fraser Gibson, 33, a data analyst from Salford Quay, said: 'Everything can change on Sunday. If the boys put in a solid performance and win everyone around, then the atmosphere surrounding them will just change. 'I was in Cologne and the fans have been amazing in their singing and their support of the team. If only the players realise that.' He said: 'Inside the stadium against Slovenia, it was an atmosphere that I will never forget. We really got behind them and we will again on Sunday evening.' He said his trip had cost him around \u00a31,000 and his match ticket, which he bought in an official ballot, was \u00a365. 'I have had England fans coming up to me wanting to find tickets. It is worth every penny to see England play. The way the fans come together is incredible. 'When I travel with Manchester City fans, you can't really be with your mates who support other teams. But with England, we are all for each other and supporting the boys.' He said he had witnessed no bad behaviour among the travelling England supporters, but condemned the singing of 'Ten German Bombers' which he heard ringing out in Cologne from England supporters. All three fans said they would be flying back on Monday to return to work, but hoped an England victory would mean them having to fly back the following weekend for the quarter-finals. England fan Alex Bradbury from Worthing, flew in from New York where he now lives, and also travelled to Russia for the 2018 World Cup. Alex, 32, who works in information technology, said: 'It is always amazing following England for the great spirit among the fans. Let's hope the team can be successful on Sunday. We are right behind them.' The decision by England fans to make a base in Dusseldorf will boost bars in the city's Alstadt area where supporters and locals mixed in the sunshine. Local businesswoman Kerstin Rougers, 40, said: 'The England fans have a reputation for liking German beer and singing songs. They are welcome here.", "summary": "The first of an expected 30,000 England supporters, who will be cheering the team, descended on Dusseldorf today choosing to give Gelsenkirchen a miss until kick- off.", "url": "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-13580903/England-Three-Lions-fans-Dusseldorf-Euros-match-Slovakia.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490", "image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/06/28/17/86705047-0-image-m-21_1719592739454.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 02:17:24", "author": "Editor,Shekhar Bhatia", "authors": ["Editor", "Shekhar Bhatia"], "language": "en", "catgory": "sports", "source_country": "GB", "sentiment": 0.098}

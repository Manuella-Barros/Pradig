On Thursday, the 29-year-old showed his Instagram followers how his medal had begun chipping shortly after returning to the States.\n\nAs the story continues gaining traction, Olympic organizers have promised to replace damaged medals. 'Paris 2024 is aware of a social media report from an athlete whose medal is showing damage a few days after it was awarded,' a spokesperson for the games told Mail Sport.\n\n'Paris 2024 is working closely with the Monnaie de Paris, the institution tasked with the production and quality control of the medals, and together with the National Olympic Committee of the athlete concerned, in order to appraise the medal to understand the circumstances and cause of the damage.' Huston bagged a bronze medal in the French capital, falling behind gold medalist Yuto Horigome of Japan and fellow American Jagger Eaton in the men's street final.\n\nDays after returning Stateside, Huston shared his thoughts on the quality of the hardware and explained the light activities that caused wear and tear on the medal. 'Alright, so these Olympic medals look great when they're brand new,' he said.\n\n'But after letting it sit on my skin with some sweat for a little bit and letting my friends wear it over the weekend,' Huston continues before pausing and flipping the camera to his medal. The lack of quality in the medal is seen with the bronze color chipping away from several areas of the piece.\n\n'They're apparently not as high quality as you'd think,' he said before zooming into the chipping colors. 'It's looking rough.' While the back of the medal was significantly more damaged, the front was not safe from the chipping either, as Huston flipped it over for the camera.\n\n'I don't know, Olympic medals, we gotta step up the quality a little bit,' he says in the clip. Huston is a 12-time gold medalist in the X Games and a six-time gold medalist in the World Championships. Additionally, he has nine silvers and four bronzes across both competitions.\n\nWhile his Olympic debut ended in a podium finish, his valued piece of memorabilia from the games lost its prestigious look not long after his win. In another slide, Huston quipped that the medal looked like 'it had been to war and back.'\n\n'The medals are the most coveted objects of the Games and the most precious for the athletes,' the spokesperson added.

His US teammate Jagger Eaton claimed silver while Japan's Yuto Horigome won the gold medal.\n\n\"These Olympic medals look great when they're brand new, but after letting it sit on my skin with some sweat for a little bit, and then letting my friends wear it over the weekend, they're apparently not as high-quality as you would think,\" he said in a video posted on his Instagram story. \"Look at that thing - it's looking rough. Even the front is starting to chip off a little,\" he said, holding the medal up to the camera displaying the deterioration.\n\n\"I don't know... Olympic medals, we gotta step up the quality a little bit,\" Huston added while also posting, \"I guess medals are meant to be in cases. Not meant for the full send,\" in his next Instagram story. Moreover, one of his followers hilariously responded to him saying that it seems that he won the medal back in 1982.\n\nInterestingly, the Paris Olympics medals are set with a piece of original iron from the Eiffel Tower. To celebrate the return of the Games after 124 years to France, each medal at the Olympics this year is embellished with an original piece of the Eiffel Tower. But at least the quality of the bronze medal doesn't seem to be at par if the comments and pictures from Huston are to be believed.", "source": {"uri": "indiatvnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "India TV News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "aditya_kukalyekar@indiatvnews.com", "name": "Aditya Kukalyekar", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skateboarding", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Skateboarding"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vinesh_Phogat", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vinesh Phogat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyjah_Huston", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nyjah Huston"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Seine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuto_Horigome_(skateboarder)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Yuto Horigome (skateboarder)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jagger_Eaton", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jagger Eaton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concorde", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Concorde"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bronze"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Silver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eiffel_Tower", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Eiffel Tower"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Iron"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Precious_Metals", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Precious Metals", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 84}], "image": "https://resize.indiatvnews.com/en/resize/newbucket/1200_-/2024/08/untitled-design-2024-08-09t164451-1723202099.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9802986", "eventUri": "eng-9802986", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-11", "textStart": 100, "textEnd": 109}], "sentiment": 0.3490196078431373, "wgt": 198, "relevance": 1}

Since I got home it's taking everything in me to get out of bed and start living again. I didn't go into Paris with expectations,\" he wrote in a lengthy August 2 post on Instagram. \"Just wanted to go out there, land some tricks and enjoy the moment. But after being in a position with a good shot at the win and not pulling thru, f -- k it hurts. In that moment I wanted to bring home that gold for us so bad.

Not meant for the send.\"\n\n\"Medal looking like it went to war and back,\" Huston continued.\n\nThe lack of quality in the medal is then seen with the bronze colour chipping away from several areas of the piece. While the back of the medal was significantly more damaged, the front had a few chips in a few places as well.\n\nHutson is a 12-time gold medalist in the X Games and a six-time gold medalist in the World Championships. He also has nine silvers and four bronzes across both competitions.\n\nThe Design of an Olympic Medal Each medal has a unique design\n\nEach Olympic medal at this year's games contains scrap metal taken from the Eiffel Tower where the iconic landmark has been refurbished over the years.\n\nGold medals contain at least six grams of 24-carat gold coating, while the rest is made up of silver. Silver medals are made up of silver, whilst bronze medals contain copper, zinc, tin, and traces of silver.\n\nThe medals also feature the iron as hexagons in the middle of the designs - the geometrical shape of France. The Paris Mint made over 5,000 medals in total - with 2,600 for the Olympics and 2,400 for the Paralympics. Each weighs around 530g and was designed by the luxury brand Chaumet.", "source": {"uri": "givemesport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GiveMeSport"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyjah_Huston", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nyjah Huston"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_national_baseball_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States national baseball team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Olympic medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skateboarding", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Skateboarding"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuto_Horigome_(skateboarder)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Yuto Horigome (skateboarder)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jagger_Eaton", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jagger Eaton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laguna_Beach,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Laguna Beach, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Laguna Beach, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bronze"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monnaie_de_Paris", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Monnaie de Paris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_Hockey_World_Championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ice Hockey World Championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tin", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "X Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Silver medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luxury_goods", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Luxury goods"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zinc", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Zinc"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copper", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Copper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Silver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eiffel_Tower", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Eiffel Tower"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Metal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Iron"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Precious_Metals", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Precious Metals", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Theme", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Theme", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Antiques/Silver_and_Flatware", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Antiques/Silver and Flatware", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 51}], "image": "https://static0.givemesportimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/screenshot-2024-08-09-at-08-35-23.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9802986", "eventUri": "eng-9802986", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4509803921568627, "wgt": 188, "relevance": 1}

I don't pretend to know about the process of oxidation or how it plays out on specific surfaces, but that seems to be the culprit here according to several Twitter folk.\n\nSo it sounds like Huston can just polish and seal that thing up to keep it looking shiny and new. However, the fact that, according to Huston, some of the bronze is already breaking off is a bigger red flag that I don't know how to account for.\n\nWe'll have to see if any other Olympic athletes speak out on the condition of their medals. Perhaps Noah Lyles will eventually weigh in on his 200m bronze once he recovers from COVID. Regardless, if I won a medal at the Summer Games, I'd just do my best with it and let the chips fall where they may, fragments of the medal breaking off pun intended. The bottom line is Huston got an Olympic bronze, and as long as the medal doesn't disintegrate entirely, that should be enough to keep him happy.

slightly chipped.\n\nHarper won Team GB's first medal of the Games, taking bronze with partner Scarlett Mew Jensen in the women's 3m synchronised springboard diving final and admitted that her medal has also been affected.\n\n\"I think it's water or anything that gets under metal, it's making it go a little bit discoloured, but I'm not sure.\"\n\nWhen asked if the tarnishing of her medal bothered her, Harper replied: \"No, because it's still a medal.\"\n\nEach Olympic and Paralympic medal at Paris 2024 has been designed by French luxury jeweller Chaumet and is set with a piece of original iron from the Eiffel Tower.\n\nThe medals are stamped with \"Paris 2024\" and the Games logo, as well as the five Olympic rings for the Olympic Games.\n\nThe ancient Greek goddess of victory, Nike, features on the other side of the Olympic medals.\n\nIn a post on his Instagram stories, Huston criticised the quality of his medal, saying: \"These Olympic medals look great when they're brand

This is a short list of the missteps taken by the Paris Olympic Committee. The event will end in just three days, and we have yet another issue. This one might just be bigger than all.\n\nWinning a medal at the Olympics is the dream of all athletes. That means that the quality of the medal should stand the test of time. Already, the medals aren't made up of gold, silver, or bronze, and so they have no monetary worth of their own. But it's the money that the athletes are after. It's a lifelong dream to represent your nation at the Games and fulfill it by winning a medal.\n\nYou want to cherish it and show it to your grandchildren. But that might not happen to the winners of the Paris Olympics. USA's Nyjah Huston won a bronze medal in men's skateboarding on July 29, and 10 days later, it's already discolored. Huston shared the image of his corroded medal on August 10 and wrote, 'medal looking like it went to war and back', mocking its quality.\n\nThis issue raises many questions. Is this a fluke, or will it happen to other athletes as well? Will this happen to just the bronze, or will we see athletes who've won gold or silver complain as well?

I have amazing family and friends who are always there for me and I get to make a living off of doing what I love most which is such a huge blessing.\"", "source": {"uri": "islandpacket.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Island Packet"}, "authors": [{"uri": "miranda_siwak@islandpacket.com", "name": "Miranda Siwak", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skateboarding", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Skateboarding"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuto_Horigome_(skateboarder)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Yuto Horigome (skateboarder)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jagger_Eaton", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jagger Eaton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyjah_Huston", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nyjah Huston"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_national_baseball_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States national baseball team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Boarding", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Boarding", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Skateboarding/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Skateboarding/Organizations", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Skateboarding/Photographers", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Skateboarding/Photographers", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Aging/Life_Expectancy", "label": "dmoz/Health/Aging/Life Expectancy", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 49}], "image": "https://www.islandpacket.com/wps/build/images/islandpacket/facebook.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9802986", "eventUri": "eng-9802986", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-02", "textStart": 994, "textEnd": 1002}], "sentiment": 0.2784313725490195, "wgt": 129, "relevance": 1}

But Huston had a complaint about the quality of the hardware he received.\n\nIn a post on his Instagram Story, Huston noted that the medal is \"looking rough\" after wearing it for a little while and doesn't look nearly as good as it did when it was brand new. He then shared\n\n\"Alright, so these Olympic medals look great when they're brand new,\" Huston said, via the New York Post. \"But after letting it sit on my skin with some sweat for a little bit and letting my friends wear it over the weekend, they're apparently not as high quality as you'd think. It's looking rough.\"\n\nUnfortunately for Huston this is a common problem for bronze. It oxidizes when exposed to air and sweat (both of which he has admitted to exposing his medal to). Though it usually doesn't occur that quickly.\n\nIt also doesn't help that the Olympic medals are rarely made purely from the metal that they're described as. So it's probably not surprising that the medal is showing signs of tarnish much faster than items of 100-percent bronze would.\n\nThe only recommendation we can give Huston is that he put it in a case and maybe apply some protective coating on it.\n\nRelated: Photo: Medals For The 2024 Summer Olympics Are Going Viral", "source": {"uri": "postandcourier.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Post and Courier"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tzvi_machlin@postandcourier.com", "name": "Tzvi Machlin", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Precious_Metals", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Precious Metals", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/postandcourier.com/content/tncms/custom/image/6903687a-a7dc-11e9-896c-0bef6d6c9301.jpg?resize=600%2C314", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9802986", "eventUri": "eng-9802986", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 460932546, "relevance": 2}

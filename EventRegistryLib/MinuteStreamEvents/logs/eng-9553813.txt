The Almaty Declaration as a basic principle of border delimitation between Armenia and Azerbaijan has been accepted by both countries, and it is an irreversible reality that is fixed between the two countries at the highest level, Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan said at a press conference on Tuesday.\n\nAccording to him, the delimitation issue will be discussed by Armenian and Azerbaijani foreign ministers when they meet for talks in Kazakhstan's Almaty on May 10.\n\n\"The delimitation of the Armenian-Azerbaijani border is based on the most recent Soviet Union maps that have legal force, which is very important. We do not want to limit ourselves to listing any particular map, because what is important for us is the legal framework aimed at ensuring full delimitation along the entire perimeter of Armenia's border, and in doing so we are also acting in practical terms. We have not deviated from our earlier statements and now we are acting based on this rationale,\" Pashinyan noted.\n\nHe said that the maps used are those that reflect the borders between Soviet Armenia and Soviet Azerbaijan at the time of the collapse of the Soviet Union.\n\nAsked about the installation of border pillars, Pashinyan noted that they are installed on a legal basis and become a security guarantee for the villages of Voskepar, Kirants, Berkaber, Baganis and, in general, the whole of Armenia.\n\n\"We are now conducting delimitation and its goal is to form security guarantees. And the border pillars are the pillars of security guarantees, and it is very important to fix this,\" Pashinyan said.\n\n\"Our goal is not to make an analysis whether there will be war or not, but to make sure that war is excluded. And we are on this path, and our goal is to make war senseless, illogical, illegitimate and impracticable \" Pashinyan noted.\n\nThe Prime Minister said also that the most part - about 90% of the work on the installation of the pillars in a section of the border in Tavush region has been done, and as far as this work is progressing, the confidence that Armenia's security guarantees are being formed within the framework of its sovereign decision is growing.-0-", "source": {"uri": "arka.am", "dataType": "news", "title": "ARKA News Agency"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikol_Pashinyan", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nikol Pashinyan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almaty", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Almaty"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Almaty"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Kazakhstan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azerbaijan", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Azerbaijan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Azerbaijan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armenia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Armenia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Armenia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Armenia", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of Armenia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yerevan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Yerevan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Yerevan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Armenia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armenian_Soviet_Socialist_Republic", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azerbaijan_Soviet_Socialist_Republic", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Soviet Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kazakhstan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kazakhstan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Kazakhstan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissolution_of_the_Soviet_Union", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dissolution of the Soviet Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereignty", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sovereignty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkaber", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Berkaber"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Berkaber"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Azerbaijan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tavush_Province", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tavush Province"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tavush Province"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Armenia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voskepar", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Voskepar"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Voskepar"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Armenia"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Fire_and_Security", "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Fire and Security", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Advisories_and_Patches", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Advisories and Patches", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Home_and_Garden/Walls", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Home and Garden/Walls", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security/FAQs,_Help,_and_Tutorials", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security/FAQs, Help, and Tutorials", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 68}], "image": "https://arka.am/upload/iblock/a9b/a9b67c51ced0f5adbc0328649afb6a5c.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9547394", "eventUri": "eng-9553813", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-07", "textStart": 9, "textEnd": 14}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-10", "textStart": 491, "textEnd": 497}], "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 208, "relevance": 1}

The Armenian government has initiated the process of delimitation of the Armenian-Azerbaijani border from the Tavush region, with the aim of preventing war, the Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan said during a press conference held on May 7.\n\n\"The escalations of 2021, 2022 have raised questions among the international community. Regrettably, I must note that they were explained in many cases on the international platforms by the factor of the four Azerbaijani villages.\n\nUnfortunately, in those situations where we should have been in the role of the claimant, we found ourselves in the role of the defendant. A question was raised: 'If you mutually recognize territorial integrity, then what is the problem that you do not solve the issue of those villages?\", stated Pashinyan.\n\nReferring to the demand put forward by the members of the \"Tavush for the Motherland\" movement to halt the border delimitation process, Pashinyan stated: \"If we halt the process, what will happen afterward? A very simple thing: war will begin.\n\nThe forces demanding a halt to the border delimitation process, supported by some foreign forces, will do everything so that new territories of Armenia will be occupied. And they will leverage it to make political changes within Armenia,\" said the PM.\n\nAccording to the Prime Minister of Armenia, war is deemed necessary by various internal and external forces to effect a change of power in Armenia without elections.

He made this comment in response to the demands of the \"Tavush for the Homeland\" movement. This refers to a protest action where people are walking from the border area to Yerevan to \"get answers\" from the authorities and to demand the cessation of the border delimitation process with Azerbaijan.\n\nAccording to Nikol Pashinyan, certain internal and external forces intend to provoke a war in this manner to change the government in the country without elections. He asserts that a similar scenario unfolded during the 2020 Karabakh war.\n\n\"The forces demanding to stop delimitation, with the support of external forces, will do everything to have more of Armenia's territories occupied. They will use this to bring about political changes in the Republic of Armenia,\" he emphasized.\n\nPashinyan is convinced that the plan is to \"establish an illegitimate, puppet government in the country, de facto destroy the statehood of the country - until its de jure destruction.\"\n\nThe prime minister extensively discussed the protest movement, its backers, the possibility of signing a peace agreement with Azerbaijan, and relations with Russia.\n\n\"The Catholicos of All Armenians leads a political movement,\" says Pashinyan, who believes that the Catholicos himself leads the \"Tavush for the Homeland\" movement. This stems from the fact that participants in the procession heading to Yerevan have united and organized under the leadership of the primate of the Tavush Diocese, Archbishop Bagrat Galstanyan. He is a respected clergyman in the country, around whom an increasing number of people are rallying. Moreover, he stated the day before that the Catholicos himself blesses the movement.\n\nFurthermore, a statement has already been issued by the Supreme Spiritual Council urging the country's leadership to \"obey the will of the people.\"\n\nAccording to the prime minister's assessment, the goal of the movement is clear -- to bring former presidents of Armenia to power.\n\n\"This scenario of a change of power in Armenia with the help of the church was presented by the leader of the 'Hayastan' bloc [former president] Robert Kocharyan after the 2021 elections,\" he stated.\n\nWhen asked if he would resign if the movement garnered more supporters and made a similar demand, Pashinyan responded:\n\n\"Resigning on a periodic basis is not a serious approach. Various political processes may occur in the country, but there is an unwavering factor: the voice of the people, which can never be underestimated anywhere or anytime. I came to power by the will of the people, and I will leave by the will of the people.\"\n\nExplaining why details of the border delimitation process starting from Armenia's Tavush region are not being disclosed, Nikol Pashinyan stated that \"nothing secret is happening.\" However, there are nuances that are not disclosed to \"avoid damaging the working process and politicizing it.\"\n\nHe assured that before the delimitation and demarcation process began, the relevant commission conducted an inventory and studied all documents. And the border is being clarified \"based on the latest maps of the USSR, which have legal force.\"\n\n\"Why do we avoid saying on the basis of which specific map the process is taking place? We have previously said that we do not want to limit ourselves to one specific map.\"\n\nWhy did the process start with the Tavush region? The prime minister has answered this question more than once. He says they did so in order to avoid war, to \"deprive [Azerbaijan] of legitimate grounds for starting a war.\"\n\nFor credibility, he reminded of military escalations on the Armenian border in 2021 and 2022. And he reported that \"they [the Azerbaijani authorities] explained them on international platforms by the issue of four Azerbaijani villages,\" which remained under Armenia's control after the war in the 90s and are now being transferred to Baku. Because of these villages, Armenia \"acted as a defendant, not a plaintiff, while its territories were occupied in 2021 and 2022.\"\n\nNikol Pashinyan said that 90 percent of the planned work in the Tavush region has already been completed. He emphasized that delimitation and demarcation instill confidence in the formation of security guarantees. He has faith that war loses legitimate grounds.\n\nThe Armenian prime minister agrees with president Ilham Aliyev of Azerbaijan that a peace deal can be reached by November 2024.\n\n\"For this to happen, all agreed-upon principles need to be fixed in the peace agreement. If I'm not saying right now that we will sign the agreement next week, it means consensus has not yet been reached,\" he emphasized.\n\nAt the same time, he expressed hope that significant progress would be made during the meeting of foreign ministers scheduled for May 10th in Kazakhstan.\n\nThe prime minister expressed his opinion on the trilateral statement signed with the presidents of Russia and Azerbaijan in November 2020, which led to the cessation of hostilities in Karabakh. Pashinyan spoke about the results of its implementation. The Lachin corridor, intended to provide uninterrupted communication between Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh, no longer has Armenian residents, and Russian peacekeeping forces do not ensure their safety. After listing these points, Pashinyan concludes that \"the statement, in essence, is not effective.\"\n\nIn this regard, he refers to the 9th point of this document, which is often mentioned in Russia and Azerbaijan.\n\nQuote from the statement: \"All economic and transport connections in the region will be unblocked. The Republic of Armenia provides transportation communication between the western districts of the Azerbaijan Republic and the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic to organize unimpeded movement of citizens, vehicles, and cargo in both directions. Control over transportation communication is carried out by the border service of the Russian Federal Security Service.\"\n\nPrime minister emphasizes that the 9th point concerns not only ensuring communication between Azerbaijan and Nakhchivan but also unlocking transport communications in the region:\n\n\"Those who accuse us of not fulfilling our obligations must recognize that, according to this point, they sought concessions from Armenia that have nothing to do with the content of this point. And this is illogical, unacceptable, and impermissible.\"\n\nHe focused attention on Azerbaijan's demand to provide an extraterritorial corridor that Armenia will not control. He also mentioned another requirement under this point - Russian control over the road.\n\nPashinyan again explained that in the statement,\n\nHe explained that, according to the statement, it is Armenia that ensures transportation communication, not another entity. And the Russian Federation should control transportation communication, which does not mean its presence on-site. According to him, control can be organized in the form of regularly submitted reports.\n\nThe head of the Armenian government also responded to questions about his visit to Moscow on May 8 and the expected meeting with president Putin:\n\n\"The agenda of the meeting is diverse, there are many issues accumulated. Some of them have been raised more than once. We have never held the view that these issues are voiced only for the sake of being heard. They were raised with the aim of eliminating negative nuances from the context of friendly relations between Armenia and Russia.\"\n\nRegarding why Pashinyan will not attend the inauguration ceremony of the Russian president, the prime minister replied that he \"did not receive an invitation.\" As for the Victory Day parade on May 9, he reminded about his participation last year:\n\n\"I don't think I should participate in it every year. I don't recall such a practice where any leader of Armenia or a leader of any other country participates in the May 9 event every year.\"\n\nThe prime minister began and concluded his press conference by showing journalists a slide that read \"Real Armenia,\" followed by maps indicating its territory in kilometers. He explained his vision for the country's future as follows:\n\n\"Armenia is a sovereign state that must pursue an independent foreign policy. The country's territory covers 29,743 square kilometers. The state structure is a parliamentary democracy. The purpose of Armenia's existence is not to serve historical justice or national agendas, but to ensure the freedom, happiness, and prosperity of its citizens.\"\n\nPashinyan then outlined the steps Armenia should take in the region:\n\nAccording to him, ensuring the country's security is possible through diversification of external relations, military reforms, and the implementation of a comprehensive security and defense system.\n\nThe prime minister considers the country's main problem to be \"further development, particularly socio-economic, for which peace is necessary.\"",

There is no legal basis for the activity and powers of the demarcation commission created by the prime minister.\n\nA corresponding lawsuit has been submitted to the Armenia Prosecutor's Office demanding that Pashinyan be held criminally responsible for illegally surrendering land as part of this process.\n\nIn fact, there is no agreed-upon delimitation and demarcation process -- it is simply the unilateral concession of land under coercion by Azerbaijan. Given that Azerbaijani government propaganda refers to sovereign Armenian territory as \"Western Azerbaijan,\" it is clear the surrender of territories will allow Azerbaijan to better prepare its next attack and create serious security threats to the life and property of thousands of Armenians, as well as to undermine their free movement and endanger their cultural heritage.\n\nAs a result of this process, significant problems may arise in terms of communications, roads and various infrastructures (republican, regional and community roads, the gas pipeline entering Armenia, telecommunication and electricity channels, etc.), as stated by human rights NGOs such as Transparency International.\n\nFor several years, the Azerbaijani armed forces have directly promoted war crimes such as the killing of civilians, including beheadings and executions, torture and other horrific crimes. Azerbaijan has cultivated anti-Armenian sentiment, repeatedly promoting racist rhetoric and systematically erasing any Armenian presence through the destruction of cultural heritage and elimination of traces of Armenian identity.\n\nThe \"Tavush for the Homeland\" movement, led by Archbishop Bagrat Galstanyan, the Primate of the Diocese of Tavush, aims to pressure Republic of Armenia authorities to stop this illegal process, which threatens the country's territorial integrity, security and peace.\n\n\"We are marching to Yerevan to end the unconstitutional and unilateral surrender of our land. Armenia's borders must only be set by the Armenian state -- not foreign dictates or violent demands,\" said Archbishop Galstanyan.\n\n\"No corner of Armenia is safe from the looming threat.

Almost 100 people protesting the move were detained last month in Yerevan after police said they refused to comply with their orders.\n\nProtesters led by a senior Armenian cleric reached Yerevan on Thursday after walking for several days from a village in the country's northeast, a distance of some 100 miles (160 km).\n\nVideo posted by Armenian media on Thursday showed a crowd of thousands of people gathering in Yerevan's central Republic Square and waving Armenian flags.\n\n\"Nikol Pashinyan, we are giving you an hour to resign\", the cleric, Archbishop Bagrat Galstanyan, was cited by Armenian media as saying.\n\n\"You no longer have any authority in Armenia\".\n\nArmenia is a treaty ally of Russia and traditionally Moscow's closest partner in the South Caucasus, but bilateral relations have sharply deteriorated in recent months as Yerevan has sought to build ties with the West, blaming Russia for failing to defend it from Azerbaijan.\n\nA Kremlin spokesman was quoted by Interfax news agency on Thursday as saying Moscow has agreed to withdraw Russian forces and border guards from various parts of Armenia at Yerevan's request.\n\nThe announcement follows the departure of nearly 2,000 Russian peacekeepers from in and around the Nagorno-Karabakh region which Azerbaijan returned by force in September last year, prompting an exodus of 100,000 ethnic Armenians who had enjoyed de facto independence since breaking away in the 1990s.\n\n(Writing by Lucy Papachristou;

The villages have been under Armenia's military control since the early 1990s; withdrawal would effectively surrender these territories to Azerbaijan.\n\nThe withdrawal is a subject of intense discussion throughout Armenia. Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan has said the unilateral concessions are necessary to prevent Azerbaijani military aggression against Armenia. Opponents of the policy say the concessions will only encourage Azeris to demand more territory from Armenia.\n\nThe church's position on the matter took on a special urgency this week when Archbishop Bagrat Galstanyan, Primate of the Tavush Diocese, announced that he would lead a protest march from the village of Kirants to Yerevan -- a journey of 100 miles -- so that the voices and legitimate concerns of the Tavush residents would be heard in the republic's capital. Archbishop Galstanyan expects the protest marchers to reach Yerevan on May 9, but gave no details of any plans once there.\n\nIn its May 7 statement, the Supreme Spiritual Council asserted: \"We urge all of our people to express their justifiable concerns and anxieties exclusively in peaceful ways; to show calm and restraint; and to refrain from illegal actions. Likewise, we expect that the services responsible for maintaining public order will work strictly within the confines of their role as stipulated in law.\"\n\nThe Eastern Diocese fully supports the position of the Mother See of Holy Etchmiadzin and its efforts to promote peaceful resolutions with an eye to justice for the Armenian faithful and genuine security for our homeland.\n\nThat same spirit was strongly expressed by the delegates of the recent 122nd Diocesan Assembly in their gracious reply to the message of His Holiness Karekin II: \"Vehapar Der, we, the participants of the Diocesan Assembly, want to make a special point in today's current situation that we are more than deeply concerned by events in Artsakh, Tavush and other regions, where Armenians, our churches and civilization are threatened by ongoing genocidal efforts. We support the heroic role our church continues to play during these difficult times. We want to thank you for your leadership and express to you our strong support in the role of our church in protecting our heritage and our people against the onslaught of forces from outside our Armenian Christian faith. We remain committed to our role in support and defense of the right of Armenians throughout the world.\"\n\nWe pray that our merciful Lord Jesus will guide all of our people through the current troubling period, and bring lasting peace, justice and security to our homeland.\n\nPrayerfully,\n\nBishop Mesrop Parsamyan\n\nPrimate, Eastern Diocese of the Armenian Church", "source": {"uri": "armenianweekly.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Armenian Weekly"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tavush_Province", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tavush Province"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tavush Province"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Armenia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armenia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Armenia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Armenia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azerbaijan", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Azerbaijan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Azerbaijan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mother_See_of_Holy_Etchmiadzin", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mother See of Holy Etchmiadzin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Armenia", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Government of Armenia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karekin_II", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Karekin II"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholicos_of_All_Armenians", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Catholicos of All Armenians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armenian_Apostolic_Church", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Armenian Apostolic Church"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patriarch", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Patriarch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archbishop", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Archbishop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pope"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yerevan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Yerevan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Yerevan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Armenia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikol_Pashinyan", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nikol Pashinyan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azerbaijanis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Azerbaijanis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azerbaijani_Armed_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Azerbaijani Armed Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Armenia", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of Armenia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primate_(bishop)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Primate (bishop)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Artsakh", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Republic of Artsakh"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armenians", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Armenians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genocide", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Genocide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bishop", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bishop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jesus"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Christianity", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Christianity", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Church-State_Relations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Church-State Relations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://armenianweekly.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/HolyEtchRestor03-scaled-e1715117810508-770x330-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9547394", "eventUri": "eng-9553813", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-09", "textStart": 250, "textEnd": 257}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-09", "textStart": 1597, "textEnd": 1602}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-07", "textStart": 1657, "textEnd": 1662}], "sentiment": 0.2313725490196079, "wgt": 143, "relevance": 1}

Melanie Joly, and the foreign affairs critics of all opposition parties, urging Canadian diplomatic intervention in forced Armenia-Azerbaijan border demarcation process.\n\nThe ANCC has expressed grave concerns over the recent decisions made by the Commission on Demarcation and Border Security of the State Border between Armenia and Azerbaijan, describing it as severely undermining \"the principles of dignified and fair negotiation that should characteristically define interactions between sovereign states.\" This demarcation - being carried out under the threat of force from Azerbaijan - is forcing Armenia to cede control of four Armenian villages and other strategic territory in its northeastern Tavush province, threatening its sovereignty and security.\n\nIn their communications, the ANCC highlighted how the demarcation process \"does not adhere to established international norms and principles,\" referencing several key international agreements. This deviation from normative legal frameworks raises serious questions about the validity and legitimacy of the commission's decisions.\n\nThe ANCC also raised alarms about the unilateral nature of these decisions, emphasizing that there is no \"mutually agreed upon framework for demarcation and delimitation; rather, there is an apparent coercion by Azerbaijan.\" This has spurred significant opposition within Armenia, leading to the establishment \"Tavush for the Homeland\" - an independent and non-affiliated movement - led by Archbishop Bagrat Galstanyan, the Primate of the Armenian Apostolic Diocese of Tavush and former Primate of the Armenian Apostolic Diocese of Canada. The movement is set to hold a large public rally in Yerevan on May 9, demanding an end to the demarcation process in its current format.\n\nThe ANCC is calling on the Canadian government to employ all diplomatic resources to support Armenia's territorial integrity and ensure the region's stability. This includes the imposition of sanctions on Azerbaijan to prevent further aggressive actions.\n\n\"We trust that Canada will take a firm stance on these issues, upholding the values of fair and respectful international relations,\" the ANCC stated, emphasizing the importance of international solidarity in these critical times.", "source": {"uri": "horizonweekly.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "\u0540\u0578\u0580\u056b\u0566\u0578\u0576 \u0547\u0561\u0562\u0561\u0569\u0561\u0569\u0565\u0580\u0569 / Horizon Weekly"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armenia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Armenia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Armenia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azerbaijan", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Azerbaijan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Azerbaijan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minister_of_Foreign_Affairs_(Canada)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minister of Foreign Affairs (Canada)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M\u00e9lanie_Joly", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "M\u00e9lanie Joly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottawa", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ottawa"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ottawa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tavush_Province", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tavush Province"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tavush Province"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Armenia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereign_state", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sovereign state"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereignty", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sovereignty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primate_(bishop)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Primate (bishop)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bagrat_Galstanyan", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bagrat Galstanyan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diocese_of_Tavush", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Diocese of Tavush"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armenian_Apostolic_Church", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Armenian Apostolic Church"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Territorial_integrity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Territorial integrity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archbishop", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Archbishop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_sanctions", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International sanctions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Canada", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Government of Canada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_relations", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International relations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yerevan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Yerevan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Yerevan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Armenia"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial_Disputes", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial Disputes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://horizonweekly.ca/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/WhatsApp-Image-2024-05-08-at-7.14.42-AM.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9547394", "eventUri": "eng-9553813", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ottawa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-09", "textStart": 1848, "textEnd": 1853}], "sentiment": -0.1058823529411764, "wgt": 136, "relevance": 1}

The Armenian opposition maintains he is actually encouraging Baku to demand more territory from Armenia and to use force for that purpose.\n\nArmenia agreed to the handover as the initial step in defining the frontier between the two rival South Caucasus countries.\n\nArmenia and Azerbaijan have fought two wars in the last three decades over the region of Nagorno-Karabakh, which had been a majority ethnic Armenian enclave since the Soviet collapse and is internationally recognized as Azerbaijani territory.\n\nThe region initially came under the control of ethnic Armenian forces, backed by the Armenian military, in separatist fighting that ended in 1994.\n\nIn 2020, Azerbaijan took back parts of Nagorno-Karabakh along with seven surrounding districts that Armenian forces had claimed during the earlier conflict.\n\nAfter Baku took full control over the region as the result of a one-day military operation in September last year, nearly 100,000 ethnic Armenians fled Nagorno-Karabakh

Vienna Convention and OSCE guidelines. The movement argues that the unilateral approach taken by Armenian authorities lacks transparency and legal grounding, directing accusations of illegality and unconstitutionality toward Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan.\n\nCritics of the process also warn against attempting to resolve border issues through unilateral concessions without a comprehensive peace treaty in place, fearing that such actions could lead to heightened security risks for Armenia. They argue that, in the absence of a mutual agreement, Armenia is capitulating to Azerbaijani pressure rather than engaging in a genuine dialogue.\n\nAdditionally, concerns have been raised about the potential impact on the safety, property rights and cultural heritage of residents in the affected territories. The demarcation process may disrupt vital infrastructure, including transportation routes and utilities.\n\nThe Armenian government has announced plans to cede border areas in the Tavush region to Azerbaijan, as the start of the border demarcation and delimitation process. Tavush residents, in protest of the decision, launched a march from Tavush's Kirants village to Yerevan this week.\n\nAt the forefront of the \"Tavush for the Homeland\" movement is Archbishop Bagrat Galstanyan, leader of the Diocese of Tavush, who aims to compel the Armenian government to halt the demarcation process. The movement's future actions are contingent upon the government's response to these demands.\n\nAs the \"Tavush for the Homeland\" initiative advances towards Yerevan, Archbishop Galstanyan has risen as a central figure. However, he now confronts a storm of controversy.\n\nDrawing attention for his peaceful demeanor and moral authority, the archbishop says that he aims to foster dialogue across diverse segments of society. \"No door in Armenia should remain closed to the bishop. All internal doors must be opened for reasonable speech, because ONE person has opened our nation's doors to the enemy,\" wrote Vahe Hovhannisyan, member of the Alternative Projects Group, arguing that peaceful discourse, rather than confrontation, is the means to effect change.\n\nHovhannisyan called on the citizenry to facilitate these interactions and overcome internal barriers with words, not force. \"The goal is not power, but salvation -- the preservation of Armenia's future,\" he wrote.\n\nThe ruling party and allied media outlets have launched a campaign of disinformation targeting Archbishop Galstanyan. Accusations range from colluding with Russia and the ARF to securing family exemptions from military service, even though the archbishop has no sons.\n\nThe speaker of the Armenian Parliament has joined the chorus of criticism, rebuking the church's involvement in the movement, a stark departure from his previous support for clerical participation during the \"Velvet Revolution\" of 2018.\n\nIn a recent press conference, Prime Minister Pashinyan refrained from directly naming Archbishop Galstanyan but resorted to inflammatory language, labeling him a \"drug addict and a bandit.\"\n\nArtak Beglaryan, former state minister of Artsakh, took to Facebook to denounce the recent onslaught of insults and campaigns directed towards Archbishop Galstanyan, labeling them as \"highly unacceptable and despicable, particularly when originating from individuals in positions of power and influence.\"\n\nIn his post, Beglaryan said that Archbishop Galstanyan has conducted himself with integrity and adhered to ethical principles, defending values and ideals that resonate with the homeland. Drawing from personal interactions, Beglaryan praised the archbishop's value system and noted his exceptional spiritual and national authority and servant leadership.\n\nBeglaryan urged for respectful discourse and ethical persuasion over malicious attacks. He criticized the use of derogatory tactics, including labeling and slander, calling for a higher standard of political culture and professionalism in dissenting opinions.\n\nBeglaryan dismissed accusations that the archbishop is a \"foreign agent\" as baseless and damaging to national unity. He lamented the decline in political culture perpetuated by the current government, warning against the dangers of internal division and polarization.\n\nAmidst the government's ongoing efforts to delineate border areas for potential transfer to Azerbaijan, a soldier sustained injuries during demining operations in Kirants, as confirmed by the Armenian Ministry of Defense on May 6.\n\nAccording to Aram Torosyan, press secretary for the RA Defense Ministry, the soldier was wounded in a mine explosion. Preliminary assessments indicate that his life is not in jeopardy.\n\nLocal residents of Kirants also reported the incident, stating that the soldier suffered leg injuries. Kamo Shahinyan, the head of Kirants village, observed an ambulance departing from the demining site.\n\nFollowing the current regime's personal attacks toward Archbishop Galstanyan, Archbishop Arshak Khachatryan, representing the Mother See, was also reportedly called to the National Security Service (NSS) for questioning.\n\nThis development follows earlier reports alleging government efforts to prosecute participants of the Tavush movement. Archbishop Khachatryan was reportedly summoned to the NSS due to his public criticism of the current administration, notably during his speech on April 24 at the Tsitsernakaberd memorial complex.\n\nIn response to inquiries, the Mother See said that Archbishop Khachatryan would address the matter at his discretion.\n\nMeanwhile, in response to the contentious issue of unilaterally transferring territories from the Tavush region to Azerbaijan, the Mother See Holy Etchmiadzin has reiterated its previous criticisms. The Supreme Spiritual Council, in a recent statement, underscored its concerns regarding the delimitation process, warning of the potential new threats it poses to the Armenian people. The statement emphasized the significant unrest sparked within the global Armenian community and particularly among residents of Tavush's border communities.\n\n\"The spiritual leaders of the Diocese of Tavush, led by their diocesan head, faithful to their spiritual mission cannot remain indifferent to the needs of the constituents entrusted to their care,\" the statement reads, emphasizing the importance of peaceful expression and adherence to legal avenues for advocacy.\n\nThe statement urged law enforcement agencies to maintain order while respecting citizens' rights. It also called on authorities to pursue a peace process while safeguarding the legitimate demands of the Armenian people without exacerbating security concerns or fostering societal unease.\n\nThe Supreme Spiritual Council argued that the delimitation process must occur in a context devoid of armed conflict, with the ultimate goal of securing the safe and undisturbed livelihoods of affected settlements.\n\n\"The church will carry on its historical responsibility in strengthening the Armenian state, protecting the rights and identity of its people, and promoting unity and fraternity, thus contributing to the establishment of regional peace,\" the statement concludes.\n\nIn a show of solidarity, dozens of Armenian diaspora communities and organizations across the globe, from the U.S. to Europe, have voiced support for the \"Tavush for the Homeland\" movement, with plans for rallies in its favor. Recently displaced Armenians from Artsakh have also joined the movement locally.\n\nAs the march approaches Yerevan, set to culminate in Republic Square on the afternoon of May 9, tensions continue to simmer, underscoring the complexities of Armenia's political landscape and the deep-seated divisions within its society.", "source": {"uri": "armenianweekly.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The

Many local residents are strongly opposed to the handover, saying that it would isolate their communities and leave them vulnerable to Azerbaijani attacks.\n\nGalstanian, who leads the Tavush Diocese of the Armenian Apostolic Church, again condemned \"this illegal unilateral process\" when he addressed the massive crowd that gathered in Yerevan's central Republic Square.\n\n\"We have come here to demand answers from the head of Armenia's government who repeatedly visited our communities and lied, misled, and then bullied and threatened people,\" he said. \"We have come to demand answers for those threats.\"\n\nThe clergyman backed by the church went on to accuse Pashinian's administration of incompetence and misrule and blame it for Azerbaijan's recapture of Nagorno-Karabakh.\n\n\"This government has completely failed in the country's governance and broken up its entire security system,\" Galstanian charged before giving Pashinian one hour to step down. He said he is ready to meet the premier and \"discuss all conditions of the resignation.\"\n\nPashinian, whose political allies have attacked the archbishop for the last few weeks, on Tuesday accused the protest leaders of trying to provoke another war with Azerbaijan in hopes of toppling him. He claimed that Azerbaijan will invade Armenia if he bows to their demands to halt the land handover.\n\nGalstanian and the Armenia opposition have dismissed his claims. Opposition leaders say Pashinian himself is encouraging Baku to demand more territory from Armenia and use force for that purpose.\n\nThe country's main opposition forces have welcomed and even joined the Tavush protests. But they do not seem to be directly involved in the campaign led by Galstanian.\n\nThe latter did not immediately say what the protesters should do if Pashinian predictably refuses to resign.

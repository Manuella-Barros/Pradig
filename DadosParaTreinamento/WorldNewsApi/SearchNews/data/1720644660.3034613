Noland Arbaugh was just 22 and as a sporty, intelligent college student had his whole life ahead of him when he suffered a tragic accident that left him a quadriplegic. During the summer holidays he went to swim in a lake with some of his friends but banged his head on something in the water which dislocated two vertebrae in his neck. Doctors confirmed he was paralysed from the neck down and he had to move back in with his parents, needing constant care. He learnt how to get around in a wheelchair but spent many hours in bed every day, only getting up if he had something to do or a visitor. Noland could operate an iPad using a mouth-held stick but if he used it for too long it would give him sores and put pressure on his neck and body. He tragically felt he was a burden on his parents and friends, who had set up a support system so there was always someone around to help him. Speaking to the Independent, Nolan explained: \"It's not easy being seen as a quadriplegic, after being the life and soul of the party. I struggled with them seeing me as frail, or fragile. I would have panic attacks from things like eating and feeling worried about choking because I couldn't help myself in that way.\" However in September last year, one of his friends told him about a trial set up by Neuralink, a brain implant company co-founded by businessman Elon Musk. Desperate to improve his quality of life, Nolan applied and within just two days had an email back from Neuralink, with an interview the following day. Four months later, at the end of January this year, he was in hospital preparing to have the two-hour operation he hoped would give him some of the independence back that he once enjoyed so freely. Nolan, now 30, was to be the first human to have a chip inserted into his head in a clinical trial called Telepathy. The coin-sized chip is a brain-computer interface (BCI) and is implanted under the skull where 64 neural threads are attached to the motor cortex. The device then decodes the desired movement of the person's brain and translates it into computer commands. If successful, it means people will be able to control devices using only their thoughts. This would be a game changer for disabled people like Nolan but as he was the first to receive the technology, he knew there were risks as he was essentially getting the \"worst\" version of it, with improvements and tweaks being made depending on results. He also had concerns over allowing anyone to potentially damage the one part of his body that was functioning normally. \"As a quadriplegic, all I have left is my brain,\" he explains. \"It's one thing that I've thanked God for every day since my accident, that he left me with my ability to think and with my personality. So going in for brain surgery was something I had to think about.\" He decided the risk was worth it and told his parents to put him in a home if things went wrong as he didn't want to be a burden on them. Nolan, a huge Musk fan, also felt passionately about the technology, wanting to help further its progression. After he recovered from the operation, he began 'training' to start using the chip and within just a few days, the cursor started moving on his computer screen. He is now able to just think about where he wants it to go and it goes there. There were problems though - a few weeks after the op a large number of the threads detached from his brain and the software had to be recalibrated so he could regain control of it again. Critics of the technology are wary of its safety claiming it caused severe side effects in monkeys during trials, such as chronic infection and paralysis, and the long term effects on the brain are of course unknown. However, so far, for Nolan, it has meant he can now use social media again because he can type quickly enough to keep up thanks to a virtual keyboard which can understand him much better than Siri. He is also playing Chess online and learning Japanese. Most importantly, it's made him happier and those close to him have noticed the difference in him. \"It's reconnected me with the outside world,\" he says. \"They basically say that I smile more. They love the change in me.\" What do you think of the Neuralink trials?

Donald confirmed that Jurgen Klinsmann\u2019s agent had faxed the Dons, among a number of other clubs, saying the striker was available on a free transfer. The stumbling block was Klinsmann\u2019s demands of at least \u00a31million per year in wages. Donald made the revelation to 300 shareholders at the city\u2019s Capitol Theatre during a question and answer session which followed the club\u2019s AGM. One shareholder urged Donald to speculate to accumulate by buying big-name players, highlighting that stars such as Gheorghe Hagi can become available on free transfers as a result of the 1995 Bosman ruling. Donald responded: \u201cOne big name player does not guarantee success. When Charlie Nicholas came here as a real personality our crowds only improved for the first six home games.\u201d The Aberdeen chairman went on to speak about the fax he had received from Klinsmann\u2019s agent. He may have regretted that decision as some Dons fans perceived the lack of interest in a possible deal for Klinsmann \u2013 who had helped Germany to victory at Euro 1996 earlier that year \u2013 as a lack of ambition. In the following day\u2019s Evening Express, Dons legend Joe Harper described the admission as a major own goal by chairman Donald. He said: \u201cIt\u2019s ridiculous that the Dons didn\u2019t at least try to take the player over. \u201cThe Aberdeen fans want a personality player and the club threw away the best chance they will ever get to get one of the biggest in the world. \u201cI\u2019m sure there are major companies in the city who would have been willing to help with the costs in return for having Klinsmann available to meet their guests and customers on match days. \u201cI mean no disrespect to Paul Bernard but the club paid \u00a31million for him. \u201cSo what was the problem with paying the same sum for one of the top stars in the world game? \u201cThe Dons would have raked in cash from selling Klinsmann shirts and other souvenirs. \u201cIt would have made Aberdeen the talk of Europe.\u201d An \u2018unrealistic\u2019 transfer for the Dons A month after the AGM and in an exclusive interview with the Press and Journal on January 9, 1997, chairman Ian Donald admitted he felt like \u201cpublic enemy number one\u201d following a series of bad results. He also provided more details on why the club opted against a move for German international Klinsmann for \u00a31million a season. He said: \u201cI did use the name Jurgen Klinsmann at the annual meeting as a throwaway line but does anyone honestly think that Klinsmann would come and play for Aberdeen Football Club? \u201cOne, the wage that was quoted recently if he goes to Nottingham Forest would be \u00a332,000 a week. \u201cThat\u2019s more than \u00a31.5million a year. \u201cOur turnover in total is \u00a35million and that includes gate receipts, commercial activities, everything. \u201cHow could we possibly pay that kind of money to one player? These are the facts the fans have to realise. \u201cIt\u2019s totally unrealistic. \u201cEven if you were to have a full house every week against the likes of Motherwell and Raith Rovers, you\u2019re not going to generate enough income to pay \u00a31million a year, never mind \u00a332,000 a week. \u201cAny attempt at a quick fix is likely to put a club into further debt. \u201cWe have to compete by bringing in good players and bringing up youngsters and that\u2019s what we\u2019ve done more than any other club outside the Old Firm. \u201cWe\u2019re doing this on the back of crowds of 12,000 to 14,000. People ask us: \u2018Where\u2019s your crowd?\u2019 when we are second in the league and can only attract 10,000 to a home game.\u201d Klinsmann was at Bayern Munich at the time of the transfer speculation linking him with the Dons. He moved to Italian side Sampdoria for the 1997-98 season but returned for a second spell at Tottenham on a loan deal halfway through the season with his goals helping save the club from the threat of relegation from tthe English top flight.", "summary": "Dons chairman Ian Donald spoke about the potential transfer at the club's annual meeting in 1996.", "url": "https://www.pressandjournal.co.uk/fp/sport/football/aberdeen-fc/6491628/jurgen-klinsmann-to-aberdeen-dons-german-legend/", "image": "https://www.pressandjournal.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/06/shutterstock_editorial_1078704a-mcq7djxy-e1717515197112.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 17:13:33", "author": "Danny Law", "authors": ["Danny Law"], "language": "en", "catgory": "sports", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": -0.259}

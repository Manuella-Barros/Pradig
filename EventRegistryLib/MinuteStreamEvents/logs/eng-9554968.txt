They alleged in court filings that they spent unlawful time behind bars after eCourts launched in four pilot counties in February 2023.\n\nThe software has promised to transform the state's legal system by moving paper records online, allowing the public to access court records they could previously only get only by visiting a courthouse. But software errors and human errors have led to multiple arrests on the same warrants and extra time in jail after release conditions were met, plaintiffs alleged.\n\nOn Tuesday, the plaintiffs narrowed their allegations to a few sheriffs by voluntarily dismissing the North Carolina Administrative Office of the Courts -- the state office responsible for eCourts' rollout -- and clerks.\n\nJoseph Kyzer, the deputy director of the Administrative Office of the Courts, shared the news in an email to The Charlotte Observer late Tuesday afternoon.\n\n\"We are pleased that plaintiffs dismissed their meritless claims against NCAOC and court officials,\" Graham Wilson, a spokesperson for the office, said in a statement. \"This dismissal should answer inaccuracies regarding eCourts as we remain focused on completing this generational expansion of access to justice for North Carolina.\"\n\nThe dismissals were without prejudice, meaning state court officials and the clerks could still be sued.\n\n\"Our clients retain the ability to refile claims against the NCAOC and Clerk Defendants -- whether in federal court or a different forum -- as we continue to learn more,\" Zack Ezor, an attorney for the plaintiffs, said in a statement Wednesday.\n\nMecklenburg County Sheriff Garry McFadden has asked that he, too, be dismissed from the lawsuit.\n\nA spokesperson for McFadden said the sheriff's office would not comment on pending litigation.\n\n\"While someone may be to blame for the delays in their release, it is not Sheriff McFadden,\" a memorandum filed in court by the sheriff last month said.\n\nMcFadden was a critic of eCourts before he was dragged into the lawsuit, and before the software even launched in Mecklenburg County in October.\n\n\"We are all concerned,\" he told WCNC before the launch. \"Who's going to suffer is the public.\"\n\nBut McFadden's \"negligence\" led to over-detentions, plaintiffs have said.\n\nAnother new filing in the lawsuit included specifics about people in Mecklenburg County who say they spent extra time in jail during the first few weeks of eCourts' Mecklenburg County rollout, providing names of 69 people and the alleged amount of extra time they were held.\n\nThose waits ranged from nine to 23 hours, according to the new filing.\n\nThe Charlotte Observer reported in November on concerns from the public defender's office about people getting out of jail late.

(WNCN) -- After facing a lawsuit related to alleged wrongful detentions and arrests, several defendants have been dropped from the case against them.\n\neCourts is a $100 million software overhaul for the North Carolina court system. It launched more than a year ago, with Wake, Johnston, Harnett and Lee Counties as the first pilot counties. It has since been implemented in dozens of other counties including Durham and Orange.\n\nSince the switchover to the new software, multiple people claim they were unconstitutionally jailed because of problems with the system. eCourts has been blamed for a list of other issues including problems with DMV records, public disclosure of private information and a slowdown in the day-to-day operations of District Court.\n\nMany of the issues have been resolved. However, district attorneys and lawyers continue to raise concerns about the software.\n\nSome of those concerns are included in a lawsuit specifically addressing wrongful detention. In a news release attorneys with Tin Fulton, Walker and Owen Law Office said, \"Our clients voluntarily dismissed their claims brought against the North Carolina Administrative Office of the Courts and three county clerks. Since our clients filed this lawsuit, the North Carolina Supreme Court published intervening case law extending certain state immunity doctrines to county clerks, largely insulating them from suit. See Wynn v. Frederick, 385 N.C. 576, 585-86, 895 S.E.2d 371, 379-80 (2023). Importantly, the voluntary dismissals are without prejudice. Our clients retain the ability to refile claims against the NCAOC and Clerk Defendants -- whether in federal court or a different forum -- as we continue to learn more.\"\n\nIn response, NCAOC spokesperson Graham Wilson said in a statement, \"We are pleased that plaintiffs dismissed their meritless claims against NCAOC and court officials. This dismissal should answer inaccuracies regarding eCourts as we remain focused on completing this generational expansion of access to justice for North Carolina.\"\n\nTuesday the plaintiffs filed briefs that oppose the efforts by Mecklenburg County Sheriff Garry McFadden, Wake County Sheriff Willie Rowe, and Tyler Technologies, Inc. to dismiss the suit.\n\nAttorneys for the plaintiffs say, \"Each of these defendants had a duty to protect our clients from the unconstitutional overdetentions and arrests that resulted from the Defendants' policies and practices, as well as the implementation and design of the defective \"eCourts\" software.\"\n\nCourt documents provide new detail related to around 60 people who were allegedly overdetained in the first weeks of the eCourts rollout in Mecklenburg County. The claims state that overdetentions have continued to occur at the Mecklenburg County jail as recently as March of this year.", "source": {"uri": "cbs17.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Edited text from the comic is transcribed here to ease readability. The artist collective SpaceShift\u2019s first project began when Asad Ali Jafri and Melissa Munira Jafri passed empty storefronts in the Devon neighborhood during the pandemic. Their regular walks led to Aao Mil Baithen, a community-based initiative celebrating South Asia and its diaspora. Other projects followed: a community-sourced zine, A Day on Devon; starlight, a pop-up art space exploring Black and South Asian solidarity; and more recently, Shamiana, a public gathering space on Devon and Artesian\u2014a version of which travelled to the Houston Climate Justice Museum to help organize an exhibition in support of Palestine. In the following interview, three members of the nine-person collective, Asad Ali Jafri, Melissa Munira Jafri, and Tulika Ladsariya, discuss the project. Asad Ali Jafri: Shamiana refers to a tent or canopy in many parts of Asia that serves as a space for gatherings. For us, Shamiana is conceptual/metaphorical as well as a literal space we are building on Devon and Artesian. This led to the launch of Aao Mil Baithen (Let\u2019s Get Together) and a number of street-level arts happenings literally on the corner of Devon and Talman. Families, all ages, artists, chai poetry, music, games, dance\u2026 I remember, as a child, knowing that Devon was the place you could go to late at night and have a sense of freedom. I also remember art, music, and poetry happenings\u2014Devon has so many layers and intersections. We want to feel that the neighborhood so many of us are connected to and live in is culturally thriving, authentic, and relevant\u2014first and foremost for the people who live and work there. Tulika Ladsariya: As a collective of artists, we think of SpaceShift as a creative space. We are always thinking of alternative ways of building in community. All of our programming is place-making and sharing in a community rich in culture on the street level, in a space that is strangely devoid of it. Melissa Munira Jafri: Many of us come from backgrounds of working with or for art-centered museums and cultural organizations, which at their essence are colonial institutions built on the disenfranchisement of people of color. An interest in art brought us together as a collective, coupled with a desire to work outside of the systems and organizations often loaded with colonial baggage. We started with street corner activations, partly because we were curious what would happen. One inspiration for me was the \u201cAe Kai\u201d exhibition organized by the Smithsonian Asian Pacific American Center in Honolulu several years ago, where they took over an old grocery store and created a temporary art space. I love the idea of using unexpected spaces for art interventions and purposefully moving away from traditional museums and gallery settings.

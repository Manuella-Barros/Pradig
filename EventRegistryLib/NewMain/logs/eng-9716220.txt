The running back has cemented himself as a versatile workhorse in head coach Kyle Shanahan's scheme, rushing for an NFL-leading and career-high 1,459 yards last season.\n\nMcCaffrey earned NFL Offensive Player of the Year honors and has garnered significant respect among his peers since his arrival via trade from the Carolina Panthers.\n\nESPN's Jeremy Fowler recently surveyed nearly 80 league executives, coaches, and scouts, asking them to rank the NFL's top 10 running backs.

First up is running back, and, unsurprisingly, San Francisco 49ers running back Christian McCaffrey ranked first.\n\nMcCaffrey ranked second last year. This time around, he garnered 80 percent of the first-place votes. His lowest ranking was fourth:\n\nHe was dominant in every category. He consistently got positive yards before contact (888) and after contact (571), ranking first and second in those respective areas. The 49ers got 5.6 yards per carry when giving McCaffrey the ball on first downs.

Last year, we only saw one target over 20 yards -- a 41-yard touchdown -- and only three over ten yards. McCaffrey was automatic underneath, but his speed and his natural mismatch on linebackers could lead to more targets beyond the first-down marker.\n\nAnother angle is lightening McCaffrey's workload during the season, so he stays healthy during a potential 20-game season and is fresh during the playoffs. But it's easier said than done when you're talking about taking a player of McCaffrey's caliber off the field.\n\nWe're a couple of seasons removed from the 49ers trading McCaffrey, and despite some criticism at the moment, giving up a few picks for an MVP player turned out to be a no-brainer.

With each year, Fowler has composed a top-10 ranking at nearly every position in the NFL from the results of the votes and conversations.\n\nOn Monday, July 8 he released his running back rankings and Hall cracked the list at No. 2 overall. Last year he didn't make the ranking and was left on the honorable mention list.\n\n\"Hall is considered the game's best running back under the age of 25, with big upside on Year 3 projections,\" Fowler said. \"He looked brilliant as a rookie before tearing his ACL, then looked great again late in 2023 with 357 yards and three touchdowns over weeks 16-18 despite a nonexistent passing game around him.\"\n\nFowler clarified in his opening monologue that this ranking isn't a multiyear projection or a career achievement award but rather a list to determine the best players in the game right now.\n\nHall was No. 2 on the list only behind San Francisco 49ers superstar Christian McCaffrey. No shame in that consolation prize.\n\nFowler revealed that McCaffrey earned more than 80% of the first-place votes in this exercise. That is nearly more than any other player at any other position which speaks to the gap between McCaffrey and the next-best running back in the league.\n\nHall (23) is five years younger than McCaffrey (28). He appears to be the next in line to take the crown as the top RB in the NFL sooner rather than later.\n\nTo be legitimately in that conversation, Hall has to make a seismic jump in the rushing yardage department. Hall hasn't had a 1,000-yard season in either of his first two campaigns in the league.\n\nHe was No. 13 in the NFL with 994 rushing yards. No. 1 was, you guessed it, McCaffrey. Similar to the voting results the next closest guy to run CMC in rushing yards last season was well behind him (292).\n\nWhile the former Iowa State product has clearly earned some respect across the league, not everyone is a believer.\n\nAt least one member of the 80 voters, if not more, didn't even have Hall on their ballots. Fowler reveals the top-10 at each position. For each player that made it inside the top-10 list you as a reader get more information on the voting process. How high they placed on the ballots and how low they placed.\n\nThe highest ranking Hall got was second best to McCaffrey which is where he ended up. However, some didn't rank him inside the top 10 at the running back position.\n\nOne person could poke holes at Hall's game based on that output. However there are plenty of advanced analytics that explain that away being a result of terrible quarterback play, loaded boxes, and teams making sure that Hall won't beat them.\n\n\"Hall averaged 4.3 yards per carry against a heavy box (eight or more defenders), which ranked fifth in the NFL,\" Fowler revealed.", "source": {"uri": "heavy.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Heavy"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breece_Hall", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Breece Hall"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior_cruciate_ligament_injury", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anterior cruciate ligament injury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Jets", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York Jets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_McCaffrey", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Christian McCaffrey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_49ers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco 49ers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowa_State_Cyclones_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Iowa State Cyclones football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Bingo", "label": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Bingo", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://heavy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-1724978140-e1720470640436.jpg?quality=65&strip=all&w=780", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9716220", "eventUri": "eng-9716220", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-08", "textStart": 332, "textEnd": 338}], "sentiment": 0.3019607843137255, "wgt": 184, "relevance": 1}

Roger Craig was the first running back in history to record 1,000 rushing yards and 1,000 receiving yards in the same season. Christian McCaffrey has been sensational since joining the 49ers during the 2022 season.\n\nThe San Francisco 49ers were one of the first beneficiaries of the West Coast offense and the expansion of the passing game in general. In fact, it can be argued that Joe Montana and Jerry Rice helped expedite the paradigm shift from run-oriented offenses to pass-heavy attacks.\n\nBecause prolific passing offenses defined the franchise's golden age, it's easy for fans to downplay or even ignore the franchise's history at running back.\n\nUnbeknownst to many, the 49ers have a rich history of running backs that dates back to the franchise's early years in the NFL. From 1950s All-Decade members to modern-day superstars, these are the five best running backs in 49ers history.\n\nRelated 5 Players You Forgot Suited Up for the San Francisco 49ers\n\nThe San Francisco 49ers have had plenty of homegrown superstars, but here are five players you may have forgotten who suited up for them.\n\n1 Frank Gore Gore's consistency allowed him to climb the all-time rushing yards list\n\nFrank Gore's career challenged the long-held axiom regarding running back longevity. He was an effective back early on, rushing for a career-best 1,695 yards in his second season with the Niners.\n\nBut where Gore really separated himself from the rest of the pack was his late-career production. In his ninth season with the 49ers in 2013, he made the fifth Pro Bowl of his career, and in his 10th and final season in San Francisco, he rushed for 1,106 yards, good for ninth among all backs that year.\n\nGore ran for 11,073 yards in a 49ers uniform, the most in franchise history, and only trails Joe Perry in rushing touchdowns, with 64. After leaving San Francisco, Gore managed to continue producing and was still getting starts in his age-37 season.\n\nDue to the number of touches he accumulated, Gore's 16,000 career rushing yards rank third in league history, behind only Emmitt Smith and Walter Payton. In terms of raw talent, Gore isn't on par with the all-time great runners, but the numbers speak for themselves and are a testament to his fortitude and tenacity.\n\n2 Joe Perry Perry's number was retired by San Francisco following his career\n\nHugh McElhenny may have been the more celebrated member of the 1950s 49ers backfield, but it was fullback Joe Perry who was the team's leading rusher during most of those seasons.\n\nAt around 200 pounds, Perry wasn't as bulky or thick as the fullbacks of the 21st century, but that didn't stop him from becoming a hard-nosed runner who imposed his will on opposing defenses. Perry led the league in carries twice and in rushing yards and rushing touchdowns three times.\n\nAt a time when running backs seldom exceeded 1,000 rushing yards in a given season, Perry did so in consecutive years in 1953 and 1954, winning NFL MVP for his 1,049 rushing yards and 1,252 yards from scrimmage in the latter.\n\nFollowing the 1954 season, Perry's usage rate took a hit and took him out of Pro Bowl consideration. He played with the Baltimore Colts for the 1961 and 1962 seasons before returning to San Francisco in 1963 and retiring the following offseason.\n\nAbove all else, Perry was a workhorse in every sense of the word and an efficient one at that. He finished in the top 10 in carries in 10 of his 16 seasons and still maintained a career average of 5.0 yards per carry. Perry ranks second in franchise history in rushing yards with 8,689 and first in rushing touchdowns with 68.\n\n3 Hugh McElhenny McElhenny was a highly efficient runner\n\nHugh McElhenny was one of the 49ers' first offensive stars, joining the team in 1952. As a rookie, McElhenny was named a First-Team All-Pro after recording 1,051 yards from scrimmage. He continued to thrive in San Francisco's offense, making five Pro Bowls and four additional All-Pro teams in his nine seasons with the franchise.\n\nDespite never surpassing 1,000 rushing yards in a season, McElhenny was one of the best running backs of his generation. He was named to the All-1950s team and inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1970.\n\nAlthough his 4,288 rushing yards and 35 touchdowns with the 49ers don't crack the top five in franchise history, his 4.9 yards per carry are higher than multiple others on this list.\n\n4 Roger Craig Craig worked well as a three-down back\n\nDuring the days of Joe Montana and Steve Young, it was easy to forget about the 49ers backfield. Bill Walsh's West Coast offense had begun to proliferate across the league and became one of the most identifiable parts of the 49ers franchise.\n\nThose who were thorough enough to look beyond the surface, though, quickly noticed the skill of 1980s running back Roger Craig.\n\nCraig spent much of his career taking snaps as a running back and fullback. His success, however, proved to be independent of his designated position. The Nebraska alum was an exceptionally gifted pass-catcher, making him a perfect fit for San Francisco's offense.\n\nIn 1985, his third year in the league, Craig became the first player on record to accumulate 1,000 rushing yards and 1,000 receiving yards in the same season. In the years since, only Marshall Faulk and Christian McCaffrey have joined him.\n\nCraig ultimately made four Pro Bowls and won three Super Bowls with the 49ers. He ran for 7,064 yards and 50 touchdowns for the franchise, ranking third in both categories.\n\n5 Christian McCaffrey McCaffrey has been sensational in a 49ers uniform\n\nIn his short time in the Bay, Christian McCaffrey has been everything Kyle Shanahan could've hoped for and then some. For years, the 49ers offense thrived without a true No. 1 back, leading to the erroneous belief that running back talent wasn't a necessity to the scheme.\n\nHowever, McCaffrey took the offense to new heights shortly after his arrival in 2022 and has reclaimed his spot as the league's best running back. The Stanford alum became the first 49er to win Offensive Player of the Year since Joe Montana in 1989 after posting 1,459 rushing yards and 2,023 yards from scrimmage in 2023, both league bests.\n\nPerhaps the biggest factor of all in McCaffrey's success in San Francisco has been his ability to stay on the field. Injuries stymied him at times during his days with the Carolina Panthers, but better coaching and surrounding talent have allowed McCaffrey to go back to being a workhorse back.\n\nWith 2,205 rushing yards, 1,028 receiving yards, and 31 total touchdowns through just 27 games in a Niners uniform, it's safe to say things are off to a promising start. McCaffrey's overall numbers obviously aren't as high as the others on this list, but his 81.7 rushing yards per game are the most in franchise history.\n\nAll stats courtesy of Pro Football Reference

The only thing holding him back was when he was hurt. But he's exactly how you would draw up a football player.\"\n\nMcCaffrey has three seasons with at least 1,000 rushing yards and 700 receiving yards, trailing only Marshall Faulk (4) in NFL history.\n\nHe was the 2023 leader in explosive plays (10-yard runs and 20-yard receptions).\n\n\"San Francisco made one of the best trades of the decade when they got him [in 2022],\" a player-personnel executive said. \"He's perfect for what they do.\"\n\nHighest ranking: 2 | Lowest ranking: Unranked\n\nAge: 23 | Last year's ranking: Honorable mention\n\nHall is considered the game's best running back under the age of 25, with big upside on Year 3 projections.\n\nHe looked brilliant as a rookie before tearing his ACL, then looked great again late in 2023 with 357 yards and three touchdowns over weeks 16-18 despite a nonexistent passing game around him.\n\n\"Natural rusher with acceleration through the hole,\" a high-ranking NFL official said. \"He's got power and can create his own shot by making someone miss.\"\n\nHall averaged 4.3 yards per carry against a heavy box (eight or more defenders), which ranked fifth in the NFL.\n\nHall proved versatile with 76 catches for 591 yards along with his 994 rushing yards.\n\n\"Legit dual-threat, a glider with high-level change of direction and vision,\" an NFL personnel evaluator said. \"Home run hitter with the ball in his hands. Can grind volume, create explosives at any moment.\"\n\nHighest ranking: 1 | Lowest ranking: Unranked\n\nAge: 28 | Last year's ranking: 1\n\nThis one is complicated. Chubb has been the game's best pure rusher when healthy. But his future is shrouded in uncertainty because of a severe knee injury suffered last season that required multiple surgeries.\n\nChubb is expected to return in 2024. What exactly the Browns are getting upon that return is tough to project.\n\nSome took Chubb off their ballots altogether. Many others kept him in the top three.\n\n\"He would be No. 1 for me if healthy,\" an AFC executive said. \"Even though I'm not sure how he's going to look, he deserves to be high.\"\n\nThe surgeries repaired damage to the meniscus, MCL and ACL in his left knee, the same side that Chubb seriously injured at Georgia in 2015.\n\n\"Even if he's lacking some explosion in the short term, he still has instincts and good feet,\" an AFC personnel evaluator said. \"Hopefully that shines through and he gets his power back. He's such a good player.\"\n\nSince entering the NFL in 2018, Chubb has averaged 5.3 yards per rush, the third-highest mark by a running back in the Super Bowl era with a minimum of 500 carries, behind Bo Jackson and Jamaal Charles at 5.4.\n\nHighest ranking: 2 | Lowest ranking: 10\n\nAge: 27 | Last year's ranking: 4\n\nAfter years of toiling in the Giants' grind-it-out offense, Barkley upgraded to Philly.\n\nThe possibilities have some around the league excited.\n\n\"He's going to be a beast,\" a veteran AFC scout who ranked him second said. \"The weapons around him on the outside, dual-threat QB, shotgun runs, his versatility -- it's a perfect fit.\"\n\nA career reset like McCaffrey's in San Francisco would be ideal for Barkley, whose production dipped to 962 yards on 247 carries (3.9 yards per carry) last season. Barkley battled ankle issues that sources said were worse than most knew. Many weeks it was a struggle for him to see the field.\n\nThe money still spoke, with Philly signing Barkley to a three-year, $37.75 million deal in free agency.\n\nDurability is a part of the Barkley conversation. He has missed at least three games in four of his six NFL seasons. But in the two seasons when he played 16 games, in 2018 and 2022, he totaled 3,678 yards and 25 touchdowns.\n\nHe makes life easier on quarterbacks, too. Daniel Jones' touchdown-to-interception ratio was 2.3 with Barkley in his backfield, compared to 0.8 without him.\n\n\"Probably not as fast as he used to be,\" an NFL offensive coach said. \"He has the ability to make people miss in space, which is sometimes bad since you think you can bounce it and outrun people. But when he does get downhill, running in between tackles, he's so strong naturally that he's hard to tackle. He runs through arm tackles. Just has to decide to do it.\"\n\nHighest ranking: 2 | Lowest ranking: Unranked\n\nAge: 25 | Last year's ranking: 6\n\nTaylor's career has seen plenty of highs and lows, from a 2021 rushing title to a Year 3 plummet due in part to an anemic Colts offense around him to a lengthy contract dispute that pushed against last year's trade deadline.\n\nLate in 2023, armed with a new contract, Taylor pumped out 487 yards and six touchdowns over his final five games.\n\n\"Still explosive -- last year he was beat up,\" an AFC scout said. \"The Colts eased him into things. But he's probably the best combination of size and straight-line speed right now.\"\n\nThe Colts' run block win rate improved from 23rd to 14th year-over-year, and a healthy Taylor for a full season should improve that stock even more.\n\n\"Expecting a huge year from him,\" an AFC executive said. \"Still an impact player.\"\n\nHighest ranking: 1 | Lowest ranking: Unranked\n\nAge: 22 | Last year's ranking: N/A\n\nRobinson didn't quite validate the hype as a rookie. His 976 rushing yards in 2023, which tied for 15th in the league, fell short of projections for the No. 8 pick in a run-heavy offense.\n\nTo be sure, Robinson's usage -- despite his obvious ability to shake defenders -- was curious at times. Robinson got more than 15 carries in four of 17 games.\n\n\"The production is not all him -- he's a top-five talent at the position right now,\" an NFL personnel evaluator said.\n\nThat's why the Year 2 expectations are still massive.\n\nRobinson led the league with 5.2 yards per carry against boxes of seven or more defenders. His 35 explosive plays ranked third for running backs.\n\n\"If he gets to the second or third level, he's incredibly hard to tackle,\" an NFL offensive coach said. \"Deceptive speed once he gets loose. He reminds me of LeSean McCoy. Very elusive. Really hard to touch him.\"\n\nJacobs looked like the game's premier back that season on his way to 1,653 yards and a first-team All-Pro bid, becoming the first Raider since Marcus Allen to lead the league in rushing. Last season, the production was that of a volume grinder, with a career-low 3.5 yards per carry, though Las Vegas' coaching change and quarterback carousel didn't help.\n\nBut if you're looking for a traditional, durable back, he's still one of the best.\n\n\"Just a good all-around back,\" an NFL offensive coach said. \"Can run inside or outside zone. Breaks a lot of tackles at the point of contact. Rarely tackled by one guy. Not the fastest or biggest or strongest but just knows how to run the football and [be] very productive. And he's very durable. Can get you a lot of carries and really punish you in the fourth quarter.\"", "source": {"uri": "insider.espn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ESPN.com (Insider)"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Football_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "American Football Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Barkley", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Charles Barkley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reception_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Reception (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshall_Faulk", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marshall Faulk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior_cruciate_ligament_injury", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anterior cruciate ligament injury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medial_collateral_ligament", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Medial collateral ligament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bo_Jackson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bo Jackson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaal_Charles", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jamaal Charles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scout_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scout (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meniscus_(anatomy)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Meniscus (anatomy)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tackle_(football_move)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tackle (football move)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior_cruciate_ligament", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anterior cruciate ligament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Jones_(American_football)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Daniel Jones (American football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tackle_(gridiron_football_position)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tackle (gridiron football position)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeSean_McCoy", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "LeSean McCoy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Allen", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marcus Allen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-Pro", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "All-Pro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://a3.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2024%2F0705%2Fr1354875_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9716220", "eventUri": "eng-9716220", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 154, "relevance": 1}

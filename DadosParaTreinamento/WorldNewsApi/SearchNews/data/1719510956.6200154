At her second house viewing, she found a 1920s ground-floor property in Turin that worked its magic. The one-bedroom art nouveau flat featured high ceilings and, at the back, an overgrown but fascinating garden. \u201cWhen I first saw it the plants were covered with a blanket of snow and two cats were sleeping peacefully,\u201d says Manuela. The tranquil scene was exactly what she was looking for. Located in the Crocetta district, the property is close to the city centre, but secluded enough not to be overwhelmed by the noise of nightlife activities. Manuela and her daughters Sveva, 16, and Costanza, 14, have now lived here for three years. \u201cWhen we bought the property in 2019, I had recently separated from my husband,\u201d says Manuela. \u201cI decided it was time for us to find a quiet place where we could put down roots. Fortunately, it is within comfortable walking distance of their father\u2019s house, school and friends.\u201d The previous owner had lived in the flat for more than 50 years. When he died, his daughter decided to sell. \u201cThe layout was a single open space with a bedroom and bathroom on the entry level,\u201d says Manuela. \u201cThere was a distinct 1970s vibe with carpet everywhere, which we removed. However, I was keen to make the most of the beautiful garden and keep his trees and the roses that produced an intoxicating scent.\u201d Before putting in an offer, Manuela confirmed it would be possible to install a garden room that would connect the living area and the garden. The glazed lean-to was built by a local blacksmith and is the brightest space in the house. \u201cIt\u2019s great being able to collect produce from our small vegetable garden in the spring and summer months, and cook it immediately,\u201d she says. Back in the house, the interiors are the result of her passion for design and natural materials. Vibrant rugs are displayed throughout the property, including on the bathroom and kitchen floors. \u201cI love soft and intimate atmospheres and I tried to create them in the house, giving life to many charming corners, each with its own function.\u201d One such corner under the stairs features a Vitra Eames rocking chair and a String system bookcase. There\u2019s also a work area in the dining room with an original 1950s desk, computer, books and plants. The furnishings, textiles and assorted objects are a mix-and-match of design pieces, many from her own company, Pinkmartini, and some inherited from family and friends or found in vintage markets. \u201cI managed to keep some furniture that came with the house, including the bed and a mirror in the bathroom,\u201d she says. There\u2019s a new mezzanine area with glazed walls that allow light to spread through the rooms. This space had been used as storage and was accessed via a flight of stairs, where the wall is now painted yellow. \u201cThe flight was L-shaped and took up lots of room,\u201d Manuela explains. \u201cWith the help of an architect friend we designed a set of straight, open-tread iron flights for the opposite wall.\u201d These lead up to Sveva and Costanza\u2019s bedrooms. The small and comfortable rooms have been designed to leave enough space for a large walk-in wardrobe on the same level. Back downstairs in the Ikea kitchen area, a large vintage mirror is suspended on a tilt. \u201cI wanted it to hang like this to give the bistro effect, but it also reflects the entire garden space, bringing nature into our home,\u201d Manuela explains. Above the IL-Wood & Co marble-topped peninsula hang two multicoloured ceramic pendants from Ferroluce Lighting and the floor is covered with a bold polyvinyl rug Manuela designed for Pinkmartini. \u201cIt was important to create a comfortable and appealing space for the girls throughout,\u201d she says. The hand-printed Deborah Bowness wallpaper in the corridor sets the tone for the rest of the interiors \u2013 a considered mix of vintage and modern furniture offset by vibrant colours. \u201cI\u2019ve used wallpaper by the same designer in my bedroom, but I decided to hang the entire roll instead of pasting it to the wall.\u201d Manuela has managed to establish balance and harmony \u2013 in a space of just 90sqm. \u201cWe exploited the high ceilings and were able to add an extra bathroom,\u201d she says. And it\u2019s peaceful, too: \u201cI rarely need to escape to the mountains, as I often did in the past.\u201d", "summary": "<p>How an Italian designer turned a tired one-bedroom art nouveau flat in north Italy into a modern but cosy home for her teenage family</p><p>Manuela Merlo\u2019s house hunt finished almost as soon as it had begun.

{"id": 232035000, "title": "How Trump Stands in Nevada Polls Ahead of Key Rally", "text": "Donald Trump is due to hold a campaign rally in Nevada as polls suggest the former president is leading President Joe Biden in the 2024 swing state.The Republican will appear in Las Vegas on Sunday in the first large-scale rally since he was convicted of 34 charges of falsifying business records in New York.Trump denied all the charges against him in the trial, and claimed the criminal case was a politically motivated \"witch hunt\" which aimed to hinder his chances of winning November's likely rematch against Biden.Trump will appear at the rally as he hopes to flip Nevada, having lost the state to Biden in 2020, as well as in 2016 to Democratic rival Hilary Clinton.Steven Cheung, a spokesperson for Trump, told Newsweek ahead of the event: \"Nevada is Trump Country and President Trump's message of a building a stronger economy and securing the border resonates deeply with voters who are sick and tired of Crooked Joe Biden's disastrous presidency.\"Ahead of the rally, a Fox News poll on June 6 found that Trump is leading Biden in Nevada by five points (50 percent to 45). The poll was conducted of 1,069 Nevada registered voters between June 1-4, in the wake of Trump becoming the first president in U.S. history to be convicted of a crime on May 30.The survey also found that nearly two-thirds of voters in Nevada (65 percent) said that Trump's felony conviction does much matter \"much\" or \"at all\" with regards to how they plan to vote in November.Instead, it seems voters are more willing to back Trump as they overwhelmingly believe the former president will be better than Biden at handling hot topic issues such as the economy (Trump +16), and immigration/border security (Trump +22).\"Biden's main problem in Nevada is the economic recovery he has touted in many places isn't being felt in Nevada,\" said Republican pollster Daron Shaw, who conducts Fox News surveys with Democrat Chris Anderson.\"Half say they are losing ground financially, including 59 percent of Independents and 30 percent of Democrats.\"Another poll by the Tyson Group, conducted from May 22 to 25, found Trump beating Biden in a direct match-up (47 percent to 44), as well as when other candidates such as Independent Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is introduced (40 percent to 37, with Kennedy third on 9 percent).A Bloomberg/Morning Consult survey of 4,962 registered voters in seven swing states released late in May showed Trump and Biden were tied on 47 percent in Nevada.Trump's office has been contacted via email for comment.The event in Las Vegas arrives amid weather warnings of extreme heat in the state, with temperatures expected to reach as high as 111 degrees Fahrenheit on Sunday.During a recent town hall event in Phoenix, a number of Trump supporters had to be treated for heat-related symptoms as heatwaves grip the west.In a statement released ahead of the Las Vegas rally, Trump's campaign team said Biden and his \"woke Democrat friends have declared a war on the middle class\" in Nevada.\"Nevadans are suffering under Bidenomics\u202fwith inflation in Nevada over 21.6%,\u202fcosting households over $1,170 a month,\" the statement added.\"Hard-working Americans are feeling the pain at the pumps too, with record high gas prices.\"", "summary": "The former president will hold his first major outdoor rally since he was found guilty of 34 felony charges in the New York hush money trial.", "url": "https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-las-vegas-rally-polls-nevada-1910168", "image": "https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2406450/donald-trump-las-vegas.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 15:09:06", "author": "Ewan Palmer", "authors": ["Ewan Palmer"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.545}

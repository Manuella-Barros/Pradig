{"id": 243298744, "title": "Gary Lineker has four-word superstition before live TV after Match of the Day debacle", "text": "Match of the Day host Gary Lineker has revealed his one and only superstition was sparked by a gaffe from Liverpool icons Alan Hansen and Mark Lawrenson. After almost 30 years fronting the BBC's football coverage, he's come to earn his status as the broadcaster's highest earner. And learning from his mistakes is one attribute that's got him where he is after an oversight by Hansen and Lawrenson led to him adopting one particular ritual. The ex-Tottenham and Barcelona striker was leading the broadcast for an FA Cup fifth-round fixture between Wolves and Rochdale in 2003 when the show went to air. But the actions of his colleagues - or lack thereof - prompted him to alter his pre-show routine, a change he's stuck with ever since. \"So Alan wanted to tell this story about when Liverpool were about to win the league at Molineux, and the Liverpool fans found a way to get in the ground,\" said Lineker on 'The Rest Is Football' podcast (via the Liverpool Echo). \"There was a door in the dressing room at Molineux that actually opened out onto the street. And he said, 'We're all sitting there about to get the team talk, and about 100 Liverpool fans came through the dressing room.' And he was gonna tell this story, which is a great story. \"I did the rehearsal a couple of times. Then, as always, we get the count coming down, the music plays [hum MOTD theme tune], and I deliver my opening line: 'So, Alan, didn't you clinch the league title here?' So Alan Hansen's just sitting there, and he's looking at the [matchday] programme! And he just keeps on looking at the programme, and he doesn't say anything. He doesn't say a word.\" \"And I'm going, 'That's odd.' And next to him is Mark Lawrenson. Now Alan and Mark had had a bit of a big night the night before. So I then hand to Mark Lawrenson: 'Do you want to say anything, Mark? ' And he's just [laughed], and he's reading his notes. I'm going, 'What is going on? ' My head's mashed! And I've gone, 'Are we not live yet? ' And the editor in my ear shouts, 'Oh, yes, we f*****g are!'\" Lineker was certain that if such an incident occurred today, it would become an internet sensation, with Hansen left red-faced by his blunder. However, it gave birth to a broadcasting ritual that Lineker has adhered to every time he goes on air. He added: \"So ever since that day, as soon as the titles run, as soon as the music plays, I say, [all join in] 'Is this for real? ' Yes! And I've done it every single programme [since]. In fact, Micah joins in sometimes.\" Wolves managed to halt Rochdale's FA Cup journey that season with a 3-1 victory at home that day. Meanwhile, Hansen and Lawrenson were compelled to evaluate their own performance following a monumental live TV blunder. Micah Richards and Alan Shearer have both made it clear they don't buy into superstitions, steering clear of any ritualistic habits. But Lineker is a different story; he's known for his meticulous routine to avoid any mishaps. The Leicester City legend was deeply affected upon hearing the news of friend Hansen's hospitalisation in early June, admitting he \"broke down\" at the time. He and the rest of the football community were relieved to hear the Scot has since been allowed to return home. Join our new WhatsApp community and receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

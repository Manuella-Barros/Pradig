(Nasdaq: AMRX) (\"Amneal\" or the \"Company\") announced its results today for the first quarter ended March 31, 2024.\n\n\"We are extremely pleased with our outstanding start to the year, as Amneal generated record levels of revenues in the first quarter. For the first time, all three segments across our diversified business produced double-digit top-line growth in the same quarter. With perpetual and rising demand for medicines and exacerbated by chronic supply shortages in the U.S. pharmaceutical industry, Amneal is part of the solution. As we become larger, we provide even more patients with access to high-quality, affordable, and essential medicines as we create value for all our stakeholders,\" said Chirag and Chintu Patel, Co-Chief Executive Officers.\n\nFirst Quarter 2024 Results\n\nNet revenue in the first quarter of 2024 was $659 million, an increase of 18% compared to $558 million in the first quarter of 2023. Generics revenues increased 14% due to strong performance in complex generics, our oncology biosimilars and new launches. Specialty revenues increased 15% driven by promoted products in Neurology and Endocrinology. AvKARE revenues increased 33% driven by continued expansion across its channels due to new products.\n\nNet loss attributable to Amneal Pharmaceuticals, Inc. was $92 million in the first quarter of 2024 compared to $7 million in the first quarter of 2023, and included a pre-tax charge of $94 million for settlement in principle on a nationwide opioids settlement.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA in the first quarter of 2024 was $152 million, an increase of 31% compared to the first quarter of 2023, reflective of strong revenue performance and higher gross margins.\n\nDiluted loss per share in the first quarter of 2024 was $0.30 compared to $0.05 for the first quarter of 2023 due to the aforementioned factors. Adjusted diluted earnings per share in the first quarter of 2024 was $0.14 compared to $0.12 for the first quarter of 2023.\n\nThe Company presents GAAP and adjusted (non-GAAP) quarterly results. Please refer to the \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" section for more information. In the tables below, GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations are presented.\n\nSettlement in Principle on a Nationwide Opioids Settlement\n\nAmneal has reached a settlement in principle on the primary financial terms, with no admission of wrongdoing, for a nationwide resolution to the opioids cases that have been filed and that might have been filed against the Company by states, counties, municipalities, and Native American Tribal Nations across the United States. The settlement in principle resolves substantially all opioids litigation and is subject to the negotiation and execution of a definitive settlement agreement between the parties. The settlement would be payable over ten years. Under the settlement, the Company would agree to pay $92.5 million in cash and provide $180.0 million in naloxone nasal spray (valued at $125 per two-pack) to help treat opioid overdoses. In lieu of receiving product, the settling parties can opt to receive 25% of the product value (up to $45.0 million) in cash during the last four years of the ten-year payment term.\n\nIn the first quarter of 2024, the Company recorded a charge of $94 million in the consolidated statement of operations based on full participation in the potential settlement, which reflects the value of the cash payments and the supply of naloxone nasal spray over the ten-year period. The settlement in principle is contingent upon a sufficient number of settling parties electing to opt into the final definitive agreement. We remain committed to helping those impacted by the opioid crisis by enhancing access to naloxone nasal spray, which is an emergency treatment for opioid overdose and helps save lives.\n\nAffirming Full Year 2024 Guidance\n\nThe Company is affirming its previously provided full year 2024 guidance.\n\nAmneal's 2024 estimates are based on management's current expectations, including with respect to prescription trends, pricing levels, the timing of future product launches, the costs incurred and benefits realized of restructuring activities, and our long-term strategy. The Company's financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"GAAP\"). The Company cannot provide a reconciliation between non-GAAP projections and the most directly comparable measures in accordance with GAAP without unreasonable efforts because it is unable to predict with reasonable certainty the ultimate outcome of certain significant items required for the reconciliation. The items include, but are not limited to, acquisition-related expenses, restructuring expenses and benefits, asset impairments, legal settlements, and other gains and losses. These items are uncertain, depend on various factors, and could have a material impact on GAAP reported results.\n\nConference Call Information\n\nAmneal will host a conference call and live webcast at 8:30 am Eastern Time today, May 3, 2024, to discuss its results. The live webcast and presentation will be accessible through the Investor Relations section of the Company's website at https://investors.amneal.com.

Such forward-looking statements include statements regarding management's intentions, plans, beliefs, expectations, financial results, or forecasts for the future, including among other things: discussions of future operations; expected or estimated operating results and financial performance; and statements regarding our positioning, including our ability to drive sustainable long-term growth, and other non-historical statements. Words such as \"plans,\" \"expects,\" \"will,\" \"anticipates,\" \"estimates,\" and similar words, or the negatives thereof, are intended to identify estimates and forward-looking statements.\n\nThe reader is cautioned not to rely on these forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are based on current expectations of future events, including with respect to future market conditions, company performance and financial results, operational investments, business prospects, new strategies and growth initiatives, the competitive environment, and other events. If the underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize, actual results could vary materially from the expectations and projections of the Company.\n\nSuch risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to: our ability to successfully develop, license, acquire and commercialize new products on a timely basis; the competition we face in the pharmaceutical industry from brand and generic drug product companies, and the impact of that competition on our ability to set prices; our ability to obtain exclusive marketing rights for our products; our revenues are derived from the sales of a limited number of products, a substantial portion of which are through a limited number of customers; the impact of a prolonged business interruption within our supply chain; the continuing trend of consolidation of certain customer groups; our dependence on third-party suppliers and distributors for raw materials for our products and certain finished goods; legal, regulatory and legislative efforts by our brand competitors to deter competition from our generic alternatives; our dependence on information technology systems and infrastructure and the potential for cybersecurity incidents; our ability to attract, hire and retain highly skilled personnel; risks related to federal regulation of arrangements between manufacturers of branded and generic products; our reliance on certain licenses to proprietary technologies from time to time; the significant amount of resources we expend on research and development; the risk of claims brought against us by third parties; risks related to changes in the regulatory environment, including U.S. federal and state laws related to healthcare fraud abuse and health information privacy and security and changes in such laws; changes to Food and Drug Administration product approval requirements; the impact of healthcare reform and changes in coverage and reimbursement levels by governmental authorities and other third-party payers; our dependence on third-party agreements for a portion of our product offerings; our substantial amount of indebtedness and our ability to generate sufficient cash to service our indebtedness in the future, and the impact of interest rate fluctuations on such indebtedness; our potential expansion into additional international markets subjecting us to increased regulatory, economic, social and political uncertainties; our ability to identify, make and integrate acquisitions or investments in complementary businesses and products on advantageous terms; the impact of global economic, political or other catastrophic events; our obligations under a tax receivable agreement may be significant; and the high concentration of ownership of our Class A common stock and the fact that we are controlled by the Amneal Group. The forward-looking statements contained herein are also subject generally to other risks and uncertainties that are described from time to time in the Company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including under Item 1A, \"Risk Factors\" in the Company's most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and in its subsequent reports on Forms 10-Q and 8-K. Investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date they are made. Forward-looking statements included herein speak only as of the date hereof and we undertake no obligation to revise or update such statements to reflect the occurrence of events or circumstances after the date hereof.\n\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\n\nThis release includes certain non-GAAP financial measures, including EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income and adjusted diluted EPS, which are intended as supplemental measures of the Company's performance that are not required by or presented in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted diluted EPS reflects diluted earnings per share based on adjusted net income, which is net loss adjusted to (A) exclude (i) non-cash interest, (ii) GAAP provision for income taxes, (iii) amortization, (iv) stock-based compensation, (v) acquisition, site closure expenses, and idle facility expenses, (vi) restructuring and other charges, (vii) charges related to certain legal matters, including interest, net, (viii) asset impairment charges, (ix) change in fair value of contingent consideration, (x) increase in tax receivable agreement liability, (xi) system implementation expense, (xii) other and (xiii) net income attributable to non-controlling interests not associated with Class B common stock, and (B) include non-GAAP provision for income taxes. Non-GAAP adjusted diluted EPS for the three months ended March 31, 2024 was calculated using the weighted average fully diluted shares outstanding of Class A common stock. Non-GAAP adjusted diluted EPS for the three months ended March 31, 2023 was calculated using the weighted average diluted shares outstanding of Class A common stock and assuming all shares of Class B common stock were converted to shares of Class A common stock as of January 1, 2023.\n\nManagement uses these non-GAAP measures internally to evaluate and manage the Company's operations and to better understand its business because they facilitate a comparative assessment of the Company's operating performance relative to its performance based on results calculated under GAAP. These non-GAAP measures also isolate the effects of some items that vary from period to period without any correlation to core operating performance and eliminate certain charges that management believes do not reflect the Company's operations and underlying operational performance. The compensation committee of the Company's board of directors also uses certain of these measures to evaluate management's performance and set its compensation. The Company believes that these non-GAAP measures also provide useful information to investors regarding certain financial and business trends relating to the Company's financial condition and operating results facilitates an evaluation of the financial performance of the Company and its operations on a consistent basis. Providing this information therefore allows investors to make independent assessments of the Company's financial performance, results of operations and trends while viewing the information through the eyes of management.\n\nThese non-GAAP measures are subject to limitations. The non-GAAP measures presented in this release may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies because other companies may not calculate one or more in the same manner. Additionally, the non-GAAP performance measures exclude significant expenses and income that are required by GAAP to be recorded in the Company's financial statements; do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, working capital needs; and do not reflect interest expense, or the requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on debt. Further, our historical adjusted results are not intended to project our adjusted results of operations or financial position for any future period. To compensate for these limitations, management presents and considers these non-GAAP measures in conjunction with the Company's GAAP results; no non-GAAP measure should be considered in isolation from or as alternatives to any measure determined in accordance with GAAP.

(Nasdaq: AMRX) (\"Amneal\" or the \"Company\") announced its results today for the first quarter ended March 31, 2024.\n\n\"We are extremely pleased with our outstanding start to the year, as Amneal generated record levels of revenues in the first quarter. For the first time, all three segments across our diversified business produced double-digit top-line growth in the same quarter. With perpetual and rising demand for medicines and exacerbated by chronic supply shortages in the U.S. pharmaceutical industry, Amneal is part of the solution. As we become larger, we provide even more patients with access to high-quality, affordable, and essential medicines as we create value for all our stakeholders,\" said Chirag and Chintu Patel, Co-Chief Executive Officers.\n\nFirst Quarter 2024 Results\n\nNet revenue in the first quarter of 2024 was $659 million, an increase of 18% compared to $558 million in the first quarter of 2023. Generics revenues increased 14% due to strong performance in complex generics, our oncology biosimilars and new launches. Specialty revenues increased 15% driven by promoted products in Neurology and Endocrinology. AvKARE revenues increased 33% driven by continued expansion across its channels due to new products.\n\nNet loss attributable to Amneal Pharmaceuticals, Inc. was $92 million in the first quarter of 2024 compared to $7 million in the first quarter of 2023, and included a pre-tax charge of $94 million for settlement in principle on a nationwide opioids settlement.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA in the first quarter of 2024 was $152 million, an increase of 31% compared to the first quarter of 2023, reflective of strong revenue performance and higher gross margins.\n\nDiluted loss per share in the first quarter of 2024 was $0.30 compared to $0.05 for the first quarter of 2023 due to the aforementioned factors. Adjusted diluted earnings per share in the first quarter of 2024 was $0.14 compared to $0.12 for the first quarter of 2023.\n\nThe Company presents GAAP and adjusted (non-GAAP) quarterly results. Please refer to the \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" section for more information. In the tables below, GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations are presented.\n\nSettlement in Principle on a Nationwide Opioids Settlement\n\nAmneal has reached a settlement in principle on the primary financial terms, with no admission of wrongdoing, for a nationwide resolution to the opioids cases that have been filed and that might have been filed against the Company by states, counties, municipalities, and Native American Tribal Nations across the United States. The settlement in principle resolves substantially all opioids litigation and is subject to the negotiation and execution of a definitive settlement agreement between the parties. The settlement would be payable over ten years. Under the settlement, the Company would agree to pay $92.5 million in cash and provide $180.0 million in naloxone nasal spray (valued at $125 per two-pack) to help treat opioid overdoses. In lieu of receiving product, the settling parties can opt to receive 25% of the product value (up to $45.0 million) in cash during the last four years of the ten-year payment term.\n\nIn the first quarter of 2024, the Company recorded a charge of $94 million in the consolidated statement of operations based on full participation in the potential settlement, which reflects the value of the cash payments and the supply of naloxone nasal spray over the ten-year period. The settlement in principle is contingent upon a sufficient number of settling parties electing to opt into the final definitive agreement. We remain committed to helping those impacted by the opioid crisis by enhancing access to naloxone nasal spray, which is an emergency treatment for opioid overdose and helps save lives.\n\nAffirming Full Year 2024 Guidance\n\nThe Company is affirming its previously provided full year 2024 guidance.\n\nNet revenue\n\n$2.55 billion - $2.65 billion\n\nAdjusted EBITDA (1)\n\n$580 million - $620 million\n\nAdjusted diluted EPS (2)\n\n$0.53 - $0.63\n\nOperating cash flow (3)\n\n$260 million - $300 million\n\nCapital expenditures\n\n$60 million - $70 million\n\n(1)\n\nIncludes 100% of Adjusted EBITDA from the AvKARE acquisition.\n\n(2)\n\nAccounts for 35% non-controlling interest in AvKARE. Assumes weighted-average diluted shares outstanding of approximately 317 million for the year ending December 31, 2024.\n\n(3)\n\nDoes not contemplate one-time and non-recurring items such as legal settlements and other discrete items.\n\nAmneal's 2024 estimates are based on management's current expectations, including with respect to prescription trends, pricing levels, the timing of future product launches, the costs incurred and benefits realized of restructuring activities, and our long-term strategy. The Company's financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"GAAP\"). The Company cannot provide a reconciliation between non-GAAP projections and the most directly comparable measures in accordance with GAAP without unreasonable efforts because it is unable to predict with reasonable certainty the ultimate outcome of certain significant items required for the reconciliation. The items include, but are not limited to, acquisition-related expenses, restructuring expenses and benefits, asset impairments, legal settlements, and other gains and losses. These items are uncertain, depend on various factors, and could have a material impact on GAAP reported results.\n\nConference Call Information\n\nAmneal will host a conference call and live webcast at 8:30 am Eastern Time today, May 3, 2024, to discuss its results. The live webcast and presentation will be accessible through the Investor Relations section of the Company's website at https://investors.amneal.com.

Such forward-looking statements include statements regarding management's intentions, plans, beliefs, expectations, financial results, or forecasts for the future, including among other things: discussions of future operations; expected or estimated operating results and financial performance; and statements regarding our positioning, including our ability to drive sustainable long-term growth, and other non-historical statements. Words such as \"plans,\" \"expects,\" \"will,\" \"anticipates,\" \"estimates,\" and similar words, or the negatives thereof, are intended to identify estimates and forward-looking statements.\n\nThe reader is cautioned not to rely on these forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are based on current expectations of future events, including with respect to future market conditions, company performance and financial results, operational investments, business prospects, new strategies and growth initiatives, the competitive environment, and other events. If the underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize, actual results could vary materially from the expectations and projections of the Company.\n\nSuch risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to: our ability to successfully develop, license, acquire and commercialize new products on a timely basis; the competition we face in the pharmaceutical industry from brand and generic drug product companies, and the impact of that competition on our ability to set prices; our ability to obtain exclusive marketing rights for our products; our revenues are derived from the sales of a limited number of products, a substantial portion of which are through a limited number of customers; the impact of a prolonged business interruption within our supply chain; the continuing trend of consolidation of certain customer groups; our dependence on third-party suppliers and distributors for raw materials for our products and certain finished goods; legal, regulatory and legislative efforts by our brand competitors to deter competition from our generic alternatives; our dependence on information technology systems and infrastructure and the potential for cybersecurity incidents; our ability to attract, hire and retain highly skilled personnel; risks related to federal regulation of arrangements between manufacturers of branded and generic products; our reliance on certain licenses to proprietary technologies from time to time; the significant amount of resources we expend on research and development; the risk of claims brought against us by third parties; risks related to changes in the regulatory environment, including U.S. federal and state laws related to healthcare fraud abuse and health information privacy and security and changes in such laws; changes to Food and Drug Administration product approval requirements; the impact of healthcare reform and changes in coverage and reimbursement levels by governmental authorities and other third-party payers; our dependence on third-party agreements for a portion of our product offerings; our substantial amount of indebtedness and our ability to generate sufficient cash to service our indebtedness in the future, and the impact of interest rate fluctuations on such indebtedness; our potential expansion into additional international markets subjecting us to increased regulatory, economic, social and political uncertainties; our ability to identify, make and integrate acquisitions or investments in complementary businesses and products on advantageous terms; the impact of global economic, political or other catastrophic events; our obligations under a tax receivable agreement may be significant; and the high concentration of ownership of our Class A common stock and the fact that we are controlled by the Amneal Group. The forward-looking statements contained herein are also subject generally to other risks and uncertainties that are described from time to time in the Company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including under Item 1A, \"Risk Factors\" in the Company's most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and in its subsequent reports on Forms 10-Q and 8-K. Investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date they are made. Forward-looking statements included herein speak only as of the date hereof and we undertake no obligation to revise or update such statements to reflect the occurrence of events or circumstances after the date hereof.\n\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\n\nThis release includes certain non-GAAP financial measures, including EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income and adjusted diluted EPS, which are intended as supplemental measures of the Company's performance that are not required by or presented in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted diluted EPS reflects diluted earnings per share based on adjusted net income, which is net loss adjusted to (A) exclude (i) non-cash interest, (ii) GAAP provision for income taxes, (iii) amortization, (iv) stock-based compensation, (v) acquisition, site closure expenses, and idle facility expenses, (vi) restructuring and other charges, (vii) charges related to certain legal matters, including interest, net, (viii) asset impairment charges, (ix) change in fair value of contingent consideration, (x) increase in tax receivable agreement liability, (xi) system implementation expense, (xii) other and (xiii) net income attributable to non-controlling interests not associated with Class B common stock, and (B) include non-GAAP provision for income taxes. Non-GAAP adjusted diluted EPS for the three months ended March 31, 2024 was calculated using the weighted average fully diluted shares outstanding of Class A common stock. Non-GAAP adjusted diluted EPS for the three months ended March 31, 2023 was calculated using the weighted average diluted shares outstanding of Class A common stock and assuming all shares of Class B common stock were converted to shares of Class A common stock as of January 1, 2023.\n\nManagement uses these non-GAAP measures internally to evaluate and manage the Company's operations and to better understand its business because they facilitate a comparative assessment of the Company's operating performance relative to its performance based on results calculated under GAAP. These non-GAAP measures also isolate the effects of some items that vary from period to period without any correlation to core operating performance and eliminate certain charges that management believes do not reflect the Company's operations and underlying operational performance. The compensation committee of the Company's board of directors also uses certain of these measures to evaluate management's performance and set its compensation. The Company believes that these non-GAAP measures also provide useful information to investors regarding certain financial and business trends relating to the Company's financial condition and operating results facilitates an evaluation of the financial performance of the Company and its operations on a consistent basis. Providing this information therefore allows investors to make independent assessments of the Company's financial performance, results of operations and trends while viewing the information through the eyes of management.\n\nThese non-GAAP measures are subject to limitations. The non-GAAP measures presented in this release may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies because other companies may not calculate one or more in the same manner. Additionally, the non-GAAP performance measures exclude significant expenses and income that are required by GAAP to be recorded in the Company's financial statements; do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, working capital needs; and do not reflect interest expense, or the requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on debt. Further, our historical adjusted results are not intended to project our adjusted results of operations or financial position for any future period. To compensate for these limitations, management presents and considers these non-GAAP measures in conjunction with the Company's GAAP results; no non-GAAP measure should be considered in isolation from or as alternatives to any measure determined in accordance with GAAP. Readers should review the reconciliations included below, and should not rely on any single financial measure to evaluate the Company's business.\n\nA reconciliation of each historical non-GAAP measure to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is set forth below.\n\nAmneal Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\n\nConsolidated Statements of Operations\n\n(unaudited;

For the first time, all three segments across our diversified business produced double-digit top-line growth in the same quarter. With perpetual and rising demand for medicines and exacerbated by chronic supply shortages in the U.S. pharmaceutical industry, Amneal is part of the solution. As we become larger, we provide even more patients with access to high-quality, affordable, and essential medicines as we create value for all our stakeholders,\" said Chirag and Chintu Patel, Co-Chief Executive Officers.\n\nNet revenue in the first quarter of 2024 was $659 million, an increase of 18% compared to $558 million in the first quarter of 2023. Generics revenues increased 14% due to strong performance in complex generics, our oncology biosimilars and new launches. Specialty revenues increased 15% driven by promoted products in Neurology and Endocrinology. AvKARE revenues increased 33% driven by continued expansion across its channels due to new products.\n\nNet loss attributable to Amneal Pharmaceuticals, Inc. was $92 million in the first quarter of 2024 compared to $7 million in the first quarter of 2023, and included a pre-tax charge of $94 million for settlement in principle on a nationwide opioids settlement.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA in the first quarter of 2024 was $152 million, an increase of 31% compared to the first quarter of 2023, reflective of strong revenue performance and higher gross margins.\n\nDiluted loss per share in the first quarter of 2024 was $0.30 compared to $0.05 for the first quarter of 2023 due to the aforementioned factors. Adjusted diluted earnings per share in the first quarter of 2024 was $0.14 compared to $0.12 for the first quarter of 2023.\n\nThe Company presents GAAP and adjusted (non-GAAP) quarterly results. Please refer to the \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" section for more information. In the tables below, GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations are presented.\n\nSettlement in Principle on a Nationwide Opioids Settlement\n\nAmneal has reached a settlement in principle on the primary financial terms, with no admission of wrongdoing, for a nationwide resolution to the opioids cases that have been filed and that might have been filed against the Company by states, counties, municipalities, and Native American Tribal Nations across the United States. The settlement in principle resolves substantially all opioids litigation and is subject to the negotiation and execution of a definitive settlement agreement between the parties. The settlement would be payable over ten years. Under the settlement, the Company would agree to pay $92.5 million in cash and provide $180.0 million in naloxone nasal spray (valued at $125 per two-pack) to help treat opioid overdoses. In lieu of receiving product, the settling parties can opt to receive 25% of the product value (up to $45.0 million) in cash during the last four years of the ten-year payment term.\n\nIn the first quarter of 2024, the Company recorded a charge of $94 million in the consolidated statement of operations based on full participation in the potential settlement, which reflects the value of the cash payments and the supply of naloxone nasal spray over the ten-year period. The settlement in principle is contingent upon a sufficient number of settling parties electing to opt into the final definitive agreement. We remain committed to helping those impacted by the opioid crisis by enhancing access to naloxone nasal spray, which is an emergency treatment for opioid overdose and helps save lives.\n\nAffirming Full Year 2024 Guidance\n\nThe Company is affirming its previously provided full year 2024 guidance.\n\nAmneal's 2024 estimates are based on management's current expectations, including with respect to prescription trends, pricing levels, the timing of future product launches, the costs incurred and benefits realized of restructuring activities, and our long-term strategy. The Company's financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"GAAP\"). The Company cannot provide a reconciliation between non-GAAP projections and the most directly comparable measures in accordance with GAAP without unreasonable efforts because it is unable to predict with reasonable certainty the ultimate outcome of certain significant items required for the reconciliation. The items include, but are not limited to, acquisition-related expenses, restructuring expenses and benefits, asset impairments, legal settlements, and other gains and losses. These items are uncertain, depend on various factors, and could have a material impact on GAAP reported results.\n\nConference Call Information\n\nAmneal will host a conference call and live webcast at 8:30 am Eastern Time today, May 3, 2024, to discuss its results.

Such forward-looking statements include statements regarding management's intentions, plans, beliefs, expectations, financial results, or forecasts for the future, including among other things: discussions of future operations; expected or estimated operating results and financial performance; and statements regarding our positioning, including our ability to drive sustainable long-term growth, and other non-historical statements. Words such as \"plans,\" \"expects,\" \"will,\" \"anticipates,\" \"estimates,\" and similar words, or the negatives thereof, are intended to identify estimates and forward-looking statements.\n\nThe reader is cautioned not to rely on these forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are based on current expectations of future events, including with respect to future market conditions, company performance and financial results, operational investments, business prospects, new strategies and growth initiatives, the competitive environment, and other events. If the underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize, actual results could vary materially from the expectations and projections of the Company.\n\nSuch risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to: our ability to successfully develop, license, acquire and commercialize new products on a timely basis; the competition we face in the pharmaceutical industry from brand and generic drug product companies, and the impact of that competition on our ability to set prices; our ability to obtain exclusive marketing rights for our products; our revenues are derived from the sales of a limited number of products, a substantial portion of which are through a limited number of customers; the impact of a prolonged business interruption within our supply chain; the continuing trend of consolidation of certain customer groups; our dependence on third-party suppliers and distributors for raw materials for our products and certain finished goods; legal, regulatory and legislative efforts by our brand competitors to deter competition from our generic alternatives; our dependence on information technology systems and infrastructure and the potential for cybersecurity incidents; our ability to attract, hire and retain highly skilled personnel; risks related to federal regulation of arrangements between manufacturers of branded and generic products; our reliance on certain licenses to proprietary technologies from time to time; the significant amount of resources we expend on research and development; the risk of claims brought against us by third parties; risks related to changes in the regulatory environment, including U.S. federal and state laws related to healthcare fraud abuse and health information privacy and security and changes in such laws; changes to Food and Drug Administration product approval requirements; the impact of healthcare reform and changes in coverage and reimbursement levels by governmental authorities and other third-party payers; our dependence on third-party agreements for a portion of our product offerings; our substantial amount of indebtedness and our ability to generate sufficient cash to service our indebtedness in the future, and the impact of interest rate fluctuations on such indebtedness; our potential expansion into additional international markets subjecting us to increased regulatory, economic, social and political uncertainties; our ability to identify, make and integrate acquisitions or investments in complementary businesses and products on advantageous terms; the impact of global economic, political or other catastrophic events; our obligations under a tax receivable agreement may be significant; and the high concentration of ownership of our Class A common stock and the fact that we are controlled by the Amneal Group. The forward-looking statements contained herein are also subject generally to other risks and uncertainties that are described from time to time in the Company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including under Item 1A, \"Risk Factors\" in the Company's most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and in its subsequent reports on Forms 10-Q and 8-K. Investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date they are made. Forward-looking statements included herein speak only as of the date hereof and we undertake no obligation to revise or update such statements to reflect the occurrence of events or circumstances after the date hereof.\n\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\n\nThis release includes certain non-GAAP financial measures, including EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income and adjusted diluted EPS, which are intended as supplemental measures of the Company's performance that are not required by or presented in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted diluted EPS reflects diluted earnings per share based on adjusted net income, which is net loss adjusted to (A) exclude (i) non-cash interest, (ii) GAAP provision for income taxes, (iii) amortization, (iv) stock-based compensation, (v) acquisition, site closure expenses, and idle facility expenses, (vi) restructuring and other charges, (vii) charges related to certain legal matters, including interest, net, (viii) asset impairment charges, (ix) change in fair value of contingent consideration, (x) increase in tax receivable agreement liability, (xi) system implementation expense, (xii) other and (xiii) net income attributable to non-controlling interests not associated with Class B common stock, and (B) include non-GAAP provision for income taxes. Non-GAAP adjusted diluted EPS for the three months ended March 31, 2024 was calculated using the weighted average fully diluted shares outstanding of Class A common stock. Non-GAAP adjusted diluted EPS for the three months ended March 31, 2023 was calculated using the weighted average diluted shares outstanding of Class A common stock and assuming all shares of Class B common stock were converted to shares of Class A common stock as of January 1, 2023.\n\nManagement uses these non-GAAP measures internally to evaluate and manage the Company's operations and to better understand its business because they facilitate a comparative assessment of the Company's operating performance relative to its performance based on results calculated under GAAP. These non-GAAP measures also isolate the effects of some items that vary from period to period without any correlation to core operating performance and eliminate certain charges that management believes do not reflect the Company's operations and underlying operational performance. The compensation committee of the Company's board of directors also uses certain of these measures to evaluate management's performance and set its compensation. The Company believes that these non-GAAP measures also provide useful information to investors regarding certain financial and business trends relating to the Company's financial condition and operating results facilitates an evaluation of the financial performance of the Company and its operations on a consistent basis. Providing this information therefore allows investors to make independent assessments of the Company's financial performance, results of operations and trends while viewing the information through the eyes of management.\n\nThese non-GAAP measures are subject to limitations. The non-GAAP measures presented in this release may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies because other companies may not calculate one or more in the same manner. Additionally, the non-GAAP performance measures exclude significant expenses and income that are required by GAAP to be recorded in the Company's financial statements; do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, working capital needs; and do not reflect interest expense, or the requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on debt. Further, our historical adjusted results are not intended to project our adjusted results of operations or financial position for any future period. To compensate for these limitations, management presents and considers these non-GAAP measures in conjunction with the Company's GAAP results; no non-GAAP measure should be considered in isolation from or as alternatives to any measure determined in accordance with GAAP. Readers should review the reconciliations included below, and should not rely on any single financial measure to evaluate the Company's business.\n\nA reconciliation of each historical non-GAAP measure to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is set forth below.\n\nAmneal Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\n\nConsolidated Statements of Operations\n\n(unaudited;

Alternatively, the settling parties could opt to receive cash payments for 25% of the product value -- up to $45.0 million -- during the last four years of the ten-year payment term, the company said.\n\nAmneal produces several generic opioid products. A multi-state coalition of attorneys general claimed that the drugmaker knowingly failed to monitor and report suspicious orders placed by its customers, as it was required to by federal law.\n\nIt was one of the largest manufacturers of opioids from 2006 to 2019, selling nearly nine billion pills, New York Attorney General Letitia James said in a statement.\n\n\"Amneal became one of the largest generic pharmaceutical companies in the world by profiting off the sale of dangerous opioids,\" James said. \"While this settlement can't fully reverse the damage done as a result of the national crisis, it will provide essential funding and resources for New York and other states to ensure those suffering get the help they need.\n\nAccording to Amneal, the proposed settlement will depend on a sufficient number of parties agreeing to its final terms.\n\nMany drugmakers, distributors and pharmacies, from Johnson & Johnson to Walmart, have agreed to pay billions in dollars to settle claims by states and local governments that they contributed to the devastating and ongoing U.S. opioid epidemic.\n\nEvery day, more than 130 people in the country die from opioid-related drug overdoses, according to the U.S. Health Resources & Services Administration. The agency says increased prescriptions for opioid medications like oxycodone and hydrocodone have led to widespread misuse of both prescription and non-prescription opioids.\n\nThe negotiations with Amneal were led by California, New York, Delaware, Tennessee, Utah, and Virginia, in coordination with an executive committee consisting of attorneys general from Colorado, Idaho, Illinois, Massachusetts, North Carolina, Ohio, and Oregon.\n\nIn addition to the financial terms, the final settlement also remains contingent on Amneal agreeing to change critical business practices, according to the California attorney general.\n\n\"Today, I am thinking of the countless families and communities impacted by the opioid epidemic. I can't begin to imagine the immense pain they have been through,\" California Attorney General Rob Bonta said in a statement. \"At the California Department of Justice, we will continue to hold accountable those that fueled this public health crisis.\"", "source": {"uri": "courthousenews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Court House News Service"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Amneal Announces Over $270M In US Opioid Lawsuit Settlement By Benzinga", "body": "Friday, Amneal Pharmaceuticals Inc (NASDAQ:AMRX) announced a significant agreement valued at over $270 million to settle claims related to its alleged contribution to the opioid crisis in the U.S.\n\nThis move positions Amneal as the latest pharmaceutical company to resolve lawsuits brought forth by states, local governments, and Native American tribes concerning the addiction epidemic.\n\nAs part of the deal, Amneal has agreed in principle to pay $92.5 million in cash and provide $180 million worth of naloxone nasal spray, an essential medication for treating opioid overdoses.\n\nThe agreement, payable over a decade, aims to address a substantial portion of the more than 900 opioid-related lawsuits facing the company, Reuters noted.\n\nReuters adds that the settlement further contributes to the growing sum of over $51 billion that various stakeholders, including drug manufacturers, distributors, pharmacy operators, and consultants, have agreed to pay to settle lawsuits and investigations related to their involvement in the opioid addiction and overdose crisis.\n\nState attorneys general have accused Amneal of inadequately monitoring and reporting suspicious orders of generic opioid medications by its customers.\n\nAllegations suggest that the company distributed nearly nine billion pills from 2006 to 2019, further exacerbating the crisis.\n\n\"Amneal became one of the largest generic pharmaceutical companies in the world by profiting off the sale of dangerous opioids,\" Reuters noted, citing New York Attorney General Letitia James.\n\nFriday, Amneal Pharmaceuticals reported first-quarter adjusted EPS of $0.14, up from $0.12 a year ago, beating the consensus of $0.09.\n\nThe company reported sales of $659.2 million, up 8%, beating the consensus of $619.03 million.\n\nGenerics revenues increased by 14% due to strong performance in complex generics, oncology biosimilars, and new launches.\n\nSpecialty revenues increased by 15%, driven by promoted products in neurology and endocrinology.\n\nAvKARE revenues increased 33%, driven by continued expansion across its channels due to new products.\n\nGuidance: Amneal reaffirms fiscal year 2024 revenue guidance of $2.55 billion-$2.65 billion versus the consensus of $2.60 billion, with an adjusted EPS of $0.53-$0.63 compared to

Gavin Newsom and state health officials announced a deal with this same company to procure naloxone, the overdose reversal medication, at a cheaper price than currently available. That agreement locks that state in as a long-term customer to the company.\n\nUnder the opioid settlement agreement that is yet to be finalized, Amneal will pay states a total of $92.5 million in cash and $180 million in naloxone products over a 10-year period.\n\nIn a statement, Amneal said the settlement would resolve all pending lawsuits filed by states against the company.The company did not admit any wrongdoing.\n\nBonta in a written statement said the settlement \"builds on our efforts to heal our communities and respond to this epidemic from all angles, from recovery services to resources on prevention and treatment.\"\n\nNew York Attorney General Letitia James explicitly criticized the company in her statement about the settlement.\n\n\"Amneal became one of the largest generic pharmaceutical companies in the world by profiting off the sale of dangerous opioids,\" she said. According to James' office, Amneal sold nearly 9 billion pills between 2006 to 2019.\n\nTo date, California has secured $4.25 billion in opioid settlement funds from drug companies for their alleged role in fueling the opioid epidemic. The state uses the money on opioid remediation programs, such as distributing naloxone and training substance use providers.\n\nSince 2018, the state has been purchasing the overdose reversal medication and distributing it to schools, law enforcement, county health departments and community harm reduction programs.\n\nStarting this month, California will be able to buy more naloxone because of the lower price it secured from Amneal: $24 for a two-unit nasal spray pack instead of the current price of $41.\n\nIn a statement, the Department of Health Care Access and Information, which is overseeing the naloxone contract, said it learned that Amneal was named in opioid litigation as it vetted proposals.\n\n\"In making its decision to select Amneal for the naloxone program, CalRx prioritized factors such as price, time to market, and ability to meet the anticipated volume demands in California, understanding that more efficiency means more lives saved,\" Andrew DiLuccia, a spokesperson for the department said in an email.\n\n\"Ultimately, the $24 CalRx naloxone price from Amneal represents a groundbreaking deal that will enable California to scale its naloxone distribution and save more lives.

Without admitting wrongdoing, the company said will make payments over the next 10 years, including $92.5 million in cash and $180 million worth of naloxone, the generic name of Emergent BioSolutions' Narcan, a nasal spray that can quickly reverse the effects of an opioid overdose and restore breathing.\n\nInstead of accepting the product, parties can opt to receive 25% of the product's value up to $45 million over the last four years of the agreement, Amneal added. The company values a naloxone two-pack at $125.\n\n\"We remain committed to helping those impacted by the opioid crisis by enhancing access to naloxone nasal spray, which is an emergency treatment for opioid overdose and helps save lives,\" Amneal said in its annual report.\n\nThe settlement was revealed a few days after California announced it had made a deal with Amneal to purchase naloxone at a discounted price of $24 for a two-pack. The previous price California paid was $41 per two-pack.\n\nIn a release about the settlement on Friday, New York's attorney general, Letitia James, had pointed criticism for Amneal, which sold nearly nine million opioid pills from 2006 to 2019.\n\n\"Amneal became one of the largest generic pharmaceutical companies in the world by profiting off the sale of dangerous opioids,\" James said. \"While this settlement can't fully reverse the damage done as a result of the national crisis, it will provide essential funding and resources for New York and other states to ensure those suffering get the help they need.\"\n\nAmneal's agreement brings the settlement amount paid by drugmakers, distributors, pharmacies and consultants to more than $51 billion to resolve lawsuits in the U.S. related to the opioid crisis, Reuters said. California, for example, has received $4.25 billion, in the opioid settlements. New York has collected $2.7 billion.\n\nThe largest opioid settlement came in 2021 when Johnson & Johnson and three of the U.S.'s largest distributors -- AmerisourceBergen, Cardinal Health and McKesson -- agreed to pay $26 billion to seven states.

Separately, it's paying states to settle claims that it contributed to the nation's opioid epidemic.\n\nCalifornia Attorney General Rob Bonta on Friday announced a $273 million multistate settlement with New Jersey-based Amneal Pharmaceutical for the drug manufacturer's alleged failure to report suspicious opioid orders, and as a consequence contributing to the opioid epidemic.\n\nIf the name \"Amneal Pharmaceuticals\" rings a bell, it's because just days earlier Gov. Gavin Newsom and state health officials announced a deal with this same company to procure naloxone, the overdose reversal medication, at a cheaper price than currently available. That agreement locks that state in as a long-term customer to the company.\n\nUnder the opioid settlement agreement that is yet to be finalized, Amneal will pay states a total of $92.5 million in cash and $180 million in naloxone products over a 10-year period.\n\nIn a statement, Amneal said the settlement would resolve all pending lawsuits filed by states against the company.The company did not admit any wrongdoing.\n\nBonta in a written statement said the settlement \"builds on our efforts to heal our communities and respond to this epidemic from all angles, from recovery services to resources on prevention and treatment.\"\n\nNew York Attorney General Letitia James explicitly criticized the company in her statement about the settlement.\n\n\"Amneal became one of the largest generic pharmaceutical companies in the world by profiting off the sale of dangerous opioids,\" she said. According to James' office, Amneal sold nearly 9 billion pills between 2006 to 2019.\n\nTo date, California has secured $4.25 billion in opioid settlement funds from drug companies for their alleged role in fueling the opioid epidemic. The state uses the money on opioid remediation programs, such as distributing naloxone and training substance use providers.\n\nSince 2018, the state has been purchasing the overdose reversal medication and distributing it to schools, law enforcement, county health departments and community harm reduction programs.\n\nStarting this month, California will be able to buy more naloxone because of the lower price it secured from Amneal: $24 for a two-unit nasal spray pack instead of the current price of $41.\n\nIn a statement, the Department of Health Care Access and Information, which is overseeing the naloxone contract, said it learned that Amneal was named in opioid litigation as it vetted proposals.\n\n\"In making its decision to select Amneal for the naloxone program, CalRx prioritized factors such as price, time to market, and ability to meet the anticipated volume demands in California - understanding that more efficiency means more lives saved,\" Andrew DiLuccia, a spokesperson for the department said in an email.\n\n\"Ultimately, the $24 CalRx naloxone price from Amneal represents a groundbreaking deal that will enable California to scale its naloxone distribution and save more lives. Addressing the opioid crisis demands all participants be part of the solution.\"", "source": {"uri": "calmatters.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "CalMatters"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ana_b_ibarra@calmatters.org", "name": "Ana B.

I will now hand the call over to Chirag.\n\nChirag Patel: Thank you, Tony. Good morning to everyone. Our first quarter performance was outstanding. Record Q1 revenues of $659 million grew 18%. For the first time, all three of our segments generated double-digit growth in the same quarter. Q1 adjusted EBITDA of $152 million grew by 31% as strong execution continues to drive sustainably higher levels of profits. As momentum builds across Amneal, we are confident in our ability to achieve our financial commitments for 2024 and beyond. Our strategic vision for Amneal is to be a global, diversified pharmaceutical company that provides patients, providers, and payers with access to high quality, affordable, and essential medicines. In the United States, Amneal fills approximately 175 million prescriptions per year. In retail pharmacies, we provide complex genetics medicines such as transdermals, topicals, oral solids, and ophthalmics. For hospitals and clinics, we supply important acute care injectables where there are chronic shortages. In biosimilars, we are expanding access to oncology therapies and adding more to our portfolio. In Specialty, our innovative medicines advance the standard of care, such as in Parkinson's disease. In our AvKARE distribution business, we provide military veterans with access to high quality medicines. Globally, we are addressing unmet health care needs in developing and developed countries. As we continue to grow larger, Amneal is leading a new era of affordable medicines and having a significant societal impact. Nowhere in our commitment to this mission more evident than our recent approval of naloxone. Opioid overdose remains a US public health care emergency. We are expanding access to this critical rescue medicine as an OTC product at pharmacies and for the public interest through states and cities across the United States. We were pleased to finalize our partnership with the State of California with more to come. We are so proud that this essential life-saving medicine is made in America and manufactured here in New Jersey by Amneal. Let me now walk through our business at a high level where we remain confident in our strategy, our ability to execute well and drive growth, and the opportunity to have a tremendous impact. First, our affordable medicines business, which is our Generics segment, has consistently grown each year since 2019. We are seeing this growth accelerate in 2024, driven by our diverse portfolio of retail, injectables, and biosimilars. Amneal has a track record of quality, innovation, and customer service. Those hallmarks continue to resonate in the US pharmaceutical market, plagued by supply shortages with perpetual demand for high quality medicines. The durability of our complex portfolio and regular cadence of new launches each year position Amneal well to continue expanding our leadership position in affordable medicines and driving sustainable long term growth. In the retail pharmaceutical market, our portfolio of around 240 medicines is complex and diversified. With industry-wide supply chain disruption due to site inspections and manufacturer discontinuations, price erosion in the United States generic industry remains lower than it has been in several years. In injectables, we are expanding our portfolio and have a significant capacity to help address drug shortages in hospitals and clinics. Our injectable strategy focuses on providing unique, ready to use products like our recent launch of PEMRYDI RTU for the treatment of certain lung cancers. Across retail and injectables, we are on track to launch over 30 new products this year, following our record 39 new launches last year. In biosimilars, we are seeing the next wave of affordable medicines. From 2024 to 2028, an estimated $192 billion in annual branded biologics value will lose exclusivity. We expect most biosimilar markets to be less competitive, given the inherent complexities of these molecules and the investment required to bring them to market. Adoption rates for early biosimilars are now 80%, particularly in oncology where we operate. Our excellent commercial team is driving strong adoption at both community oncology and hospital integrated delivery networks. That, coupled with our pipeline and with trusted partners, gives us confidence in continued momentum. We are well on our way to achieving over $125 million of revenue in 2024, with $90 million in biosimilars revenue over the last 12 months. We look to in-license one to two biosimilars each year or more and to be vertically integrated over time. Internationally, we are continuing to expand our reach and build a strong foundation. This is happening most notably in India, where we are building a customized portfolio of therapies for unmet needs like critical care, ophthalmology, oncology and diagnostics. In other geographies, we are working with partners to register and commercialize select and new products. We expect international expansion will add $5,200 million revenues by 2027 and rapidly scale up to that. Next, in our Specialty business, we continue to make good progress with our key neurology and endocrinology branded products, as revenues are growing double digits. In Q1, we successfully launched Ongentys, an adjunctive therapy for Parkinson's disease, which we recently in-licensed to our specialty portfolio. Next up is IPX203, with our action date is on August 7. Carbidopa/levodopa has been the main therapy for Parkinson's disease for over five decades. We believe IPX203 meaningfully advances that standard of care with a broad application for all patients. In our AvKARE distribution business, we have more than doubled revenues and profits since our acquisition in 2020. We are expanding all three channels, distribution, government and unit dose, driven by new products from suppliers, including Amneal. We now expect over $650 million in our AvKARE revenue next year, as we expect this to remain a high growth business. In short, we're starting 2024 with very strong momentum. Our diversified growth profile is sustainable and our financial performance is accelerating remarkably. I'll now hand it to Chintu.\n\nChintu Patel: Good morning, everyone. Thank you, Chirag, and thank you to the global Amneal family who works hard every day to help make healthy possible. I will discuss how our core strengths in both operations and innovation provides us with a long runway for sustainable top and bottom line growth. First, quality has been at the center of everything we do since our founding in 2002. We continue to invest in quality through automation and AI technologies to advance our global infrastructure. Our success is also driven by our commitment to operational excellence, ongoing efficiency programs and a robust supply chain. All of our plans are FDA approved. In each plant, we are driving optimization and efficiency programs to maintain our exceptional customer service levels and gain cost efficiencies. Across our supply chain, we are focused on what we call the three Rs - redundancy, resiliency and reliability. In particular, drug shortages are an ongoing challenge in the market. The US FDA released 114 drug shortages, including 75 injectables. At Amneal, we look to be part of the solution. We have about 20 commercial and pipeline injectables that are on the shortage list, including oncology medicines. We have also tripled our injectables manufacturing capacity in recent years at multiple plants. We continue to prioritize efforts to help alleviate shortages in the market, particularly for injectables. Second, our track record in innovation is very strong, and we are off to a great start in 2024 with five key complex product launches, naloxone nasal spray, PEMRYDI RTU, carvedilol ER, FML eye drops, and generic Ciprodex. We currently have 86 new products, ANDAs pending, of which 63 are non-oral solids. In addition, we have 67 pipeline products, 94% of which are non-oral solids. With our ongoing shift towards complex innovations, we have improved our R&D efficiencies and are spending less internally, which allows us to allocate more investment towards external R&D over time. We were so proud of last week's approval of Naloxone nasal spray, a life-saving treatment for drug overdoses. This is a tremendous milestone for the entire team at Amneal. The product is now available through retail pharmacies as an OTC product and to states and counties across the US. We have built robust manufacturing capacity to make up to 10 million two-packs starting next year. We are significantly expanding access to help address the opioid crisis that impacts so many Americans. In injectables, we expect to launch over 10 new products this year, following the 14 new injectables we launched in 2023. Our R&D focus is on oncology, ready-to-use bags, and long-acting injectables. For years, we have been meeting with clinicians to understand their needs. This emphasis on the voice of the customer has allowed us to develop unique presentations of existing products. Last month, we launched our first 505(b)(2) injectable in PEMRYDI RTU. This new ready-to-use presentation of a frequently used oncology medicine can improve efficiency and reduce medication error. We look to launch two to three 505(b)(2) injectables each year with approximately 15 in development. Next, biosimilars continue to be a key area of strategic focus. Building on the success of our first three commercial products, we in-licensed two denosumab biosimilar candidates for Prolia and XGEVA in Q4. Those programs continue to progress with our development partner, mAbxience. In addition, we are pleased to share that, in Q1, we in-licensed two additional pegfilgrastim pipeline programs, on-body injector and pre-filled auto-injector. Today, approximately 30% to 40% of the pegfilgrastim market is on-body and fewer competitors are expected in this space. In total, we have three commercial biosimilars and four more under development, all in oncology. As we establish Amneal as a key biosimilar player, we look to add more opportunistic biosimilar molecules to our pipeline over time. Internationally, we have distribution partners in place for approximately 40 emerging market countries including strong markets like Saudi Arabia, Mexico, South Africa, and the Philippines. We are registering products globally, including in Europe, Canada, China, and emerging markets. In specialty, we are continuously evolving our R&D efforts to move up the value chain. First, our IPX203 complete response resubmission is under review. Also, we are advancing our DHE auto-injector program for migraine and cluster headache. We transfer production internally and are excited to complete our application later this year, which puts us in a good position to launch in the first half of next year, once approved. In addition, we continue to advance our pipeline with K-114 for endocrinology and other programs. We look to launch one to two specialty products each year going forward. Overall, Amneal is expanding and growing in the key areas of medicine, complex generics, injectables, biosimilars, international distribution and specialty branding. We are so deeply passionate about our company's mission and purpose and the good work that remains ahead. I will now pass it over to Tasos.\n\nTasos Konidaris: Thank you, Chintu. And good morning. At a high level, our diversified business is driving sustainable higher levels of revenues and profits and continued deleveraging. Our first quarter results were excellent with total net revenue of $659 million, up 18%. Q1 generics net revenue of $391 million grew 14%, driven by our diverse portfolio of complex products. Biosimilars generated $27 million in revenue, driven by ALYMSYS. New products launched in 2023 and 2024 added $19 million to Q1 revenue growth. In addition, the remaining base portfolio continued to grow due to the relevancy of our products, strong market demand, less pricing pressure and Amneal's high quality supply chain. Q1 Specialty net revenues of $105 million grew 15%, driven by double-digit growth of our key branded products, plus the recent launch of ONGENTYS in March. Q1 AvKARE net revenues of $163 million grew 33%, reflecting continued strong growth across all three customer channels, driven by new products. Our Q1 adjusted gross margins of 42% increased 250 basis points year-over-year and were ahead of our expectations. Strong gross margins were driven by the favorable mix of revenues that reflected the complexity of our portfolio combined with higher fixed overhead absorption. Q1 adjusted EBITDA of $152 million grew 31%, reflecting robust revenue growth, higher gross margins, tight management of operating expenses and a favorable comparison to prior year. Our leveraged growth profile in Q1 is a blueprint for sustainable higher P&L results for the company going forward. Q1 adjusted EPS of $0.14 grew 17%, driven by higher adjusted EBITDA, partially offset by interest costs. As a reminder, we have made substantial progress over the last four years driving accelerated top and bottom line growth, reducing leverage and resolving legacy matters. As a result, our annual adjusted EBITDA has increased from $339 million in 2019 to $594 million over the last 12 months ended Q1 2024. Also, net leverage has declined from 7.4 times in 2019 to 4.6 times now. As I mentioned earlier, settling legacy legal matters has been a priority of ours. Two years ago, we settled upon our ER litigation and we just made our final payment in Q1. In addition, today, we announced that we reached agreement in principle for a nationwide opioid settlement payable over 10 years that resolves substantially all opioid litigation. Accordingly, in the first quarter, we recorded a pre-tax charge of $94 million, which reflects cash payments in the supply of naloxone nasal spray bought over the next 10 years. As a result, we have now substantially resolved these two legacy legal matters, which removes these overhangs from the company. Given the strong start of the year and our improved visibility, including the recent naloxone approval, we're targeting the higher end of our full year outlook. As a reminder, we expect total net revenue of $2.550 billion to $2.650 billion and adjusted EBITDA of $580 million to $620 million, which reflects high-single-digit growth on both top and bottom line. With that, let me turn the call over to Chirag.\n\nChirag Patel: Thank you, Tasos. Amneal's Q1 performance was excellent across the board and reflects our continued upward trajectory in driving higher financial results over the years. We are so excited about the opportunities ahead. Let's now open the call for Q&A, Anthony.\n\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question is from Nathan Rich with Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS ).\n\nNathan Rich: Congratulations on a strong quarter. I maybe wanted to start with naloxone and specifically the California contract. Can you talk about when that contract starts and how long it is and any details you can share maybe on the type of volume commitment that the state made? Have you gotten additional interest from other states sort of on the back of that? Any comments on the margin profile of Naloxone maybe relative to the corporate average would be helpful.\n\nChirag Patel: California supply starts now and will see the increased demand as they ramp up our label. According to the state's press release, they could buy up to 3.2 million units per year. We don't expect them to buy that in the first year. They'll ramp it up as they go. So, somewhere between, we expect, 2 million to 3 million units in the State of California. The remaining contractual terms are confidential. It was a great win for us and we're very proud of the agreement with the State of California and trusting us to supply and valuing the made-in-the-United States product. So we really appreciate it. In terms of the margin profile, it is going to be higher and accretive than the current gross margins.\n\nChintu Patel: It's obviously not just the issue of the State of California. It's an issue across all our states and our commercial teams are actively engaged with other internal parties, both on the state and federal level. So really excited to kind of fill the incremental need that's going to provide for many years.\n\nChirag Patel: Yes. And we have built the capacity to supply 10 million units - up to 10 million units starting early next year. This year, we're producing somewhere between 2.5 million to 3 million units.\n\nNathan Rich: Maybe just a follow up on the cadence of earnings this year. Tasos, I know you kind of pointed to the high end of the range, but I think looking at the historical EBITDA cadence, I think 20% comes in the first quarter typically. Based on what you did this year, that would imply a number well above that kind of high end of the range. So, is there anything to kind of note on just earnings cadence this year that would be different than normal?\n\nTasos Konidaris: You take one quarter, you can never annualize this. So if you think about we finished the year last year with EBITDA of, what, $554 million, right? So we added Q1, so our run rate, right, the last run rate of the last four quarters now, it's almost $600 million, $594 million. So the year is playing out how we were hoping it would, which is acceleration of top and bottom line growth, right? So we're having some great, great improvement. So now we're targeting the high end of the range and you're saying, is there more, right? And you can count on us to try to maximize the performance. But at the same time, right, we're also focused on driving and making investments primarily now at R&D, primarily kind of tuck-in licensing deals, the biosimilar and complex drugs to not just maximize this year or the next, but build a long term growth for 2026, 2027. So you're not missing anything. The only thing we're going to be mindful is we want to make sure we have room in our operating expenses to make investments over the next, call it, nine months, primarily in R&D. And then also, depending how things play out with IPX203, kind of making sure we kind of make the right investments there to drive that growth as quickly as possible.\n\nOperator: The next question is from Leszek Sulewski with Truist Securities.\n\nLeszek Sulewski: Can you just provide some initial update commentary on ONGENTYS, given the new ownership structure, perhaps some feedback from prescribers? And then also on PEMRYDI? And I had a follow-up.\n\nChirag Patel: We're turning it over to Mr. Joe Renda here.\n\nJoe Renda: So far, we've been very pleased with ONGENTYS, as well as the partnership with BIAL. It's been a great partnership, and we've been working very closely with them and their global team, executing upon the strategies that they've learned from over the years. I would say probably the three pieces of feedback that would be significant would be, one, we are hearing very positive feedback from prescribers. There was a concern that ONGENTYS would not be remaining in the market, so prescribers were very pleased when they heard we were going to be taking over this brand. And we've been able to sign on a few more contracts from an access standpoint. So our goal there is to increase the access, the market access that is, for ONGENTYS in the market beyond what it was. And so far, we've been very pleased with that performance and progress. And finally, I would say one of the things we're looking at closely to kind of determine the uptick is what our NBRx performance has been, new patients to brand. And we're up some 20% in NBRxs from a performance standpoint. So far, we're very pleased, and it's been a great partnership, and it's also been a really good augmentation to Rytary.\n\nChirag Patel: Les, you had a question on the PEMRYDI RTU. The way to think about that for Amneal, right, it's another complex innovation. On the injectable side, it's our first 505(b)(2) launch. We'll do two to three a year going forward. And it's a ready-to-use oncology therapy that reduces steps. So think of it as a new factor of growth for the company.\n\nLeszek Sulewski: Now, moving on to IPX203 and with your action date circled for August 7th, can you just talk about perhaps your launch readiness, your plans with the sales force, and just overall impact potential guidance, if any?\n\nJoe Renda: Les, first of all, I would say one of the things that is significant for us is we've really become a leader in the Parkinson's space. Rytary has enabled us to develop and deepen relationships with key prescribers and movement disorder specialists across the country, really around the world for that matter. And that also is coupled with the fact that we've developed a market access capability that has created an access stream for Rytary that's the best in the Parkinson's community. So we enjoy some 70% commercial coverage and about 60 or so percent of the Part D coverage. The ONGENTYS that I just spoke to has enabled us to actually increase our prescriber base. So we're going deeper now into general neurologists. So when you look at our go-to-market strategy with IPX, the three components there are, one, leveraging and working off of those deep relationships that we've built over the last decade in the Parkinson's community. And then second is to leverage that market access capability that we have. We'll use that same strategy to gain access for IPX203, comparable to what we have with Rytary. Finally, I would say that the novel formulation that is IPX203 really offers greater efficacy, better on time, fewer dosing. So the Parkinson's community itself is very excited. In fact, just last night, we were at a Parkinson's Foundation gala and there was a lot of buzz and talk about when IPX203 is coming to market. So we're very ready and eager to get IPX203 to the hands of the patients that need it out there.\n\nChirag Patel: Les, in terms of potential of peak revenues assuming approval. We continue to feel great about it. So the number that we - Rytary right now, there's a couple hundred million dollars in annual revenues, right? The guidance we have given about IPX203 is peak revenues of $300 million to $500 million. We think based on the product profile and the fact that IPX203 is only being used by about 5% of the available patients - Rytary, I'm sorry. So there is a tremendous market opportunity out there for the remaining 95% of the market that's not been utilizing Rytary. And I think our peak year revenue is $300 million to $500 million. I think it's just well within what the team is capable.\n\nOperator: The next question is from David Amsellem with Piper Sandler.\n\nDavid Amsellem: Just have a few questions. Wanted to drill down on the $100 million plus in new product revenue in 2024. Can you talk about the mix between retail and injectable contribution in that $100 million? That's number one. Number two is how much of the injectable contribution is coming from shortage products versus complex products? So that's another question. Also, switching gears to ALYMSYS, the bevacizumab biosimilar, can you just talk about the dynamics here that are driving the strong sales? Is it a limited competition in the market? Are there other things at play here? And just talk about your expectations for that product and what informs your $100 million plus in sales by 2025.\n\nChintu Patel: New product launches, let's just go back a little bit. Last five years, if you go by the NPLs and you total that to this year's revenue is about $765 million we have added in new product launches. And what we see going forward - and this is just within generics injectables and biosimilars. We can break it down for you later on, but stay on the bigger picture is that why we are able to grow this and why in the United States this business - this is just a US number. Internationals are separate. Why this is a big deal? Because I think it's for - over time, people have been focused on price erosion and have ignored the entire biggest market for the affordable medicines is United States and we now expect the next four years - if you annualize our revenue of next four years from - in 2028, that would be additional $800 million to $1 billion added to NPLs. And you know we've been working on such a strong pipeline and in-licensing strong products. On page 7 of our presentation, we have listed out many of them, like 60 products being launched in 2024 and 2025. 15 of them are high value. So you can see more and more high values are happening as you go year out. And we have not disclosed certain pipeline assets for competitive reasons, as well as we have not disclosed some of the in-licensing products that we have or working on it for competitive reasons. So very excited to - and these are risk adjusted number I gave you. So this $100 million is - the breakdown we can provide you later on between the...\n\nTasos Konidaris: I can provide. So $100 million, it's a combination of a couple things. Combination of products, if you remember last year, towards the end of Q4, quite a number of new products, close to I think 13 or so products were approved in Q4 of last year. So that's kind of the annualization of those revenues, as well as new product launches this year. So that $100 million number, it's not a certainty, but a high degree of confidence, point number one. When you break it out between retail and injectable, it's pretty much almost like 50-50, 60-40 between - so it's evenly split. Retail products like Naloxone, right, on one side, injectable products like PEMRYDI and the remaining of the other smaller injectable products. So it's evenly split between retail and injectables.\n\nChirag Patel: Your next question on shortages versus regular. Shortages make up very small numbers at this point. It's our regular products that we've been expanding the market, so demand is coming our way because we are the best quality and consistent supplier out in the market. So our customers are trusting us and more and more trust has been established. Your question regarding ALYMSYS, we have a very strong team. The commercial team has done a superb job. Amneal reputation, Amneal's basket of 300 products, we bring a lot more to the table for our customers than if you're a pure play biosimilar. So this is why I believe, for the future, you will see the companies being more successful who have a broader portfolio and who are working closely, whether it's oncologists, the community oncologists, or the hospitals, or the PBMs because we provide tremendous value to them. So we have a better negotiating powers with them or advantages versus the pure play biosimilars. And we are going to keep improving those. So, ALYMSYS, you will see even higher market share coming up. As well as Fylnetra, when we add OBI, you will start seeing the uptake on the market share as well.\n\nDavid Amsellem: Just to clarify, the $100 million does not include naloxone. I think I saw a footnote for that in the slides, but I just want to make sure that's correct, the $100 million does not include naloxone.\n\nJoe Renda: David, that's correct. The estimate we had on the Q4 call and reiterate, $30 million plus for naloxone, $100 million is for the rest of the NPLs this year.\n\nChintu Patel: David, you can see the five - my brother mentioned five already launched, which are good value products, complex.\n\nOperator: The next question is from Balaji Prasad with Barclays (LON: BARC ).\n\nBalaji Prasad: Congratulations on the results. Couple of questions from me. Starting with the Generic side, I was slightly surprised to see Amneal's Para IV on XIFAXAN. Bausch has been vehemently defending this from years versus a host of generic companies settled there. So how differentiated is your Para IV versus others? How realistic of an opportunity is this versus any other generic company? And similar question on the Restasis too. For years, generic companies have flagged this as an opportunity and struggle to get approval for their version, how should we think about it? Secondly, on AvKARE, I saw that versus last quarter's presentation where you had the long-term guide at $600 million, you raised it to $650 million. What drove that increase in revenue guidance and what is the EBITDA impact of it?\n\nChintu Patel: So on rifaximin, we always work on very unique and key products and we do have a position. It's something confidential. I don't want to get into the detail. We're excited about rifaximin opportunity. But it remains to be seen how it develops. There are multiple things that is involved. So we cannot comment at this time on any of the details. On Restasis, yeah, it is a very complex product. We are advancing our ANDA and we are expected to launch Restasis next year in 2025. We are very hopeful on that.\n\nChirag Patel: On your AvKARE question, Balaji, is - yeah, it is growing really well. And the lord of government product, VA, DOD has - this is the advantage for - you get some advantage being American company and having manufacturing capacity in America. So we're taking a full advantage of that and this is why you see the growth in AvKARE and it would continue to grow.\n\nTasos Konidaris: Balaji, can you just repeat your other question?\n\nBalaji Prasad: The impact of AvKARE and EBITDA, what I'm also trying to figure out is, with your last 12-months revenue, EBITDA already being close to $590 million and with a stronger revenue trajectory looking that much clearer for us now, what are the upside-downside risks towards the higher end of your EBITDA guidance? And if the AvKARE long-term guidance rate is - and what's the impact of AvKARE guidance raise on the EBITDA too?\n\nTasos Konidaris: What happens is, AvKARE has been growing along with the rest of the business. So we're not relying on any specific segment, whether or not it's Generic, AvKARE, Specialty, biosimilars to kind of carry the day. So our growth continues to be across all our businesses. Point number one. Point number two is, the upsides and downsides of the business is, we continue to rely on new product launches, robust new product approvals and launches to kind of carry the day. So we're not always in control of that. So that depends, as you know, with the regulatory authorities. So some years may be ahead of plan, some years may be a little delayed, but all of those will come. But the cadence of it is not totally in our control. So that's something we just want to be mindful of, number one. Number two is IPX203. So as we discussed, the vast majority of the potential launch expenses of IPX203 are built into our existing guidance, right? So that way we are conservative. If we get approval, then we will have to look at, I think, an incremental top and bottom line contribution of that revenue. So, the downside is protected, the upside has not been built in. And AvKARE just continues to grow nicely. So hopefully that gives you a sense. The final thing I would say is the type of investments we choose to make, right, to kind of drive. So a lot of it is variable, it's within our control. So if we think the year plays out incredibly well, we may choose to make some additional investments. If the year is playing a little tighter than we thought, we may just kind of push back a couple potential deals.\n\nChintu Patel: The momentum, Balaji, has been strong, as you can see, the six key products have been approved already. So, we feel very good on it, how the momentum is great and the pipeline is delivering.\n\nChris Schott: Just a couple for me. Maybe first on biosimilar Prolia and XGEVA. Can you just elaborate a little bit more on the opportunity for these two. And maybe just specifically launch timelines in light of the recent Sandoz (SIX: SDZ ) settlement, and of the two brands, is it either more interesting to you than the other, just given obviously different market dynamics between the two of them. Second question, naloxone, between the public market and retail channel, what are you seeing as the bigger opportunity and does the opioid settlement at all impact how you think about that? Kust finally, AvKARE, obviously great performance here, but just interested in your latest thoughts on potential to monetize that business and how you're thinking about that.\n\nChintu Patel: Let's start with biosimilars, Prolia and XGEVA, we are equipped to sell in both channels, the onco channel as well as PBM. We expect the launch in 2026, maybe a bit early. We will see how the filing - I think one is early, one is going to be a little bit later. And we expect. We expect the market penetration to be very good because we already have established relationship and by then we'll have more established relationship with the community oncology groups as well as the hospital groups and contracting PBMs, relationship overall. So we expect to generate a good [indiscernible] should go well above $100 million for these products. Your second question on naloxone, the retail side is slow, the government is where most of the demand is state-wise. Retail is probably 10%, 20%. We already have contracts with CBS and Walgreens to supply them and already have supplied them, both of them. And government is the State of California, biggest state we get. We are working with other major states, obviously our home states. And we should be getting more business from government and this opportunity will become really big. And our settlement does not really impact if you do the math, which Tony can follow up with you later on. There's very little of products which we have 10 million capacity, so no issue whatsoever. And AvKARE, as we have said it earlier, strategic options are open, the business is performing really well. We're not in the rush to do anything. If we get the right price, we will transact. And delever massively, we'll pay down the gross debt in a huge amount, which - it's been a great acquisition for us. And either way, we're fine with the AvKARE.\n\nOperator: Thank you. We have no further questions, so I will hand back over to Chirag Patel to conclude the call. Thank you. Thank you. So Q1 was an outstanding start to 2024 as the momentum builds across all areas of our diversified business. Our recent naloxone launch is the latest example. And at Amneal, we love what we do. And our teams are fired up, high momentum across the company in - all over United States, Ireland, all over India. And we just could not be even more excited for overall the health and the performance of our company. So thank you everyone and have a great day.\n\nEnd of Q&A:\n\nOperator: Thank you, Chirag.

I will now turn the call over to Amneal's Head of Investor Relations, Tony DiMeo.\n\nTony DiMeo: Good morning. And thank you for joining Amneal Pharmaceuticals first quarter 2024 earnings call. Today, we issued a press release reporting Q1 results. The earnings press release and presentation are available at amneal.com. Certain statements made on this call regarding matters that are not historical facts, including, but not limited to, management's outlook or predictions, are forward-looking statements that are based solely on information that is now available to us. Please see the section entitled Cautionary Statements on Forward-Looking Statements for factors that may impact future performance. We also discuss non-GAAP measures. Information on use of these measures and reconciliations to GAAP are in the earnings release and presentation.\n\nOn the call today are Chirag and Chintu Patel, Co-Founders and Co-CEOs; Tasos Konidaris, CFO; our commercial leaders, Andy Boyer for Generics, Joe Renda for Specialty; and Jason Daly, Chief Legal Officer. I will now hand the call over to Chirag.\n\nChirag Patel: Thank you, Tony. Good morning to everyone. Our first quarter performance was outstanding. Record Q1 revenues of $659 million grew 18%. For the first time, all three of our segments generated double-digit growth in the same quarter. Q1 adjusted EBITDA of $152 million grew by 31% as strong execution continues to drive sustainably higher levels of profits. As momentum builds across Amneal, we are confident in our ability to achieve our financial commitments for 2024 and beyond. Our strategic vision for Amneal is to be a global, diversified pharmaceutical company that provides patients, providers, and payers with access to high quality, affordable, and essential medicines. In the United States, Amneal fills approximately 175 million prescriptions per year.\n\nIn retail pharmacies, we provide complex genetics medicines such as transdermals, topicals, oral solids, and ophthalmics. For hospitals and clinics, we supply important acute care injectables where there are chronic shortages. In biosimilars, we are expanding access to oncology therapies and adding more to our portfolio. In Specialty, our innovative medicines advance the standard of care, such as in Parkinson's disease. In our AvKARE distribution business, we provide military veterans with access to high quality medicines. Globally, we are addressing unmet health care needs in developing and developed countries. As we continue to grow larger, Amneal is leading a new era of affordable medicines and having a significant societal impact. Nowhere in our commitment to this mission more evident than our recent approval of naloxone.\n\nOpioid overdose remains a US public health care emergency. We are expanding access to this critical rescue medicine as an OTC product at pharmacies and for the public interest through states and cities across the United States. We were pleased to finalize our partnership with the State of California with more to come. We are so proud that this essential life-saving medicine is made in America and manufactured here in New Jersey by Amneal. Let me now walk through our business at a high level where we remain confident in our strategy, our ability to execute well and drive growth, and the opportunity to have a tremendous impact. First, our affordable medicines business, which is our Generics segment, has consistently grown each year since 2019.\n\nWe are seeing this growth accelerate in 2024, driven by our diverse portfolio of retail, injectables, and biosimilars. Amneal has a track record of quality, innovation, and customer service. Those hallmarks continue to resonate in the US pharmaceutical market, plagued by supply shortages with perpetual demand for high quality medicines. The durability of our complex portfolio and regular cadence of new launches each year position Amneal well to continue expanding our leadership position in affordable medicines and driving sustainable long term growth. In the retail pharmaceutical market, our portfolio of around 240 medicines is complex and diversified. With industry-wide supply chain disruption due to site inspections and manufacturer discontinuations, price erosion in the United States generic industry remains lower than it has been in several years.\n\nIn injectables, we are expanding our portfolio and have a significant capacity to help address drug shortages in hospitals and clinics. Our injectable strategy focuses on providing unique, ready to use products like our recent launch of PEMRYDI RTU for the treatment of certain lung cancers. Across retail and injectables, we are on track to launch over 30 new products this year, following our record 39 new launches last year. In biosimilars, we are seeing the next wave of affordable medicines. From 2024 to 2028, an estimated $192 billion in annual branded biologics value will lose exclusivity. We expect most biosimilar markets to be less competitive, given the inherent complexities of these molecules and the investment required to bring them to market.\n\nAdoption rates for early biosimilars are now 80%, particularly in oncology where we operate. Our excellent commercial team is driving strong adoption at both community oncology and hospital integrated delivery networks. That, coupled with our pipeline and with trusted partners, gives us confidence in continued momentum. We are well on our way to achieving over $125 million of revenue in 2024, with $90 million in biosimilars revenue over the last 12 months. We look to in-license one to two biosimilars each year or more and to be vertically integrated over time. Internationally, we are continuing to expand our reach and build a strong foundation. This is happening most notably in India, where we are building a customized portfolio of therapies for unmet needs like critical care, ophthalmology, oncology and diagnostics.\n\nIn other geographies, we are working with partners to register and commercialize select and new products. We expect international expansion will add $5,200 million revenues by 2027 and rapidly scale up to that. Next, in our Specialty business, we continue to make good progress with our key neurology and endocrinology branded products, as revenues are growing double digits. In Q1, we successfully launched Ongentys, an adjunctive therapy for Parkinson's disease, which we recently in-licensed to our specialty portfolio. Next up is IPX203, with our action date is on August 7. Carbidopa/levodopa has been the main therapy for Parkinson's disease for over five decades. We believe IPX203 meaningfully advances that standard of care with a broad application for all patients.\n\nIn our AvKARE distribution business, we have more than doubled revenues and profits since our acquisition in 2020. We are expanding all three channels, distribution, government and unit dose, driven by new products from suppliers, including Amneal. We now expect over $650 million in our AvKARE revenue next year, as we expect this to remain a high growth business. In short, we're starting 2024 with very strong momentum. Our diversified growth profile is sustainable and our financial performance is accelerating remarkably. I'll now hand it to Chintu.\n\nChintu Patel: Good morning, everyone. Thank you, Chirag, and thank you to the global Amneal family who works hard every day to help make healthy possible. I will discuss how our core strengths in both operations and innovation provides us with a long runway for sustainable top and bottom line growth. First, quality has been at the center of everything we do since our founding in 2002. We continue to invest in quality through automation and AI technologies to advance our global infrastructure. Our success is also driven by our commitment to operational excellence, ongoing efficiency programs and a robust supply chain. All of our plans are FDA approved. In each plant, we are driving optimization and efficiency programs to maintain our exceptional customer service levels and gain cost efficiencies.\n\nAcross our supply chain, we are focused on what we call the three Rs - redundancy, resiliency and reliability. In particular, drug shortages are an ongoing challenge in the market. The US FDA released 114 drug shortages, including 75 injectables. At Amneal, we look to be part of the solution. We have about 20 commercial and pipeline injectables that are on the shortage list, including oncology medicines. We have also tripled our injectables manufacturing capacity in recent years at multiple plants. We continue to prioritize efforts to help alleviate shortages in the market, particularly for injectables. Second, our track record in innovation is very strong, and we are off to a great start in 2024 with five key complex product launches, naloxone nasal spray, PEMRYDI RTU, carvedilol ER, FML eye drops, and generic Ciprodex.\n\nWe currently have 86 new products, ANDAs pending, of which 63 are non-oral solids. In addition, we have 67 pipeline products, 94% of which are non-oral solids. With our ongoing shift towards complex innovations, we have improved our R&D efficiencies and are spending less internally, which allows us to allocate more investment towards external R&D over time. We were so proud of last week's approval of Naloxone nasal spray, a life-saving treatment for drug overdoses. This is a tremendous milestone for the entire team at Amneal. The product is now available through retail pharmacies as an OTC product and to states and counties across the US. We have built robust manufacturing capacity to make up to 10 million two-packs starting next year. We are significantly expanding access to help address the opioid crisis that impacts so many Americans.\n\nIn injectables, we expect to launch over 10 new products this year, following the 14 new injectables we launched in 2023. Our R&D focus is on oncology, ready-to-use bags, and long-acting injectables. For years, we have been meeting with clinicians to understand their needs. This emphasis on the voice of the customer has allowed us to develop unique presentations of existing products. Last month, we launched our first 505(b)(2) injectable in PEMRYDI RTU. This new ready-to-use presentation of a frequently used oncology medicine can improve efficiency and reduce medication error. We look to launch two to three 505(b)(2) injectables each year with approximately 15 in development. Next, biosimilars continue to be a key area of strategic focus. Building on the success of our first three commercial products, we in-licensed two denosumab biosimilar candidates for Prolia and XGEVA in Q4.\n\nThose programs continue to progress with our development partner, mAbxience. In addition, we are pleased to share that, in Q1, we in-licensed two additional pegfilgrastim pipeline programs, on-body injector and pre-filled auto-injector. Today, approximately 30% to 40% of the pegfilgrastim market is on-body and fewer competitors are expected in this space. In total, we have three commercial biosimilars and four more under development, all in oncology. As we establish Amneal as a key biosimilar player, we look to add more opportunistic biosimilar molecules to our pipeline over time. Internationally, we have distribution partners in place for approximately 40 emerging market countries including strong markets like Saudi Arabia, Mexico, South Africa, and the Philippines.\n\nWe are registering products globally, including in Europe, Canada, China, and emerging markets. In specialty, we are continuously evolving our R&D efforts to move up the value chain. First, our IPX203 complete response resubmission is under review. Also, we are advancing our DHE auto-injector program for migraine and cluster headache. We transfer production internally and are excited to complete our application later this year, which puts us in a good position to launch in the first half of next year, once approved. In addition, we continue to advance our pipeline with K-114 for endocrinology and other programs. We look to launch one to two specialty products each year going forward. Overall, Amneal is expanding and growing in the key areas of medicine, complex generics, injectables, biosimilars, international distribution and specialty branding.\n\nWe are so deeply passionate about our company's mission and purpose and the good work that remains ahead. I will now pass it over to Tasos.\n\nTasos Konidaris: Thank you, Chintu. And good morning. At a high level, our diversified business is driving sustainable higher levels of revenues and profits and continued deleveraging. Our first quarter results were excellent with total net revenue of $659 million, up 18%. Q1 generics net revenue of $391 million grew 14%, driven by our diverse portfolio of complex products. Biosimilars generated $27 million in revenue, driven by ALYMSYS. New products launched in 2023 and 2024 added $19 million to Q1 revenue growth. In addition, the remaining base portfolio continued to grow due to the relevancy of our products, strong market demand, less pricing pressure and Amneal's high quality supply chain. Q1 Specialty net revenues of $105 million grew 15%, driven by double-digit growth of our key branded products, plus the recent launch of ONGENTYS in March.\n\nQ1 AvKARE net revenues of $163 million grew 33%, reflecting continued strong growth across all three customer channels, driven by new products. Our Q1 adjusted gross margins of 42% increased 250 basis points year-over-year and were ahead of our expectations. Strong gross margins were driven by the favorable mix of revenues that reflected the complexity of our portfolio combined with higher fixed overhead absorption. Q1 adjusted EBITDA of $152 million grew 31%, reflecting robust revenue growth, higher gross margins, tight management of operating expenses and a favorable comparison to prior year. Our leveraged growth profile in Q1 is a blueprint for sustainable higher P&L results for the company going forward. Q1 adjusted EPS of $0.14 grew 17%, driven by higher adjusted EBITDA, partially offset by interest costs.\n\nAs a reminder, we have made substantial progress over the last four years driving accelerated top and bottom line growth, reducing leverage and resolving legacy matters. As a result, our annual adjusted EBITDA has increased from $339 million in 2019 to $594 million over the last 12 months ended Q1 2024. Also, net leverage has declined from 7.4 times in 2019 to 4.6 times now. As I mentioned earlier, settling legacy legal matters has been a priority of ours. Two years ago, we settled upon our ER litigation and we just made our final payment in Q1. In addition, today, we announced that we reached agreement in principle for a nationwide opioid settlement payable over 10 years that resolves substantially all opioid litigation. Accordingly, in the first quarter, we recorded a pre-tax charge of $94 million, which reflects cash payments in the supply of naloxone nasal spray bought over the next 10 years.\n\nAs a result, we have now substantially resolved these two legacy legal matters, which removes these overhangs from the company. Given the strong start of the year and our improved visibility, including the recent naloxone approval, we're targeting the higher end of our full year outlook. As a reminder, we expect total net revenue of $2.550 billion to $2.650 billion and adjusted EBITDA of $580 million to $620 million, which reflects high-single-digit growth on both top and bottom line. With that, let me turn the call over to Chirag.\n\nChirag Patel : Thank you, Tasos. Amneal's Q1 performance was excellent across the board and reflects our continued upward trajectory in driving higher financial results over the years. We are so excited about the opportunities ahead. Let's now open the call for Q&A, Anthony.", "source": {"uri": "finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

(NASDAQ: AMRX ) has reported a strong start to the first quarter of 2024, with a notable earnings and revenue beat that propelled its shares 3.86% higher.\n\nThe pharmaceutical company announced an adjusted EPS of $0.14, surpassing analysts' expectations by $0.05. Revenue for the quarter reached $659 million, exceeding the consensus estimate of $620.31 million.\n\nThe first quarter's revenue marked an 18% increase from the $558 million reported in the same period last year, indicating robust growth across the company's diversified business segments. This performance was driven by double-digit growth in all three segments, with generics revenues up 14%, specialty revenues increasing by 15%, and AvKARE revenues soaring by 33%. The positive results are attributed to strong performance in complex generics, oncology biosimilars, new launches, and expansion across channels due to new products.\n\nHowever, the company faced a net loss of $92 million in the first quarter of 2024, compared to a $7 million loss in the first quarter of 2023, largely due to a pre-tax charge of $94 million related to a settlement in principle on a nationwide opioids settlement. Despite this, the adjusted EBITDA saw a significant rise of 31% to $152 million, reflecting the company's strong revenue performance and higher gross margins.\n\nLooking ahead, Amneal reaffirmed its full-year 2024 guidance, projecting an adjusted EPS range of $0.53 to $0.63, which brackets the analyst consensus of $0.58. The company also anticipates net revenue between $2.55 billion and $2.65 billion for the year, with the midpoint slightly below the consensus estimate of $2.604 billion. Additionally, Amneal expects capital expenditures of $60 million to $70 million and operating cash flow of $260 million to $300 million.\n\nChirag and Chintu Patel, Co-Chief Executive Officers, expressed their satisfaction with the company's performance, stating, \"We are extremely pleased with our outstanding start to the year, as Amneal generated record levels of revenues in the first quarter.\" They highlighted Amneal's role in addressing the demand for medicines and supply shortages in the U.S. pharmaceutical industry.\n\nInvestors have responded positively to the earnings and revenue beat, as reflected in the stock's upward movement following the announcement.

I will now turn the call over to Amneal's Head of Investor Relations, Tony Dimeo.\n\nTony Dimeo\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining Amneal Pharmaceuticals' First Quarter 2024 earnings call. Today, we issued a press release reporting Q1 results. The earnings press release and presentation are available at annual.com. Certain statements made on this call regarding matters that are not historical facts, including but not limited to, management's outlook or predictions are forward-looking statements that are based solely on information that is now available to us. Please see the section entitled Cautionary statements and forward-looking statements for Factors that may impact future performance. We also discuss non-GAAP measures. Information on use of these measures and reconciliation to GAAP in the earnings release and presentation.\n\nOn the call today are Chirag and Chintu Patel, Co-Founders and Co-CEOs; Tasos Konidaris, CFO; our commercial leaders, Andy Boyer for generics, Joe Renda for specialty; and Jason Daly, Chief Legal Officer. I will now hand the call over to Chirag.\n\nChirag Patel\n\nThank you, Tony. Good morning to everyone from our first quarter performance was outstanding. Record Q1 revenues of $659 million grew 18%. For the first time, all three of our segments generated double digit digit growth in the same quarter. Q1 adjusted EBITDA of $152 million grew by 31% as strong execution continues to drive sustainably higher levels of profits as momentum builds across Amneal. We are confident in our ability to achieve our financial commitments for 2024 and beyond.\n\nOur strategic vision for Amneal is to be a global diversified pharmaceutical company that provides patients, providers and payers with access to high-quality, affordable and essential medicines in the U.S., AmnioFill is approximately $175 million prescriptions per year in retail pharmacies. We provide complex genetics medicines such as transdermals, topicals, oral solids and opthalmics for hospitals and clinics. We supply important acute care injectables where there are chronic shortages in biosimilars We are expanding access to oncology therapies and adding more to our portfolio in specialty, our innovative medicines advance the standard of care, such as in Parkinson's disease in our healthcare distribution business. We provide military veterans with access to high-quality medicines globally. We are addressing unmet healthcare needs in developing and developed countries as we continue to grow larger. And Neil is a leading new era of affordable medicines and having a significant societal impact. Nowhere in our commitment to this mission, more evident than our recent approval of Innolux opioid overdose remains a US public health care emergency. We are expanding access to this critical rescue medicine as an OTC product at pharmacies and for the public interest through states and cities across the United States we were pleased to finalize our partnership with the State of California with more to come. We are so proud that this essential life-saving medicine is made in America and manufacturing here in New Jersey by Amneal.\n\nLet me now walk through our business at a high-level look, where we remain confident in our strategy, our ability to execute well and drive growth and the opportunity to have a tremendous impact. First, our affordable medicines business, which is our genetics segment, has consistently grown each year since 2019. We are seeing this growth accelerate in 2024, driven by our diverse portfolio of retail, injectables and biosimilars. And Neil has a track record of quality, innovation and customer service. Those hallmarks continue to resonate in the U.S. pharmaceutical market, plagued by supply shortages with perpetual demand for high-quality medicines, the durability of our complex portfolio and regular today, cadence of new launches each year position Amneal well to continue expanding our leadership position in affordable medicines and driving sustainable long-term growth in the retail pharmaceutical market.\n\nOur portfolio of around 240 medicines is complex and diversified with industry-wide supply chain disruption due to site inspections and manufacturer discontinuations. Price erosion in the United States generic industry remains lower than it has been in several years. In injectables, we are expanding our portfolio and have a significant capacity to help address drug shortages in hospitals and clinics with injectable strategy focuses on providing unique ready to use products like our recent launch of Van Brady RTU for the treatment of certain lung cancers across retail and injectables. We are on track to launch over 30 new products this year following our record 39 new launches last year. In biosimilars, we are seeing the next wave of affordable medicines from 2024 to 2028 and estimated $192 billion in annual branded biologics value will lose exclusivity. We expect most biosimilar markets to be less competitive, given the inherent complex IT complexities of these molecules and the investment required to bring them to market adoption rates for only biosimilars are now 80%, particularly in oncology where we operate. Our excellent commercial team is driving strong adoption at both community oncology and hospital integrated delivery networks that, coupled with our pipeline and with trusted partners, gives us confidence in continued momentum. We are well on our way to achieving over $125 million of revenue in 24 with $90 million in biosimilars revenue over the last 12 months. We look we in-license one to two biosimilars each year or more and to be vertically integrated over time.\n\nInternationally, we continue to expand our reach and build a strong foundation. This is happening most notably in India, where we are building a customized portfolio of therapies for unmet needs like critical care, ophthalmology, oncology and diagnostics. In other geographies, we are working with partners to register and commercialize select and new products. We expect international expansion will add $50 million to $100 million in revenues by 2027 and rapidly scale up to that.\n\nNext, in our specialty business, we continued to make good progress with our key neurology and endocrinology branded products as revenues are growing double digits. In Q1, we successfully launched on Genta's and adjunctive therapy for Parkinson's disease, which we recently in-licensed to our specialty portfolio.\n\nNext up is IPX203 with our action date is on August seventh. Carbidopa levodopa has been the main therapy for Parkinson's disease for over five decades. We believe IPX-203 meaningfully advances that standard of care with a broad application for all patients. You know what our care distribution business. We have more than doubled revenues and profits since our acquisition in 2020. We are expanding all three channels. Distribution in government and unit does driven by new products from suppliers, including Emil. We now expect or $650 million revenue next year as we expect this to remain a high-growth business. In short, we're starting 2024 with very strong momentum or diversified growth profile is sustainable, and our financial performance is accelerating. Remarkably, I'll now hand it to Chintu.\n\nChintu Patel\n\nGood morning, everyone. Thank you to thank you, Chirag, and thank you to the global and new family who work hard every day to help make healthy possible. I will discuss how our core strengths in both operations and innovation provides us with a long runway for sustainable top and bottom line growth. First, QUALITY has been at the center of everything we do since our founding in 2002, we continue to invest in quality through automation and AI technologies to advance our global infrastructure. Our success is also driven by our commitment to operational excellence, ongoing efficiency programs and a robust supply chain. All of our plants are FDA-approved in each plant. We are driving optimization and efficiency programs to maintain our exceptional customer service levels and gain cost efficiencies across our supply chain. We are focused on what we call the three Rs, redundancy, resiliency and reliability, in particular, drug shortages are an ongoing challenge in the market. The US FDA list 114 drug shortages, including 75 injectables. And I mean we look to be part of the solution. We have about 20 commercial and pipeline injectables that are on the shortage list, including oncology medicines. We have also tripled our injectables manufacturing capacity in recent years at multiple plants we continue to prioritize efforts to help alleviate shortages in the market, particularly for injectables.\n\nSecond, our track record in innovation is very strong, and we are off to a great start in 2024 with five key complex product launches, no logs on nasal sprays and with the RDU. card with a lot of ERFML. eyedrops and genetic CiproDex. We currently have 86 new products ANDAs pending, of which 63 are non oral solids. In addition, we have 67 pipeline products, 94% of which are non-oral solid. With our ongoing shift towards complex innovations. We have improved our R&D efficiencies and are spending less internally, which allows us to allocate more investment towards external R&D over time, we were so proud of last week's approval of the logs on nasal spray, a life-saving treatment for drug overdoses. This is a tremendous milestone for the entire team at Amneal. The product is now available to retail pharmacies as an OTC product and two states and counties across the U.S., we have built robust manufacturing capacity to make up to $10 million to pack starting next year. We are significantly expanding access to help address the opioid crisis that impacts so many Americans in injectables, we expect to launch over 10 new products this year following the 14 new injectables be launched in 2023. Our R&D focus is on oncology, ready-to-use bags and long acting injectables. For the years, we have been meeting with clinicians to understand their needs. This emphasis on the voice of the customer has allowed us to develop unique presentations of existing products. Last month, we launched our first YFIV. two injectable impairment at DIDU. These new ready-to-use presentation of a frequently used oncology magazine can improve efficiency and reduce medication errors. We look to launch 2 to three five five b. two injectables each year with approximately 15 in development.\n\nNext biosimilar continue to be a key area of strategic focus, building on the success of our first three commercial products. We in-licensed to denosumab biosimilar candidate for Prolia and XGEVA in Q4. Those programs continue to progress with our development partner, XmAb science. In addition, we are pleased to share that in Q1, we in-licensed two additional pegfilgrastim pipeline programs, on-body injector and prefilled auto-injector. Today, approximately 30% to 40% of the backfill existing market is on body and fewer competitors are expected in this space. In total, we have three commercial biosimilars and four more under development, all in oncology, as we establish Amneal as a key biosimilar player, we look to add more opportunistic biosimilar molecules to our pipeline over time. Internationally, we have distribution partners in place for approximately 40 emerging markets market countries, including strong markets like Saudi Arabia, Mexico, South Africa and the Philippines. We are registering products globally, including in Europe, Canada, China and emerging markets.\n\nIn specialty, we are continuously evolving our R&D efforts to move up the value chain. First, our IPX. two three complete response submission is under review. Also, we are advancing our DAT auto-injector program for migraine and cluster headache. We transfer production internally and excited to complete our application later this year, which puts us in a good position to launch in the first half of next year once approved.\n\nIn addition, we continue to advance our pipeline with key one one four for endocrinology and other programs. We look to launch one to two specialty products each year going forward. Overall, Amneal is expanding and growing in the key areas of managing complex generics, injectables, biosimilars, International Distribution and Specialty Brands. We are so deeply passionate about our company's mission and purpose and the good work that remains ahead.\n\nI will now pass it over to Tassos.\n\nTasos Konidaris\n\nGood morning. At a high level, our diversified business is driving sustainable, higher levels of revenues and profits and continued deleveraging. Our first quarter results were excellent, with total net revenue of $659 million, up 18%. Q1 generics net revenue of $391 million grew 14%, driven by our diverse portfolio of complex products. Biosimilars generated $27 million in revenue, driven by our basis, new products launched in 2023 and 2024 added $19 million to Q1 revenue growth. In addition, the remaining base portfolio continued to grow due to the relevancy of our products, strong market demand, less pricing pressure and Amneal's high-quality supply chain. Q1 specialty net revenues of $805 million grew 15%, driven by double digit growth of our key branded products, plus the recent launch of Agensys in March, Q1 of your net revenues of $163 million grew 33%, reflecting continued strong growth across all three customer channels, driven by new products our Q1 adjusted gross margins of 42% increased 250 basis points year over year and were ahead of our expectations. Strong gross margins were driven by the favorable mix of revenues that reflected the complexity of our portfolio combined with higher fixed overhead absorption.\n\nQ1 adjusted EBITDA of $152 million grew 31% reflecting robust revenue growth, higher gross margins, tight management of operating expenses and a favorable comparison to prior year. Our leverage growth profile in Q1 is the blueprint for sustainable, higher P&L results for the Company going forward. Q1 adjusted EPS of $0.14 grew 17%, driven by higher adjusted EBITDA, partially offset by interest costs. As a reminder, we have made substantial progress over the last four years, driving accelerated top and bottom line growth, reducing leverage and resolve legacy matters. As a result, our annual adjusted EBITDA has increased from $339 million in 2019 to $594 million over the last 12 months ended Q1 2024. Also, net leverage has declined from 7.4 times in 2019 to 4.6 times.\n\nNow, as I mentioned earlier, settling legacy legal matters has been a priority of ours. Two years ago, we settled Opana ER litigation and we just made a final payment in Q1. In addition, today, we announced that we reached agreement in principle for a nationwide opioid settlement payable over 10 years. That resolves substantially all opioids litigation. Accordingly, in the first quarter, we recorded a pretax charge of $94 million, which reflects cash payments in the supply of logs and nasal spray, both over the next 10 years. As a result, we have now substantially resolved these two legacy legal matters, which removes this overhang from the company. Given the strong start of the year and our improved visibility, including the recent locks and approval for targeting the higher end of our full year outlook. As a reminder, we expect total net revenue of $2,550 million to $2,650 million and adjusted EBITDA of $580 million to $620 million, which reflects high single digit growth on both top and bottom line.\n\nWith that, let me turn the call over to Chirag.\n\nChirag Patel\n\nWell, thank you, Tassos. Amneal's Q1 performance was excellent across the board and reflects our continued upward trajectory in driving higher financial results over the years. We are so excited about the opportunities ahead.\n\nLet's now open the call for Q&A.\n\n(Operator Instructions) Nathan Rich, Goldman Sachs.\n\nNathan Rich\n\nYes, hi, good morning. Congratulations on a strong quarter. And thanks for the questions. Maybe wanted to start with the lock zone and specifically the California contract. Can you talk about when that contract starts and how long it is. And any details you can share maybe on the type of volume commitment that Steve made and have you gotten additional interest from? Are there states sort of on the back of that and any comments on the margin profile of the lockdown maybe relative to the corporate average would be helpful.\n\nChirag Patel\n\nAnd Nathan, good morning job. So California supplies starts now and we will see the increased demand as they ramp up our label. And according to the state's press release, they could buy up to $3.2 million units per year. We don't expect them to buy that in the 1st year, but then ramp it up as they go source somewhere between We expect $2 million to 3 million units in the State of California. The remaining contractual terms are confidential. We it was a great win for us and we're very proud of the agreement with the State of California and trusting us to supply valuing the made in United States product. So we really appreciate it.\n\nIn terms of the margin profile, it is going to be a higher and accretive than the current gross margin.\n\nTasos Konidaris\n\nObviously, the issues that the State of California, so this is impacting and it's an issue across all of our states. And our commercial teams are actively engaged with other internal devices, both on the state and federal level. So really excited to kind of fill the incremental need that's going to provide for many years.\n\nChirag Patel\n\nYes. And we have built the capacity to supply 10 million units up to 10 million units starting early next year. This year, we're producing somewhere between 2.5 million to 3 million units.\n\nNathan Rich\n\nThat's great. And maybe just a follow-up on the cadence of earnings this year. And you know, taxes. I know you kind of pointed to the high end of the range, but I think looking at the historical EBITDA cadence, I think 20% comes in the first quarter typically based on what you did this year, that would imply a number well above that kind of high end of the range. So is there anything to kind of note on just earnings cadence this year that would be different than normal?\n\nTasos Konidaris\n\nAl, it's it's a you know, you take one quarter. We can never annualize annualize the. So if you think about we finished the year last year with EBITDA was $554 million, right? So we added Q1 run rate.\n\nThe last run rate of the first four of the last four quarters now it's almost $600 million, $594 million. So the year is playing out how we were hoping it which is acceleration of top and bottom line growth, right? So we have a So So great, great improvement. So now we are targeting the high end of the range, and we are saying is there more right to have a fab and you can count on us and tried to maximize the performance. But at the same time, right, we are also focused on driving and making investments primarily in our R&D, primarily in kind of tuck-in licensing deals in the biosimilar and complex drugs to not just maximize this year or the next. But build a long term growth for 2026, 2027. So you're not missing anything. The only thing I want to be mindful is I want to make sure we have room in our operating expenses to make investments over the over the next, call it, nine months, primarily in R&D and then also depending how things play out with IPX. two or three kind of making sure we we cannot make the right investments there to drive that growth as quickly as possible.\n\nGood morning. Thank you for taking my questions. Can you just provide some initial update commentary on the Genta's given the new ownership structure and perhaps some feedback from prescribers and then also on perimetry and I have a follow-up.\n\nYes. I think, so far, we've been very pleased with our Genta's as well as the partnership with BR. It's been a great partnership, and we've been working very closely with them and their global team executing upon the strategies that we they've learned from over the years. I would say probably the three pieces of feedback that would be significant would be one, we are hearing very positive feedback from prescribers. There was a concern that fit on Genta's would not be remaining in the market. So prescribers were very pleased when they heard we were going to be taking over this brand and we've been able to sign on a few more contracts from an access standpoint. So our goal there is to increase the access the market access that is for Genta's the market beyond what it was. And so far, we've been very pleased with that performance and progress.\n\nAnd finally, I would say one of the things we're looking at closely to kind of determine the uptick as what our NBRx. Our performance has been new new patients to brand and were up some 20% NBRx is from a performance standpoint. So so far, we're very pleased and it's been a great partnership. And it's also been a really good augmentation to Rytary unless you had a question on prem Reddy, RTU.\n\nChirag Patel\n\nYes, the way to think about that for annual rate is another complex innovation. On the injectable side, it's our first five or five b. to launch we'll do two to three years going forward. And it's a ready to use oncology therapy that reduces steps. So think of it as it's a new vector of growth for the Company.\n\nLes Sulewski\n\nGreat. Appreciate that extra color. Now on moving on to IPX two or three and your action date circled for August seventh, can you just talk about perhaps your launch readiness on your plans with the sales force than just overall impact potential guidance, if any? Thank you.\n\nYes. So let's say that first of all, I would say one of the things that is significant for us is we've really become a leader in the Parkinson's space, right? Hari has enabled us to develop and deepen relationships with key prescribers and movement disorder specialists across the country, really in and around the world for that matter. And um, and that also is coupled with the fact that we've developed a market access capability that has created an access stream for Rytary. That's that's the best in the in the Parkinson's community. So we enjoy some 70% commercial coverage in about 60 or so percent of the Part D coverage. And then the agenda that I just spoke to has enabled us to actually increase our prescriber base that would go. We're going deeper now into general neurologists.\n\nSo when you look at our go-to-market strategy with IPX, the three components there are one leveraging and working off of those deep relationships that we've that we've built over the last decade in the Parkinson's community. And then second is to leverage that market access capability that we have, we'll use that same strategy to gain access for IPX. two or three comparable to what we have with Rytary.\n\nAnd then finally, I would say that the novel formulation that is IPX. two or three really offers greater efficacy, better on-time, fewer dosing. So the Parkinson's community itself is very excited. In fact, just last night, we were at a Parkinson's Foundation Gala, and there's a lot of buzz and talk about when IPX. two or three is coming to market.\n\nTasos Konidaris\n\nSo we're very ready and eager to get the OPX two or three to the hands of the patients that needed out there and less in terms of potential peak revenues, assuming approval, how good do feel great about it is the number that we know Rytary right now. There's a couple of hundred million dollars in annual revenues, right of the guidance we have given about IPF. two three is our peak revenues of $300 million to $500 million. We think based on the product profile and the fact that IPX. two or three is only being used by about 5% of the available patients, right, right. Away I'm sorry. So there is a tremendous market opportunity out there for the remaining 95% of the market that's not been utilizing Rytary. And I think a bit here revenues three to 500. I think I'd just well within what the team is capable.\n\nYes, and thank you. Just have a few questions. I wanted to drill down on the $100 million plus in new product revenue in 2024. Can you talk about the mix between retail and injectable contribution in that $100 million, and that's number one. Number two is how much of the injectable contribution is coming from shortage products. Ours is a complex product. And so that's another question. And then also And switching gears to our MRs or the bevacizumab and biosimilar, can you just talk about the dynamics here that are driving the strong sales. Is it limited competition in the market? Or are there other things at play here? And just talk about your expectations for and for that product and what informs your $100 million plus in sales by 2025? Thank you.\n\nChirag Patel\n\nGreat, David. No, good. Good morning, Al. So let me it's a new product launches let's just go back a little bit the last five years, if you go by the NPLs and you total that to this year's revenue is about $765 million we have added in new product launches and what we see going forward, and this is just within generics, injectables and biosimilars, we can break it down for you later on but stay on a bigger picture, is that why we are able to grow this? And why in the United States this business, this is just US number international is separate. Why this is a big deal because I think it's for over time because people have been focused on price erosion and every node, the entire biggest market for the affordable medicines is United States, and we now expect the next 40 years. So if you annualize our revenue of next four years from 28, that that would be additional $800 million to $1 billion added to the new new to NPLs. So this is, you know, we've been working on such a strong pipeline and in-licensing strong products.\n\nOn page 7 of our presentation, we are listed out many of them like 60 products being launched in 24 and 25, 15 of them are high value. So you can see it in more and more high values that happening as you go year out. And we have not disclosed certain pipeline assets for competitive reasons as well as we have not disclosed some of the in-licensing products that we are have or working on it for competitive reasons. So very excited to and these are risk-adjusted number I gave you. So this $100 million is the breakdown we can provide you later on between the organic and providing. Tasos can provide appropriate color.\n\nTasos Konidaris\n\nSo the $100 million, it's combination of a couple of things, combination of products. If you remember last year towards the at the end of Q4, quite a number of new products close to, I think 13 or so products that were approved in Q4 of last year. So that's kind of the annualization of those revenues, right, as well as new product launches this year. So that $100 million number, it's not a certainty, but a high degree of confidence. Point number one, when you break it out between retail and injectable is pretty much almost split 50 50, 60 40 between. So it's evenly split of retail products like naproxen right on one on one side, injectable products of like per the and there are many of the other smaller injectable products. So it's pretty evenly split between retail and injectables.\n\nChirag Patel\n\nAnd next, your next question on the shortages versus regular, where shortages make very small numbers at this point. It's our regular products that we've been we've been expanding the market. So demand is coming our way because we we are the best quality and consistent supplier out in the market. So our customers are trusting us and more and more trust has been established.\n\nYour question regarding Olympus is we have a very strong team. I mean that the commercial team has done a superb job and reputation and meals basket of 300 products. We bring a lot more to the table for our customers than if you are a pure play biosimilar. So this is why I believe that for the future you will see that companies being more successful, who have a broader portfolio and who are working closely, whether it's the oncologist, the community oncologist, all the hospitals, all the PBMs because we provide tremendous value to them. So we have a better negotiating power with them or advantages versus the pure-play biosimilars, and we're going to keep improving. And those alliances you will see even higher market share coming coming up as well as fill Nitro. And we add OBI. You will start seeing the uptake on the market share as well.\n\nDavid Amsellem\n\nThat's helpful. Just to clarify, the $100 million does not include the locks on. I think I saw a footnote for that in the slides, but I just want to make sure that's correct. $100 million did not include.\n\nTasos Konidaris\n\nAnd the lockdown, David, that's correct that we have the estimate we had on the Q4 call and reiterated $30 million plus for Lawson, $100 million is for the rest of the NPLs this year.\n\nAnd you can see the file with my brother mentioned five already launched, which are good value products complex in queue.\n\nHi, good morning, everyone, and congratulations on the results. A couple of questions from me. I was starting to be a generic side, a slightly surprised to see Amneal Spire for on Xifaxan. Bausch has been Raymond defending this from years versus a host of generic companies settled there, how differentiated is a buyer for versus others who are realistic of an opportunity? Is this versus any other generic company?\n\nAnd a similar question on Restasis to own for years. Generic companies are flagging this as an opportunity and struggled to get approval for the merger and how should we think about it?\n\nAnd secondly, on health care I saw that versus last quarter's presentation where you have a long-term guidance, $600 million, you raised it to six $50 million. What drove that increase in revenue guidance and what is the EBITDA impact of it? Thank you.\n\nYes, hi, Balaji. Good morning and thank you saw 95. I mean, we always work on very unique and key products, and we do have a position a day, something confidential. I don't want to get into the details. We are excited about the $5 billion opportunity, but it remains to be seen how it develops and multiple things that is involved. So we cannot comment at this time and any of the details on the Stasi. Yes, it is a very complex product. We are advancing our NDA and we are expected to launch at least as it next year in 2025.\n\nChirag Patel\n\nWe are very hopeful on that approaching our annual health care question, Balaji is yes, it is growing really well and a lot of government product where DOD as this is the advantage for you get some advantage being the biggest being American company and having manufacturing capacity in America. So we're taking full advantage of that. And this is why you see the growth in our cat and it would continue to grow.\n\nAnd Balaji, can you just repeat your other question?\n\nBalaji Prasad\n\nSo yes, the impact of our debt on EBITDA, I what I'm also trying to figure out is with the last 12 months revenue or EBITDA already being close to $590 million and with a stronger revenue trajectory, looking that much clearer for us now. What are the upside downside risks towards the higher end of your EBITDA guidance? And if the have care long-term guidance raise and what's the impact of AdCare guidance raise on the EBITDA.\n\nTasos Konidaris\n\nSo what happens of care of Gilead has been growing along with the rest of the business. So we're not relying on any specific segment, whether or not this generic of care specialty biosimilars are going to carry the day. So growth continues to be across all our all our businesses.\n\nPoint number one point Point number two is the upside to the downside of the businesses will continue to rely on new product launches, right, a robust new product approvals and launches and to kind of carry the day so we're not always in control of that. So that depends, as you know, with the on the regulatory authority source some years maybe is ahead of plan some some years we may be a little delayed, but all of those will come. But the cadence of it right, is not is not totally in our control. So that's something we just want to be mindful of number one. And number two is IPX two or three. So as we discussed, the vast majority of the potential launch expenses of IPX two or three year kind of built into our existing guidance, right? So that we worked on. We are conservative. If we get approval, then we will have to look at I think I cannot incremental top and bottom line contribution of that of that of that revenue. So the The downside is protected. The upside has not been has not been built in and after it just continues to grow nicely. So hopefully, that gives you a sense.\n\nAnd then the final thing I would say is the type of investments we choose to make right to kind of drive so that a lot of it is variable. It's within our control. So if we think the year plays out of incredibly well, who may choose to make some additional investments, if the year is playing a little tighter than we thought we made just yet kind of pushed bucket couple of potential deals.\n\nBut momentum has been strong as you can see the six key products have been approved already. So we feel very good on that. How the momentum is great and the pipeline is delivery and isolation.\n\nGreat. Thanks so much for the questions. And just a couple for me. Maybe first on biosimilar Prolia, and XGEVA. Just elaborate a little bit more on the opportunity for these two and maybe just specifically launch time lines in light of the recent Sandoz settlement and the two brands is it either more interesting to you than the other just given obviously different market dynamics between the two of them?\n\nSecond question, the war zone between the public market and retail channel, what are you seeing as the bigger opportunity? And does the opioid settlement at all impact, how you think about that? And then maybe just finally on AdCare, obviously great performance here, but just your latest thoughts on potential to monetize that business and how you're thinking about that. Thank you.\n\nChirag Patel\n\nGood morning, Chris. So let's start with biosimilars, Prolia and XGEVA. We are equipped to sell in both channel, the Oncor Encore channel as well as PBM. We expect the launch in 26, maybe a bit early, and we'll see how the the filing. I think one is early. One is going to be a little bit later, and we expect the market penetration to be very good because we already have established relationship and by then we'll have more established relationship with the community oncologists, oncology groups as well as at the hospital groups and contracting PBMs relationship overall. So we expect to generate a good peak sales should go well above $100 million for these products.\n\nOn your second question on Aloxi zone, the retail side is slow. The government is where most of the the demand is state-wise. Retail is probably 10%, 20%. We are already have contracts with CVS and Walgreens to supply them, and they already have supplied them both of them and government deserves state of California biggest state. We get we are working with other major states, obviously, our home state and we should be getting more business from government. And this this opportunity will become really big and our settlement does not really impact if you do the maths, which Tony can follow-up with you later on as well, little of products, which we have $10 million capacity. So no issue whatsoever and have care. Now, as we have said it earlier, strategic options are open. The business is performing really well. We're not in a rush to do anything. If we get the right price, we will transact and delever massively or pay down the gross debt in a huge amount, which and it's been a great acquisition for us and either way we're fine with it.\n\nThank you. We have no further questions, so I will hand back over to Chirag.\n\nChirag Patel\n\nThank you. So Q1 was an outstanding start to 2024 as the momentum builds across all areas of our diversified business and the reason I love some launches later, this example and at Amneal, we love what we do. And our teams are fired up a high momentum across the Company and in all over United States, Ireland, all over India. And we just could not be more excited for overall the health and the performance of our company. So thank you, everybody, everyone, and have a great day.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you, Chirag.

On the call today are Chirag and Chintu Patel, Co-Founders and Co-CEOs; Tasos Konidaris, CFO; our commercial leaders, Andy Boyer for Generics, Joe Renda for Specialty; and Jason Daly, Chief Legal Officer. I will now hand the call over to Chirag.\n\nChirag Patel: Thank you, Tony. Good morning to everyone. Our first quarter performance was outstanding. Record Q1 revenues of $659 million grew 18%. For the first time, all three of our segments generated double-digit growth in the same quarter. Q1 adjusted EBITDA of $152 million grew by 31% as strong execution continues to drive sustainably higher levels of profits. As momentum builds across Amneal, we are confident in our ability to achieve our financial commitments for 2024 and beyond. Our strategic vision for Amneal is to be a global, diversified pharmaceutical company that provides patients, providers, and payers with access to high quality, affordable, and essential medicines. In the United States, Amneal fills approximately 175 million prescriptions per year. In retail pharmacies, we provide complex genetics medicines such as transdermals, topicals, oral solids, and ophthalmics. For hospitals and clinics, we supply important acute care injectables where there are chronic shortages. In biosimilars, we are expanding access to oncology therapies and adding more to our portfolio. In Specialty, our innovative medicines advance the standard of care, such as in Parkinson's disease. In our AvKARE distribution business, we provide military veterans with access to high quality medicines. Globally, we are addressing unmet health care needs in developing and developed countries. As we continue to grow larger, Amneal is leading a new era of affordable medicines and having a significant societal impact. Nowhere in our commitment to this mission more evident than our recent approval of naloxone. Opioid overdose remains a US public health care emergency. We are expanding access to this critical rescue medicine as an OTC product at pharmacies and for the public interest through states and cities across the United States. We were pleased to finalize our partnership with the State of California with more to come. We are so proud that this essential life-saving medicine is made in America and manufactured here in New Jersey by Amneal. Let me now walk through our business at a high level where we remain confident in our strategy, our ability to execute well and drive growth, and the opportunity to have a tremendous impact. First, our affordable medicines business, which is our Generics segment, has consistently grown each year since 2019. We are seeing this growth accelerate in 2024, driven by our diverse portfolio of retail, injectables, and biosimilars. Amneal has a track record of quality, innovation, and customer service. Those hallmarks continue to resonate in the US pharmaceutical market, plagued by supply shortages with perpetual demand for high quality medicines. The durability of our complex portfolio and regular cadence of new launches each year position Amneal well to continue expanding our leadership position in affordable medicines and driving sustainable long term growth. In the retail pharmaceutical market, our portfolio of around 240 medicines is complex and diversified. With industry-wide supply chain disruption due to site inspections and manufacturer discontinuations, price erosion in the United States generic industry remains lower than it has been in several years. In injectables, we are expanding our portfolio and have a significant capacity to help address drug shortages in hospitals and clinics. Our injectable strategy focuses on providing unique, ready to use products like our recent launch of PEMRYDI RTU for the treatment of certain lung cancers. Across retail and injectables, we are on track to launch over 30 new products this year, following our record 39 new launches last year. In biosimilars, we are seeing the next wave of affordable medicines. From 2024 to 2028, an estimated $192 billion in annual branded biologics value will lose exclusivity. We expect most biosimilar markets to be less competitive, given the inherent complexities of these molecules and the investment required to bring them to market. Adoption rates for early biosimilars are now 80%, particularly in oncology where we operate. Our excellent commercial team is driving strong adoption at both community oncology and hospital integrated delivery networks. That, coupled with our pipeline and with trusted partners, gives us confidence in continued momentum. We are well on our way to achieving over $125 million of revenue in 2024, with $90 million in biosimilars revenue over the last 12 months. We look to in-license one to two biosimilars each year or more and to be vertically integrated over time. Internationally, we are continuing to expand our reach and build a strong foundation. This is happening most notably in India, where we are building a customized portfolio of therapies for unmet needs like critical care, ophthalmology, oncology and diagnostics. In other geographies, we are working with partners to register and commercialize select and new products. We expect international expansion will add $5,200 million revenues by 2027 and rapidly scale up to that. Next, in our Specialty business, we continue to make good progress with our key neurology and endocrinology branded products, as revenues are growing double digits. In Q1, we successfully launched Ongentys, an adjunctive therapy for Parkinson's disease, which we recently in-licensed to our specialty portfolio. Next up is IPX203, with our action date is on August 7. Carbidopa/levodopa has been the main therapy for Parkinson's disease for over five decades. We believe IPX203 meaningfully advances that standard of care with a broad application for all patients. In our AvKARE distribution business, we have more than doubled revenues and profits since our acquisition in 2020. We are expanding all three channels, distribution, government and unit dose, driven by new products from suppliers, including Amneal. We now expect over $650 million in our AvKARE revenue next year, as we expect this to remain a high growth business. In short, we're starting 2024 with very strong momentum. Our diversified growth profile is sustainable and our financial performance is accelerating remarkably. I'll now hand it to Chintu.\n\nChintu Patel: Good morning, everyone. Thank you, Chirag, and thank you to the global Amneal family who works hard every day to help make healthy possible. I will discuss how our core strengths in both operations and innovation provides us with a long runway for sustainable top and bottom line growth. First, quality has been at the center of everything we do since our founding in 2002. We continue to invest in quality through automation and AI technologies to advance our global infrastructure. Our success is also driven by our commitment to operational excellence, ongoing efficiency programs and a robust supply chain. All of our plans are FDA approved. In each plant, we are driving optimization and efficiency programs to maintain our exceptional customer service levels and gain cost efficiencies. Across our supply chain, we are focused on what we call the three Rs - redundancy, resiliency and reliability. In particular, drug shortages are an ongoing challenge in the market. The US FDA released 114 drug shortages, including 75 injectables. At Amneal, we look to be part of the solution. We have about 20 commercial and pipeline injectables that are on the shortage list, including oncology medicines. We have also tripled our injectables manufacturing capacity in recent years at multiple plants. We continue to prioritize efforts to help alleviate shortages in the market, particularly for injectables. Second, our track record in innovation is very strong, and we are off to a great start in 2024 with five key complex product launches, naloxone nasal spray, PEMRYDI RTU, carvedilol ER, FML eye drops, and generic Ciprodex. We currently have 86 new products, ANDAs pending, of which 63 are non-oral solids. In addition, we have 67 pipeline products, 94% of which are non-oral solids. With our ongoing shift towards complex innovations, we have improved our R&D efficiencies and are spending less internally, which allows us to allocate more investment towards external R&D over time. We were so proud of last week's approval of Naloxone nasal spray, a life-saving treatment for drug overdoses. This is a tremendous milestone for the entire team at Amneal. The product is now available through retail pharmacies as an OTC product and to states and counties across the US. We have built robust manufacturing capacity to make up to 10 million two-packs starting next year. We are significantly expanding access to help address the opioid crisis that impacts so many Americans. In injectables, we expect to launch over 10 new products this year, following the 14 new injectables we launched in 2023. Our R&D focus is on oncology, ready-to-use bags, and long-acting injectables. For years, we have been meeting with clinicians to understand their needs. This emphasis on the voice of the customer has allowed us to develop unique presentations of existing products. Last month, we launched our first 505(b)(2) injectable in PEMRYDI RTU. This new ready-to-use presentation of a frequently used oncology medicine can improve efficiency and reduce medication error. We look to launch two to three 505(b)(2) injectables each year with approximately 15 in development. Next, biosimilars continue to be a key area of strategic focus. Building on the success of our first three commercial products, we in-licensed two denosumab biosimilar candidates for Prolia and XGEVA in Q4. Those programs continue to progress with our development partner, mAbxience. In addition, we are pleased to share that, in Q1, we in-licensed two additional pegfilgrastim pipeline programs, on-body injector and pre-filled auto-injector. Today, approximately 30% to 40% of the pegfilgrastim market is on-body and fewer competitors are expected in this space. In total, we have three commercial biosimilars and four more under development, all in oncology. As we establish Amneal as a key biosimilar player, we look to add more opportunistic biosimilar molecules to our pipeline over time. Internationally, we have distribution partners in place for approximately 40 emerging market countries including strong markets like Saudi Arabia, Mexico, South Africa, and the Philippines. We are registering products globally, including in Europe, Canada, China, and emerging markets. In specialty, we are continuously evolving our R&D efforts to move up the value chain. First, our IPX203 complete response resubmission is under review. Also, we are advancing our DHE auto-injector program for migraine and cluster headache. We transfer production internally and are excited to complete our application later this year, which puts us in a good position to launch in the first half of next year, once approved. In addition, we continue to advance our pipeline with K-114 for endocrinology and other programs. We look to launch one to two specialty products each year going forward. Overall, Amneal is expanding and growing in the key areas of medicine, complex generics, injectables, biosimilars, international distribution and specialty branding. We are so deeply passionate about our company's mission and purpose and the good work that remains ahead. I will now pass it over to Tasos.\n\nTasos Konidaris: Thank you, Chintu. And good morning. At a high level, our diversified business is driving sustainable higher levels of revenues and profits and continued deleveraging. Our first quarter results were excellent with total net revenue of $659 million, up 18%. Q1 generics net revenue of $391 million grew 14%, driven by our diverse portfolio of complex products. Biosimilars generated $27 million in revenue, driven by ALYMSYS. New products launched in 2023 and 2024 added $19 million to Q1 revenue growth. In addition, the remaining base portfolio continued to grow due to the relevancy of our products, strong market demand, less pricing pressure and Amneal's high quality supply chain. Q1 Specialty net revenues of $105 million grew 15%, driven by double-digit growth of our key branded products, plus the recent launch of ONGENTYS in March. Q1 AvKARE net revenues of $163 million grew 33%, reflecting continued strong growth across all three customer channels, driven by new products. Our Q1 adjusted gross margins of 42% increased 250 basis points year-over-year and were ahead of our expectations. Strong gross margins were driven by the favorable mix of revenues that reflected the complexity of our portfolio combined with higher fixed overhead absorption. Q1 adjusted EBITDA of $152 million grew 31%, reflecting robust revenue growth, higher gross margins, tight management of operating expenses and a favorable comparison to prior year. Our leveraged growth profile in Q1 is a blueprint for sustainable higher P&L results for the company going forward. Q1 adjusted EPS of $0.14 grew 17%, driven by higher adjusted EBITDA, partially offset by interest costs. As a reminder, we have made substantial progress over the last four years driving accelerated top and bottom line growth, reducing leverage and resolving legacy matters. As a result, our annual adjusted EBITDA has increased from $339 million in 2019 to $594 million over the last 12 months ended Q1 2024. Also, net leverage has declined from 7.4 times in 2019 to 4.6 times now. As I mentioned earlier, settling legacy legal matters has been a priority of ours. Two years ago, we settled upon our ER litigation and we just made our final payment in Q1. In addition, today, we announced that we reached agreement in principle for a nationwide opioid settlement payable over 10 years that resolves substantially all opioid litigation. Accordingly, in the first quarter, we recorded a pre-tax charge of $94 million, which reflects cash payments in the supply of naloxone nasal spray bought over the next 10 years. As a result, we have now substantially resolved these two legacy legal matters, which removes these overhangs from the company. Given the strong start of the year and our improved visibility, including the recent naloxone approval, we're targeting the higher end of our full year outlook. As a reminder, we expect total net revenue of $2.550 billion to $2.650 billion and adjusted EBITDA of $580 million to $620 million, which reflects high-single-digit growth on both top and bottom line. With that, let me turn the call over to Chirag.\n\nChirag Patel: Thank you, Tasos. Amneal's Q1 performance was excellent across the board and reflects our continued upward trajectory in driving higher financial results over the years. We are so excited about the opportunities ahead. Let's now open the call for Q&A, Anthony.\n\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question is from Nathan Rich with Goldman Sachs.\n\nNathan Rich: Congratulations on a strong quarter. I maybe wanted to start with naloxone and specifically the California contract. Can you talk about when that contract starts and how long it is and any details you can share maybe on the type of volume commitment that the state made? Have you gotten additional interest from other states sort of on the back of that? Any comments on the margin profile of Naloxone maybe relative to the corporate average would be helpful.\n\nChirag Patel: California supply starts now and will see the increased demand as they ramp up our label. According to the state's press release, they could buy up to 3.2 million units per year. We don't expect them to buy that in the first year. They'll ramp it up as they go. So, somewhere between, we expect, 2 million to 3 million units in the State of California. The remaining contractual terms are confidential. It was a great win for us and we're very proud of the agreement with the State of California and trusting us to supply and valuing the made-in-the-United States product. So we really appreciate it. In terms of the margin profile, it is going to be higher and accretive than the current gross margins.\n\nChintu Patel: It's obviously not just the issue of the State of California. It's an issue across all our states and our commercial teams are actively engaged with other internal parties, both on the state and federal level. So really excited to kind of fill the incremental need that's going to provide for many years.\n\nChirag Patel: Yes. And we have built the capacity to supply 10 million units - up to 10 million units starting early next year. This year, we're producing somewhere between 2.5 million to 3 million units.\n\nNathan Rich: Maybe just a follow up on the cadence of earnings this year. Tasos, I know you kind of pointed to the high end of the range, but I think looking at the historical EBITDA cadence, I think 20% comes in the first quarter typically. Based on what you did this year, that would imply a number well above that kind of high end of the range. So, is there anything to kind of note on just earnings cadence this year that would be different than normal?\n\nTasos Konidaris: You take one quarter, you can never annualize this. So if you think about we finished the year last year with EBITDA of, what, $554 million, right? So we added Q1, so our run rate, right, the last run rate of the last four quarters now, it's almost $600 million, $594 million. So the year is playing out how we were hoping it would, which is acceleration of top and bottom line growth, right? So we're having some great, great improvement. So now we're targeting the high end of the range and you're saying, is there more, right? And you can count on us to try to maximize the performance. But at the same time, right, we're also focused on driving and making investments primarily now at R&D, primarily kind of tuck-in licensing deals, the biosimilar and complex drugs to not just maximize this year or the next, but build a long term growth for 2026, 2027. So you're not missing anything. The only thing we're going to be mindful is we want to make sure we have room in our operating expenses to make investments over the next, call it, nine months, primarily in R&D. And then also, depending how things play out with IPX203, kind of making sure we kind of make the right investments there to drive that growth as quickly as possible.\n\nOperator: The next question is from Leszek Sulewski with Truist Securities.\n\nLeszek Sulewski: Can you just provide some initial update commentary on ONGENTYS, given the new ownership structure, perhaps some feedback from prescribers? And then also on PEMRYDI? And I had a follow-up.\n\nChirag Patel: We're turning it over to Mr. Joe Renda here.\n\nJoe Renda: So far, we've been very pleased with ONGENTYS, as well as the partnership with BIAL. It's been a great partnership, and we've been working very closely with them and their global team, executing upon the strategies that they've learned from over the years. I would say probably the three pieces of feedback that would be significant would be, one, we are hearing very positive feedback from prescribers. There was a concern that ONGENTYS would not be remaining in the market, so prescribers were very pleased when they heard we were going to be taking over this brand. And we've been able to sign on a few more contracts from an access standpoint. So our goal there is to increase the access, the market access that is, for ONGENTYS in the market beyond what it was. And so far, we've been very pleased with that performance and progress. And finally, I would say one of the things we're looking at closely to kind of determine the uptick is what our NBRx performance has been, new patients to brand. And we're up some 20% in NBRxs from a performance standpoint. So far, we're very pleased, and it's been a great partnership, and it's also been a really good augmentation to Rytary.\n\nChirag Patel: Les, you had a question on the PEMRYDI RTU. The way to think about that for Amneal, right, it's another complex innovation. On the injectable side, it's our first 505(b)(2) launch. We'll do two to three a year going forward. And it's a ready-to-use oncology therapy that reduces steps. So think of it as a new factor of growth for the company.\n\nLeszek Sulewski: Now, moving on to IPX203 and with your action date circled for August 7th, can you just talk about perhaps your launch readiness, your plans with the sales force, and just overall impact potential guidance, if any?\n\nJoe Renda: Les, first of all, I would say one of the things that is significant for us is we've really become a leader in the Parkinson's space. Rytary has enabled us to develop and deepen relationships with key prescribers and movement disorder specialists across the country, really around the world for that matter. And that also is coupled with the fact that we've developed a market access capability that has created an access stream for Rytary that's the best in the Parkinson's community. So we enjoy some 70% commercial coverage and about 60 or so percent of the Part D coverage. The ONGENTYS that I just spoke to has enabled us to actually increase our prescriber base. So we're going deeper now into general neurologists. So when you look at our go-to-market strategy with IPX, the three components there are, one, leveraging and working off of those deep relationships that we've built over the last decade in the Parkinson's community. And then second is to leverage that market access capability that we have. We'll use that same strategy to gain access for IPX203, comparable to what we have with Rytary. Finally, I would say that the novel formulation that is IPX203 really offers greater efficacy, better on time, fewer dosing. So the Parkinson's community itself is very excited. In fact, just last night, we were at a Parkinson's Foundation gala and there was a lot of buzz and talk about when IPX203 is coming to market. So we're very ready and eager to get IPX203 to the hands of the patients that need it out there.\n\nChirag Patel: Les, in terms of potential of peak revenues assuming approval. We continue to feel great about it. So the number that we - Rytary right now, there's a couple hundred million dollars in annual revenues, right? The guidance we have given about IPX203 is peak revenues of $300 million to $500 million. We think based on the product profile and the fact that IPX203 is only being used by about 5% of the available patients - Rytary, I'm sorry. So there is a tremendous market opportunity out there for the remaining 95% of the market that's not been utilizing Rytary. And I think our peak year revenue is $300 million to $500 million. I think it's just well within what the team is capable.\n\nOperator: The next question is from David Amsellem with Piper Sandler.\n\nDavid Amsellem: Just have a few questions. Wanted to drill down on the $100 million plus in new product revenue in 2024. Can you talk about the mix between retail and injectable contribution in that $100 million? That's number one. Number two is how much of the injectable contribution is coming from shortage products versus complex products? So that's another question. Also, switching gears to ALYMSYS, the bevacizumab biosimilar, can you just talk about the dynamics here that are driving the strong sales? Is it a limited competition in the market? Are there other things at play here? And just talk about your expectations for that product and what informs your $100 million plus in sales by 2025.\n\nChintu Patel: New product launches, let's just go back a little bit. Last five years, if you go by the NPLs and you total that to this year's revenue is about $765 million we have added in new product launches. And what we see going forward - and this is just within generics injectables and biosimilars. We can break it down for you later on, but stay on the bigger picture is that why we are able to grow this and why in the United States this business - this is just a US number. Internationals are separate. Why this is a big deal? Because I think it's for - over time, people have been focused on price erosion and have ignored the entire biggest market for the affordable medicines is United States and we now expect the next four years - if you annualize our revenue of next four years from - in 2028, that would be additional $800 million to $1 billion added to NPLs. And you know we've been working on such a strong pipeline and in-licensing strong products. On page 7 of our presentation, we have listed out many of them, like 60 products being launched in 2024 and 2025. 15 of them are high value. So you can see more and more high values are happening as you go year out. And we have not disclosed certain pipeline assets for competitive reasons, as well as we have not disclosed some of the in-licensing products that we have or working on it for competitive reasons. So very excited to - and these are risk adjusted number I gave you. So this $100 million is - the breakdown we can provide you later on between the...\n\nTasos Konidaris: I can provide. So $100 million, it's a combination of a couple things. Combination of products, if you remember last year, towards the end of Q4, quite a number of new products, close to I think 13 or so products were approved in Q4 of last year. So that's kind of the annualization of those revenues, as well as new product launches this year. So that $100 million number, it's not a certainty, but a high degree of confidence, point number one. When you break it out between retail and injectable, it's pretty much almost like 50-50, 60-40 between - so it's evenly split. Retail products like Naloxone, right, on one side, injectable products like PEMRYDI and the remaining of the other smaller injectable products. So it's evenly split between retail and injectables.\n\nChirag Patel: Your next question on shortages versus regular. Shortages make up very small numbers at this point. It's our regular products that we've been expanding the market, so demand is coming our way because we are the best quality and consistent supplier out in the market. So our customers are trusting us and more and more trust has been established. Your question regarding ALYMSYS, we have a very strong team. The commercial team has done a superb job. Amneal reputation, Amneal's basket of 300 products, we bring a lot more to the table for our customers than if you're a pure play biosimilar. So this is why I believe, for the future, you will see the companies being more successful who have a broader portfolio and who are working closely, whether it's oncologists, the community oncologists, or the hospitals, or the PBMs because we provide tremendous value to them. So we have a better negotiating powers with them or advantages versus the pure play biosimilars. And we are going to keep improving those. So, ALYMSYS, you will see even higher market share coming up. As well as Fylnetra, when we add OBI, you will start seeing the uptake on the market share as well.\n\nDavid Amsellem: Just to clarify, the $100 million does not include naloxone. I think I saw a footnote for that in the slides, but I just want to make sure that's correct, the $100 million does not include naloxone.\n\nJoe Renda: David, that's correct. The estimate we had on the Q4 call and reiterate, $30 million plus for naloxone, $100 million is for the rest of the NPLs this year.\n\nChintu Patel: David, you can see the five - my brother mentioned five already launched, which are good value products, complex.\n\nOperator: The next question is from Balaji Prasad with Barclays.\n\nBalaji Prasad: Congratulations on the results. Couple of questions from me. Starting with the Generic side, I was slightly surprised to see Amneal's Para IV on XIFAXAN. Bausch has been vehemently defending this from years versus a host of generic companies settled there. So how differentiated is your Para IV versus others? How realistic of an opportunity is this versus any other generic company? And similar question on the Restasis too. For years, generic companies have flagged this as an opportunity and struggle to get approval for their version, how should we think about it? Secondly, on AvKARE, I saw that versus last quarter's presentation where you had the long-term guide at $600 million, you raised it to $650 million. What drove that increase in revenue guidance and what is the EBITDA impact of it?\n\nChintu Patel: So on rifaximin, we always work on very unique and key products and we do have a position. It's something confidential. I don't want to get into the detail. We're excited about rifaximin opportunity. But it remains to be seen how it develops. There are multiple things that is involved. So we cannot comment at this time on any of the details. On Restasis, yeah, it is a very complex product. We are advancing our ANDA and we are expected to launch Restasis next year in 2025. We are very hopeful on that.\n\nChirag Patel: On your AvKARE question, Balaji, is - yeah, it is growing really well. And the lord of government product, VA, DOD has - this is the advantage for - you get some advantage being American company and having manufacturing capacity in America. So we're taking a full advantage of that and this is why you see the growth in AvKARE and it would continue to grow.\n\nTasos Konidaris: Balaji, can you just repeat your other question?\n\nBalaji Prasad: The impact of AvKARE and EBITDA, what I'm also trying to figure out is, with your last 12-months revenue, EBITDA already being close to $590 million and with a stronger revenue trajectory looking that much clearer for us now, what are the upside-downside risks towards the higher end of your EBITDA guidance? And if the AvKARE long-term guidance rate is - and what's the impact of AvKARE guidance raise on the EBITDA too?\n\nTasos Konidaris: What happens is, AvKARE has been growing along with the rest of the business. So we're not relying on any specific segment, whether or not it's Generic, AvKARE, Specialty, biosimilars to kind of carry the day. So our growth continues to be across all our businesses. Point number one. Point number two is, the upsides and downsides of the business is, we continue to rely on new product launches, robust new product approvals and launches to kind of carry the day. So we're not always in control of that. So that depends, as you know, with the regulatory authorities. So some years may be ahead of plan, some years may be a little delayed, but all of those will come. But the cadence of it is not totally in our control. So that's something we just want to be mindful of, number one. Number two is IPX203. So as we discussed, the vast majority of the potential launch expenses of IPX203 are built into our existing guidance, right? So that way we are conservative. If we get approval, then we will have to look at, I think, an incremental top and bottom line contribution of that revenue. So, the downside is protected, the upside has not been built in. And AvKARE just continues to grow nicely. So hopefully that gives you a sense. The final thing I would say is the type of investments we choose to make, right, to kind of drive. So a lot of it is variable, it's within our control. So if we think the year plays out incredibly well, we may choose to make some additional investments. If the year is playing a little tighter than we thought, we may just kind of push back a couple potential deals.\n\nChintu Patel: The momentum, Balaji, has been strong, as you can see, the six key products have been approved already. So, we feel very good on it, how the momentum is great and the pipeline is delivering.\n\nChris Schott: Just a couple for me. Maybe first on biosimilar Prolia and XGEVA. Can you just elaborate a little bit more on the opportunity for these two. And maybe just specifically launch timelines in light of the recent Sandoz (SIX:SDZ) settlement, and of the two brands, is it either more interesting to you than the other, just given obviously different market dynamics between the two of them. Second question, naloxone, between the public market and retail channel, what are you seeing as the bigger opportunity and does the opioid settlement at all impact how you think about that? Kust finally, AvKARE, obviously great performance here, but just interested in your latest thoughts on potential to monetize that business and how you're thinking about that.\n\nChintu Patel: Let's start with biosimilars, Prolia and XGEVA, we are equipped to sell in both channels, the onco channel as well as PBM. We expect the launch in 2026, maybe a bit early. We will see how the filing - I think one is early, one is going to be a little bit later. And we expect. We expect the market penetration to be very good because we already have established relationship and by then we'll have more established relationship with the community oncology groups as well as the hospital groups and contracting PBMs, relationship overall. So we expect to generate a good [indiscernible] should go well above $100 million for these products. Your second question on naloxone, the retail side is slow, the government is where most of the demand is state-wise. Retail is probably 10%, 20%. We already have contracts with CBS and Walgreens to supply them and already have supplied them, both of them. And government is the State of California, biggest state we get. We are working with other major states, obviously our home states. And we should be getting more business from government and this opportunity will become really big. And our settlement does not really impact if you do the math, which Tony can follow up with you later on. There's very little of products which we have 10 million capacity, so no issue whatsoever. And AvKARE, as we have said it earlier, strategic options are open, the business is performing really well. We're not in the rush to do anything. If we get the right price, we will transact. And delever massively, we'll pay down the gross debt in a huge amount, which - it's been a great acquisition for us. And either way, we're fine with the AvKARE.\n\nOperator: Thank you. We have no further questions, so I will hand back over to Chirag Patel to conclude the call. Thank you. Thank you. So Q1 was an outstanding start to 2024 as the momentum builds across all areas of our diversified business. Our recent naloxone launch is the latest example. And at Amneal, we love what we do. And our teams are fired up, high momentum across the company in - all over United States, Ireland, all over India. And we just could not be even more excited for overall the health and the performance of our company. So thank you everyone and have a great day.\n\nEnd of Q&A:\n\nOperator: Thank you, Chirag. This concludes today's call. Thank you for joining.

Rollins School of Nursing.\n\nNew Jersey-based drug manufacturer Amneal Pharmaceuticals has become the latest company to reach a settlement agreement with Delaware and other states for its role in fueling the opioid crisis, the Delaware Department of Justice announced Monday.\n\nThe settlement, worth over $270 million, follows claims that Amneal -- which manufactured nearly 9 billion generic opioid pills from 2006 to 2019 -- \"knowingly failed to monitor and report suspicious orders placed by its customers,\" thereby allowing the overprescription of opioids, according to the Delaware Department of Justice.\n\nIt comes amid a surge in overdoses in Kent and Sussex counties, with state police issuing multiple safety advisories after 125 suspected overdoses were reported downstate within a single week. Analysis by the Delaware National Guard found many of the drugs involved in the overdoses contained both xylazine, the veterinary sedative also known as \"tranq,\" and the synthetic opioid fentanyl.\n\nAmneal has agreed to provide $92.5 million in cash over the next decade to the states involved in the settlement, according to the Delaware Department of Justice. Like past settlements, Delaware's payout will go to the state's Prescription Opioid Settlement\u202fDistribution\u202fFund, which will then disperse the money to organizations dedicated to addressing addiction.\n\nThe rest of the settlement funds will be provided to states in the form of naloxone nasal spray, the opioid overdose-reversing drug more commonly known as Narcan.\n\nAmneal's generic version of naloxone was approved for over-the-counter sales by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration on April 24, according to the company. And while Amneal did not issue a statement following the settlement, the company's co-chief executive officers said they were \"proud to help address this public health emergency\" in a press release regarding the launch of their generic Narcan.\n\n\"While no amount of money can undo the harm that has been done, we will continue to hold pharmaceutical companies accountable for their role in the opioid crisis, both nationally and here in Delaware,\" said Delaware Attorney General Kathy Jennings. \"We have lost too many to this deadly epidemic, and we will stand for it no more.\"\n\nMORE: From

The company's first-quarter sales exceeded expectations, with an adjusted EBITDA that surpassed the consensus by 17%. Amneal also signaled confidence in their financial guidance, suggesting that their projections may be on the conservative side. This is evidenced by robust growth across all segments, including Generics, Specialty, and AvKARE, with significant contributions from new product revenues, increased biosimilar uptake, and an expansion of the AvKARE distribution network.\n\nFurther bolstering the Buy rating is Amneal's aggressive product pipeline, with over 30 new product launches anticipated for 2025, and an expected increase in AvKARE revenue. Additionally, the planned second-half 2024 launch of IPX-203, which has not yet been factored into guidance, presents an upside potential. The resolution of a national opioid litigation further solidifies the company's financial outlook by removing legal uncertainty and having a manageable impact on cash flow. With these considerations, Nathan Rich has raised his estimates and price target for Amneal Pharmaceuticals, maintaining a confident Buy rating on the stock.\n\nIn another report released on May 3, Truist Financial also maintained a Buy rating on the stock with a $9.00 price target.\n\nTipRanks tracks over 100,000 company insiders, identifying the select few who excel in timing their transactions.

There are plenty of qualified candidates who have the brains and skills to become the next leader of the nation. So we decided to come up with a list. Some of the names generated by The Root staff might be expected; others may surprise you. Tell us what you think\u2014and who we might have missed. Stacey Abrams Stacey Abrams has tried multiple times to become the next governor of Georgia but has lost twice. Along the way, she\u2019s gained a huge following and support base; we would not be shocked if she ran for president in the near future and we\u2019d be even less shocked if she won. Ayanna Pressley One of the politicians at the forefront of ensuring abortion access, Rep. Ayanna Pressley (D-MA) will have the support of thousands of women who believe in abortion rights. Cori Bush One thing we know about Cori Bush: she\u2019ll always be one to stand up for Black people\u2019s rights. Bush consistently calls out Republicans and anyone else who is doing things that will negatively affect her people. Kamala Harris Kamala Harris has already tried to work in the Oval Office but failed during her 2020 Presidential campaign. Now, she\u2019s the Vice President which makes her an obvious choice as the next possible president. Michelle Obama Who doesn\u2019t love Michelle Obama? Although she\u2019s never expressed political dreams, she\u2019d be one of the most popular candidates to ever run. Wes Moore Wes Moore made history earlier this year by becoming the first Black governor of Maryland. Why not make more history by becoming the next president of the United States? Raphael Warnock Senator Raphael Warnock\u2019s victory against Republican and all-around idiot Herschel Walker was a huge win for Democrats. He may be eyeing an even larger victory during future presidential elections. Keisha Lance Bottoms Former Atlanta mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms is currently on Biden\u2019s administration, serving as the director of the Office of Public Engagement. Before she accepted that role, she was under consideration as Biden\u2019s VP pick. We can only hope she\u2019s looking for a larger role down the line. Austin Davis Austin Davis is currently Pennsylvania\u2019s second-highest elected official. He\u2019s young, driven, and full of energy. His current role as the lieutenant governor of Pennsylvania could prepare him for a future run as president. Although, these old tweets could haunt him. Hakeem Jeffries The first Black House Democratic leader, Hakeem Jeffries is qualified to run for president, but does he have the name recognition to win the top prize? Maybe not, but man does he have the drive and charisma. Barbara Lee Barbara Lee is a career politician who recently announced plans to launch her campaign for the California Senate. Does she have higher political aspirations? Oprah Winfrey This has less to do with politics and more to do with her astronomical popularity. Everyone loves Oprah Winfrey! If anything, Donald Trump proved that billionaires can win the presidency without any political experience. But here\u2019s the difference. Oprah is smart, empathetic and beloved. Dwayne Johnson Dwayne \u201cThe Rock\u201d Johnson already shot down any rumors that he\u2019ll be running for president in 2024, but it was seriously talked about for a while and was the premise for his sitcom, Young Rock. Robert F. Smith One of the richest Black people in the world, similar to Oprah, Smith could also make a serious bid for president because of his huge influence and presence. Brandon Johnson Brandon Johnson was once an unknown politician who had a goal of becoming the next Mayor of Chicago. In April 2023, he achieved it. If he has his eyes on the White House, don\u2019t doubt him. Antonio Delgado Antonio Delgado is the current lieutenant governor of New York. He\u2019s another young and energetic politician who has the charisma to galvanize a country. Karen Bass Karen Bass has made history before. In 2008, she became the first Black woman to serve as a speaker of a legislative body. Currently she is the Mayor of Los Angeles, don\u2019t be shocked if she has her eyes on a bigger prize. Sylvester Turner The Mayor of Houston has been a politician for more than 30 years, so he has the experience. If he tries to run for president, will he have a chance?", "summary": "<img class=\"type:primaryImage\" src=\"https://i.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fit,q_80,w_636/fd18433b8c36f7dfd2a27533a2a77ec0.jpg\"/><p>Although <a class=\"sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 lcFFec js_link\" href=\"https://www.theroot.com/the-evolution-of-barack-obama-1848853908\">Barack Obama</a> was the first Black person to become the President of the United States, he likely won\u2019t be the last.

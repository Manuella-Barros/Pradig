announcing he is standing as an independent candidate in the election.\n\nCorbyn, who was blocked from standing again for his old party, will seek election in the Islington North constituency he has represented for 40 years.\n\nSir Keir Starmer said his predecessor's move was \"a matter for Jeremy\", as he defended his decision to ban Mr Corbyn from standing for Labour as part of his efforts to \"tear antisemitism out of our party by the roots\".\n\nMr Corbyn has been suspended by Labour since 2020 after he refused to fully accept the Equality and Human Rights Commission's findings that the

They accused the party of having a \"pre-determined outcome\" and \"dragging out the process in order to block her from being a candidate at the election\".\n\nThe Labour party told Newsnight that it does not comment on disciplinary cases.\n\nLabour's National Executive Committee (NEC) wrote to Ms Abbott in December 2023 saying it had concluded its eight-month inquiry into her comments.\n\nIt issued her with a \"formal warning\" for \"engaging in conduct that was in the opinion of the NEC, prejudicial and grossly detrimental to the Labour Party\".\n\nIt said it expected her to undertake an \"online, e-learning module\" which a source said was a two-hour antisemitism awareness course.\n\nMs Abbot did the module in February, after which it is understood she received an email from Labour's chief whip acknowledging she had completed it.\n\nOn Friday, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer told BBC News that Diane Abbott is \"going through, and being part of and getting to the end of a disciplinary process because of something she said\".\n\nHe said it \"would be sorted out now within a few days because the deadline for candidates is coming\".\n\nMs Abbott currently sits as an independent MP and is not allowed to represent Labour in the House of Commons. She has been an MP since 1987, was the first black woman elected to Parliament, and a loyal supporter of former party leader Jeremy Corbyn.\n\nShe is said to be \"angry, depressed and worn out\" by the way she feels the party has treated her, but is said to be buoyed by the support of activists in her constituency.\n\nHer suspension came after she wrote in a letter to the Observer newspaper that Irish, Jewish and Traveller people \"undoubtedly experience prejudice\" which she said is \"similar to racism\".\n\nThe letter added: \"It is true that many types of white people with points of difference, such as redheads, can experience this prejudice.\n\n\"But they are not all their lives subject to racism.\"\n\nIn her apology, Ms Abbott said \"errors\" arose in an initial draft that was sent, adding: \"But there is no excuse, and I wish to apologise for any anguish caused.\"\n\nBBC Newsnight understands Ms Abbott clarified to the NEC that the \"initial draft\" was the only version that had been written.\n\nAsked about Ms Abbott's comments the day after the letter was published, Sir Keir condemned them as antisemitic, saying \"we must never accept that there's some sort of hierarchy of racism\".\n\nThe party said it had introduced an independent complaints process to investigate cases.", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"},

"title": "Labour's race row probe into Diane Abbott 'completed FIVE MONTHS ago'", "body": "Sir Keir Starmer is facing fury after it emerged a race row probe into Diane Abbott ended months ago - but she still hasn't been told if she can be a Labour candidate.\n\nMs Abbott, who has been MP for Hackney North and Stoke Newington since 1987, has had the Labour whip withdrawn for more than a year.\n\nShe was suspended amid an investigation into her comments about Jewish people in a letter to the Observer newspaper in April last year.\n\nAccording to BBC Newsnight, that investigation was completed in December last year with Ms Abbott given a formal warning over her conduct.\n\nShe was also reportedly required to complete an 'antisemitism awareness course'.\n\nBut a source close to Ms Abbott said she is still yet to be told whether she can stand as a Labour candidate in her north London constituency at the general election.\n\nSupporters of the veteran MP on Labour's left-wing hit out at the 'outrageous' treatment of Ms Abbott by Sir Keir and party bosses.\n\nIt also came amid a row over claims Sir Keir is lining up key allies to a string of safe seats after six current Labour MPs announced last-minute retirements.\n\nLast week, ex-Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn - an ally of Ms Abbott - confirmed he will run as an independent candidate after being barred from standing for the party.\n\nSir Keir Starmer is facing fury after it emerged a race row probe into Diane Abbott ended months ago - but she still hasn't been told if she can be a Labour candidate\n\nSupporters of the veteran MP on Labour's left-wing hit out at the 'outrageous' treatment of Ms Abbott by Sir Keir and party bosses\n\nMs Abbott issued a swift apology for her remarks in April last year, after she suggested Jewish, Irish and Traveller people experience 'prejudice' but are not 'subject to racism'.\n\nShe was forced to sit as an independent MP in the House of Commons while a probe was launched into her remarks.\n\nThe BBC reported that Labour's ruling National Executive Committee (NEC) wrote to Ms Abbott in December 2023 saying it had concluded its eight-month inquiry.\n\nIt issued her with a 'formal warning' for 'engaging in conduct that was in the opinion of the NEC, prejudicial and grossly detrimental to the Labour Party', it was claimed.\n\nThe NEC also reportedly said it expected Ms Abbott to undertake an 'online, e-learning module', which she is said to have completed in February.\n\nSir Keir last week refused to be drawn on on whether Ms Abbott would be allowed to stand as a Labour candidate in Hackney North and Stoke Newington.\n\n'The NEC will be coming to decisions on the final list of candidates in due course, so you'll see that when the decisions are taken,' the Labour leader said on Saturday.\n\nLabour told BBC Newsnight that it does not comment on disciplinary cases.\n\nThe revelation sparked intense anger on Labour's left-wing, with a spokesperson for the Momentum group saying: 'This is outrageous news which confirms the Starmer leadership is trying to force Britain's first black woman MP out of Parliament.\n\n'For months we have been told by Keir Starmer that the process is independent and it's nothing to do with him.\n\n'Today's revelation confirms this is another brazen lie from Keir Starmer - the investigation was concluded months ago, Diane remains a Labour member and the whip should already have been restored as a result.\n\n'Starmer's conduct has already been insulting and demeaning to a woman he rightly called a 'trailblazer' - the first step to making amends is to restore the whip and let Diane run as the Labour candidate, as local members wish.'\n\nMeanwhile, the Guardian reported that key allies of Sir Keir are expected to be lined up as candidates in a string of safe seats.\n\nThere has been a last-minute spate of Labour MPs announcing they will stand down from the Commons ahead of the 4 July general election.\n\nThey include Barbara Keeley, John Cryer, John Spellar, Virendra Sharma, Kevin Brennan and Julie Elliott.\n\nSenior Labour figures close to Sir Keir - including NEC members - are tipped to chosen as candidates in the now-vacant seats.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

in December with Ms Abbott given a formal warning over her conduct.\n\nShe was also reportedly required to complete an 'antisemitism awareness course'.\n\nDiane Abbott (pictured) will not be allowed to stand as a Labour candidate in the upcoming general election\n\nA source close to Ms Abbott said she was still yet to be told whether she could stand as a Labour candidate in her north London constituency at the general election, it was reported earlier.\n\nSupporters of the veteran MP on Labour's left-wing hit out at the 'outrageous' treatment of Ms Abbott by Sir Keir and party bosses.\n\nIt also came amid a row over claims Sir Keir is lining up key allies to a string of safe seats after six current Labour MPs announced last-minute retirements.\n\nLast week, ex-Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn - an ally of Ms Abbott - confirmed he will run as an independent candidate after being barred from standing for the party.\n\nMs Abbott issued a swift apology for her remarks in April last year, after she suggested Jewish, Irish and Traveller people experience 'prejudice' but are not 'subject to racism'.\n\nShe was forced to sit as an independent MP in the House of Commons while a probe was launched into her remarks.\n\nMs Abbott, who has been MP for Hackney North and Stoke Newington since 1987, has been suspended from the party since April last year\n\nThe BBC reported that Labour's ruling National Executive Committee (NEC) wrote to Ms Abbott in December 2023 saying it had concluded its eight-month inquiry.\n\nIt issued her with a 'formal warning' for 'engaging in conduct that was in the opinion of the NEC, prejudicial and grossly detrimental to the Labour Party', it was claimed.\n\nThe NEC also reportedly said it expected Ms Abbott to undertake an 'online, e-learning module', which she is said to have completed in February.\n\nSir Keir last week refused to be drawn on on whether Ms Abbott would be allowed to stand as a Labour candidate in Hackney North and Stoke Newington.\n\n'The NEC will be coming to decisions on the final list of candidates in due course, so you'll see that when the decisions are taken,' the Labour leader said on Saturday.\n\nLabour told BBC Newsnight that it does not comment on disciplinary cases.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [],

I can't talk about specific cases.\"\n\nWhen pressed for his view on whether the whip should be restored to Ms Abbott, Mr Reynolds replied: \"The process we have in the Labour Party is frankly not one that any politician in the Labour Party decides. So I can't give you an answer on that.\n\n\"We want that situation resolved, we all want to see that resolved. I genuinely don't know the circumstances that you're describing.\n\n\"I think in any disciplinary matter you need both sides to engage in it, I genuinely have no additional information other than that but we are all keen to see every situation like this resolved as soon as possible.\"\n\nIn March, Ms Abbott claimed Labour would not return the whip for her allegedly anti-Semitic remarks because she was too critical of the party leadership.\n\n\"I will not get the whip back because my 'attacks on the leadership have if anything intensified',\" she wrote on X, formerly Twitter. \"This is the leadership's real agenda.\"\n\nMs Abbott has been openly critical of Labour's economic policy, claiming it is not Left-wing enough and advocating a return to the policies advocated by Mr Corbyn.\n\nShe has mocked Wes Streeting, the shadow health secretary, for urging the NHS to stop doing \"daft things\" in the name of diversity and inclusion, while condemning Sir Keir Starmer over his initial refusal to call for a ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas conflict.\n\nFollowing her suspension, she apologised for her remarks and claimed they were a first draft sent to the Observer newspaper in error.\n\nIt comes after Mr Corbyn announced last week that he will stand against Labour as an independent candidate in Islington North, presenting a major headache for Sir Keir.\n\nThe former Labour leader has unveiled his campaign to defend his north London constituency, which he has represented for more than 40 years.\n\nMr Corbyn appealed to lifelong Labour voters, saying: \"I am here to represent the people of Islington North on exactly the same principles that I've stood by my whole life: social justice, human rights and peace.\"\n\nHe went on to insist those principles were \"needed now more than ever before\" and that he represented \"a genuine alternative to the corrupt years of this Tory Government\".", "source": {"uri": "uk.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news",

She has since apologised, and is understood to have attended an anti-Semitism awareness course in February.\n\nAnd it's understood she was given the party whip back on Tuesday afternoon.\n\nBut Keir Starmer today refused to say whether she would be allowed to stand as a Labour candidate in the election. Asked about the investigation finishing in December, the Labour leader said: \"The process overall is obviously a little longer than the fact-finding exercise.\n\n\"But in the end, this is a matter that will have to be resolved by the National Executive Committee and they'll do that in due course.\"\n\nThe Times reported the party leadership had concluded she would not be allowed to stand under Labour's banner. And it was claimed party figures were attempting to negotiate a way to restore the party whip to her without her being a candidate - either through her agreeing to retire or being offered a seat in the House of Lords.\n\nOn Friday, Deputy leader Angela Rayner told the Mirror she wanted to see a resolution to the row. She said: \"I would like to see a resolution, because I don't think Diane Abbott's career should end in that way. We've had our ding-dongs between us, but there's no question to me of her advocacy and her passion to make lives better.\n\n\"I think it'd be really regrettable if her career ends without this being resolved. That's not something I'm in control of, I don't have the full detail. There's a full investigation and I'm not a part of that. I don't get involved in complaints. But I would hope to see her career in a better place. I don't want her career to end under those circumstances.\"\n\nMs Abbott, who has been an MP since 1987, has said the process \"has EVERYTHING to do with\" Sir Keir. The veteran MP was suspended after she responded to an Observer article headlined: \"Racism in Britain is not a black and white issue. It's far more complicated.\"\n\nShe wrote in a letter to the title: \"It is true that many types of white people with points of difference, such as redheads, can experience this prejudice. But they are not all their lives subject to racism. In pre-civil rights America, Irish people, Jewish people and Travellers were not required to sit at the back of the bus.\" Ms Abbott later said she wished to \"wholly and unreservedly withdraw my remarks and disassociate myself from them\".", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mikey_smith@mirror.co.uk", "name": "Mikey Smith", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whip_(politics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Whip (politics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Labour Party (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Antisemitism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Member of parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackney_North_and_Stoke_Newington_(UK_Parliament_constituency)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hackney North and Stoke Newington (UK Parliament constituency)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_Travellers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Irish Travellers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keir_Starmer", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Keir Starmer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Racism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Executive_Committee_of_the_Labour_Party", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Executive Committee of the Labour Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angela_Rayner", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Angela Rayner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Lords", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "House of Lords"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leader_of_the_Labour_Party_(UK)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Leader of the Labour Party (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Irish people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jews"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "White people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Race-Ethnic-Religious_Relations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Race-Ethnic-Religious Relations", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Employment/Careers", "label": "dmoz/Business/Employment/Careers", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Party_Planning", "label": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Party Planning", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Whips", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Whips", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 82}], "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article32911986.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Diane-Abbott-apology.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9604143", "eventUri": "eng-9604143", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 183, "relevance": 1}

In March Abbott strongly denied reports that had she rejected antisemitism training offered by the party.\n\nLabour figures from across different factions of the party are understood to be furious that the case was concluded so long ago but shadow ministers have continued to present it as ongoing, seemingly not knowing. Others have expressed concern that black Labour members will feel there is no space for them in the party if she is ejected.\n\nAfter the Guardian revealed that the Conservatives' biggest donor, Frank Hester, had told colleagues that looking at Abbott made you \"want to hate all black women\" and that the MP \"should be shot\", Abbott said she hoped to receive some \"public support\" from the Labour leader, Keir Starmer.\n\nIn the wake of the row, Starmer criticised Hester's \"abhorrent language\" but told the BBC that Abbott's suspension \"was for an entirely different issue\".\n\nWhen asked about Abbott's case last week, Starmer said: \"The final decisions on candidates is coming up in a few days' time, I think 4 June - it may be a little earlier, a little later, I can't quite remember. But within a relatively short period of time the final list of candidates will be decided, and that will be a matter for the Labour party's national executive committee.\"\n\nA spokesperson for the leftwing campaign group Momentum said: \"This is outrageous news which confirms that the Starmer leadership is trying to force Britain's first black woman MP out of parliament. For months we have been told by Keir Starmer that the process is independent and it's nothing to do with him.\"", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"},

I think straight up they've been lying to you and to other journalists as well.\"\n\nHe continued to criticise the Labour Party's claim of an independent process, explaining that decisions are politically driven and managed by party officials: \"The decision to open an inquiry is entirely politicised... It's run by the same people it's always been run by in Labour HQ.\"\n\nFisher then compared Abbott's case to that of Corbyn. Corbyn was suspended for a statement made following a report alleging \"serious failures\" during his leadership tenure to handle anti-Jewish racism among supporters.

In one of the biggest developments of the week, it transpires that Sir Keir Starmer's Labour Party will not allow veteran MP Diane Abbott to represent the party at the upcoming general election. Talk about a bombshell...\n\nThe Hackney North & Stoke Newington MP was the first black woman elected to parliament, serving continually since 1987 and achieving a majority of over 33,000 in 2019 -- but Labour's decision this evening is likely to bring her 37-year political career to end. The Labour party could make an official announcement of its decision as soon as today, says the Times, although senior party officials are reportedly in discussions about whether the Labour whip should be restored to Abbott before the July poll to allow her to leave 'with dignity'. Mr S isn't quite sure that will soften the blow...\n\nThe revelation comes after the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire reported this morning that the internal party investigation into Abbott had wrapped up a whole, er, six months ago. Despite this being the case, however, the Hackney North MP -- who was suspended in April 2023 for writing a letter that compared the discrimination suffered by Jewish people and the Traveller community to the taunting of redheads -- was not told of what the outcome meant for her candidate status. In the meantime, Abbott received a formal warning and completed an 'antisemitism awareness course' in February after publicly apologising for her comments.\n\nThe move will likely ignite tensions in Starmer's Labour party -- which has little over a month to go before it finds out how the electorate really feel about it. Abbott's allies certainly haven't been shy about their anger about the MP's treatment in the past, while left-wing Corbynite group Momentum has said today that the delay in resolving her candidate status 'confirms that the Starmer leadership is trying to force Britain's first black woman MP out of parliament'.

She did so in February, having apologised publicly and withdrawn her remarks.\n\nFriends have also raised concerns about the MP's health, and have been urging her to call time on her political career ahead of the July 4 election.\n\nSources confirmed to The Times newspaper, and to Jewish News, that Abbott has been given the chance to stand down as an MP after 37 years with dignity.\n\nClaims that she had been offered a peerage in return remained unconfirmed.\n\nHer exclusion from the general election will allow the Labour leadership to impose a new candidate in Hackney North, where Abbott won a majority of more than 33,000 votes in 2019.\n\nIt is understood that Anntoinette Bramble, deputy mayor of Hackney council, Hackney councillor and Susan Fajana-Thomas, and Mete Coban, also a councillor in Stoke Newington, have expressed interest in standing if Abbott does not.\n\nSem Moema, the London assembly member for North East, who attempted to stand in Islington North could also be a contender.\n\nAbbott was suspended as a Labour MP after suggesting Jewish, Irish and Traveller people were not subject to racism \"all their lives\".\n\nShe later apologised and withdrew the remarks, written in a letter to the Observer newspaper.\n\nKeir Starmer condemned the letter and said he acted swiftly to suspend Ms Abbott. He said that the swiftness with which the MP had had the whip removed demonstrated \"how far the Labour party has changed\" and that Labour has \"zero tolerance\" of antisemitism.\n\nWhen pressed repeatedly on whether Ms Abbott's comments showed prejudice towards Jewish people, Starmer said at the time: \"In my view, what she said was to be condemned, it was antisemitic.\"", "source": {"uri":

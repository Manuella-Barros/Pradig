Airing from 1998 to 2003, the drama followed a group of teenagers living in Massachusetts. Holmes played cool girl Joey Potter, and starred opposite James Van Der Beek, Joshua Jackson and Michelle Williams in the hit series. Last year, Jackson, who played Holmes\u2019 love interest Pacey Witter, told The Times that the core cast are still in touch and part of a WhatsApp group. But this came as news to Holmes, who revealed she\u2019d had no knowledge about it. \u201cUm... really?\u201d she told The Times. \u201cNo! All of us text every now and then, but I wasn\u2019t aware of the WhatsApp. \u201cBut you know what? I\u2019m really bad at WhatsApp. I never check it because it\u2019s a little too much.\u201d Despite not being in the group, The Secret star said she still keeps in touch with the cast \u201cevery now and then\u201d as she added, \u201cEveryone\u2019s grown up and is busy, but the bond will forever be there.\u201d Elsewhere in the interview, the Logan Lucky actor revealed the items of clothing that she\u2019d kept from her time on the show \u201cI kept the sneakers that [Joey] wore in the first episode of the first season. They were little black and white sneakers that I thought embodied the character.\u201d Revealing the existence of the group last year, her former co-star Jackson said: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t get a lot of use but every once in a while someone will crop up. [In January 2023] we passed the 25th anniversary [of the show] so there was a flurry of texts. \u201cIt really centres around, \u2018Oh my God, I can\u2019t believe that we all went through that thing together.\u2019 It\u2019s obviously such a formative point in all our lives.\u201d Pouring water on the possibility of a reboot last year, Holmes said the show was instead a \u201ctime capsule\u201d. \u201cThere have been many discussions over the years. We all loved the experience,\u201d she told Variety. \u201cThere\u2019s a protection that comes along with the discussion. The show was a time capsule. To put it into today\u2019s world might tarnish it a little bit. \u201cIt was right before everyone had a phone and social media and all of that, so there was an innocence that was there between the characters that was one of the things I think people liked about the show. To put it into the setting of today\u2019s world, I\u2019m not sure.\u201d", "summary": "<p>Holmes revealed she wasn\u2019t in the group as she didn\u2019t know it existed </p>", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/news/katie-holmes-dawsons-creek-whatsapp-group-b2559440.html", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/06/09/14/MixCollage-09-Jun-2024-02-33-PM-481.jpg?width=1200", "video": "https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/bIilH6xd-4VHSaSK0.mp4", "publish_date": "2024-06-09 14:41:17", "author": "Maira Butt", "authors": ["Maira Butt"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": 0.261}

Cambridge University researchers have developed new vaccine technology that has been shown in mice to provide protection against a wide range of viruses with the potential for future devastating outbreaks.\n\nTheir aim is to create a vaccine that will protect people against the next coronavirus pandemic - and have it ready before the outbreak even begins. The new approach - called 'proactive vaccinology' - involves scientists building a vaccine before the disease-causing pathogen even emerges.\n\nThe new vaccine works by training the body's immune system to recognise specific regions of eight different coronaviruses - including SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2, and several currently circulating in bats and have the potential to jump to humans and cause a pandemic. Key to its effectiveness is that the specific virus regions the vaccine targets also appear in many related coronaviruses, say scientists.\n\nBy training the immune system to attack those regions, it gives protection against other coronaviruses not represented in the vaccine - including ones that haven't even been identified yet. Conventional vaccines include a single antigen to train the immune system to target a single specific virus.\n\nThat may not protect against a diverse range of existing coronaviruses, or against pathogens that are newly emerging. The researchers explained that the new vaccine, for example, does not include the SARS-CoV-1 coronavirus, which caused the 2003 SARS outbreak, yet it still induces an immune response to that virus.\n\nStudy first author Rory Hills, a graduate researcher in the University of Cambridge's Department of Pharmacology, said: \"Our focus is to create a vaccine that will protect us against the next coronavirus pandemic and have it ready before the pandemic has even started. We've created a vaccine that provides protection against a broad range of different coronaviruses - including ones we don't even know about yet.\"\n\nSenior author Professor Mark Howarth, also of Cambridge's Department of Pharmacology, said: \"We don't have to wait for new coronaviruses to emerge. We know enough about coronaviruses, and different immune responses to them, that we can get going with building protective vaccines against unknown coronaviruses now.\n\n\"Scientists did a great job in quickly producing an extremely effective Covid vaccine during the last pandemic, but the world still had a massive crisis with a huge number of deaths. We need to work out how we can do even better than that in the future and a powerful component of that is starting to build the vaccines in advance.\"\n\nProf Howarth explained that the new 'Quartet Nanocage' vaccine is based on a structure called a nanoparticle - a ball of proteins held together by incredibly strong interactions. Chains of different viral antigens are attached to the nanoparticle using a novel 'protein superglue'.\n\nProf Howarth says multiple antigens are included in the chains, which trains the immune system to target specific regions shared across a wide range of coronaviruses. The findings of the study, published in the journal Nature Nanotechnology, show that the new vaccine raises a broad immune response, even in mice that were pre-immunised with SARS-CoV-2.\n\nThe new vaccine is much simpler in design than other broadly protective vaccines currently in development, which the researchers say should accelerate its route into clinical trials. They believe the underlying technology they have developed also has potential for use in vaccine development to protect against other health problems.\n\nThe work involved a collaboration between scientists at Cambridge, the University of Oxford and the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) in the United States. It improves on previous work, by the Oxford and Caltech groups, to develop a new \"all-in-one\" vaccine against coronavirus threats. The vaccine developed by Oxford and Caltech is due to enter clinical trials next year, but scientists say its \"complex\" nature makes it \"challenging\" to manufacture which could limit large-scale production.", "source": {"uri": "uk.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News UK"}, "authors": [{"uri": "steven_smith@uk.news.yahoo.com", "name": "Steven Smith", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Immune system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vaccine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SARS-CoV-1", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "SARS-CoV-1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Cambridge", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "University of Cambridge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pathogen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SARS-CoV-2", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "SARS-CoV-2"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_response", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Immune response"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Antigen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacology", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pharmacology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mouse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2002\u20132004_SARS_outbreak", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2002\u20132004 SARS outbreak"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanoparticle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nanoparticle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Protein"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanotechnology", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nanotechnology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Oxford", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "University of Oxford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Institute_of_Technology", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "California Institute of Technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature_(journal)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nature (journal)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Clinical trial"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Future", "label": "dmoz/Society/Future", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Immunology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Immunology", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Child_Health/Immunizations", "label": "dmoz/Health/Child Health/Immunizations", "wgt": 48}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Issues", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Public_Health_and_Safety/Disease_Control_and_Prevention", "label": "dmoz/Health/Public Health and Safety/Disease Control and Prevention", "wgt": 33}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 76}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo-1200x1200.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542317", "eventUri": "eng-9542317", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.223529411764706, "wgt": 245, "relevance": 1}

The vaccine trains the immune system to recognize specific regions common to coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2 and potential pandemic viruses. This proactive approach aims to prevent future pandemics by developing vaccines before pathogens emerge. The vaccine uses a nanoparticle structure with attached viral antigens to elicit a broad immune response. The simpler design accelerates its path to clinical trials, and the technology holds potential for vaccines against other health challenges.\n\nA team of scientists from the world's leading universities have developed a new all-in-one vaccine that they hope can protect humans against a broad range of coronaviruses, including ones that are yet to emerge.\n\nThe research published in 'Nature Nanotechnology' on Monday is based on a new approach to vaccine development called \"proactive vaccinology\", where scientists build a vaccine before the disease-causing pathogen even emerges, which has shown promising results in mice.\n\nThe study by the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge in the UK and Caltech in the US says the vaccine works by training the body's immune system to recognise specific regions of eight different coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2 which caused the COVID-19 outbreak, and several that are currently circulating in bats and have potential to jump to humans and cause a pandemic.\n\n\"Our focus is to create a vaccine that will protect us against the next coronavirus pandemic, and have it ready before the pandemic has even started,\" said Rory Hills, a graduate researcher in the University of Cambridge's Department of Pharmacology and first author of the report.\n\nFor example, the new vaccine does not include the SARS-CoV-1 coronavirus, which caused the 2003 SARS outbreak, yet it still induces an immune response to that virus.\n\n\"We've created a vaccine that provides protection against a broad range of different coronaviruses - including ones we don't even know about yet,\" said Hills.\n\nKey to its effectiveness is that the specific virus regions the vaccine targets also appear in many related coronaviruses. By training the immune system to attack these regions, it gives protection against other coronaviruses not represented in the vaccine, including ones that haven't even been identified yet.\n\n\"We don't have to wait for new coronaviruses to emerge. We know enough about coronaviruses, and different immune responses to them, that we can get going with building protective vaccines against unknown coronaviruses now,\" said Professor Mark Howarth in the University of Cambridge's Department of Pharmacology, senior author of the report.\n\n\"Scientists did a great job in quickly producing an extremely effective COVID vaccine during the last pandemic, but the world still had a massive crisis with a huge number of deaths. We need to work out how we can do even better than that in the future, and a powerful component of that is starting to build the vaccines in advance,\" he said.\n\nThe new 'Quartet Nanocage' vaccine is based on a structure called a nanoparticle - a ball of proteins held together by incredibly strong interactions. Chains of different viral antigens are attached to this nanoparticle using a novel ''protein superglue''. Multiple antigens are included in these chains, which trains the immune system to target specific regions shared across a broad range of coronaviruses.\n\nThe latest study demonstrated that the new vaccine raises a broad immune response, even in mice that were pre-immunised with SARS-CoV-2.\n\nThe new vaccine is much simpler in design than other broadly protective vaccines currently in development, which the researchers believe should accelerate its route into clinical trials.\n\nThe underlying technology that the scientific collaboration has developed also has potential for use in vaccine development to protect against many other health challenges.

This approach to vaccine development is called \"proactive vaccinology,\" which seeks to build disease-fighting immunity before some pathogens emerge.\n\nTheir approach, reported in Nature Nanotechnology, trains the immune system to recognize the specific regions of eight coronaviruses including SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2, and several others that are currently circulating in bats and have the potential to jump to humans and cause a pandemic. The team has demonstrated the new vaccine's effectiveness in mouse models. It works because the eight regions targeted also appear in many related coronaviruses. By training the immune system to attack these regions, as opposed to each individual virus, it provides protection against others not represented in the vaccine -- including those that haven't been identified.\n\nFor example, the researchers noted that their new vaccine doesn't include the SARS-CoV-1 coronavirus, which caused the 2003 outbreak, but still induces an immune response to it.\n\n\"Our focus is to create a vaccine that will protect us against the next coronavirus pandemic and have it ready before the pandemic has even started,\" said first author of the study Rory Hills, a graduate researcher at the University of Cambridge department of pharmacology.\n\nSenior author Mark Howarth, PhD, a professor at the University of Cambridge department of pharmacology, added: \"Scientists did a great job in quickly producing an extremely effective COVID-19 vaccine during the last pandemic, but the world still had a massive crisis with a huge number of deaths. We need to work out how we can do even better than that in the future, and a powerful component of that is starting to build the vaccines in advance.\"\n\nWhile conventional vaccines include a single antigen to train the immune system to target a single specific virus, these vaccines may not protect against a diverse range of existing coronaviruses, or against pathogens that are newly emerging. As witnessed by the latest pandemic and the emergence of different SARS-C0V-2 variants, finding ways to develop proactive vaccines is a powerful new approach.\n\nCalled the Quartet Nanocage vaccine, the new vaccine attaches chains of different viral antigens to nanoparticles using what the investigators dub a \"protein superglue.\" With multiple antigens included in each of these chains, the vaccine trains the immune system to target the eight regions that are shared across a range of different coronaviruses.\n\nEven in mice that were pre-immunized with SARS-CoV-2, the vaccine demonstrated a broad immune response. Further, the Quartet Nanocage design is simpler than other vaccines currently in development to provide broad protection, which could help speed its path to clinical trials.\n\nThis new work is a collaboration between the University of Cambridge researchers and teams at the University of Oxford and Caltech. It improves upon earlier work by the Oxford and Caltech groups to develop a novel all-in-one vaccine against coronaviruses. Set to enter early clinical trials in 2025, the Oxford/Caltech vaccine could face significant hurdles due to its complexity, which may limit its large-scale production.\n\nThe hope is the newly created vaccine will overcome this production hurdle and become an important tool in fighting pandemics of the future.\n\n\"We don't have to wait for new coronaviruses to emerge,\" said Howarth. \"We know enough about coronaviruses, and different immune responses to them, that we can get going with building protective vaccines against unknown coronaviruses now.\"", "source": {"uri": "insideprecisionmedicine.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Inside Precision Medicine"}, "authors": [{"uri": "chris_anderson@insideprecisionmedicine.com", "name": "Chris Anderson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Cambridge", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "University of Cambridge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Immune system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vaccine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SARS-CoV-1", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "SARS-CoV-1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SARS-CoV-2", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "SARS-CoV-2"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_organism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Model organism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Immunity (medical)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanotechnology", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nanotechnology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Antigen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacology", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pharmacology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature_(journal)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nature (journal)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pathogen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_vaccine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "COVID-19 vaccine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_response", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Immune response"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Oxford", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "University of Oxford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Institute_of_Technology", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "California Institute of Technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandemic", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pandemic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanoparticle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nanoparticle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mouse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Protein"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Infectious_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Infectious Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Microbiology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Microbiology", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Child_Health/Immunizations", "label": "dmoz/Health/Child Health/Immunizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Livestock", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Livestock", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Malicious_Software", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Malicious Software", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 71}], "image": "https://www.insideprecisionmedicine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/COVID-19-Vaccine-1278437662-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542317", "eventUri": "eng-9542317", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 232, "relevance": 1}

Cambridge University researchers have developed new vaccine technology that has been shown in mice to provide protection against a wide range of viruses with potential for future devastating outbreaks.\n\nTheir aim is to create a vaccine that will protect people against the next coronavirus pandemic - and have it ready before the outbreak even begins. The new approach - 'proactive vaccinology' - involves scientists building a vaccine before the disease-causing pathogen even emerges.\n\nThe new vaccine works by training the body's immune system to recognise specific regions of eight different coronaviruses - including SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2, and several currently circulating in bats and have the potential to jump to humans and cause a pandemic. Key to its effectiveness is that the specific virus regions the vaccine targets also appear in many related coronaviruses, say scientists.\n\nREAD: Stokies can book EIGHTH Covid jab - The Spring Covid vaccination programme\n\nREAD: 'I'm not on my own': Stoke-on-Trent widow takes solace from Covid memorial - Lynn Jones' husband Gareth died from coronavirus three years ago\n\nBy training the immune system to attack those regions, it gives protection against other coronaviruses not represented in the vaccine - including ones that haven't even been identified yet.\n\nConventional vaccines include a single antigen to train the immune system to target a single specific virus. That may not protect against a diverse range of existing coronaviruses, or against pathogens that are newly emerging.\n\nThe researchers explained that the new vaccine, for example, does not include the SARS-CoV-1 coronavirus, which caused the 2003 SARS outbreak, yet it still induces an immune response to that virus.\n\nStudy first author Rory Hills, a graduate researcher in the University of Cambridge's Department of Pharmacology, said: \"Our focus is to create a vaccine that will protect us against the next coronavirus pandemic, and have it ready before the pandemic has even started. We've created a vaccine that provides protection against a broad range of different coronaviruses - including ones we don't even know about yet.\"\n\nSenior author Professor Mark Howarth, also of Cambridge's Department of Pharmacology, said: \"We don't have to wait for new coronaviruses to emerge. We know enough about coronaviruses, and different immune responses to them, that we can get going with building protective vaccines against unknown coronaviruses now,\"\n\nHe added: \"Scientists did a great job in quickly producing an extremely effective Covid vaccine during the last pandemic, but the world still had a massive crisis with a huge number of deaths. We need to work out how we can do even better than that in the future, and a powerful component of that is starting to build the vaccines in advance.\"\n\nThe new vaccine is much simpler in design than other broadly protective vaccines currently in development, which the researchers say should accelerate its route into clinical trials. They believe the underlying technology they have developed also has potential for use in vaccine development to protect against other health problems.\n\nThe work involved a collaboration between scientists at Cambridge, the University of Oxford, and the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) in the United States. It improves on previous work, by the Oxford and Caltech groups, to develop a new \"all-in-one\" vaccine against coronavirus threats.\n\nThe vaccine developed by Oxford and Caltech is due to enter clinical trials next year, but scientists say its \"complex\" nature makes it \"challenging\" to manufacture which could limit large-scale production.\n\nIf you're on the lookout for local news, we have you covered with our FREE email newsletter - sign up in the box at the top of this story or click here.", "source": {"uri": "stokesentinel.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Sentinel"}, "authors": [{"uri": "rob_andrews@stokesentinel.co.uk", "name": "Rob Andrews", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Immune system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vaccine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SARS-CoV-1", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "SARS-CoV-1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Cambridge", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "University of Cambridge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pathogen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SARS-CoV-2", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "SARS-CoV-2"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mouse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deployment_of_COVID-19_vaccines", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Deployment of COVID-19 vaccines"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2002\u20132004_SARS_outbreak", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2002\u20132004 SARS outbreak"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_response", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Immune response"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Antigen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Oxford", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "University of Oxford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Institute_of_Technology", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "California Institute of Technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Clinical trial"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Infectious_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Infectious Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Microbiology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Microbiology", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Child_Health/Immunizations", "label": "dmoz/Health/Child Health/Immunizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive_Health/Sexually_Transmitted_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive Health/Sexually Transmitted Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Malicious_Software", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Malicious Software", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://i2-prod.bristolpost.co.uk/incoming/article7809399.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/3_Coronavirus-Fri-Feb-25-2022.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542317", "eventUri": "eng-9542317", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 231, "relevance": 1}

Of course, mouse studies don't always pan out in humans, but study first author Rory Hills is optimistic.\n\n\"Our focus is to create a vaccine that will protect us against the next coronavirus pandemic, and have it ready before the pandemic has even started,\" Hills, a graduate pharmacology researcher at Cambridge, said in a university news release.\n\nHills' team relied on a relatively new approach to vaccine development, called \"proactive vaccinology\"-- trying to design a shot that shields against viral strains that aren't here yet, but are likely to emerge.\n\n\"We don't have to wait for new coronaviruses to emerge. We know enough about coronaviruses, and different immune responses to them, that we can get going with building protective vaccines against unknown coronaviruses now,\" explained study senior author and Cambridge professor of pharmacology Mark Howarth.\n\nNanotechnology is also a key element in the research. Vaccines work by sensitizing the human immune system to spot and attack one key \"antigen\" on a particular germ's surface.

It's hoped that the product could serve as a broad-spectrum protection against deadly diseases by isolating and including common genetic segments. That includes against viruses that humans haven't encountered yet.\n\n\"Our focus is to create a vaccine that will protect us against the next coronavirus pandemic, and have it ready before the pandemic has even started,\" says Rory Hills, a graduate pharmacologist from Cambridge, who is the study's lead author.\n\nThe Cambridge-led study builds on previous vaccine developments by its partner institutions; one such broad-spectrum coronavirus vaccine built by Oxford and Caltech is due for Phase 1 clinical trials in 2025.\n\nBut this new therapy aims to harness the similarities in antigens across several viruses. Antigens stimulate antibody responses in animals and humans.\n\nFor its latest work, the group produced a multi-viral 'Quartet Nanocage' from 4 viruses.\n\nThese nanocages are protein bundles bound with antigen chains, which provide several targets for the body's immune system.\n\nThey then measured how mice responded, finding vaccine \"boosts\" that omitted segments of SARS-CoV-2 still generated an immune response to the virus. In their study, the authors write \"overall, Quartet Nanocages achieved broad [coronavirus] response\".

Details of the work, a collaboration between the universities of Cambridge and Oxford and the California Institute of Technology, are published in Nature Nanotechnology.\n\nThe universal coronavirus vaccine can be made in existing facilities for microbial fermentation, Hills said, adding that the researchers are working with industrial partners on ways to scale up the process. The nanoparticles and viral proteins can be made at different times in different places and mixed together to produce the vaccine.\n\nMedical regulators do not have procedures for proactive vaccinology and the researchers say these would have to be worked out with the relevant bodies. If the vaccine were found to be safe and effective in humans, one option would be to use it as a Covid booster with the added benefit of it protecting against other coronaviruses.\n\nMore likely is that countries would hold stocks of the vaccine, and others designed to target separate pathogens, once they have been manufactured and approved. \"In the event that a coronavirus or other pathogen crosses over you could have pre-existing vaccine stocks ready and a clear plan to quickly scale up production if needed,\" Hills said.\n\nProf Mark Howarth, a senior author of the study, said: \"Scientists did a great job in quickly producing an extremely effective Covid vaccine during the last pandemic, but the world still had a massive crisis with a huge number of deaths.

Of course, mouse studies don't always pan out in humans, but study first author Rory Hills is optimistic.\n\n\"Our focus is to create a vaccine that will protect us against the next coronavirus pandemic, and have it ready before the pandemic has even started,\" Hills, a graduate pharmacology researcher at Cambridge, said in a university news release.\n\nHills' team relied on a relatively new approach to vaccine development, called \"proactive vaccinology\"-- trying to design a shot that shields against viral strains that aren't here yet, but are likely to emerge.\n\n\"We don't have to wait for new coronaviruses to emerge. We know enough about coronaviruses, and different immune responses to them, that we can get going with building protective vaccines against unknown coronaviruses now,\" explained study senior author and Cambridge professor of pharmacology Mark Howarth.\n\nNanotechnology is also a key element in the research. Vaccines work by sensitizing the human immune system to spot and attack one key \"antigen\" on a particular germ's surface. Reliance on a single antigen can become a weakeness, however, if new viral strains emerge.\n\nIn the new research, the Cambridge group employed a nanoparticle they dubbed a Quartet Nanocage, \"a ball of proteins held together by incredibly strong interactions,\" according to the news release.\n\nThey then engineered a variety of different viral antigens that lodged themselves within this nanocage.\n\nIn theory, that means that a vaccine containing this structure could sensitize immune cells to target a myriad of coronavirus types.\n\nMouse studies suggest that the strategy is successful.\n\nMore from this section Jackson County Health Alert: Feeling Angry?

The vaccine confers immunity against the original SARS virus, despite it not being one of the viruses used to build it.\n\nThere's little doubt that plenty of viruses currently circulating in animals will one day make the jump to humans. Moreover, viruses that have already made that leap will continue to mutate, creating new versions that will evade existing immunity. In a more connected world, such diseases have the potential to spread, and even kill, much faster.\n\nSwifter processes to produce new vaccines may help, but it's never great to be playing catch up. The solution lies in \"proactive vaccinology\", finding ways to protect against viruses that don't yet exist or have not yet infected humans. Although we can never know with certainty the effectiveness of such a vaccine until the virus emerges, Dr Rory Hills of the University of Cambridge and colleagues hope to have something that would provide reasonable confidence.\n\n\"Our focus is to create a vaccine that will protect us against the next coronavirus pandemic, and have it ready before the pandemic has even started,\" Hills, first author of the new study, said in a statement. \"We've created a vaccine that provides protection against a broad range of different coronaviruses - including ones we don't even know about yet.\"\n\nDefending against a truly new type of virus, one with no cousins already infecting humans, could be an almost impossible task. Threats like that are rare, however. Almost all the diseases that plague humanity have close relatives, most notably in the case of coronaviruses.\n\n\"We don't have to wait for new coronaviruses to emerge. We know enough about coronaviruses, and different immune responses to them, that we can get going with building protective vaccines against unknown coronaviruses now,\" said Cambridge's Professor Mark Howarth.\n\nTheir experimental vaccine is called a \"Quartet Nanocage\". At its core is a ball of tightly-bound nanoparticles to which viral antigen chains are attached with a type of \"protein glue\" they and their colleagues created.\n\nExposure to these chains trains the immune system to target regions of coronaviruses that remain consistent across multiple varieties.\n\nThe team of researchers is hardly alone in attempting to produce a proactive coronavirus vaccine. A few scientists have been working on the idea since the original SARS outbreak in 2003, and inevitably efforts accelerated with the COVID-19 pandemic and the vaccine-making advances that came with it.\n\nHowever, the researchers claim their approach is simpler to develop than alternatives. That may sound unlikely, since they are using an array of antigens rather than just one, but if they're right it could make for a more rapid progress, particularly now its promise has been demonstrated.\n\nThe team used Receptor-Binding Domains (RBDs) from the \"Spikes\" of four coronaviruses, including the original Wuhan strain of COVID-19 for injection into mice. They compared this with alternative approaches that used some of the same technology but lacked key stages of the process. Although all the methods tested produced an array of antibodies, the Quartet Nanocage produced both the broadest and strongest response.\n\nCrucially, the resulting antibodies were able to neutralize the original SARS1 virus. Replacing the Wuhan strain in the vaccine with the \"Kraken\" version of Omicron demonstrated the capacity to neutralize the original. Similarly, a version where an RBD from the original SARS1 virus was used proved effective against currently circulating variants. The broadening of responses also worked for mice whose immune systems had previously been primed with the Wuhan spike, indicating the approach could be helpful for people who have already received other COVID vaccines, or been infected.\n\nAs the authors note, medical technologies that work in mice do not always translate to humans. Moreover, even if some protection is provided, the extent of that protection is not known, and probably can't be until the relevant virus emerges. Nevertheless, a widespread vaccine that reduces infections even modestly might have been all we needed in the early days of the pandemic to prevent it from running out of control.\n\nPerhaps most importantly, the same basic technique may prove applicable to other families of viruses, such as influenza.", "source": {"uri": "iflscience.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "IFLScience"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Immunity (medical)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vaccine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SARS", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "SARS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Cambridge", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "University of Cambridge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mutation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mouse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_response", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Immune response"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Antigen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandemic", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pandemic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Immune system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Protein"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wuhan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wuhan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wuhan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SARS-CoV-2_Omicron_variant", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2002\u20132004_SARS_outbreak", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2002\u20132004 SARS outbreak"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_vaccine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "COVID-19 vaccine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Antibody"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Influenza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Infection"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Infectious_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Infectious Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Malicious_Software", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Malicious Software", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Child_Health/Immunizations", "label": "dmoz/Health/Child Health/Immunizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Insects", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Insects", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Malicious_Software", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Malicious Software", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 71}], "image": "https://assets.iflscience.com/assets/articleNo/74070/aImg/76017/nanocage-meta.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542317", "eventUri": "eng-9542317", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2078431372549019, "wgt": 189, "relevance": 1}

Rory Hills, the study's first author, remains optimistic despite the fact that mouse studies do not always translate to human applications.\n\nIn a university news release, Hills, a graduate pharmacology researcher at Cambridge, explained that his research is focused on developing a vaccine that will protect us from the next Coronavirus pandemic.\n\nIn order to develop a vaccine that shields against viruses that have not yet appeared, Hills' research team used a relatively new approach called \"proactive vaccination\".\n\nA new Coronavirus does not have to emerge before steps can be taken. The study's senior author and Cambridge professor of pharmacology, Mark Howarth, says that it is now possible to develop vaccines against unknown coronaviruses based on the current understanding of coronaviruses and their immune responses.\n\nIn addition, nanotechnology plays a key role in the research. A vaccine works by causing the human immune system to recognize and attack one key \"antigen\" on the surface of a particular germ. A single antigen can become weak, however, if new viral strains emerge.\n\nResearchers used a nanoparticle called a Quartet Nanocage that is made up of proteins that are held together by incredibly strong interactions, according to a news release.\n\nThe researchers then engineered different viral antigens to embed themselves within this nanocage.\n\nThis could theoretically lead to a vaccine that sensitizes immune cells to a range of Coronaviruses.\n\nThere is evidence that the strategy works in mice. According to the researchers, mice who received the vaccine were protected from 2003's SARS outbreak even though it did not contain SARS-CoV-1.\n\nTheir reasoning is that nanocage vaccines are relatively easy to develop, and that could be a boon to human clinical trials.\n\n\"We have developed a vaccine that provides protection against a wide range of Coronaviruses - including ones we aren't even aware of,\" Hills said.\n\nIn the news release, Howarth noted that the new initiatives build on past achievements.\n\nAs a result of the last pandemic, scientists produced an extremely effective COVID quickly, but there was still a massive crisis and a high death toll around the world. The key is to begin developing vaccines in advance, and starting to do so in advance is an important part of that process.\"\n\nSEE ALSO:", "source": {"uri": "chiangraitimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CTN News l Chiang Rai Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Cambridge", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "University of Cambridge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mouse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vaccine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacology", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pharmacology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SARS-CoV-2", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "SARS-CoV-2"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Antigen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_response", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Immune response"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanotechnology", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nanotechnology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanoparticle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nanoparticle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccination", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vaccination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Immune system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pathogen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SARS-CoV-1", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "SARS-CoV-1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2002\u20132004_SARS_outbreak", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2002\u20132004 SARS outbreak"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_blood_cell", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "White blood cell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Protein"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Clinical trial"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Microbiology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Microbiology", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Immunology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Immunology", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Child_Health/Immunizations", "label": "dmoz/Health/Child Health/Immunizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Malicious_Software", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Malicious Software", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Public_Health_and_Safety/Disease_Control_and_Prevention", "label": "dmoz/Health/Public Health and Safety/Disease Control and Prevention", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 70}], "image": "https://www.chiangraitimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/HD1714741296221origin.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542317", "eventUri": "eng-9542317", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1529411764705881, "wgt": 452726104, "relevance": 2}], "totalResults": 29, "page": 1, "count": 1, "pages": 29}}}

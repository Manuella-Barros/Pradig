They included a two-year-old child, a man and two women.\n\nOther people are still trapped, some with serious injuries.\n\nThe emergency services have been in contact with some of the trapped people since the early hours of Wednesday. There has been no contact with two of them.\n\nAccording to the police, 14 people were in the hotel at the time. Five were able to escape unharmed when the floor collapsed.\n\nRhineland-Palatinate's state Interior Minister Michael Ebling planned to visit the scene of the accident.\n\nWhat happened?\n\nThe gable roof of the two-storey building collapsed and appears to be leaning, compressing the two floors on one side of the building.

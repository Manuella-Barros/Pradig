(AP) -- The Alabama Department of Corrections, which faced pointed criticism this week from families of inmates during an emotional public hearing, issued a statement Thursday saying the department is working to address ongoing challenges in the state prison system.\n\nThe department said that a number of changes have been made since Corrections Commissioner John Q. Hamm was appointed in 2022. The department said hiring has increased, and there are ongoing efforts to curb the flow of contraband and improve communications with families.\n\n\"Two years is not a long time in state government, but it can seem like an eternity when your loved ones are incarcerated. These public hearings are critical to rebuilding the public's trust in its state agencies through better transparency and accountability,\" Hamm said in a statement.\n\nFamily members of people incarcerated in Alabama prisons packed the Wednesday public hearing held by the Joint Legislative Prison Committee, a panel of lawmakers focused on prison oversight. Several speakers described how their loved ones had died in state custody. Others described beatings, rapes, extortion attempts and rampant drug availability and overdoses behind bars. They also expressed frustration over the state's lack of progress in improving conditions.\n\nThe sister of a man stabbed to death last month was among the speakers. Deandre Roney, 39, died June 8. Before he was killed, his sister said he told prison staff that he was being threatened by another inmate. \"We just want justice and answers,\" Chante Roney, his sister, said at the hearing.\n\nThe Department of Corrections said Thursday that officials have identified a suspect in Roney's death, but the investigation is ongoing.\n\nThe Alabama prison system has long come under criticism for high rates of violence, crowding and chronic understaffing. The U.S. Department of Justice filed a lawsuit in 2020 against Alabama arguing that conditions in the prison system -- which the Justice Department called one of the most understaffed and violent in the country -- are so poor that they violate the ban on cruel and unusual punishment.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

I'm sending these pictures to you because one day you're going to need them. They're going to kill me in here,\" she testified in front of the committee.\n\nHer son was killed at Elmore Correctional Facility last year. \"On December 12, 2023, at 6:30 a.m., we got a call. 'He's dead,'\" she told the committee.\n\nThis is how Martin summed up what she saw from the Alabama Department of Corrections: \"third world country, drugs, murder, extortion, overdoses, gangs, lost hope...\"\n\nThe U.S. Department of Justice is suing Alabama, arguing the prisons are unconstitutionally overcrowded and dangerous.\n\nAt the Joint Prison Oversight Committee hearing in Montgomery on Wednesday, people in the audience cried as families told stories of violence against loved ones behind bars. Many wore T-shirts memorializing family members who died in custody.\n\nRosa Williams testified that her brother, who has schizophrenia, has been stabbed, raped and had his teeth knocked out at Elmore Correctional Facility.\n\n\"The system is not set up to help the mentally ill,\" Rush, who works in the medical field, told the committee.\n\nShe said their family has been extorted by other inmates who demanded money in exchange for his life.\n\n\"I stand here today pleading for his life,\" Williams told the committee. \"Please know my greatest hope is that he comes home alive.\"\n\nRev. Bobby White, who represented a coalition of pastors throughout Alabama, testified about widespread drug use in prisons and asked for more counseling options.\n\nIn the first three months of this year, there were 22 overdose deaths in state prisons, according to statistics from the department of corrections.\n\n\"If you weren't a drug addict when you go into prison, you shouldn't be one when you get out,\" White testified.\n\nShauntae Roney told the committee her brother was on a list for COVID release but was never let out. She said the family frequently requested wellness checks because he faced threats and assaults inside Donaldson prison.\n\nIn June, just five months before his release date, he was stabbed in the head and the back and left outside to die, Roney testified. She said other inmates brought him back inside the facility, but their family never got answers about what happened\n\n'We were saving money all this time for him to be productive [when he got out] and we had to bury him with that money,\" Roney said.\n\nEddie Burkhalter, a researcher at the nonprofit Alabama Appleseed, testified that the prisons have a 61% staff vacancy, leaving them short by more than 2,000 officers.\n\nBurkhalter said the nonprofit obtained records showing that 366 staff were fired between 2018 and 2023, including 134 who were \"charged with work-related crimes, ranging from smuggling contraband to assault and murder.\"\n\nState Sen. Clyde Chambliss presided over the hearing, telling the crowd in an opening statement that \"some folks think that we can just go tomorrow and make changes immediately.\"\n\n\"That's not the way our system is designed,\" he said. \"That's not the way it works.\"\n\nMany lawmakers, including those on the oversight committee, were not present at the hearing. Chambliss said they would be watching remotely.\n\nState Sen. Vivian Figure said she was \"so disappointed when I drove up this morning and the parking lot was empty.\"\n\nFigures, who is not on the committee but testified during the public hearing, said lawmakers should \"spend time in prison for a few days\" to see what prisoners in Alabama go through. She said her son spent time in prison years ago.\n\n\"We have lost so many lives in our state prisons that it is unconscionable and truly unacceptable,\" Figures testified. \"They should do the time but they should be safe.\"\n\nState Rep.

She wouldn't tell me where his body was. She wasn't going to tell me where his body was going to be sent. Basically, all she told me was to contact her tomorrow at 8 a.m. in her office.\"\n\nAlabama lawmakers on the state's Joint Prison Oversight Committee Wednesday heard stories from Mathis and over a dozen family and friends of those incarcerated in state prisons, describing the violence their loved ones faced.\n\nIn a hearing that lasted over an hour, up to 20 people told the Joint Prison Oversight Committee Wednesday about brutality their family members faced from corrections officers and other inmates, including homicide and sexual assault, as well as suicides within the prisons.\n\nOthers demanded accountability from members of the committee and demanded action.\n\n325 people died while in custody of the Alabama Department of Corrections in 2023, according to Alabama Appleseed, a nonprofit that focuses on justice issues in the state. Of the deaths whose cases have been closed, 13 were suicides and 10 were homicides. Another 89 were attributed to overdoses. The remainder are classified as accidental deaths, natural deaths or unknown.\n\nThe violence in men's prisons led the U.S. Department of Justice in 2020 to sue the state, alleging that conditions in the Alabama Department of Corrections violated inmates' Eighth Amendment protections against cruel and unusual punishment.\n\n\"Generally, Alabama's prisons are in chaos,\" said Eddie Burkhalter, a researcher with Alabama Appleseed. \"It has been that way for decades. Folks in prison can't find solace. They are in danger. Oftentimes, that danger is known to them. They ask for help, they can't get it.\"\n\nRepresentatives from the ADOC who attended the meeting declined to comment on Wednesday. Commissioner John Hamm did not attend, and the representatives present sat stoically in their seats with a couple of individuals writing in notepads they had while listening to people's testimony.\n\nSpeakers, called individually to the microphone, each described violence their children, siblings and nephews experienced.\n\nKevin Hyatt said it took five days for DOC to inform his family that his nephew, Christopher Latham, had been beaten at Staton Correctional Facility in Elmore in September of last year. Latham had completed 18 years of a 20-year sentence.\n\n\"He was getting ready to come out,\" Hyatt said. \"He was going to come live with us. He didn't make it, and when we finally got to see him in the hospital, he was brain dead.\"\n\nThe family gave their approval to terminate life support. Latham passed away a day and a half later.\n\nLauren Faraino, director of The Woods Foundation, an organization that supports criminal justice reforms, criticized Hamm; Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall and members of the Alabama Board of Pardons and Paroles for not attending the meeting.\n\n\"The parole board needs to be here because they are absolutely part of the problem,\" she said.\n\nThe Alabama Attorney General's Office had a representative at the meeting who attended in place of Marshall. Sen. Clyde Chambliss, R-Prattville, the chair of the committee, said that members of the parole board were invited to attend.\n\n\"It may have been a little late,\" Chambliss said. \"It was about 30 days ago when I invited them, and I understand now they probably already had everything scheduled, so that is on me. I will get them an invitation earlier next time.\"\n\nChambliss then stopped Faraino from continuing to call out other officials, saying she was out of order.\n\nBurkhalter estimates from records requests that 161 people died in DOC custody from January to June of this year.\n\n\"Our overdose mortality rate in prisons last year, 435 per 100,000 people, was 20 times the national rate across state prisons,\" Burkhalter said.\n\nBurkhalter said a lack of corrections officers and misclassification of offenders is adding to the dangers for people behind bars.\n\n\"The small number of folks who are causing much of the chaos in prison are misclassified, and they are allowed to roam freely in dorms with other folks who are much lower classified,\" he said. \"And so you have folks who are essentially preying on other folks freely, and there aren't officers in the dorms to protect the ones who are preyed upon.\"\n\nThe Department of Corrections face court orders to boost staffing levels. Legislators have dramatically increased the amount of money allocated to the department to help address the issue of violence. Lawmakers provided Corrections with $737 million for the 2025 fiscal year, an increase of about 11% from the previous year.\n\nSince 2002, spending on Corrections has gone up 274%, with much of that increase to pay for corrections officers. Despite that, ADOC administrators have had problems recruiting and retaining people to work in its facilities.\n\nHamm told members of the committee in April that 31 officers graduated from the ADOC Training Academy in March.\n\nHowever, Burkhalter said there is a 61% vacancy rate at major facilities.\n\nCapacity is another issue. According to DOC, closed security facilities such as Donaldson Correctional Facility in Jefferson County are at 147% capacity while medium security sites such as Bibb Correctional Facility in Brent, Alabama have nearly double, 191%, of people in prison that they should.\n\n\"Some prisons are much higher than individual prisons,\" Burkhalter said. \"They are not designed to keep this many people. Designs are there for a reason, they are for safety. We have created a system where it is just chaotic.\"\n\nCriminal justice reform advocates have blamed the Alabama Board of Pardons and Paroles low parole grants for exacerbating the problem.\n\nThe Legislature changed the leadership of the board in 2019, which led to a sharp decline in parole grants. The board granted 31% of parole applications in 2019. That number fell to 20% in 2020 and 15% in 2021. The ACLU said last year that the rate had fallen to 7%. Rep. Chris England, D-Tuscaloosa, said during the meeting that the parole rate had increased to 20% this year.\n\nChambliss at the meeting Wednesday noted the Legislature last spring passed SB 322, which Chambliss sponsored. The legislation directs DOC to hire staff to provide families and loved ones of those incarcerated with information about their loved ones in DOC custody.\n\n\"It gives the commissioner of Corrections a lot more flexibility and accountability in his management team,\" Chambliss said during the meeting. \"That is a good thing.\"\n\nThat, however, was the only bill that lawmakers passed to address the problems with Corrections.\n\n\"I am going to continue sponsoring bills that I always sponsor to continue the conversation,\" England said in an interview after the meeting. \"Hopefully, we come to an accord on a couple of them, maybe get a couple of them passed.\"\n\nOther legislators on the committee defended their role in addressing the problems with Corrections.\n\n\"We have allocated money to build a new prison, we need more, there is no question that is accurate,\" said Rep. Jim Hill, R-Odenville, chair of the House Judiciary Committee. \"We have allocated money for facilities like Perry County, Shelby County, that prepare people for release. It allows people for sanctions instead of putting people back in prison, to sanction them for short periods of time in those facilities.\"\n\nEngland said he will move forward with other reforms he wants even though most of the criminal justice reform bills he sponsored have either stalled or failed.\n\n\"Jails, criminal justice reform, is not a politically popular issue,\" he said. \"It is just not. Every time we get into these conversations, I am just trying to let everyone out of prison, which, once you capture it that way, it is over. The conversation ends. That is not politically popular. That will not get you reelected.\"", "source": {"uri": "rawstory.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Raw Story"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prison_warden",

Clyde Chambliss, R-Scottsboro, opened the Joint Prison Oversight Committee's annual public hearing by telling the people waiting to speak that they should not expect too much.\n\n\"As a reminder, some folks think that we can just go tomorrow and make changes immediately,\" he said. \"That's not the way our system is designed, that's not the way it works.\"\n\nTrying to head off contentious comments, Chambliss then explained the separation of powers in Alabama's state government and said the legislature does not \"deal with the day-to-day affairs of running government.\"\n\nOne member of the public, Tim Mathis, spoke about the death of his son Chase in Elmore Correctional Facility.\n\nSuffering from a prescription pain pill addiction, Chase crashed his car in 2014, killing his friend and sending him to the hospital. In 2017, he was sentenced to fifteen years on a manslaughter charge.\n\nOnce in prison, Tim Mathis says his son could not enroll in a substance abuse program and was even initially denied the wheelchair he needed after the accident.\n\nBut his family, Mathis stated, still \"had no idea at the time that took place it was going to turn into a death sentence at the hands of the ADOC.\"\n\n\"I answered the phone,\" he remembered. \"[The warden] said 'Mr. Mathis?' I said 'yes,' she said 'I have bad news for you, Chase is deceased.' It was just that short, just that blunt.\"\n\nChase had died of an overdose on June 4. His father believes it may have been murder but that the availability of drugs in Alabama prisons is a major problem regardless.\n\n\"Now Chase did have an addiction problem, but you can't lock a drunk up in a liquor store and expect him to stay sober,\" Mathis told the committee. He said he will begin paying for billboards in the Montgomery area criticizing the ADOC and Gov. Kay Ivey soon.\n\nSeveral other Alabamians also advocated for criminal justice reform at the committee hearing.\n\nRosalyn Warren, a self-identified \"believer in rehabilitation,\" nevertheless admitted that \"most of these people who are incarcerated, they're not in there because they're singing in a choir too loud.\"\n\n\"But anybody who's punished for a crime, the punishment is to be removed from society, not to be assaulted, not to be killed, and not to be treated inhumanely,\" she continued.\n\n\"When my father went to prison, he was just a thug, just a really bad type of a person,\" Warren said. \"But because my dad went to prison early, and he was rehabilitated as far as education ... me and all my siblings, we all have college degrees and no one has a criminal record.\"\n\nWhen talking to the committee, she specifically pointed to the criminal justice system in Norway as an exemplar.\n\nIn the '80s and '90s, the recidivism rate in Norway was around two-thirds. Then the country invested more into their prisons and began focusing on rehabilitation. Now only around 25 percent of former inmates reoffend within 5 years of release.\n\nBy way of comparison, the 3-year recidivism rate in Alabama is 29 percent. One 2021 study of 24 states, including Alabama, by the U.S. Department of Justice found the 10-year recidivism rate in America was 82 percent.\n\nMatthew Charles, who was the first person released from prison under the First Step Act and one of President Donald Trump's guests at the 2019 State of the Union, also spoke to the committee on behalf of Families Against Mandatory Minimums.\n\nCharles highly praised SB322, which increased staffing and transparency at the ADOC. However, he said the bill \"would not have prevented many of the deaths and horror stories we hear today\" and called it \"a step in a series of steps that are necessary, and not a resting point.\"\n\nJoseph Hyatt, whose nephew was killed in prison last year, said he understands that things take time but that the committee has been \"overlooking what's going on in the prisons.\"\n\n\"We've got a hundred and fifty deaths so far,\" Hyatt said. \"Now some of them are murders, some of them are drug-related. Your prison system, I don't see where y'all are doing anything different.\"\n\n\"You've got to act quick,\" he told the committee.\n\nOther speakers called out the drug problem in Alabama's prisons, said \"super prisons\" are not the answer, and tearily recounted their personal stories of family members dying while in state custody.\n\nFormer Alabama Governor Don Siegelman and state senator Vivian Figures, D-Mobile, both criticized the Alabama prison system and spoke about why significant reform is needed.\n\n\"I had not planned to speak this morning, but as I sat there and listened to the testimonies of these people, I couldn't help but be pulled to this microphone,\" Figures said.\n\n\"[Inmates] are in the care of the Department of Corrections of the state of Alabama,\" she said. \"And it is our responsibility to keep them safe, which is what the federal government have told us and mandated that we do. But we haven't.\"\n\nFigures complained that hardly any members of the state legislature attended the committee meeting despite being invited. She then suggested that \"legislators need to spend some time in these prisons for a couple, three days without any protection\" in order to understand prisoners' plight.\n\nChambliss rejoined that he had only invited the legislators a couple weeks earlier and many already had plans. State representative Chris England, D-Tuscaloosa, stated that they had the highest turnout of state legislators ever.\n\n\"Now is not the time to get discouraged, to get mad, and point fingers,\" England said. \"Now is the time to continue to organize. Build your army and continue fighting.\"", "source": {"uri": "alreporter.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Alabama Political Reporter"}, "authors": [{"uri": "chance_phillips@alreporter.com", "name":

Henning, aged 59 and originally from New York, had led the Church in Providence, Rhode Island, since last summer.\n\nThe Boston archdiocese is expected to host a press conference later Monday to announce further details, including when Henning will be officially installed in his new role.\n\nHenning is relatively new among U.S. bishops. He was first appointed as an auxiliary bishop of Rockville Centre, New York by Francis in 2018. He was made bishop of Providence, the capital of the country's smallest state, in 2023.\n\nO'Malley turned 80, the typical retirement age for Church service, on June 29. While he was named the archbishop of Boston by Pope John Paul II in 2003 and was made a cardinal by Pope Benedict XVI in 2006, Francis had considerably elevated his public profile, and treated him as a close ally.\n\nIn his first year as pope in 2013, Francis appointed O'Malley as a member of his influential kitchen cabinet of high Church officials, known as the Council of Cardinals. In 2014, Francis also tasked O'Malley with leading the Vatican's first official commission on clergy sexual abuse.\n\nThe task force, formally known as the Pontifical Commission for the Protection of Minors, was roiled last year by the shock resignation of one of its members, a globally known abuse prevention expert.\n\nAt the time, O'Malley said he had been \"surprised\" by the resignation and disagreed with the person's decision.\n\nThe Vatican did not immediately say when O'Malley would step down from his Vatican roles, but, according to age limits on Church service, would be expected to do so soon.\n\nThe Boston archdiocese is the fourth-largest Catholic archdiocese in the U.S., and includes an estimated 1.8 million Catholics, according to its website.\n\n(Reporting by Joshua

The Boston Globe and NBC News confirmed the news with anonymous sources. Palmo called the pick a \"shock.\"\n\nHenning, 59, became the leader of the Providence diocese in May of last year. He previously served in New York and is fluent in Spanish and Italian and is literate in French, Greek, and Hebrew, according to an online bio from the diocese.\n\nO'Malley was appointed as archbishop in 2003 and, at 80, has already led Greater Boston's Roman Catholic community for longer than expected. (Catholic bishops are asked to retire at age 75, and 80 is also the age when bishops are no longer eligible to vote for a new pope.)\n\nPreviously, he served in Florida, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and then in Fall River starting in 1992 amid sexual abuse scandals involving Rev. James Porter. In 2002, the Globe reported that O'Malley pioneered new policies on clergy sexual abuse and settled more than 101 cases against Porter.\n\nO'Malley played a similar role in Boston in 2003, where a similar, wide-spread scandal \"victimized hundreds, eroded church attendance, and has led the church in Boston to the brink of bankruptcy,\" the Globe reported at the time. He replaced Cardinal Bernard F. Law, who resigned when it was exposed that he covered up the sexual abuse of children.\n\nEarlier this year, O'Malley, ordained in the Order of Friars Minor Capuchin, reflected in the Globe on his decades at the helm of the Archdiocese of Boston and said he'd depart \"soon.\"\n\nEric MacLeish, a attorney who represented hundreds of clergy abuse victims, told the Globe in the same story that O'Malley was compassionate, met with all of his clients, and \"did the right thing.\"\n\n\"We were in a terrible crisis,\" O'Malley told in the Globe about his start. \"I think we've come a long way from there towards establishing a sense of peace.\"\n\nOn its website, the diocese praises O'Malley for leadership decisions including becoming the first cardinal in the world to launch a personal blog in 2006, his work against abortion rights, and his outreach to young Catholics.", "source": {"uri": "boston.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Boston"}, "authors": [{"uri":

In 2018, he released a scathing statement criticizing Francis after the pope disregarded allegations of abuse by Chilean survivors of the nation's most notorious offender.\n\nO'Malley's strong language served as a wake-up call for Francis, who ultimately apologized after initiating an investigation into the Chilean scandal.\n\nMore recently, O'Malley's commission identified \"significant issues\" in the way the Vatican had managed the case of a former Jesuit artist, the Rev.

Henning becomes a metropolitan archbishop, with direct authority over Boston and an indirect supervisory role over six other dioceses in Massachusetts, Vermont, New Hampshire and Maine.\n\nThe Vatican's 5 August statement brought confirmation following rumours first reported by Rocco Palmo, a veteran Catholic writer, indicating that O'Malley, who turned 80 earlier this summer and is no longer able to vote in the next conclave, was retiring and being replaced by Henning.\n\nA Capuchin Franciscan, O'Malley has served as the Archbishop of Boston since 2003. Prior to Boston, he served as bishop of Saint Thomas in the American Virgin Islands, then as bishop of Fall River, Massachusetts, and then as bishop of Palm Beach, Florida.\n\nSpeaking fluent Spanish, O'Malley has long had a reputation for his work with and advocacy on behalf of migrants and the impoverished, having served various immigrant communities.\n\nHe is also well known for his efforts to advance child protection. He took over in Boston from Cardinal Bernard Law, who resigned in 2002 amid the fallout of the clerical sexual abuse scandals, including allegations of coverup, that exploded in the United States after a massive expose by the Boston Globe, leading to the US Church adopting sweeping reform across the nation of safeguarding policies.\n\nIn 2013, O'Malley was selected as an original member the Pope's then-newly formed Council of Cardinals, to both represent North America and advise the Pope on matters of church governance and reform. O'Malley is one of the few original members to remain in the group.\n\nIn large part because of his successful reform efforts in safeguarding, O'Malley in 2014 was appointed to lead the Pontifical Commission for the Protection of Minors (PCPM). In that role he had to navigate several high-profile cases, including the scandals in 2018 surrounding American former cardinal and former priest Theodore McCarrick, and the ongoing case of Slovenian Father Marko Rupnik.\n\nO'Malley recently made waves for penning a letter to the prefects and heads of Vatican departments regarding the display, including online, of artwork produced by Rupnik, a famed priest artist, asking that \"pastoral prudence would prevent displaying artwork in a way that could imply either exoneration or a subtle defence\" of alleged abusers \"or indicate indifference to the pain and suffering of so many victims of abuse\".\n\nRELATED:\n\nHis letter came shortly after Italian layman Paolo Ruffini, prefect of the Vatican Dicastery for Communications, had caused backlash for defending his departments continued use of Rupnik's artwork on their website, and for implying that the abuse was not as serious since it did not involve minors.\n\nDespite stepping down as archbishop of Boston, O'Malley is expected to stay on at the commission, for the time being, at the personal request of Pope Francis.\n\nPhoto: Cardinal Sean O'Malley with Pope Francis in 2018.

(WPRI) -- Pope Francis announced Monday he is appointing Roman Catholic Bishop of Providence Richard Henning as the new archbishop of Boston.\n\nHenning, 59, will replace Cardinal Sean O'Malley, one of the most prominent prelates in the United States and a close ally of Pope Francis. O'Malley, 80, at one time served as bishop of Fall River, where he dealt with the fallout from the sex abuse crisis.\n\nArchbishop-elect Henning will be formally introduced by O'Malley at a 10 a.m. press conference.\n\nHenning's appointment comes as a surprise since he was only appointed bishop of Providence just last year. He succeeded Bishop Thomas Tobin, who had been in the position since 2005.\n\nBACKGROUND: Providence bishop set to succeed O'Malley in Boston\n\n\"Over the last two years, you may have noticed that I usually have something to say. I regret that in this instance, I do not feel that I can find the words to express my sorrow in leaving the Church of Providence,\" Henning said in a statement. \"In so many ways and moments, you have welcomed me into your churches, homes, and hearts. Your resilience in the face of challenges, your commitment to family and community, and your abiding faith in Jesus have lifted me and taught me. I am ever in your debt.\n\n\"When I arrived in Rhode Island, I spoke about my delight in the state motto and the fact that I would now live in a state of hope,\" he continued. \"Having now visited communities across Rhode Island, I say with great certainty that it is you, the people of this beautiful state - you are that hope! I will never cease to pray for you, and I hope for your prayers for me.\"\n\nIt's unclear who will replace Henning in the Providence diocese. The Rev. Msgr. Albert Kenney currently serves as the diocese's vicar general and could be asked to lead the church locally until Henning's permanent successor is named.\n\nHenning will remain as the Apostolic Administrator of the Diocese of Providence until he takes office as Archbishop of Boston on Thursday, October 31.\n\nThis is a Breaking News story.

Henning of Providence to succeed Cardinal Se\u00e1n P. O'Malley as the archdiocese's 10th bishop and seventh archbishop.\n\nAccording to the archdiocese, the archbishop-elect will be installed on Oct. 31. Cardinal O'Malley remains Archbishop of Boston until that date.\n\nAn announcement of the new appointment issued by the archdiocese said Cardinal O'Malley and Archbishop-elect Henning will celebrate Mass together this morning at the archdiocese's Pastoral Center at 9 a.m., followed by a joint press conference at 10 a.m. The press conference can be viewed live at vimeo.com/event/4489023.\n\nAccording to rules set by Pope Paul VI, all bishops must submit their resignation to the pope at age 75, which the pope is free to accept or defer as he chooses. However, because the same rules dictate that cardinals lose their appointments in Vatican dicasteries and may not participate in the conclave to elect the next pope once they turn 80, it is typically expected that the pope will accept the resignation of active cardinals at or around that age.\n\nCardinal O'Malley celebrated his 80th birthday on June 29.\n\nArchbishop-elect Henning, 59, was born in Rockville Centre, New York in 1964 to Richard and Maureen Henning, the first of five siblings. He grew up in Valley Stream, receiving the sacraments of baptism, first Holy Communion, and confirmation at Holy Name of Mary Parish, where he also attended the parish grammar school.\n\nArchbishop-elect Henning attended Chaminade High School in Mineola, New York, going on to earn bachelor's and master's degrees in history from St. John's University in Queens, New York. He studied for the priesthood at the Seminary of the Immaculate Conception in Huntington, New York and was ordained in 1992.\n\nFollowing his ordination, he was assigned to a local parish for five years and gained extensive pastoral experience working in the parish school and ministering to the Spanish-speaking Catholics of the area.\n\nIn 1997, then-Father Henning was assigned to postgraduate studies in Sacred Scripture. He earned a Licentiate in Biblical Theology at The Catholic University of America in Washington, D.C. and a Doctorate in the same subject from the University of St. Thomas Aquinas in Rome.\n\nAfter his studies, Archbishop-elect Henning joined the faculty of the Seminary of the Immaculate Conception in Huntington, where he taught scripture for more than 10 years.\n\nIn 2012, as part of the partnership for seminary formation among the Dioceses of Rockville Centre, Brooklyn, and the Archdiocese of New York, then-Msgr. Henning was appointed to lead the Seminary of the Immaculate Conception through its transition to the largest retreat house in the Northeast. The ordinaries of Rockville Centre, Brooklyn and New York also charged him to establish and lead the Sacred Heart Institute for the ongoing formation of Catholic priests and deacons. Bishop Henning is also noted for his work with international priests serving in the U.S.\n\nIn 2018, Pope Francis appointed Archbishop-elect Henning as an auxiliary bishop in the Diocese of Rockville Centre, where he served as a regional vicar and later as the Vicar for Clergy and Pastoral Planning.\n\nIn November 2022, Archbishop-elect Henning was appointed the Coadjutor Bishop of Providence. He succeeded Bishop Thomas Tobin as the Bishop of Providence on May 1, 2023.", "source": {"uri": "thebostonpilot.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Pilot"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Prior to Boston, he served as bishop of Saint Thomas in the American Virgin Islands, then as bishop of Fall River, Massachusetts, and then as bishop of Palm Beach, Florida.\n\nSpeaking an idiomatically fluent Spanish, O'Malley has long had a reputation for his work with and advocacy on behalf of migrants and the impoverished, having served various immigrant communities.\n\nHe is also well known for his efforts to advance child protection, having taken over in Boston for Cardinal Bernard Law, who resigned in 2002 amid the fallout of the clerical sexual abuse scandals, including allegations of coverup, that exploded in the United States after a massive expose by the Boston Globe, leading the entire national church to adopt a sweeping reform of safeguarding policies.\n\nO'Malley in 2013 was selected as an original member the pope's then-newly formed Council of Cardinals advising him on matters of church governance and reform, to represent North America. He is one of the few original members to remain in the group.\n\nIn large part because of his successful reform efforts in safeguarding, O'Malley in 2014 was also tapped to lead the Pontifical Commission for the Protection of Minors (PCPM), a role in which he has had to navigate several high-profile cases, including the scandals in 2018 surrounding American former cardinal and former priest Theodore McCarrick, and the ongoing case of Slovenian Father Marko Rupnik.\n\nO'Malley recently made waves for penning a letter to the prefects and heads of Vatican departments asking them to exercise \"pastoral prudence\" in the display, including online, of artwork produced by Rupnik, who is accused of abusing at least 30 adult women.\n\nHis letter came shortly after Italian layman Paolo Ruffini, prefect of the Vatican Dicastery for Communications, had caused backlash for defending his departments continued use of Rupnik's artwork on their website, and for implying that the abuse was not as serious since it did not involve minors.\n\nRELATED: Pope's safeguarding czar urges Vatican to take down Rupnik artwork\n\nDespite stepping down as archbishop of Boston, O'Malley is expected to stay

Revelations of years of abuse and coverups by the church led to the downfall of then-archbishop Cardinal Bernard Law, who resigned in disgrace in December 2002.\n\nAt age 80, O\u00b4Malley is five years beyond the normal retirement age for bishops. His 59-year-old successor, Henning, from Rockville Centre, Long Island, has been bishop of Providence since last year.\n\nFrancis has long expressed his esteem for O'Malley and selected him as a founding member of his core cardinal advisers, known as the C9.\n\nIn that role O\u00b4Malley, a Franciscan friar, advised Francis not only on child protection issues, but also helped design the reform of the Vatican bureaucracy.\n\nFILE - In this Sunday, March 10, 2013 file photo, U.S. Cardinal Sean Patrick O'Malley arrives to the Santa Maria alla Vittoria church in Rome to celebrate Mass.

Here's what to know about Bishop Richard Henning. - The Boston Globe", "body": "RelatedBishop of Providence to be named successor to Boston's Cardinal O'Malley\n\nO'Malley will introduce Henning at a news conference later this morning.\n\nHenning, 59, and the ninth Bishop of Providence for just over a year now, was the auxiliary bishop in the Diocese of Rockville Centre, N.Y., which covers most of Long Island, when it filed for bankruptcy in 2020 after hundreds of sexual abuse cases were filed against it.\n\nHenning was born in Rockville Centre, N.Y., in 1964, and is the oldest of five children, according to an online biography posted by the Diocese of Providence.\n\nGrowing up, Henning spent time on a small island in the Great South Bay, a bay between Long Island and Fire Island in New York, where \"he developed a lifelong passion for the water, sailing, boating, and kayaking on the bay,\" the biography said.\n\nHenning told the Globe in a 2022 interview that when he was in fifth grade, a priest spoke about vocations and Henning turned to a classmate and said, \"I think I want to be a priest.\"\n\n\"That idea came and went over my childhood, but never quite went away,\" Henning said. \"You kind of feel that tug of the Holy Spirit. I realized at one point that I had to respond.\"\n\nHe said while his local parish was influential, his calling began at home. Henning's father was a firefighter and his mother was a nurse, he told the Globe.\n\n\"Both of [my parents] chose paths in life that were devoted to others,\" he said. \"That left a mark on me.\"\n\nHenning went to Chaminade High School in Mineola, N.Y., and then attended St. John's University in Queens, N.Y., where he obtained a bachelor's degree and a master's degree, both in history, the biography said.\n\nHenning is fluent in English, Spanish, and Italian, and can read French, Greek, and Hebrew, according to his biography.\n\nHenning writes columns in the Rhode Island Catholic called \"The State of Hope.\" An article published on July 25 recounted his experience at the National Eucharistic Congress in Indianapolis, Ind.\n\nHenning trained for the priesthood at the Seminary of the Immaculate Conception in Huntington, N.Y., his biography said. He was ordained in 1992.\n\nHenning served for five years as an associate pastor at St. Peter of Alcantara Roman Catholic Church in Port Washington, N.Y., according to his biography.\n\n\"In that assignment, he did extensive pastoral work in the large parish school and ministered to the Spanish-speaking Catholics of that peninsula,\" the biography said.\n\nAfter being assigned to post-graduate studies in 1997, Henning went to the Catholic University of America in Washington, D.C., to earn a licentiate in biblical theology, his biography said. The degree is obtained by those who intend to teach ecclesiastical faculties, according to the university's website.\n\nHe earned a doctorate in the same discipline from the Pontifical University of St. Thomas Aquinas in Rome.\n\nHenning then taught for more than 10 years at the Seminary of the Immaculate Conception, where he had trained for the priesthood.\n\nIn 2012, Henning was appointed to lead the Seminary of the Immaculate Conception, according to his biography. He was also tasked with establishing and leading the Sacred Heart Institute \"for the ongoing formation of Catholic priests and deacons,\" his biography said.\n\nHenning was appointed the episcopal vicar for the Central Vicariate of the Diocese of Rockville Centre in 2017, according to his biography.\n\nFrom 2018 to 2022, Henning served as auxiliary bishop for the Diocese of Rockville Centre, N.Y. He was consecrated a bishop on July 24, 2018, in St. Agnes Cathedral in New York, his biography said.\n\nHe was then named a coadjutor bishop alongside Bishop Thomas Tobin in Providence until Tobin's retirement in 2023.\n\nThe Rockville Centre diocese filed for bankruptcy in 2020 after hundreds of sexual abuse cases were filed against it under New York's Child Victims Act.\n\nThe act allows survivors the time to file claims despite the statute of limitations. The bankruptcy case was sent to mediation in May after the majority of survivors rejected a proposed $200 million settlement and the archdiocese sought to dismiss its bankruptcy.\n\nHenning told the Globe in 2022, when he was named coadjutant bishop of Providence, that the bankruptcy had been \"a long and difficult process,\" but also a \"learning experience\" that he hoped to never go through again.\n\n\"The decision to enter into Chapter 11 was driven by the desire to first have the resources to address survivors, but also to be able to continue the mission of the church,\" Henning said.\n\nHenning said he has respect for Rockville Centre Diocese's leadership for their handling of the bankruptcy.\n\nMike McDonnell, a spokesman for SNAP, the Survivors Network of Those Abused by Priests, told the Globe in 2022 that \"despite repeated pledges from church officials to be open and transparent, church officials in Rockville Centre hid important information about clergy abuse from the public.\"\n\n\"Bishop Henning held a high ranking position in the Diocese of Rockville Centre and we can't help but think that he could have done more,\" McDonnell said.\n\nTobin, whom Henning replaced in Providence, was known for his outspoken opposition to same-sex marriage and abortion rights. Tobin criticized Pope Francis in 2020 for his support for same-sex civil unions.\n\nHenning, on the other hand, told the Globe in the 2022 interview that his beliefs align \"entirely\" with the pope's.\n\nThe pope is \"a remarkable person. He is just amazing,\" Henning said. \"Do I in any way dissent from him? When it comes to Catholic teaching, no, I do not.\"\n\nThe archdiocese had a $15 million annual deficit when O'Malley took over in 2003 amid the abuse scandal and the lawsuits that followed, but two decades later in 2023, it had a $13 million surplus, according to prior Globe reporting. However, weekly church attendance and Catholic school enrollment have continued to decline.\n\nThe Rev. Laura Everett, executive director of the Massachusetts Council of Churches, said in a statement she welcomed Henning to Boston and noted that several other denominations have also recently chosen new local leaders.\n\n\"We give thanks for Cardinal O'Malley's pastoral care and dedication over these past twenty-one years,\" Everett said. \"A number of new Church leaders will begin their episcopacies in the next few months, giving the whole Church a chance to rebuild and grow closer together.\"", "source": {"uri": "bostonglobe.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Boston Globe"}, "authors": [],

Kinsler said this week that Hernandez was a bad umpire and \"just needs to go away.\"\n\n\"The Office of the Commissioner's lenient treatment to abusive player behavior sends the wrong message to players and managers. It's open season on umpires, and that's bad for the game,\" the WUA said.\n\n\"Enough is enough. Umpires will wear the wristbands until our concerns are taken seriously,\" the union said.\n\nMLB said it had no comment on the union's statement.\n\nCrew chiefs Joe West, Gerry Davis and Bill Miller wore the wristbands in the first games of the day. Hernandez wore one for the Arizona-Twins game.\n\nMiller worked at second base during the Dodgers-Tigers game at Comerica Park, right near Kinsler.\n\n\"He's not the focus of the situation. That's just part of the puzzle,\" Miller said. \"We've have had several instances where umpires have been called out or challenged. Ejections seem to be up, and we just feel like we need to band together and let people know that we are human beings.\"\n\nMost every full-time MLB umpire wore a wristband. Triple-A call-up umps didn't in the early games.\n\n\"That's certainly their right to do that. I think the country's in a mood to protest right now. That's pretty clear,\" Milwaukee manager Craig Counsell said before the Brewers played at Colorado.\n\n\"The umpires do get the brunt of it sometimes. But I also think they're kind of trained to understand that,\" he said.\n\nWest, the president of the umpires' union, declined comment after working home plate at Wrigley Field in the Cubs' 4-3 win over Toronto. In the fourth inning, West called strike three on Chicago's Jon Jay -- Jay yelled in frustration as he walked away from the plate.\n\nWest is the most senior umpire in the majors. Earlier this month, he was suspended three games by MLB for comments he made in a newspaper story about Texas star Adrian Beltre being the biggest complainer in the game. West said he was joking, and Beltre said he knew the umpire was kidding.\n\nOn Thursday, at the owners' meeting in Chicago, Commissioner Rob Manfred drew a distinction on remarks by players and umpires.\n\n\"It is not unusual after a very competitive event for a player to say something that we don't think is helpful over the long term. We have always dealt with those by player discipline, fines. That's the ordinary course,\" Manfred said.\n\n\"I see the umpire thing differently. Umpires have to be beyond reproach on the topic of impartiality. That's why there are really specific rules in the umpire basic agreement about public comment,\" he said.\n\nOn Monday, Kinsler was ejected by Hernandez in Texas after being called out on strikes. The next day, Kinsler sharply criticized Hernandez, saying the umpire was \"messing\" with games \"blatantly.\"\n\n\"No, I'm surprised at how bad an umpire he is. ... I don't know how, for as many years he's been in the league, that he can be that bad. He needs to re-evaluate his career choice, he really does. Bottom line,\" Kinsler said.\n\nKinsler and Hernandez shook hands on the field before the Tigers-Rangers game on Wednesday. Kinsler said Friday that he'd be fined, without disclosing the amount.\n\n\"The verbal attack on Angel denigrated the entire MLB umpiring staff and is unacceptable,\" the union said. The commissioner's office \"has failed to address this and other escalating attacks on umpires,\" the union asserted.\n\nLast month, Hernandez sued MLB alleging race discrimination. In a complaint filed in U.S. District Court in Cincinnati, the 55-year-old Hernandez, who was born in Cuba and lives in Florida, cited as evidence of alleged discrimination his lack of World Series assignments in the past decade and MLB not promoting him to crew chief.\n\nHernandez worked the World Series in 2002 and 2005 but hasn't done it not since.\n\nAs for the wristbands, Toronto infielder Darwin Barney said, \"whether you're a player, an umpire, a scorekeeper, there's two sides to everything. They are allowed to protest. Good for them.\"\n\nTexas manager Jeff Banister has been ejected five times this season.\n\n\"I've said it enough, how I feel about the umpires we have in Major League Baseball. I think they're the best,\" he said. \"I also believe that this game is an emotional game. It's not always clean.\"\n\nPadres manager Andy Green said \"there have been moments in time where I have said things to umpires I wish I had not said.\"\n\n\"So for that I'm cognizant of why they feel that way. I'm not the only one,\" he said. \"It's an interesting job. You're crushed if you're noticed and if you're not noticed you get to labor in anonymity.\"\n\nTags: umpires protest mlb Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation: facebook Tweet", "dateTime":

Triple-A call-up umps didn't in the early games.\n\n\"That's certainly their right to do that. I think the country's in a mood to protest right now. That's pretty clear,\" Milwaukee manager Craig Counsell said before the Brewers played at Colorado.\n\n\"The umpires do get the brunt of it sometimes. But I also think they're kind of trained to understand that,\" he said.\n\nWest, the president of the umpires' union, declined comment after working home plate at Wrigley Field in the Cubs' 4-3 win over Toronto. In the fourth inning, West called strike three on Chicago's Jon Jay - Jay yelled in frustration as he walked away from the plate.\n\nWest is the most senior umpire in the majors. Earlier this month, he was suspended three games by MLB for comments he made in a newspaper story about Texas star Adrian Beltre being the biggest complainer in the game. West said he was joking, and Beltre said he knew the umpire was kidding.\n\nOn Thursday, at the owners' meeting in Chicago, Commissioner Rob Manfred drew a distinction on remarks by players and umpires.\n\n\"It is not unusual after a very competitive event for a player to say something that we don't think is helpful over the long term. We have always dealt with those by player discipline, fines. That's the ordinary course,\" Manfred said.\n\n\"I see the umpire thing differently. Umpires have to be beyond reproach on the topic of impartiality. That's why there are really specific rules in the umpire basic agreement about public comment,\" he said.\n\nOn Monday, Kinsler was ejected by Hernandez in Texas after being called out on strikes. The next day, Kinsler sharply criticized Hernandez, saying the umpire was \"messing\" with games \"blatantly.\"\n\n\"No, I'm surprised at how bad an umpire he is. ... I don't know how, for as many years he's been in the league, that he can be that bad. He needs to re-evaluate his career choice, he really does. Bottom line,\" Kinsler said.\n\nKinsler and Hernandez shook hands on the field before the Tigers-Rangers game on Wednesday. Kinsler said Friday that he'd be fined, without disclosing the amount.\n\nDetroit manager Brad Ausmus didn't reveal the amount, either, but said Saturday \"it's the biggest fine I've ever seen Major League Baseball give a player. So I don't want to hear - I don't want them to minimize - that he's not being punished.\"\n\n\"The more I think about it, the more wrong I think it is,\" he said, adding, \"Kinsler was acting emotionally at the time. This is thought-out and planned and orchestrated.\"\n\n\"To single out one player is completely wrong and goes against what the sport is. It's a team sport. There is often arguments between players and umpires, managers and umpires, coaches and umpires, and it's part of the game. To single out one player as a union is completely uncalled for,\" Ausmus said.\n\nThe union said \"the verbal attack on Angel denigrated the entire MLB umpiring staff and is unacceptable.\" The commissioner's office \"has failed to address this and other escalating attacks on umpires,\" the union asserted.\n\nLast month, Hernandez sued MLB alleging race discrimination. In a complaint filed in U.S. District Court in Cincinnati, the 55-year-old Hernandez, who was born in Cuba and lives in Florida, cited as evidence of alleged discrimination his lack of World Series assignments in the past decade and MLB not promoting him to crew chief.\n\nHernandez worked the World Series in 2002 and 2005 but hasn't done it not since.\n\nAs for the wristbands, Toronto infielder Darwin Barney said, \"whether you're a player, an umpire, a scorekeeper, there's two sides to everything. They are allowed to protest. Good for them.\"\n\nTexas manager Jeff Banister has been ejected five times this season.\n\n\"I've said it enough, how I feel about the umpires we have in Major League Baseball. I think they're the best,\" he said. \"I also believe that this game is an emotional game. It's not always clean.\"\n\nPadres manager Andy Green said \"there have been moments in time where I have said things to umpires I wish I had not said.\"\n\n\"So for that I'm cognizant of why they feel that way. I'm not the only one,\" he said. \"It's an interesting job. You're crushed if you're noticed and if you're not noticed you get to labor in anonymity.\"\n\n___\n\nAP Sports Writers Bernie Wilson and Stephen Hawkins and AP freelance writers Dave Hogg, Dennis Georgatos, Andres Ybarra and Mike Helfgot contributed to this report.\n\nToronto Blue Jays' Steve Pearce, right, throws his bat after striking out against the Chicago Cubs during the third inning of a baseball game, Saturday, Aug. 19, 2017, in Chicago.

Kinsler said this week that Hernandez was a bad umpire and \"just needs to go away.\"\n\n\"The Office of the Commissioner's lenient treatment to abusive player behavior sends the wrong message to players and managers. It's open season on umpires, and that's bad for the game,\" the WUA said.\n\n\"Enough is enough. Umpires will wear the wristbands until our concerns are taken seriously,\" the union said.\n\nSaid Kinsler: \"I really don't think too deeply into it. I hope they wear the white wristbands for the rest of their careers. I don't care. I said what I felt and what I thought. If they take offense to that, that's their problem.\"\n\nMLB said it had no comment on the union's statement.\n\nCrew chiefs Joe West, Gerry Davis and Bill Miller wore the wristbands in the first games of the day.

Kinsler said this week that Hernandez was a bad umpire and \"just needs to go away.\"\n\n\"The Office of the Commissioner's lenient treatment to abusive player behavior sends the wrong message to players and managers. It's open season on umpires, and that's bad for the game,\" the WUA said.\n\n\"Enough is enough. Umpires will wear the wristbands until our concerns are taken seriously,\" the union said.\n\nSaid Kinsler: \"I really don't think too deeply into it. I hope they wear the white wristbands for the rest of their careers. I don't care. I said what I felt and what I thought. If they take offense to that, that's their problem.\"\n\nMLB said it had no comment on the union's statement.\n\nCrew chiefs Joe West, Gerry Davis and Bill Miller wore the wristbands in the first games of the day. Hernandez wore one for the Arizona-Twins game.\n\nMiller worked at second base during the Dodgers-Tigers game at Comerica Park, right near Kinsler.\n\n\"He's not the focus of the situation. That's just part of the puzzle,\" Miller said. \"We've have had several instances where umpires have been called out or challenged. Ejections seem to be up, and we just feel like we need to band together and let people know that we are human beings.\"\n\nMost every full-time MLB umpire wore a wristband. Triple-A call-up umps didn't in the early games.\n\n\"That's certainly their right to do that. I think the country's in a mood to protest right now. That's pretty clear,\" Milwaukee manager Craig Counsell said before the Brewers played at Colorado.\n\n\"The umpires do get the brunt of it sometimes. But I also think they're kind of trained to understand that,\" he said.\n\nWest, the president of the umpires' union, declined comment after working home plate at Wrigley Field in the Cubs' 4-3 win over Toronto. In the fourth inning, West called strike three on Chicago's Jon Jay - Jay yelled in frustration as he walked away from the plate.\n\nWest is the most senior umpire in the majors. Earlier this month, he was suspended three games by MLB for comments he made in a newspaper story about Texas star Adrian Beltre being the biggest complainer in the game. West said he was joking, and Beltre said he knew the umpire was kidding.\n\nOn Thursday, at the owners' meeting in Chicago, Commissioner Rob Manfred drew a distinction on remarks by players and umpires.\n\n\"It is not unusual after a very competitive event for a player to say something that we don't think is helpful over the long term. We have always dealt with those by player discipline, fines. That's the ordinary course,\" Manfred said.\n\n\"I see the umpire thing differently. Umpires have to be beyond reproach on the topic of impartiality. That's why there are really specific rules in the umpire basic agreement about public comment,\" he said.\n\nOn Monday, Kinsler was ejected by Hernandez in Texas after being called out on strikes. The next day, Kinsler sharply criticized Hernandez, saying the umpire was \"messing\" with games \"blatantly.\"\n\n\"No, I'm surprised at how bad an umpire he is. ... I don't know how, for as many years he's been in the league, that he can be that bad. He needs to re-evaluate his career choice, he really does. Bottom line,\" Kinsler said.\n\nKinsler and Hernandez shook hands on the field before the Tigers-Rangers game on Wednesday. Kinsler said Friday that he'd be fined, without disclosing the amount.\n\nDetroit manager Brad Ausmus didn't reveal the amount, either, but said Saturday \"it's the biggest fine I've ever seen Major League Baseball give a player. So I don't want to hear - I don't want them to minimize - that he's not being punished.\"\n\n\"The more I think about it, the more wrong I think it is,\" he said, adding, \"Kinsler was acting emotionally at the time. This is thought-out and planned and orchestrated.\"\n\n\"To single out one player is completely wrong and goes against what the sport is. It's a team sport. There is often arguments between players and umpires, managers and umpires, coaches and umpires, and it's part of the game. To single out one player as a union is completely uncalled for,\" Ausmus said.\n\nThe union said \"the verbal attack on Angel denigrated the entire MLB umpiring staff and is unacceptable.\" The commissioner's office \"has failed to address this and other escalating attacks on umpires,\" the union asserted.\n\nLast month, Hernandez sued MLB alleging race discrimination. In a complaint filed in U.S. District Court in Cincinnati, the 55-year-old Hernandez, who was born in Cuba and lives in Florida, cited as evidence of alleged discrimination his lack of World Series assignments in the past decade and MLB not promoting him to crew chief.\n\nHernandez worked the World Series in 2002 and 2005 but hasn't done it not since.\n\nAs for the wristbands, Toronto infielder Darwin Barney said, \"whether you're a player, an umpire, a scorekeeper, there's two sides to everything. They are allowed to protest. Good for them.\"\n\nTexas manager Jeff Banister has been ejected five times this season.\n\n\"I've said it enough, how I feel about the umpires we have in Major League Baseball. I think they're the best,\" he said. \"I also believe that this game is an emotional game. It's not always clean.\"\n\nPadres manager Andy Green said \"there have been moments in time where I have said things to umpires I wish I had not said.\"\n\n\"So for that I'm cognizant of why they feel that way. I'm not the only one,\" he said. \"It's an interesting job.

Kinsler said this week that Hernandez was a bad umpire and \"just needs to go away.\"\n\n\"The Office of the Commissioner's lenient treatment to abusive player behavior sends the wrong message to players and managers. It's open season on umpires, and that's bad for the game,\" the WUA said.\n\n\"Enough is enough. Umpires will wear the wristbands until our concerns are taken seriously,\" the union said.\n\nSaid Kinsler: \"I really don't think too deeply into it. I hope they wear the white wristbands for the rest of their careers. I don't care. I said what I felt and what I thought. If they take offense to that, that's their problem.\"\n\nMLB said it had no comment on the union's statement.\n\nCrew chiefs Joe West, Gerry Davis and Bill Miller wore the wristbands in the first games of the day. Hernandez wore one for the Arizona-Twins game.\n\nMiller worked at second base during the Dodgers-Tigers game at Comerica Park, right near Kinsler.\n\n\"He's not the focus of the situation. That's just part of the puzzle,\" Miller said. \"We've have had several instances where umpires have been called out or challenged. Ejections seem to be up, and we just feel like we need to band together and let people know that we are human beings.\"\n\nMost every full-time MLB umpire wore a wristband. Triple-A call-up umps didn't in the early games.\n\n\"That's certainly their right to do that. I think the country's in a mood to protest right now. That's pretty clear,\" Milwaukee manager Craig Counsell said before the Brewers played at Colorado.\n\n\"The umpires do get the brunt of it sometimes. But I also think they're kind of trained to understand that,\" he said.\n\nWest, the president of the umpires' union, declined comment after working home plate at Wrigley Field in the Cubs' 4-3 win over Toronto. In the fourth inning, West called strike three on Chicago's Jon Jay -- Jay yelled in frustration as he walked away from the plate.\n\nWest is the most senior umpire in the majors. Earlier this month, he was suspended three games by MLB for comments he made in a newspaper story about Texas star Adrian Beltre being the biggest complainer in the game. West said he was joking, and Beltre said he knew the umpire was kidding.\n\nOn Thursday, at the owners' meeting in Chicago, Commissioner Rob Manfred drew a distinction on remarks by players and umpires.\n\n\"It is not unusual after a very competitive event for a player to say something that we don't think is helpful over the long term. We have always dealt with those by player discipline, fines. That's the ordinary course,\" Manfred said.\n\n\"I see the umpire thing differently. Umpires have to be beyond reproach on the topic of impartiality. That's why there are really specific rules in the umpire basic agreement about public comment,\" he said.\n\nOn Monday, Kinsler was ejected by Hernandez in Texas after being called out on strikes. The next day, Kinsler sharply criticized Hernandez, saying the umpire was \"messing\" with games \"blatantly.\"\n\n\"No, I'm surprised at how bad an umpire he is. ... I don't know how, for as many years he's been in the league, that he can be that bad. He needs to re-evaluate his career choice, he really does. Bottom line,\" Kinsler said.\n\nKinsler and Hernandez shook hands on the field before the Tigers-Rangers game on Wednesday. Kinsler said Friday that he'd be fined, without disclosing the amount.\n\nDetroit manager Brad Ausmus didn't reveal the amount, either, but said Saturday \"it's the biggest fine I've ever seen Major League Baseball give a player. So I don't want to hear -- I don't want them to minimize -- that he's not being punished.\"\n\n\"The more I think about it, the more wrong I think it is,\" he said, adding, \"Kinsler was acting emotionally at the time. This is thought-out and planned and orchestrated.\"\n\n\"To single out one player is completely wrong and goes against what the sport is. It's a team sport. There is often arguments between players and umpires, managers and umpires, coaches and umpires, and it's part of the game. To single out one player as a union is completely uncalled for,\" Ausmus said.\n\nThe union said \"the verbal attack on Angel denigrated the entire MLB umpiring staff and is unacceptable.\" The commissioner's office \"has failed to address this and other escalating attacks on umpires,\" the union asserted.\n\nLast month, Hernandez sued MLB alleging race discrimination. In a complaint filed in U.S. District Court in Cincinnati, the 55-year-old Hernandez, who was born in Cuba and lives in Florida, cited as evidence of alleged discrimination his lack of World Series assignments in the past decade and MLB not promoting him to crew chief.\n\nHernandez worked the World Series in 2002 and 2005 but hasn't done it not since.\n\nAs for the wristbands, Toronto infielder Darwin Barney said, \"whether you're a player, an umpire, a scorekeeper, there's two sides to everything. They are allowed to protest. Good for them.\"\n\nTexas manager Jeff Banister has been ejected five times this season.\n\n\"I've said it enough, how I feel about the umpires we have in Major League Baseball. I think they're the best,\" he said. \"I also believe that this game is an emotional game.

Kinsler said this week that Hernandez was a bad umpire and \"just needs to go away.\"\n\n\"The Office of the Commissioner's lenient treatment to abusive player behavior sends the wrong message to players and managers. It's open season on umpires, and that's bad for the game,\" the WUA said.\n\n\"Enough is enough. Umpires will wear the wristbands until our concerns are taken seriously,\" the union said.\n\nMLB said it had no comment on the union's statement.\n\nCrew chiefs Joe West, Gerry Davis and Bill Miller wore the wristbands in the first games of the day. Hernandez wore one for the Arizona-Twins game.\n\nMiller worked at second base during the Dodgers-Tigers game at Comerica Park, right near Kinsler.\n\n\"He's not the focus of the situation. That's just part of the puzzle,\" Miller said. \"We've have had several instances where umpires have been called out or challenged. Ejections seem to be up, and we just feel like we need to band together and let people know that we are human beings.\"\n\nMost every full-time MLB umpire wore a wristband. Triple-A call-up umps didn't in the early games.\n\n\"That's certainly their right to do that. I think the country's in a mood to protest right now. That's pretty clear,\" Milwaukee manager Craig Counsell said before the Brewers played at Colorado.\n\n\"The umpires do get the brunt of it sometimes. But I also think they're kind of trained to understand that,\" he said.\n\nWest, the president of the umpires' union, declined comment after working home plate at Wrigley Field in the Cubs' 4-3 win over Toronto. In the fourth inning, West called strike three on Chicago's Jon Jay - Jay yelled in frustration as he walked away from the plate.\n\nWest is the most senior umpire in the majors. Earlier this month, he was suspended three games by MLB for comments he made in a newspaper story about Texas star Adrian Beltre being the biggest complainer in the game. West said he was joking, and Beltre said he knew the umpire was kidding.\n\nOn Thursday, at the owners' meeting in Chicago, Commissioner Rob Manfred drew a distinction on remarks by players and umpires.\n\n\"It is not unusual after a very competitive event for a player to say something that we don't think is helpful over the long term. We have always dealt with those by player discipline, fines. That's the ordinary course,\" Manfred said.\n\n\"I see the umpire thing differently. Umpires have to be beyond reproach on the topic of impartiality. That's why there are really specific rules in the umpire basic agreement about public comment,\" he said.\n\nOn Monday, Kinsler was ejected by Hernandez in Texas after being called out on strikes. The next day, Kinsler sharply criticized Hernandez, saying the umpire was \"messing\" with games \"blatantly.\"\n\n\"No, I'm surprised at how bad an umpire he is. ... I don't know how, for as many years he's been in the league, that he can be that bad. He needs to re-evaluate his career choice, he really does. Bottom line,\" Kinsler said.\n\nKinsler and Hernandez shook hands on the field before the Tigers-Rangers game on Wednesday. Kinsler said Friday that he'd be fined, without disclosing the amount.\n\n\"The verbal attack on Angel denigrated the entire MLB umpiring staff and is unacceptable,\" the union said. The commissioner's office \"has failed to address this and other escalating attacks on umpires,\" the union asserted.\n\nLast month, Hernandez sued MLB alleging race discrimination. In a complaint filed in U.S. District Court in Cincinnati, the 55-year-old Hernandez, who was born in Cuba and lives in Florida, cited as evidence of alleged discrimination his lack of World Series assignments in the past decade and MLB not promoting him to crew chief.\n\nHernandez worked the World Series in 2002 and 2005 but hasn't done it not since.\n\nAs for the wristbands, Toronto infielder Darwin Barney said, \"whether you're a player, an umpire, a scorekeeper, there's two sides to everything. They are allowed to protest. Good for them.\"\n\nTexas manager Jeff Banister has been ejected five times this season.\n\n\"I've said it enough, how I feel about the umpires we have in Major League Baseball. I think they're the best,\" he said. \"I also believe that this game is an emotional game. It's not always clean.\"\n\nPadres manager Andy Green said \"there have been moments in time where I have said things to umpires I wish I had not said.\"\n\n\"So for that I'm cognizant of why they feel that way. I'm not the only one,\" he said. \"It's an interesting job. You're crushed if you're noticed and if you're not noticed you get to labor in anonymity.\"", "dateTime": "2017-08-19T23:58:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim": 0.8823529481887817, "dateCrawl":

Kinsler was ejected for arguing balls and strikes, and harshly criticized Hernandez after the game. Per Anthony Fenech of the Detroit Free Press:\n\nKinsler, an 11-year veteran, unloaded on Hernandez's performance, saying, \"It has to do with changing the game. He's changing the game. He needs to find another job, he really does.\"\n\nAnd, \"I'm just saying it's pretty obvious that he needs to stop ruining baseball games.\" And, \"Candidly, leave the game. No one wants you behind the plate anymore. No one in this game wants you behind the plate any more, none of the players.\"\n\nKinsler was fined an undisclosed amount on Friday by MLB, but not suspended. That prompted the Saturday statement and action from major league umpires.\n\n\"This week, a player publicly and harshly impugned the character and integrity of Angel Hernandez -- a veteran umpire who has dedicated his career to baseball and the community,\" the World Umpires Association said in a statement. \"The verbal attack on Angel denigrated the entire MLB umpiring staff and is unacceptable.\n\n\"The Office of the Commissioner has failed to address this and other escalating attacks on umpires.

(Ronald Martinez/Getty Images)\n\nA group of Major League Baseball umpires is feeling singled out and put upon. So on Saturday, they decided to do something about it.\n\nAfter Detroit Tigers second baseman Ian Kinsler called out umpire Angel Hernandez earlier in the week, the World Umpires Association released a statement Saturday, saying that \"the verbal attack on Angel denigrated the entire MLB umpiring staff and is unacceptable.\" In addition to the statement, some umps wore white wristbands during games \"to protest escalating verbal attacks on umpires and their strong objection to the Office of the Commissioner's response to the verbal attacks.\"\n\nKinsler, who was ejected for arguing balls and strikes Monday, later said Hernandez \"needs to find another job\" and is \"messing with baseball games, blatantly.\" He was fined by Major League Baseball for his comments.\n\nThis aggression will not stand as far as the umps are concerned. \"The Office of the Commissioner's lenient treatment to abusive player behavior sends the wrong message to players and managers. It's 'open season' on umpires, and that's bad for the game,\" they said in the statement.\n\nAccording to the statement, Kinsler's fine wasn't nearly harsh enough a penalty for the umps, who felt a suspension was warranted. It stands to reason that a source of the umpires' grievance comes from veteran Joe West's recent three-game ban for naming the Rangers' Adrian Beltre as baseball's \"biggest complainer\" in a June story published in USA Today. West was not paid during his suspension.\n\nIt's probably not a coincidence that the WUA sent this tweet on Saturday afternoon:\n\nUmpire Joe West before taking the field today wearing white wrist band to protest escalating verbal attacks on MLB umpires! pic.twitter.com/a8TkW2JCip\n\n-- MLB World Umpires (@MLBaseballUmps) August 19, 2017\n\nDuring Saturday's game between the Dodgers and Tigers at Comerica Park in Detroit, Kinsler started at second and second-base umpire Bill Miller and third-base umpire Todd Tichenor were wearing the wristbands.

Hernandez wore one for the Arizona-Twins game.\n\nMiller worked at second base during the Dodgers-Tigers game at Comerica Park, right near Kinsler.\n\n\"He's not the focus of the situation. That's just part of the puzzle,\" Miller said. \"We've have had several instances where umpires have been called out or challenged. Ejections seem to be up, and we just feel like we need to band together and let people know that we are human beings.\"\n\nMost every full-time M.L.B. umpire wore a wristband. Umpires called up from Class AAA did not in the early games.\n\n\"That's certainly their right to do that. I think the country's in a mood to protest right now. That's pretty clear,\" Milwaukee Manager Craig Counsell said before the Brewers played at Colorado.\n\n\"The umpires do get the brunt of it sometimes. But I also think they're kind of trained to understand that,\" he said.\n\nWest is the most senior umpire in the majors. Earlier this month, he was suspended for three games by M.L.B. for comments he made in a newspaper story about Texas star Adrian Beltre being the biggest complainer in the game. West said he was joking, and Beltre said he knew the umpire was kidding.\n\nOn Thursday, at the owners' meeting in Chicago, Commissioner Rob Manfred drew a distinction on remarks by players and those by umpires.\n\n\"It is not unusual after a very competitive event for a player to say something that we don't think is helpful over the long term. We have always dealt with those by player discipline, fines. That's the ordinary course,\" Manfred said. \"I see the umpire thing differently. Umpires have to be beyond reproach on the topic of impartiality. That's why there are really specific rules in the umpire basic agreement about public comment.\"\n\nOn Monday, Kinsler was ejected by Hernandez in Texas after being called out on strikes. The next day, Kinsler sharply criticized Hernandez, saying the umpire was \"messing\" with games \"blatantly.\"\n\n\"I don't know how, for as many years he's been in the league, that he can be that bad,\" Kinsler said. \"He needs to re-evaluate his career choice, he really does. Bottom line.\" Kinsler said.\n\nKinsler and Hernandez shook hands on the field before the Tigers-Rangers game on Wednesday. Kinsler said Friday that he'd be fined, without disclosing the amount.\n\n\"The verbal attack on Angel denigrated the entire MLB umpiring staff and is unacceptable,\" the union said. The commissioner's office \"has failed to address this and other escalating attacks on umpires,\" the union asserted.\n\nLast month, Hernandez sued M.L.B., accusing it of racial discrimination. In a complaint filed in U.S. District Court in Cincinnati, the 55-year-old Hernandez, who was born in Cuba and lives in Florida, cited as evidence his lack of World Series assignments in the past decade and the fact that he has not been promoted to crew chief.\n\nHernandez worked the World Series in 2002 and 2005 but hasn't done it not since.\n\nAs for the wristbands, Toronto infielder Darwin Barney said, \"whether you're a player, an umpire, a scorekeeper, there's two sides to everything. They are allowed to protest.

Join for free]\n\nThe league levied a fine against Kinsler after he told reporters that Hernandez should consider a new career and had to stop ruining baseball games.

The verbal attack on Angel denigrated the entire MLB umpiring staff and is unacceptable.\n\nThe Office of the Commissioner has failed to address this and other escalating attacks on umpires. The player who denigrated Hernandez publicly said he thought he would be suspended. Instead got far more lenient treatment -- a fine. He shrugged that off and told reporters he has 'no regrets' about his offensive statements calling for an end to Hernandez's career.\n\nAccording to the union, umpiring crews will continue wearing the wristbands until it believes the commissioner's office has taken their concerns seriously.\n\nThe protest officially started with Saturday's Blue Jays-Cubs game in Chicago.\n\nUmpire Joe West before taking the field today wearing white wrist band to protest escalating verbal attacks on MLB umpires! pic.twitter.com/a8TkW2JCip\n\n-- MLB World Umpires (@MLBaseballUmps) August 19, 2017\n\nThe league office has yet to release an official response.

It's also worth noting that Angel Hernandez is currently embroiled in a racial discrimination lawsuit again the league.\n\nNeedless to say, the building tensions between the league and the umpires will be a major storyline as baseball gears up for the stretch run.\n\nMore MLB coverage from Yahoo Sports:\n\n- - - - - - -\n\nMark Townsend is a writer for Big League Stew on Yahoo Sports.

I don't care,\" he said after the game.\n\nThe controversy stemmed from Kinsler's comments Tuesday in Texas when he said veteran umpire Angel Hernandez \"needs to find another job\" and just \"go away.\" Hernandez had ejected Kinsler and Ausmus one day earlier for arguing balls and strikes.\n\nThe World Umpires Association, which announced the protest just before the start of the Tigers' game against the Los Angeles Dodgers on Saturday, said Kinsler had \"publicly and harshly impugned the character and integrity\" of Hernandez.\n\nThe union also criticized the MLB Commissioner's office for its \"lenient\" discipline of Kinsler, which included an undisclosed fine but no suspension.\n\nAusmus said Kinsler's punishment was anything but lenient.\n\n\"It's the biggest fine I've ever seen Major League Baseball give a player,\" he said. \"So I don't want to hear that he's not being punished. I'm not going to put a number on (the fine). It's the biggest I've ever seen.\"\n\nSecond base umpire Bill Miller, the crew chief, stood only feet away from Kinsler for most of the game while wearing the white band on his left arm.\n\nThird base umpire Tim Tichenor also wore the white band; umpires Adam Hamari and Chris Segal did not.\n\nAfter the game, Miller told a pool reporter that the gesture was \"in support of Major League umpires\" but that specific questions about the protest would have to be directed to the union attorney.\n\n\"(Kinsler) is not the focus of the situation,\" Miller said. \"That's just part of the puzzle. We've have had several instances where umpires have been called out or challenged. Ejections seem to be up, and we just feel like we need to band together and let people know that we are human beings.\"\n\nAusmus said that, in his experience, umpires can give as good as they can take, and he's \"shocked\" by their sudden sensitivity.\n\n\"I've been a part of many arguments, and there are many things said both ways, player to umpire and umpire to player,\" \"Ausmus said. \"To act like anyone's innocent in a particular argument is not only unfounded, it's a lie.\n\n\"The one great thing about Major League umpires -- and I've experienced this as a player and a manager -- is if you get in an argument with an umpire, they're very good at putting it behind them. Which makes this even more remarkable that this would linger and become an issue.\"\n\nAusmus said he thought the union's focus on one player could also backfire.\n\n\"There's now a giant spotlight on Ian Kinsler,\" he said. \"Any missed call on Ian Kinsler, everyone's going to know about it. It's really going to put more pressure on the umpires to get the calls right when Ian Kinsler is involved.\"\n\nIn fact, Kinsler said he's noticed that he's getting a better strike zone since he made his comments. Otherwise, he said, \"the white wristband protest has no effect on me.\n\n\"They can feel how they can feel and I can feel how I want to feel. I said what I felt and what I thought. If they take offense to that, then that's their problem.\"", "dateTime": "2017-08-19T22:22:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim": 0.6980392336845398, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-20", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3374673", "time": "22:22:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3374673", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "concepts": [{"id": "199444", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 3}, {"id": "210760", "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 5}, {"id": "303573", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "score": 5}, {"id": "303711", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "score": 3}, {"id": "304985", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Dodgers"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Dodgers", "score": 3}, {"id": "310293", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Umpire (baseball)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umpire_(baseball)", "score": 5}, {"id": "310555", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Strike zone"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_zone", "score": 3}, {"id": "310671", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "Detroit Tigers"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit_Tigers", "score": 4}, {"id": "327981", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Second baseman"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_baseman", "score": 4}, {"id": "363515", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Brad Ausmus"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Ausmus", "score": 4}, {"id": "386682", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Commissioner of Baseball"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commissioner_of_Baseball", "score": 3}, {"id": "389024", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Ian Kinsler"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_Kinsler", "score": 3}, {"id": "1234065", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "World Umpires Association"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Umpires_Association", "score": 3}], "image": "http://image.mlive.com/home/mlive-media/width620/img/detroit/photo/2017/08/15/23241075-large.jpg", "timeCrawl": "01:52:00", "isDuplicate": false, "title": "Brad Ausmus fumes at 'petty' umpire protest; Ian Kinsler refuses to back down", "originalArticle": null}

This is a person who works mostly outside throughout the hot summer dressed in black, and everyone around them thinks they can do his job better than he can. Every mistake, no matter how minor, is met with extreme reactions of displeasure and good calls go unnoticed, unless they're for the other team, and then they are questioned and doubted.\n\nUmpires go to work to thousands of people telling them they're doing a bad job. I cannot imagine working that way, and I work in a newsroom where half-baked outrage is almost a daily occurrence.\n\nYou may argue that ballplayers face the same degree of criticism. But baseball players have perks that umpires do not have.\n\nNo one loves the umpire. No one waits in line for his autograph. No one dresses up like an umpire to come to the game. There are 10 umpires in the Baseball Hall of Fame. Can you name one of them?\n\nUmpires are an easy target. Society has given us universal permission to blame them for everything; to question every action; to ignore it when they make the right call, that is, one we like; and blame them for all our suffering when they make a bad call.\n\nPart of the reason we don't like them, I think, is because they have uncontestable power over our team. They call the shots. Some calls can be challenged, but some cannot. Balls and strikes are unappealable, for instance. And umpires have the power to eject people.\n\nAt Tuesday's Rangers game, Ian Kinsler, a Detroit Tigers player (and former Ranger) was ejected by home plate umpire Angel Hernandez in the fifth inning. According to news sources, he was arguing balls and strikes. It wasn't very dramatic. I don't think there are any video clips of it available online.\n\nBut what happened next got my attention. Kinsler said publicly, \"I'm surprised at how bad an umpire he is. I don't know how, for as many years he's been in the league, that he can be that bad. He needs to reevaluate his career choice, he really does. Bottom line. ... If I get fined for saying the truth, then so be it.\"\n\nHe has not, as of yet, been fined. But he should be.\n\nI take issue with his use of the word \"truth.\" Kinsler basically challenged the MLB to fine him for \"saying the truth.\" Is it true that Hernandez is such a bad umpire that he should change careers? How could Kinsler know that? Has he so closely followed every call Hernandez has made in every game that he knows his calls are consistently wrong?\n\nHopefully, Kinsler is too busy trying to win games to closely follow one umpire's career. If Hernandez had called an obvious strike a ball, I don't think Kinsler would have acted the way he did that got him ejected. Whatever else this is about, it's not about truth.\n\nI wouldn't care if Kinsler had criticized the umpire's calls during the game, or his action of ejecting him. But to criticize the man's whole life's work goes way past \"truth\" and into arrogant, self-righteous judgment.\n\nAlso, I don't care how good a baseball player Kinsler is, he doesn't get a pass on basic human decency.\n\nPublicly stating that someone you work with needs to rethink his career because he's incompetent is really bad behavior by anyone's standards.\n\nIf the situation were reversed and Hernandez had said of Kinsler: \"I'm surprised at how bad a baseball player he is. I don't know how, for as many years he's been in the league, that he can be that bad.\" Hernandez would face sanctions from the MLB in a flash. His head would snap back from the retort he would receive. If you doubt me, just look at what happened last week.\n\nOn Aug. 9, umpire Joe West was suspended by the MLB for three games for calling Adrian Beltre the \"biggest complainer in baseball\" in an interview he gave to USA Today. They asked him who the biggest complainer is and he replied \"It's got to be Adrian Beltre. Every pitch you call that's a strike, he says, 'Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!' I had a game with him recently and the pitch was right down the middle. He tells me, 'that ball is outside.'\n\n\"I told him, 'You may be a great ballplayer, but you're the worst umpire in the league. You stink.'\"\n\nHis statement doesn't seem that bad to me. In fact, the exchange he describes sounds playful. West even says that Beltre is a great ballplayer.\n\nHe basically called Beltre a whiner and got suspended three games by the MLB.\n\nWhy?\n\nThe union, last I heard, was outraged and appealing, but I've heard nothing more about it. An umpire's suspension does not warrant the kind of coverage that a player's does.\n\nKinsler's rash outpouring of contempt for the whole career of one man will get no reaction either. We've all moved on. No one we care about was insulted.\n\nAnd that would probably be the worst part about being an umpire. There's no one on your side. You're there to either do the right thing, which means call the game in our favor, or you're there to be our scapegoat when we don't like what's happening.\n\nYou are not allowed a single mistake in your job without huge reaction, and all your good work goes unnoticed by everyone. If you are publicly criticized or humiliated, no one much cares. It only gets play if the speaker is of interest.\n\nTo round out the Kinsler/Hernandez mini-drama, there was some sort of reconciliation between them at Wednesday night's game. Which reminds me that most things that happen in baseball, however dramatic, don't last past the watercooler the next day, or possibly the next week. You can't get caught up in these dramas when you've got 162 games to play, or officiate.", "dateTime": "2017-08-19T17:39:00Z", "extractedDates": [{"textEnd": 3568, "textStart": 3562, "imp": true, "date": "2017-08-09", "amb": false}], "sim": 0.6941176652908325, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-19", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3374673", "time": "17:39:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3374673", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "302619", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Home plate"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball_field#Home_plate", "score": 3}, {"id": "303573", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "score": 4}, {"id": "303711", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "score": 3}, {"id": "304254", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "USA Today"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Today", "score": 2}, {"id": "305020", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Innings"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings", "score": 3}, {"id": "310293", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Umpire (baseball)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umpire_(baseball)", "score": 5}, {"id": "310555", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Strike zone"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_zone", "score": 3}, {"id": "310671", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "Detroit Tigers"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit_Tigers", "score": 3}, {"id": "312739", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Baseball_Hall_of_Fame_and_Museum", "score": 3}, {"id": "389024", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Ian Kinsler"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_Kinsler", "score": 3}, {"id": "422007", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Adri\u00e1n Beltr\u00e9"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adri\u00e1n_Beltr\u00e9", "score": 2}, {"id": "597405", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Joe West (umpire)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_West_(umpire)", "score": 2}, {"id": "1375323", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Whoa!

The Office of the Commissioner has failed to address this and other escalating attacks on umpires ... It's 'open season' on umpires, and that's bad for the game.\"\n\nRead the full statement in the tweet below:\n\nInterestingly, West had a controversial moment during Saturday's Cubs-Jays game, when he called Cubs left fielder Jon Jay out on strikes.

Players haven't changed in that regard, I don't think managers have changed either.\n\n\"I just think there's, like in all sports, there's just much more scrutiny on our sport,\" he said. \"So I don't sense that in general from where I was as a player in this game. That's just me.\"\n\nPadres manager Andy Green said there have been times when he's said something to an umpire that he regrets, and is very cognizant of why they may be reacting as they did on Saturday.\n\n\"I respect everything they do in the game and how hard they work and understand the fact they're human beings who make mistakes just like you and I do,\" Green said. \"It's an interesting job. You're crushed if you're noticed, and if you're not noticed, you get to labor in anonymity. I'm appreciative of what they do.\"\n\nThere will always be emotion and reaction in the game, Rangers manager Jeff Banister said.\n\n\"The way I look at it -- I'm in every game fighting for our guys and our team and our fans,\" Banister said. \"Nothing carries over for me after the fact, because I know they're trying to do the exact same thing. They're trying to be the best they can on a given night on a given call. So we're all in it for the same reason. It's highly emotional. Sometimes things get said. It's the ability to move on.\n\n\"I enjoy the relationship with the umpires,\" Banister said. \"I do believe that they are the best out there. Sports are emotional. Games get tight and they get emotional. Maybe we could all do a better job of picking and choosing our words.

MLB fined Kinsler for his comments when he said Hernandez \"needs to reevaluate his career choice.\" Managers have also joined in on the action with A.J. Hinch and Mike Matheny making comments against umpires this month.\n\nAll of this has led to tension, and now apparently a protest.\n\n#WUA issued the following statement in response to escalating verbal attacks: pic.twitter.com/wGLIoLOUq0 -- MLB World Umpires (@MLBaseballUmps)\n\nAugust 19, 2017\n\nUmpire Joe West before taking the field today wearing white wrist band to protest escalating verbal attacks on MLB umpires! pic.twitter.com/a8TkW2JCip -- MLB World Umpires (@MLBaseballUmps)\n\nAugust 19, 2017\n\nJoe West taking part in this protest is a bit ironic considering events that happened earlier this month. He was suspended three games by MLB after comments made to USA Today about Adrian Beltre. When asked who the \"biggest complainer\" was, West mentioned Beltre. He later clarified the two are on good terms.\n\nAs for his current protest, there was an interesting moment in Saturday's game that West was at between the Cubs and Blue Jays. Chicago's Jon Jay was clearly upset by a strike call, and West stared the ballplayer down as he made his way back to the dugout.\n\njoe west is a laughing stock pic.twitter.com/DSNrRtRcPe -- 7 (@SevenCostanzaa)\n\nAugust 19, 2017\n\nJoe West, wearing white wrist band to protest verbal attacks on umps, glares at Jon Jay as he heads back to dugout ticked at strike 3 call -- Sahadev Sharma (@sahadevsharma)\n\nAugust 19, 2017\n\nWe're not sure if the white wristbands will stop the so-called \"verbal abuse\", but it's clear the umpires are making a point to start a discussion about it.", "dateTime": "2017-08-19T19:14:00Z", "extractedDates": [{"textEnd": 790, "textStart": 775, "date": "2017-08-19", "freq": 4, "amb": false}], "sim": 0.6509804129600525, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-19", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3374673", "time": "19:14:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3374673", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "206540", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 2}, {"id": "302546", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "score": 4}, {"id": "303573", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "score": 5}, {"id": "304254", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "USA Today"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Today", "score": 2}, {"id": "305796", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Toronto Blue Jays"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto_Blue_Jays", "score": 2}, {"id": "310293", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Umpire (baseball)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umpire_(baseball)", "score": 5}, {"id": "310538", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Chicago Cubs"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Cubs", "score": 2}, {"id": "315015", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Manager (professional wrestling)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(professional_wrestling)", "score": 3}, {"id": "345293", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Wrist"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrist", "score": 3}, {"id": "360828", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Mike Matheny"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Matheny", "score": 3}, {"id": "389024", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Ian Kinsler"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_Kinsler", "score": 3}, {"id": "418094", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "A.

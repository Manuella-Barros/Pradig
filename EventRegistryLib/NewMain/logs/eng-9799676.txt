The $100 million doesn't even account for production or marketing costs, and it has yet to land on Apple TV+, but it's managed only $39 million at the global box office.\n\nReports have also trickled out that Apple is looking to rein in costs and be a bit more frugal in its series and film production, despite Apple TV+ being such a small line item for a $3 trillion company that Wall Street hasn't much cared how it does so long as it helps sell iPhones.\n\nBut a source says that while \"Wolfs\" is a pivot, it doesn't reflect on how it feels about some of its other upcoming titles that are already going theatrical, including another Brad Pitt movie from Joseph Kosinski set for next year, \"F1.\"\n\nAs for the \"Wolfs\" sequel, Watts is back to write, direct, and produce the sequel, but no cast has formally been set as of yet.\n\nIn \"Wolfs,\" Clooney plays a professional fixer hired to cover up a high profile crime. But when a second fixer (Pitt) shows up and the two \"lone wolves\" are forced to work together, they find their night spiraling out of control in ways that neither one of them expected.

Apple Original Films has made a deal with Watts to write, direct and produce a sequel vehicle for Clooney and Pitt.\n\nAt the same time, Apple has changed its plan for Wolfs to have a wide theatrical release before it lands on Apple TV+. It instead will receive a limited theatrical release on September 20, and then debut globally on Apple TV+ on Friday, September 27.\n\nApple confirmed the release pivot, but sources said it does not signal a change in its hybrid strategy of a streaming service release preceded by a wide theatrical with P&A that was undertaken with Killers of the Flower Moon and Napoleon. Apple will stick to the wide theatrical release on its other film starring Pitt, the Formula One drama F1, which is directed by Joseph Kosinski and producer Jerry Bruckheimer. The Instigators, the Doug Liman-directed heist caper film that stars Matt Damon and Casey Affleck, is in limited release this week before premiering Friday on Apple TV+. Apple will make decisions based on the marketplace; its recent release, Fly Me To The Moon, did not fare well theatrically despite having Scarlett Johansson and Channing Tatum in the starring roles. That film was released by Sony, which is also handling distribution on Wolfs.\n\nApple's next big feature after that, the Steve McQueen-directed WWII drama Blitz will get a limited theatrical release November 22. Sources said Wolfs is a crowd pleaser that has tested strongly, but this was felt the best strategy to ensure the biggest audience for a star driven film on the Apple TV+ streaming site.\n\nIn Wolfs, Clooney plays a professional fixer hired to cover up a high-profile crime. But when a second fixer (Pitt) shows up and the two lone wolves are forced to work together, they find their night spiraling out of control in ways neither expected. The cast also includes Amy Ryan, Austin Abrams, Poorna Jagannathan, Richard Kind and Zlatko Buri\u0107. The film is produced in partnership with George Clooney's Smokehouse Pictures and Brad Pitt's Plan B Entertainment.\n\nWatts, who is making his first original film since his breakthrough Cop Car, after directing the Spider-Man Homecoming trilogy with Tom Holland and Zendaya, produces Wolfs with Dianne McGunigle; Clooney produces alongside Smokehouse Pictures partner Grant Heslov, and Pitt produces alongside Plan B partners Dede Gardner and Jeremy Kleiner. Order of producers is Pitt, Dede Gardner, Kleiner, Heslov, Clooney, Watts and McGunigle. Michael Beugg is executive producer.\n\n\"Wolfs is the kind of big event movie that makes Apple TV+ such an exceptional home for the best in entertainment,\" Apple Original Films head of features Matt Dentler said in a statement. \"With George and Brad's remarkable and engaging chemistry under Jon Watts' extraordinary direction, 'Wolfs' blends all the great elements of comedy, action, and drama into a hugely entertaining movie that will leave audiences ready for what's next.

While originally slated for a full theatrical release, Wolfs is now shaking things up.\n\nDeadline reports that Wolfs will now be receiving a one-week limited theatrical release before its Apple TV+ debut. It will first hold its world premiere at the Venice Film Festival before being released in theaters on September 20. Wolfs will then debut on Apple TV+ on September 27.\n\nThat is not the only shocking development. Wolfs is also getting a sequel. Apple Original Films has made a deal with Watts to write, direct, and produce a sequel, presumably with Pitt and Clooney returning.\n\nWhile Apple confirmed the release change, \"sources said it does not signal a change in its hybrid strategy of a streaming service release preceded by a wide theatrical with P&A that was undertaken with Killers of the Flower Moon and Napoleon.\"\n\nAnother upcoming Apple movie starring Pitt, F1, will retain its wide theatrical release plan. That movie is directed by Top Gun: Maverick helmer Joseph Kosinski and produced by Joseph Bruckheimer.\n\nDoug Liman's The Instigators, starring Matt Damon and Casey Affleck, has a similar release strategy. The Instigators was released in theaters on August 2 and will premiere on Apple TV+ on August 9. Perhaps this new model is the way for Apple.\n\nWhat is Wolfs about?\n\nWolfs re-teams Pitt and Clooney for a new action comedy. In the movie, they play two fixers who are forced to work together after realizing they were hired for the same job.\n\nWhile Pitt and Clooney are the big names leading the project, the ensemble also features Austin Abrams, Amy Ryan, Poorna Jagannathan, and Richard Kind.\n\nBoth Pitt and Clooney's production companies -- Plan B Entertainment and Smokehouse Pictures, respectively -- will produce Wolfs. Apple Studios also serves as a producer as well.\n\nJon Watts wrote and directed Wolfs. He is best known for his work in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). Watts directed the first Tom Holland-led Spider-Man trilogy. Early in his career, he gained notoriety for directing Clown and Cop Car.\n\nBrad Pitt and George Clooney movies\n\nFans of movies know that Wolfs is not Brad Pitt and George Clooney's first rodeo. They previously starred in the Ocean's trilogy as Danny Ocean and Rusty Ryan.\n\nMore recently, both Pitt and Clooney had small roles in John Krasinski's IF. Clooney voiced Spaceman, an astronaut IF (which stands for \"imaginary friend\"). Pitt is credited as Keith, an IF with no dialogue.\n\nBoth Pitt and Clooney are decorated actors themselves, and each has won Best Supporting Actor at the Oscars. Clooney was the first to win, winning the award in 2005 for his performance in Syriana. In 2020, Pitt took home the same award for his performance in Once Upon a Time in Hollywood.\n\nAs producers, they have both won Best Picture awards as well. Clooney produced Ben Affleck's Best Picture-winning Argo in 2012. Pitt produced 12 Years a Slave, which also won Best Picture a couple of years later.\n\nWolfs will be released in theaters on September 20 and on Apple TV+ on September 27.", "source": {"uri":

It will then make its global debut on Apple TV+ the following week on September 27, 2024.\n\nIt follows a similar tactic to the one used for Doug Liman's heist thriller The Instigators starring Matt Damon. That also had a limited theatrical release this week and will hit Apple TV+ on Friday.\n\nDespite the change in its previous strategy for Apple Original Films such as Killers of the Flower Moon and Napoleon, Apple is unlikely to keep it up, and still plans to have a wide theatrical release followed by a streaming release for Brad Pitt's F1 movie.\n\nApple is taking each of its movies on a case-by-case basis in order to ensure the biggest audience possible for them. Especially its megastar-driven projects.\n\nThere's clearly plenty of faith in Wolfs, however, as Watts and Apple Original Films have penned a deal for a sequel with Clooney and Pitt.\n\nWhat is Wolfs about?\n\nIn Wolfs, Clooney plays a professional fixer hired to cover up a high-profile crime. But when a second fixer (Pitt) shows up, and the two lone wolves are forced to work together, they find their night spiraling out of control in ways neither expected.\n\nWolfs also stars Amy Ryan, Austin Abrams, Poorna Jagannathan, Richard Kind and Zlatko Buri\u0107.\n\nJon Watts, best known for directing Tom Holland's Spider-Man trilogy, writes and directs Wolfs. Watts produces alongside Dianne McGunigle. Clooney and Grant Heslov produce through Smokehouse Pictures, while the trio of Pitt, Dede Gardner, and Jeremy Kleiner produce for Plan B Entertainment.\n\nWolfs is from Apple Original Films.

Wolfs will premiere at the Venice Film Festival before hitting theaters for a limited time before heading to Apple TV+ on September 27. Apple's decision to alter release plans for Wolfs may be a strategic move based on past box office performances of other original films.\n\nApple is displaying an extreme level of confidence in one of its highly-anticipated upcoming films. A new report from Deadline revealed that a sequel to Wolfs is already in the works, with both Brad Pitt and George Clooney returning. Jon Watts, who wrote and directed the original Wolfs, will also be back in the saddle to pen the script and helm the sequel, reuniting the core trio that got fans so excited about the film in the first place. Wolfs is set to premiere at the Venice Film Festival when it kicks off later this month, and will then debut in theaters on September 20 for a limited time only before arriving on Apple TV+ on September 27. This was not in the original plan, as Wolfs was initially supposed to receive a full theatrical run, like other Apple Original Films, and then premiere on the platform at a later date.\n\nThis could be in response to Apple Original Films not faring particularly well at the box office with full theatrical runs, particularly Argylle, which failed to reach $100 million at the worldwide box office despite a reported budget of more than $200 million. Killers of the Flower Moon, the Martin Scorsese-directed pic starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Robert De Niro, also failed to reach its reported budget, closing its theatrical run with $157 million worldwide. Napoleon did manage to narrowly scrape into the green, earning $221 million, but this margin in profits likely isn't where Apple would like to be operating. The report indicates that Apple will make these decisions going forward based on the market, with other films such as Pitt's F1 movie maintaining the traditional theatrical release.\n\nWhat Is 'Wolfs' About and Who Else Stars in It?\n\nWolfs follows two fixers, Nick (Pitt) and Jack (Clooney), who both get assigned to the same job and then are forced to work together. In addition to Pitt and Clooney, Wolfs also stars Amy Ryan, who was nominated for an Oscar for her performance in Gone Baby Gone (2007), and also plays Holly in The Office. Austin Abrams and Richard Kind also star in Wolfs, but it's unclear at this time who besides Pitt and Clooney will return for the sequel.\n\nWolfs arrives in theaters on September 20 for one week only before premiering on Apple TV+ on September 27. Check out the trailer for the film above and stay tuned to Collider for future updates.\n\nWolfs Thriller\n\nFollows two lone wolf fixers who are assigned to the same job.\n\nRelease Date September 20, 2024 Director Jon Watts Cast Brad Pitt , George Clooney , Amy Ryan , Austin Abrams , Poorna Jagannathan Writers Jon Watts\n\nWATCH ON APPLE TV+", "source": {"uri": "collider.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Collider"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Clooney", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "George Clooney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequel", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sequel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Pitt", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Brad Pitt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_TV+", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Apple TV+"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venice_Film_Festival", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Venice Film Festival"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box_office", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Box office"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadline_Hollywood", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Deadline Hollywood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killers_of_the_Flower_Moon_(film)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Killers of the Flower Moon (film)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Watts", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jon Watts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_De_Niro", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Robert De Niro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonardo_DiCaprio", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Leonardo DiCaprio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Office (American TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixer_(person)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fixer (person)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austin_Abrams", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Austin Abrams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collider_(website)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Collider (website)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Kind", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Richard Kind"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thriller_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Thriller film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poorna_Jagannathan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Poorna Jagannathan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amy_Ryan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Amy Ryan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Academy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_One", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Formula One"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Studios", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Studios", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/brad-pitt-george-clooney-wolfs.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9799676", "eventUri": "eng-9799676", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-09-27", "textStart": 273, "textEnd": 285, "freq": 3}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-09-20", "textStart": 992, "textEnd": 1004, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "date": "2020-09-", "textStart": 2854, "textEnd": 2866}], "sentiment": 0.2941176470588236, "wgt": 217, "relevance": 1}

Wolfs has also changed its release plan, releasing only limitedly in theaters before going to streaming. The release plan change will allow Wolfs to avoid competition.\n\nThe new movie Wolfs is already slated for a sequel, just as its release plan changes. Wolfs is an upcoming action movie starring Brad Pitt and George Clooney, who play two crime fixers who are assigned to the same job. Wolfs is directed by Jon Watts, and in addition to Pitt and Clooney features a leading cast including Amy Ryan, Austin Abrams, Poorna Jagnnathan, Irina Dubova, and Richard Kind.\n\nAs per Deadline, Wolfs 2 has already been confirmed. The sequel deal has been made with Wolfs director Watts, and it will also star Clooney and Pitt in the lead roles. In addition to the sequel news, a change to the release plan for the Apple film has been announced. Wolfs will still hit theaters on September 20, but it will have a limited theatrical release rather than the originally planned wide exclusive theatrical release. After just one week in theaters, Wolfs will transition to Apple TV+ availability, debuting globally on the platform on Friday, September 27.\n\nWith This Decision, Wolfs Will Avoid Major Competition September Is A Packed Month For Film Close\n\nThis dual announcement -- of the sequel and release strategy pivot -- is an interesting combination of choices for Wolfs. With a Wolfs sequel already confirmed, one would think, on the one hand, that Apple is confident in the film's success. In contrast, however, Apple is not confident enough that Wolfs can succeed in theaters to warrant a full theatrical release before hitting streaming. With this conflicting confidence, it will be interesting to see how Wolfs fares on its various platforms, especially as it prepares for a sequel.\n\nRelated George Clooney & Brad Pitt's New Movie Snaps 16-Year Drought After $163 Million Hit\n\nGeorge Clooney and Brad Pitt are set to star in their first live-action onscreen reunion since 2008 with the upcoming Jon Watts action comedy Wolfs.\n\nPart of why Wolfs might be switching its release plan could come down to the sheer amount of competition there is during the film's planned release time. September 20 alone sees the release of the upcoming Transformers franchise film Transformers One, along with the horror films Bagman and The Substance. Transformers One alone would provide ample competition for Wolfs, but the other titles would make it even harder for the film to compete. The following weekend is also competitive, seeing the release of Lee, The Wild Robot, Megalopolis, and Never Let Go.\n\nWith only one week exclusively in theaters for only a limited release, Wolfs will not even have time to be considered a flop against the wider releases. Instead, audiences will be able to quickly enjoy Wolfs from their homes, so the only battles the film will wage will arise from streaming-based competition. Hopefully, this move works out for Wolfs and will allow the thriller to perform well on Apple TV+, encouraging audiences to check out the eventual sequel.\n\nSource: Deadline\n\nWolfs Not Yet RatedActionThriller\n\nWolfs is an action-thriller film written and directed by Jon Watts, and sees the on-screen reunion of Brad Pitt and George Clooney after nearly fifteen years.

Well, we have good news for you as before the first film has even hit the streamer, a sequel is already in the works.\n\nApple Original Films has made a deal with Wolfs director Jon Watts to write, direct, and produce a sequel for the upcoming movie, as reported by Deadline. In addition to news of a second installment, Apple TV Plus has also planned to release the first movie theatrically on the big screen from September 20 before it lands on the streamer globally on September 27.\n\nWolfs, which is due to make its world premiere at the 81st Venice Film Festival at the end of August, follows a professional fixer (Clooney) hired to cover up a high-profile crime, but when he shows up to the job he finds that another fixer (Pitt) has also been called there too. As the two lone wolves are forced to work together in this action comedy, they realize that their joining may not be just a coincidence.\n\nIt is unclear at this time what the plot for the sequel will be, but depending on the outcome of their characters in the first movie, we expect Clooney and Pitt to return, as writer and director Watts is.\n\nAlongside Pitt and Clooney, Wolfs also stars Amy Ryan, Austin Abrams, and Poorna Jagannathan. The film is written and directed by Watts, who is best known for directing the Tom Holland Spider-Man trilogy and the Kevin Bacon starrer Cop Car.\n\nAs well as Wolfs, Apple TV Plus also has a bunch of other blockbusters under its belt, such as Matt Damon's The Instigators set to drop on Apple TV Plus on August 9, and the Formula One drama F1 starring Pitt, which will premiere in 2025. Both will also have a theatrical release before hitting the streamer.\n\nWolf hits selected theaters on September 20 and will be available to stream on Apple TV Plus from September 27.

Wolfs premieres at the 81st Venice International Film Festival ahead of its limited theatrical release on September 20. Then it debuts on Apple TV+ on Friday, September 27. Hey, you know when Apple plans a Wolfs sequel even before the original proves popular, you know it expects a hit.\n\nApple Original Films is clearly excited about the eyeball-attracting prospects of its Clooney-Pitt star vehicle. Big-budget thrillers haven't necessarily performed brilliantly for Apple, but maybe a comedy-action flick with superstars will be different.\n\n\"Wolfs is the kind of big event movie that makes Apple TV+ such an exceptional home for the best in entertainment,\" said Matt Dentler, head of features, Apple Original Films. \"With George and Brad's remarkable and engaging chemistry under Jon Watts' extraordinary direction, Wolfs blends all the great elements of comedy, action and drama into a hugely entertaining movie that will leave audiences ready for what's next.\n\n\"Releasing the movie to theaters before making it widely available to Apple TV+ customers brings the best of both worlds to audiences, and we're excited to see fans embrace the movie as we start working with Jon on the sequel,\" he added.\n\nHere's how Apple Original Films describes Wolfs:\n\nIn Wolfs, Clooney plays a professional fixer hired to cover up a high-profile crime. But when a second fixer (Pitt) shows up and the two \"lone wolves\" are forced to work together, they find their night spiraling out of control in ways that neither one of them expected. The star-studded cast also includes Amy Ryan, Austin Abrams, Poorna Jagannathan, Richard Kind and Zlatko Buri\u0107.\n\nWolfs is an Apple Original Film from Apple Studios written and directed by Watts. George Clooney's Smokehouse Pictures and Brad Pitt's Plan B Entertainment partnered in the film's production with Apple. Watts, Clooney, Pitt, Grant Heslov, Dianne McGunigle, Dede Gardner and Jeremy Kleiner produce. Michael Beugg executive produces.\n\nSo we can expect to see Wolfs streaming on Apple TV+ September 27, after a week in theaters. In the meantime, the streamer features plenty of other thrillers you can sample. The service is available by subscription for $9.99 with a seven-day free trial. You can also get it via any tier of the Apple One subscription bundle. For a limited time, customers who purchase and activate a new iPhone, iPad, Apple TV, Mac or iPod touch can enjoy three months of Apple TV+ for free.\n\nAfter launching in November 2019, \"Apple TV+ became the first all-original streaming service to launch around the world, and has premiered more original hits and received more award recognitions faster than any other streaming service. To date, Apple Original films, documentaries and series have been honored with 471 wins and 2,090 award nominations and counting,\" the service said.\n\nIn addition to award-winning movies and TV shows (including breakout soccer comedy Ted Lasso), Apple TV+ offers documentaries, dramas, comedies, kids shows and more.", "source": {"uri": "cultofmac.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Cult of

This decision comes as Apple responds to market dynamics and recent box office performances.\n\nApple Original Films has confirmed that the sequel to Wolfs will be written, directed, and produced by Jon Watts. The film will also see the return of its lead actors, Clooney and Pitt. In Wolfs, Clooney plays a professional fixer hired to conceal a high-profile crime. The plot intensifies when a second fixer, portrayed by Pitt, enters the scene, leading to unexpected developments.\n\nDespite the change in release strategy for Wolfs, other Apple films like the Pitt-starrer Formula One drama F1 and the heist caper film The Instigators will still follow the wide theatrical release strategy. Apple's next major feature, the Steve McQueen-directed WWII drama Blitz, is also scheduled for a limited theatrical release on November 1.\n\n\"Wolfs is the kind of big event movie that makes Apple TV+ such an exceptional home for the best in entertainment,\" said Matt Dentler, Apple Original Films's head of features. \"With George and Brad's remarkable and engaging chemistry under Jon Watts's extraordinary direction, Wolfs blends all the great elements of comedy, action, and drama into a hugely entertaining movie that will leave audiences ready for what's next.\"", "source": {"uri": "newsbytesapp.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NewsBytes"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Clooney", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "George Clooney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Apple_TV+_original_films", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "List of Apple TV+ original films"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequel", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sequel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limited_theatrical_release", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Limited theatrical release"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_TV+", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Apple TV+"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixer_(person)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fixer (person)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venice_Film_Festival", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Venice Film Festival"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Watts", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jon Watts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drama_(film_and_television)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Drama (film and television)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heist_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Heist film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box_office", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Box office"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_One", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Formula One"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Blitz", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Blitz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World War II"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Comedy"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://i.cdn.newsbytesapp.com/images/28220621723107565.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9799676", "eventUri": "eng-9799676", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-09-20", "textStart": 263, "textEnd": 275}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-09-27", "textStart": 316, "textEnd": 328}, {"amb": false, "date": "-11-01", "textStart": 1145, "textEnd": 1155}], "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 205, "relevance": 1}

That will soon change though, as Clooney and Pitt are teaming back up for September's Wolfs, a crime comedy about two professional fixers who have to work together when they're hired from the same job. Word's now come in that Wolfs is already getting a sequel, which had been talked about, but with that update had come some bad news about the first movie.\n\nLet's start things off on a positive note first. Apple Original Films has announced that Wolfs writer, director and executive producer Jon Watts has signed on to write a Wolfs sequel. Clooney and Pitt will also reprise their respective roles of Jack and Nick, as opposed to Wolfs 2 following along with two different leading men or women. So if you like what you see from Wolfs later this year, take comfort knowing that this trio of talent is working to bring a follow-up adventure to your eyeballs.\n\nNow here's the bad news: until today, Wolfs was going to get a wide theatrical release following its world premiere at the 81st Venice Film Festival, which takes place from August 28-September 7. That plan has been scrapped; instead, Wolfs will get a limited theatrical release on September 20, and then it will become available to stream with an Apple TV+ subscription on September 27. In other words, if you've been eager to see Wolfs on a big screen, you now have a much narrower window of time to do that, and there's no chance this movie will make a big splash at the box office.\n\nMatt Dentler, the head of features at Apple Original Films, released this statement about the changed release plan for Wolfs:", "source": {"uri": "cinemablend.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CINEMABLEND"}, "authors": [{"uri": "adam_holmes@cinemablend.com", "name": "Adam Holmes", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Clooney", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "George Clooney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Pitt", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Brad Pitt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean's_(film_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ocean's (film series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadpool_2_(soundtrack)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Deadpool 2 (soundtrack)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cameo_appearance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cameo appearance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Crime film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sequel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reading,_Berkshire", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Reading, Berkshire"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Watts", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jon Watts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_producer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Executive producer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limited_theatrical_release", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Limited theatrical release"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_TV+", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Apple TV+"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/81st_Academy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "81st Academy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venice_Film_Festival", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Venice Film Festival"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box_office", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Box office"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adventure_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Adventure film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fdCeuCe2BD3eCYZ6j3QZYW-1200-80.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9799676", "eventUri": "eng-9799676", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-28", "dateEnd": "2024-09-07", "textStart": 1387, "textEnd": 1408}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-09-20", "textStart": 1495, "textEnd": 1507}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-09-27", "textStart": 1587, "textEnd": 1599}], "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 201, "relevance": 1}

This movie stars Brad Pitt and George Clooney as rival fixers tasked with completing the same job as a duo, and judging by the trailer it looks to be witty and action-packed.\n\nWhy are we telling you this? Because Deadline has affirmed that a sequel to Wolfs is already in development. Despite the first film not even making its arrival until September 27 on Apple TV+ and coming to a selection of cinemas (and no longer a wide-scale theatrical premiere) around the world the week before from September 20, Apple TV has already given Watts the greenlight to develop a follow-up, a sequel that sees Pitt and Clooney returning too.\n\nWe'll have to see if Wolfs presents an ending that sets up a sequel or if this follow-up will take the leading duo to a new place for a crazy new set of events.

This development comes as the film, which will make its world premiere at the 81st Venice Film Festival, pivots to a limited theatrical release on September 20, followed by a global debut on Apple TV+ on September 27.\n\nThe decision to alter the release strategy for \"Wolfs\" was confirmed by Apple, although it does not indicate a change in their broader hybrid strategy. The company will continue to employ a streaming service release preceded by a wide theatrical release for other films, such as the Formula One drama \"F1\" starring Pitt and directed by Joseph Kosinski. This approach was also used for recent releases like \"Killers of the Flower Moon\" and \"Napoleon.\"\n\nIn \"Wolfs,\" Clooney plays a professional fixer hired to cover up a high-profile crime. When a second fixer, portrayed by Pitt, arrives, the two must navigate an increasingly chaotic situation. The cast also includes Amy Ryan, Austin Abrams, Poorna Jagannathan, Richard Kind, and Zlatko Buri\u0107. The film is produced in partnership with Clooney's Smokehouse Pictures and Pitt's Plan B Entertainment.\n\nJon Watts, known for his work on the \"Spider-Man: Homecoming\" trilogy, directs and produces \"Wolfs.\" He collaborates with producers Dianne McGunigle, Clooney's Smokehouse partner Grant Heslov, and Pitt's Plan B partners Dede Gardner and Jeremy Kleiner.\n\nApple's head of features, Matt Dentler, praised the film, stating, \"With George and Brad's remarkable and engaging chemistry under Jon Watts' extraordinary direction, 'Wolfs' blends all the great elements of comedy, action, and drama into a hugely entertaining movie that will leave audiences ready for what's next.\"\n\nThis strategic move aims to maximize audience reach for the star-driven film. Apple's recent release, \"Fly Me to the Moon,\" did not perform well theatrically despite its star-studded cast, influencing this decision. The company plans to adapt its release strategies based on marketplace performance, with future films like Steve McQueen's WWII drama \"Blitz\" also receiving limited theatrical releases.", "source": {"uri": "tribune.com.pk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Express Tribune"}, "authors": [{"uri": "pop_culture@tribune.com.pk", "name": "Pop Culture", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Pitt", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Brad Pitt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drama_(film_and_television)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Drama (film and television)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Clooney", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "George Clooney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_One", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Formula One"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limited_theatrical_release", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Limited theatrical release"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_TV+", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Apple TV+"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixer_(person)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fixer (person)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/81st_Academy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "81st Academy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venice_Film_Festival", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Venice Film Festival"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sequel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killers_of_the_Flower_Moon_(film)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Killers of the Flower Moon (film)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austin_Abrams", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Austin Abrams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoke_House_Pictures", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Smoke House Pictures"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Watts", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jon Watts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zlatko_Buri\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Zlatko Buri\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Kind", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Richard Kind"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plan_B_Entertainment", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Plan B Entertainment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Kosinski", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joseph Kosinski"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poorna_Jagannathan", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Poorna Jagannathan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amy_Ryan", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Amy Ryan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremy_Kleiner", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jeremy Kleiner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grant_Heslov", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Grant Heslov"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dede_Gardner", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dede Gardner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider-Man_in_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spider-Man in film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_release", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wide release"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_McQueen", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Steve McQueen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fly_Me_to_the_Moon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fly Me to the Moon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Comedy"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Studios", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Studios", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/wolfs1723121107-0/wolfs1723121107-0.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9799676", "eventUri": "eng-9799676", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-09-20", "textStart": 281, "textEnd": 293}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-09-27", "textStart": 338, "textEnd": 350}], "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 195, "relevance": 1}

Directed by Jon Watts, the film follows Clooney's Jack and Pitt's Nick as rival fixers forced to work together.\n\nGeorge Clooney and Brad Pitt's upcoming movie Wolfs is their first onscreen collaboration in sixteen years. Wolfs is an upcoming psychological thriller starring Ocean's Eleven alumni George Clooney and Brad Pitt that is set to hit theaters on September 20, 2024. Produced by Apple Original Films, Wolfs will also be available to stream exclusively on Apple TV+ on an unspecified date.\n\nWolfs follows Clooney's Jack and Pitt's Nick as two lone wolf fixers who are assigned to the same job. The film also stars Amy Ryan (Gone Baby Gone, Bridge of Spies, Birdman), Poorna Jagannathan (Big Little Lies, The Night Of, Ramy), Austin Abrams (Euphoria, Paper Towns, This Is Us), and Richard Kind (Argo, Inside Out, A Serious Man). Wolfs is written and directed by Jon Watts, the celebrated director of Tom Halland's Spider-Man trilogy and Jeff Bridges' latest series The Old Man.\n\nApple has already confirmed a Wolfs sequel with Clooney, Pitt, and director Jon Watts set to return, per Deadline .\n\nWolfs Is George Clooney & Brad Pitt's First Movie Together Since Burn After Reading Burn After Reading was directed by the Coen Brothers Close\n\nThe last feature film collaboration between Pitt and Clooney was the 2008 satirical dark comedy Burn After Reading, which was written and directed by the iconic filmmaking duo the Coen Brothers (No Country For Old Men, True Grit). Burn After Reading follows two gym employees who try to sell a mysterious disk with confidential CIA intel. Pitt and Clooney's last collaboration was technically the 2012 television broadcast of 8, a Broadway play that chronicles the closing arguments of Perry v. Schwarzenegger which led to the overturn of Proposition 8.\n\nClooney starred in several films together during the 2000s, including all three installments of the Steven Soderbergh Ocean's trilogy. They both appeared in 2002's Confession of a Dangerous Mind, written by Charlie Kaufman (Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind), although Clooney had a leading role while Pitt, and Matt Damon for that matter, played unnamed bartenders. Additionally, both Clooney and Pitt were voice actors in John Krasinski's IF, but Wolfs is set to offer a much more proper onscreen reunion for the two Hollywood legends.\n\nBurn After Reading is currently available to stream on Netflix.\n\nRelated Apple Is Giving Us The Ocean's 11 Reunion I've Wanted For 17 Years...Sort Of\n\nTwo of Apple's upcoming original movies will see the reunions of 4 Ocean's trilogy stars, pairing Clooney & Pitt and Damon & Affleck in two thrillers.\n\nWolfs Looks Like A Worthy Time For George Clooney & Brad Pitt's Reunion There is sure to be plenty of witty banter in the action-comedy Close\n\nWatts has already proven he can deliver highly entertaining and profitable films, which likely played a part in attracting Clooney and Pitt for their first onscreen reunion in sixteen years. Based on the trailer, the fierce rivalry between Clooney and Pitt's fixers looks to offer plenty of sharp and witty banter. The action comedy also appears to have plenty of intense shootouts and car chases, making it a worthy film to see the long-awaited reunion of Pitt and Clooney. Wolfs, as opposed to Wolves, highlights the fact that Pitt and Clooney's characters are not partners and are forced to work together to stay alive.\n\nWolfs Not Yet RatedActionThriller\n\nWolfs is an action-thriller film written and directed by Jon Watts, and sees the on-screen reunion of Brad Pitt and George Clooney after nearly fifteen years. The film centers on two fixers who are brought together when they're both hired for the same job.\n\nDirector Jon Watts Release Date September 20, 2024 Studio(s) Apple Studios , Plan B Entertainment ,

Jon did three of the best Spider-Man films ever for us.\n\n\"He's got lots of things going on now. So we'll probably be looking for somebody else, just because he's busy.\"\n\nWolfs will be released in cinemas on Friday, September 20, before streaming September 27 on Apple TV+.", "source": {"uri": "manchestereveningnews.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Manchester Evening News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "lucas_hill_paul@manchestereveningnews.co.uk", "name": "Lucas Hill-Paul", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Clooney", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "George Clooney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Pitt", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Brad Pitt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Studios", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Apple Studios"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_TV+", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Apple TV+"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixer_(person)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fixer (person)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Watts", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jon Watts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadline_Hollywood", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Deadline Hollywood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider-Man_in_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spider-Man in film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heist_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Heist film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean's_Eleven", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ocean's Eleven"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sequel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adventure_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Adventure film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austin_Abrams", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Austin Abrams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Kind", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Richard Kind"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poorna_Jagannathan", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Poorna Jagannathan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amy_Ryan", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Amy Ryan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Holland_(filmmaker)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tom Holland (filmmaker)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drama_(film_and_television)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Drama (film and television)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Future_plc", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Future plc"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Feige", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Feige"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venice_Film_Festival", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Venice Film Festival"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_producer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Film producer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Comedy"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Studios", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Studios", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/tv/article29699896.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/2_george-clooney-and-brad-pitt.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9799676", "eventUri": "eng-9799676", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-09-27", "textStart": 500, "textEnd": 512, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-09-20", "textStart": 536, "textEnd": 548, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": 0.1529411764705881, "wgt": 183, "relevance": 1}

It's why I keep rewatching those movies all the time. That's also why I couldn't wait to see Wolfs once I saw the first trailer. Pitt and Clooney will partner up again in an action movie that should have plenty of comedy, just like the Oceans franchise.\n\nI would have seen Wolfs in theaters next month, but that's no longer on the table. Apple changed its mind about the theatrical run of Wolfs, deciding instead to release it on Apple TV Plus several months sooner than expected.\n\nThe movie isn't bad, according to reports. It's apparently quite the contrary. Apple has decided to give it a sequel, which is exciting news. To be fair, I would have watched Wolfs despite what critics would have said about it.\n\nThe movie was initially set to get a wide theatrical release, premiering on September 20th. It would have stayed in theaters for 45 days, then moved to video-on-demand services. After another month, it would eventually make it to Apple TV+. When all was said and done, we'd be looking at a late 2024 release date on the streaming service, at the earliest.\n\nAccording to Deadline, Apple changed its plans for Wolfs. The film will still get a September 20th theatrical release, but it'll be a very limited one. Wolfs will land on Apple TV+ just a week later, on September 27th.\n\nIt's unclear what prompted the change, with the report saying Apple has confirmed its new plans for the movie. Also, Apple hasn't changed its mind about hybrid movie releases. It'll still go forward with some of them, like the upcoming Formula One drama F1. In the future, Apple will reportedly make decisions based on the marketplace, whatever that means.\n\nFly Me to the Moon, starring Scarlett Johansson and Channing Tatum, didn't do that well theatrically. The Instigators, with Matt Damon and Casey Affleck, got a limited release before its Apple TV+ premiere this Friday, but it's also getting negative reviews.\n\nAll this is exciting news for this Pitt-Clooney movie fan. Wolfs doesn't have to be an Oscar winner. \"A crowd pleaser\" sounds great, and I can't wait to watch it.\n\nThe story's premise is interesting regardless of who plays the titular roles. Two \"lone wolfs\" have been hired to clean up the same mess, only to discover that they must work together to do the job. Naturally, things will get out of hand. And we'll have a laugh here and there as the two wolfves (wolfs?) try to figure out how to fix the situation.", "source": {"uri": "bgr.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "BGR"}, "authors": [{"uri": "chris_smith@bgr.com", "name": "Chris Smith", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Clooney", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "George Clooney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Pitt", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Brad Pitt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_TV+", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Apple TV+"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trailer_(promotion)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Trailer (promotion)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Comedy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadline_Hollywood", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Deadline Hollywood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sequel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_on_demand", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Video on demand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_One", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Formula One"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Instigators", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Instigators"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limited_theatrical_release", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Limited theatrical release"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drama_(film_and_television)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Drama (film and television)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casey_Affleck", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Casey Affleck"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Academy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fly_Me_to_the_Moon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fly Me to the Moon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channing_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Channing Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scarlett_Johansson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scarlett Johansson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Damon", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Matt Damon"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://bgr.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/rsz_wolfs_photo_0101.jpg?resize=1200%2C628", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9799676", "eventUri": "eng-9799676", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-09-20", "textStart": 1005, "textEnd": 1019, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-09-27", "textStart": 1489, "textEnd": 1503}], "sentiment": 0.2078431372549019, "wgt": 180, "relevance": 1}

He's an up and comer.\"\n\nClooney and Pitt put their money where their mouth is -- while also putting on their producer hats -- when they revealed to Deadline that they offered to take a huge pay cut in exchange for a theatrical release, in addition to streaming.\n\n\"Yeah.

It was an exciting time because it got to be one of those weird bidding wars which happen every once in a while, and it ended up being pretty extreme, and Apple came in with a really big number for Brad and I, and we said, 'We'd like to take less, as long as we can guarantee that we can have a theatrical release.'

It previously plotted to launch the film exclusively in cinemas across thousands of screens worldwide for an extended run, following the pattern set by previous releases like Killers of the Flower Moon, Napoleon, Argylle, and most recently, Fly Me to the Moon.\n\nThe company today announced that the film will get a small-scale limited theatrical release on September 20, followed by a worldwide streaming debut on Apple TV+ on Friday, September 27.\n\nWolfs stars Brad Pitt and George Clooney as two lone-fixers assigned to the same job, in an action comedy feature directed by Jon Watts.\n\nWhile some may see Apple's theatrical retrenchment here as a harbinger of doom, Apple is backing the film by announcing that work has already begun on a sequel. Deadline also reports high test scores with audiences in early previews, describing the movie as a \"crowd pleaser\".\n\nRather than saying anything about the quality of this particular title, the change may reflect a reality check of Apple's mediocre-to-poor box office performance to date. Apple spent a lot of money on taking films like Argylle and Fly Me to the Moon to theaters, with little to show for it.\n\nWhile the company says it is committed to theatrical releases for other films in the future, like the upcoming 2025 F1 movie (also starring Brad Pitt), it seems it will be more selective going forward. For instance, the other big original movies on its slate for this year are all announced as straight-to-streaming affairs.\n\nIf you are an Apple TV+ subscriber, this is probably a good thing as non-exclusive theatrical releases mean that you get to see the film at home faster. Under the original plan, Wolfs would have been showing in theaters exclusively for about 45 days, before hitting premium video-on-demand platforms for buy or rent for a month or so, and only then arrive on Apple TV+, months after the movie's original premiere, probably around November.\n\nBut now, anyone with an Apple TV+ subscription will be able to stream Wolfs, starting September 27.", "source": {"uri": "9to5mac.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "9to5Mac"}, "authors": [{"uri": "benjamin_mayo@9to5mac.com", "name": "Benjamin Mayo", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killers_of_the_Flower_Moon_(film)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Killers of the Flower Moon (film)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limited_theatrical_release", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Limited theatrical release"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fly_Me_to_the_Moon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fly Me to the Moon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Pitt", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brad Pitt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_TV+", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Apple TV+"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Watts", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jon Watts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadline_Hollywood", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Deadline Hollywood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art_release", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Art release"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Clooney", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "George Clooney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sequel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box_office", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Box office"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Comedy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_on_demand", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Video on demand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_One", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Formula One"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Trivia", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Trivia", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Studios", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Studios", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://i0.wp.com/9to5mac.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2024/08/apple-tv-wolfs-brad-pitt-george-clooney.jpg?resize=1200%2C628&quality=82&strip=all&ssl=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9799676", "eventUri": "eng-9799676", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-09-20", "textStart": 473, "textEnd": 485}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-09-27", "textStart": 551, "textEnd": 563, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": 0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 178, "relevance": 1}

Wolfs sees Clooney and Pitt, who previously starred together in the Ocean trilogy, as two professional fixers who are forced to work together after being hired for the same job despite both preferring to work alone. The film is directed by Jon Watts, who is best known for directing the MCU Spider-Man trilogy.\n\nWhile Wolfs has not yet hit theaters, Apple has reportedly given the sequel a greenlight according to Deadline. Watts will return as the director, writer, and producer of the sequel, and Pitt and Clooney are expected to reprise their roles. In addition to the sequel, Apple has also shifted its release plans for Wolfs. The film was initially slated for a wide theatrical rollout on September 20, 2024, but now the plan is for that release date to be a limited theatrical engagement before the film debuts on AppleTV+ the following week on September 27, 2024.\n\nApple Has Had a Tough Year at the Box Office Close\n\nApple has stepped up into the theatrical film game with some big heavy hitters, having courted big directors like Martin Scorsese for Killers of the Flower Moon and Ridley Scott for Napoleon, or big-name stars like those found in Argylle, Fly Me to the Moon, and Wolfs. Yet the box office returns on Apple's films have been rather disappointing, made worse by their massive budgets. Killers of the Flower Moon had a budget of $200 million but only grossed $68 million domestically and $157 million worldwide. That movie's investment can be said to have paid off with the nine Oscar nominations, but sadly it did not take home any wins on the night.\n\nMeanwhile, Napoleon's budget ranged between $130 and $200 million, so its $61 million domestic total came as a big letdown. The film's worldwide total of $221 million was not enough to recoup the cost, given how much Apple likely had to split up the profits in foreign markets. The disappointments continue, with both Argylle and Fly Me to the Moon being major commercial disappointments. Argylle brought in $96 million worldwide against a $200 million budget, while Fly Me to the Moon quickly dropped out of the box office top ten after opening less than a month ago with a total of $39 million worldwide against a $100 million budget.\n\nRelated Ocean's 11 Stars React to Possible Fourth Installment\n\nTwo Ocean's trilogy stars offer a surprising response to the possibility of returning to the Ocean's franchise.\n\nOf course, Apple is predominantly a tech company, meaning it gains profits from other revenue streams outside of its films and is therefore likely able to weather such storms. Yet, after four high-profile box office disappointments and scaling back on their television productions, it is no shock to see the studio pivot Wolfs to a limited release before going straight to streaming.\n\nMany of Apple's box office bombs became big hits on the streaming platform, and studies have shown that movies with even limited theatrical release are seen as more valuable to streamers than films released straight onto the platform. Even stars like George Clooney and Brad Pitt might not be box office draws anymore, so Apple will now have Wolfs as a high-profile release while also possibly securing a potential franchise for themselves.\n\nWolfs opens in theaters in limited release on September 20, 2024 and debuts on AppleTV+ on September 27, 2024.", "source": {"uri": "movieweb.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Movieweb"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Clooney", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "George Clooney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequel", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sequel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Pitt", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Brad Pitt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argylle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Argylle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killers_of_the_Flower_Moon_(film)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Killers of the Flower Moon (film)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Watts", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jon Watts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadline_Hollywood", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Deadline Hollywood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider-Man_in_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spider-Man in film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marvel Cinematic Universe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fly_Me_to_the_Moon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fly Me to the Moon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box_office", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Box office"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_producer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Film producer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_TV+", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Apple TV+"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ridley_Scott", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ridley Scott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Academy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Feature film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Scorsese", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Martin Scorsese"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean's_(film_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ocean's (film series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limited_theatrical_release", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Limited theatrical release"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box-office_bomb", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Box-office bomb"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean's_Eleven", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ocean's Eleven"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Studios", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Studios", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://static1.moviewebimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/clooney-pitt-4.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9799676", "eventUri": "eng-9799676", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2020-09-", "textStart": 885, "textEnd": 897, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": -0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 177, "relevance": 1}

With Wolfs and a potential sequel adding to its ranks, Apple TV Plus continues to be the best value option in the world of streaming services.", "source": {"uri": "imore.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "iMore"}, "authors": [{"uri": "john_anthony_disotto@imore.com", "name": "John-Anthony Disotto", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_TV+", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Apple TV+"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Watts", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jon Watts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Clooney", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "George Clooney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequel", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sequel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Pitt", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Brad Pitt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/81st_Academy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "81st Academy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider-Man_in_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spider-Man in film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venice_Film_Festival", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Venice Film Festival"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Comedy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Original_Film", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Original Film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friday_Night_Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Friday Night Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Severance_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Severance (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killers_of_the_Flower_Moon_(film)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Killers of the Flower Moon (film)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Lasso", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ted Lasso"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drama_(film_and_television)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Drama (film and television)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epic_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Epic film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joaquin_Phoenix", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joaquin Phoenix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Academy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Picture", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Academy Award for Best Picture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Scorsese", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Martin Scorsese"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napoleon", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Napoleon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Film"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Trivia", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Trivia", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qD6tGCt9Jkcc5tjSSB4Qvd-1200-80.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9799676", "eventUri": "eng-9799676", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-09-20", "textStart": 289, "textEnd": 301}], "sentiment": 0.223529411764706, "wgt": 171, "relevance": 1}

{"id": 239779862, "title": "Fake smiles and feeling compelled to oblige", "text": "You can\u2019t get inside the ropes at the Masters to speak to Rory McIlroy or make it onto the Anfield sod to meet Virgil van Dijk, so it\u2019s a special facet which the GAA possesses. The biggest stars often stay on up to an hour after games as they sign hurls, jerseys, helmets, balls, sliotars, or whatever comes nearest to hand for their young admirers. \u201cCan I have your hurl, jersey, helmet or boots?\u201d is commonly heard after big games, and players are generally more than happy to sate the appetite of the next generation. We\u2019ve all seen the hordes of children making a beeline for Kerry football star David Clifford at the final whistle, while Joe Canning was in similar demand during his glittering hurling days with Galway. Kilkenny legend Henry Shefflin is rumoured to have been a passenger in the county kit van on occasion as the Cats\u2019 team bus sped down the road, while \u2018The King\u2019 stayed on to satisfy his subjects. The level of footfall which Clifford receives after games is a sight to behold \u2014 it could be 20- or 30-people deep around him just seconds after the final whistle as fans scramble for their own memento. Interestingly, the two-time Footballer of the Year was quickly escorted off the pitch by an official in O\u2019Moore Park after last Sunday\u2019s victory over Louth as he avoided the latest bout of Clifford-mania. That won\u2019t happen again for the remainder of his county season, as pitch invasions are off limits in Croke Park \u2014 but GAA stars, Clifford even more than most, are incredibly giving of their time and there\u2019s rarely anything left unsigned. But what do they really feel about this growing craze and being public property while still trying to digest the result of an important game just moments after its conclusion? \u201cThere is something beautiful about a child or adult wanting to meet their idols or heroes and then they get that chance,\u201d one player says anonymously. \u201cYou will always appreciate the genuine fan among the swarm and you can almost tell by the way they approach you. When you are approached with politeness and patience, that goes a long way with me. \u201cIn saying that, it can feel like a bit of a chore and not optional at times. It can be frustrating after a game that you have put all your energy into. All you want to do is get to the lads and embrace each other, win or lose. \u201cI\u2019ve missed many dressing room moments, sing songs and celebrations. I\u2019d even say the heartbroken dressing room is missed, being there to console lads and vice versa. \u201cBeing caught outside signing autographs and taking pictures with a fake smile is the hardest. The frustrating thing about it is how rude and inconsiderate some people can be in those moments. \u201cThey can stick anything in your face and demand a signature or pull and drag out of you for a photo so they can get on their way home; it feels like there is zero consideration for me and my time. \u201cI\u2019ve never a problem with embracing fans to shake hands or a friendly hug, that\u2019s the stuff I really enjoy. There is something really nice and genuine about that, but the autographs and pictures can be a lot in those moments.\u201d \u200bKerry journalist Adam Moynihan found himself inundated with incredulous replies earlier this year after stating that it was \u201cjust plain wrong\u201d that Kilmacud Crokes star Shane Walsh was \u201cimmediately surrounded\u201d after their All-Ireland club SFC semi-final loss to Glen. \u201cShane Walsh is immediately surrounded by kids looking for selfies and autographs. I\u2019m sorry, but after a tough defeat, it\u2019s just plain wrong. Parents should have more cop on,\u201d Moynihan posted on X. The responses ranged from \u201care you for real?\u201d to \u201cwould you wise up\u201d, as well as \u201ccop on\u201d and \u201ccalm down\u201d, but that view is shared by some GAA players when speaking off the record. \u201cI\u2019m sure they\u2019re very excited going out to meet their heroes, but it can definitely be done in a better manner,\u201d another top player says. \u201cStewards and parents need to take a bit of ownership in that regard. Players generally don\u2019t mind, as long as it\u2019s done in the right way. The way that Clifford is being hounded after games, and I say hounded because there\u2019s just throngs of kids running at him. \u201cParents and stewards could manage the kids a lot better. I don\u2019t mind waiting around at all, but it\u2019s weather dependant too during the league where you\u2019re potentially freezing cold and it\u2019s lashing rain. \u201cThat\u2019s not as enjoyable. Where it\u2019s warm or that, I don\u2019t think players see it as any hassle waiting around and signing some stuff. You absolutely do enjoy giving back because you were in that situation yourself.\u201d Players can be damned if they do and damned if they don\u2019t, with Bernard Flynn\u2019s comments about Mayo football star Aidan O\u2019Shea following a challenge game in 2017 springing to mind. \u201cThere were 15, 20 kids around and he signed autographs,\u201d former Meath ace Flynn said. \u201cThe team was in a circle 10 yards away. No one asked him to leave what he was doing. Every other player was in a circle in a huddle talking. \u201cHe was left outside the ring and allowed do what he wanted. He decided then after a while to come into the ring when all the photographs were finished, which I found absolutely incredible. They did a warm-down and the same thing happened. \u201cThe whole team did a warm-down. Ten yards away he proceeded to have photos and selfies and whatnot and he was allowed to do his own thing. I stood back in amazement.\u201d \u200bMayo noses were seriously out of joint as a result, while some Dublin hurling fans took issue with John Mullane\u2019s observations following their 2022 Leinster SHC hammering to Kilkenny in Parnell Park. \u201cI couldn\u2019t get over what my eyes were seeing. You\u2019re after losing a game by 17 points, you accept that you have to do right by kids and get photos, take selfies and do a few autographs, that\u2019s grand, we\u2019ve all been there. But you make your way to the dressing room. I couldn\u2019t get over it, the Kilkenny lads, TJ Reid and that, were gone in. And there was about 12 of the Dublin lads out on the field. \u201cThe first part of trying to redeem yourself for the following week is getting into the dressing room and feeling that pain. You can take five minutes, but they were still on the field 20 or 25 minutes later. There\u2019s a time and a place for it.\u201d Many Dublin and Mayo footballers were still out on the pitch in Dr Hyde Park long after the final whistle of their epic draw last Sunday, while Limerick\u2019s all-conquering hurlers are regularly swarmed after their record-breaking exploits. Former Kilkenny star Richie Hogan \u201cnever found it an issue\u201d, but there was nervousness after losing a game as \u201cthe manager generally always wants all his players in the dressing room within a couple of minutes\u201d. Hogan insists that such access to its stars and their willingness to give back is what separates the GAA from other sports. \u201cIt\u2019s a brilliant part of the GAA and I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll ever lose that,\u201d Hogan said recently. \u201cYou could never imagine Kylian Mbappe or any one of the young international soccer players having to go through it, but that\u2019s an incredible part of what we have and it differentiates us from other sports.\u201d \u200bOffaly under 20 star Adam Screeney is the next big thing in hurling with his adoring fans wasting little time after the final whistle, and sometimes before it, to meet him \u2014 and he has no issue doing whatever is needed to inspire the \u201cfuture\u201d. \u201cI used to be going out annoying the TJ Reids, the Henry Shefflins and the Joe Cannings,\u201d he says. \u201cI still have a hurl at home with Joe Canning\u2019s signature on it and sellotape over it so it wouldn\u2019t come off. \u201cI don\u2019t really mind because they are the future of Offaly and they are the ones that are going to drive Offaly to the next level. I suppose we\u2019re lucky enough to be successful at the minute and we don\u2019t mind waiting. If it took an hour on the field afterwards to sign all them autographs, then so be it because we were once those kids.\u201d The autograph/selfie craze won\u2019t be going away any time soon as the present stars continue to play their part by inspiring the future, no matter the circumstances. That\u2019s the beauty of the GAA.", "summary": "<p>The ability to rock out onto a pitch and stop your heroes for an autograph or a selfie is a phenomenon that\u2019s unique to the GAA.</p>", "url": "https://www.independent.ie/sport/gaelic-games/fake-smiles-and-feeling-compelled-to-oblige/a450505061.html", "image": "https://focus.independent.ie/thumbor/4KvWxU-nfYOE1H-kn4e_N_ji8T4=/110x0:3187x2049/550x550/prod-mh-ireland/036d8c46-2389-4ab1-a886-d14e206793d0/0767378f-a95b-49f4-a4c8-ee7351b0e509/2807660.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-23 01:30:00", "author": "Michael Verney", "authors": ["Michael Verney"], "language": "en", "source_country": "ie", "sentiment": 0.189}

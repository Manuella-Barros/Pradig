However, with the damage so extensive -- affecting everything from the city's airport to its water service to public transit -- informing the public can be a helpful way to prepare them for disruptions, notes Malachi Walker, security advisor at security firm DomainTools.\n\n\"The transparency displayed by the City of Wichita in disclosing the ransomware attack is incredibly important so that those impacted can be on alert and make necessary responses,\" he says in an email to Dark Reading.\n\nThose disruptions indeed seemed numerous, if a \"frequently asked questions\" section in the city's alert that addresses people's chief concerns is any indication.\n\nWith systems down, the city will be going to cash-based systems for paying water bills, riding the bus, attending cultural events, and paying for landfill services, among several others that typically offer digital payment options.\n\nThe city also will be unable to live-stream city council meetings and advised people to attend in person if they were interested in the proceedings. Both the Wi-Fi service and the departure screens at Wichita's Dwight D. Eisenhower National Airport also are not functioning due to the attack, though flights are operating as normal.\n\nThere also is evidence that critical city infrastructure was affected by the attack, as officials advised in alert that those who have had their water shut off bring payment or proof of payment to City Hall and their water will be reconnected.\n\nMoreover, the city is waiving late fees and penalties for people who have difficulty paying water bills until the incident is resolved, though residents can still pay via cash, mail, or by going directly to Wichita City Hall. New accounts also can be set up at the city hall, while auto-payments are suspended for the time being, according to the alert.\n\nThe city's IT department is working with law enforcement and security partners to investigate, though specific details of the attack remain murky and the city said there is currently \"no timetable for when systems could be coming back online.\"\n\n\"We appreciate your patience as we work through this incident as quickly and as thoroughly as possible,\" according to the alert, which will be updated as the situation changes.\n\nRansomware attacks have become all-too-commonplace these days, although there was evidence earlier this year that some -- particularly those against industrial control networks -- are on the decline. Indeed, global law-enforcement actions have been proactive and successful in breaking up known ransomware groups, though it seems new ones appear to crop up almost as soon as one is dismantled.\n\nStill, each ransomware attack should be treated with an individual seriousness, particularly when so many public services are affected, as is the case in Wichita, notes Colin Little, security engineer at cybersecurity firm Centripetal.\n\n\"In this day and age, it is all too easy to say 'Yep, another cyber attack,' but that this statement needs to be confirmed in a press release boldly underlines the gravity of this event,\" he says in an email. \"That these services are executing business continuity measures suggests police and fire services will be degraded and in one of the largest cities in the US that is a big deal.\"\n\nKey now for the investigation is to get to the bottom of who the attackers are and what specific tactics they used so officials can bolster the security of networks in the future, security experts say.\n\nTom Kellermann, senior vice president of cyber strategy at security firm Contrast Security, suggested that Russia state-sponsored actors may be behind the attacks, as they have \"punitively escalated their destructive attacks against U.S. cities as revenge\" for a recently passed Congressional aid package for Ukraine. However, no culprit for the attack has yet been identified.\n\nFinding out the initial access point also is key to the investigation to safeguard networks in the future, notes another expert.\n\n\"Was it social engineering, unpatched software or firmware, or something else?\" says Roger Grimes, data-driven defense evangelist at security awareness training firm KnowBe4. \"If they can't identify how the ransomware first got initial access it's going to be a lot harder to prevent it from happening again.\"\n\nIt's also important to identify if encrypted data also was exfiltrated by attackers so officials can notify the public if there may be further consequences that may occur from the incident, such as the sharing of their info on the Dark Web or future attacks, Walker says.", "source": {"uri": "darkreading.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Dark Reading"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ransomware", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ransomware"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wichita,_Kansas", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wichita, Kansas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wichita, Kansas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Town_hall", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Town hall"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transparency_(behavior)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Transparency (behavior)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_transport", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Public transport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_network", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Computer network"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encryption", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Encryption"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airport", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Airport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Email"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reading,_Berkshire", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Reading, Berkshire"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wichita_Dwight_D._Eisenhower_National_Airport", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wichita Dwight D.

The news of the Wichita cyberattack emerged on LockBit's previously inactive platforms, which were reactivated after the shutdown of their official website.\n\nThe Wichita cyberattack targeted the official website (wichita.gov), prompting concerns over the security of critical municipal systems. While the ransomware group has not yet released any compromised data, they have set a deadline of May 15, 2024, for its publication.\n\nThe announcement by LockBit ransomware follows closely on the heels of an earlier notification by the city of Wichita regarding a ransomware attack on May 5, 2024, although the responsible ransomware gang was not initially disclosed. Wichita, the largest city in the state of Kansas, serves as the county seat of Sedgwick County and is a populous urban center in the region.\n\nThe Cyber Express has reached out to the state government to learn more about this cyberattack on Wichita. However, at the time of writing this, no official statement or response has been received. However, the city of Wichita denoted a ransomware attack that targeted various government and private organizations within the city.\n\nAccording to a press release by the city of Wichita, the recent posts from the state's Cyber Security Incident Update indicate ongoing efforts by the city's information technology department and security partners to address the cyberattack.\n\n\"Many City systems are down as security experts determine the source and extent of the incident. There is no timetable for when systems could be coming back online. We appreciate your patience as we work through this incident as quickly and as thoroughly as possible\", reads the official press release.\n\nIn the meantime, various city services and amenities have been impacted by the cyber incident, prompting adjustments to normal operations. Water systems remain secure and functional, with provisions in place for those experiencing difficulties paying bills or facing water shut-offs.\n\nTransit services, city vendors, park and recreation facilities, licensing procedures, and municipal court operations have all been affected to varying degrees, necessitating alternative arrangements such as cash payments and in-person transactions.\n\nSimilarly, services provided by cultural institutions, resource centers, planning departments, and housing and community services are also subject to modifications and delays as the city works to address the cyberattack. The city's airport and library services have experienced disruptions to Wi-Fi access and digital infrastructure, although essential operations continue with minimal impact on services provided to the public.\n\nThis is an ongoing story and The Cyber Express will be closely monitoring the situation.

It's the security infraction that makes for, quite literally, sleepless nights because it affects not just IT departments and SOCs but the whole operational function of the organization, reaching out to its partners and customers. At the same time, it inflicts stress and can have a catastrophic impact on the people it affects: their finances, their families and their health.\n\nGiven the ubiquity of ransomware attacks (and infosec thought leadership group SANS Institute suggests they spiked by 73 per cent to 4,611 in 2023), the threat could hardly be more stark. Gartner has even suggested that by 2025, attackers will target operational technology targets -- where digital meets industrial infrastructure -- to harm or even kill human beings.\n\nIt should perhaps be no surprise then that when we commissioned Vanson Bourne for the sixth global Enterprise Cloud Index (ECI) survey to ask 1,500 IT, DevOps and platform engineering decision makers about 2024 plans, ransomware was front and center. Polled as to their significant infrastructure challenges, the highest number (42%) pointed to ransomware and malware protection, slightly ahead of a related area, data privacy and compliance (39%).\n\nRansomware also figured prominently when the audience, spanning 16 countries, was asked to rank the order of primary drivers of infrastructure choice. Almost four in 10 (39%) cited ransomware, just behind performance (40%) and flexibility to run solutions across clouds and on-premises (41%).\n\nRansomware attacks are so common now that many, especially in the age of internationalizing breach disclosure rules, are open to admitting they have been hit. In this poll, 89% said they had been hit in the last three years. And, with some accounting to be made for those that are not allowed to disclose or those that do not know the answer, the percentage is likely to be even larger. Of those that admitted to having been penetrated, almost all (96%) said there had been negative impacts.\n\nFear of ransomware is being amplified by the uber-trend towards digitization and organizational dependence on data for decision-making and automation. We know that one of the best opportunities organizations possess for competitive differentiation is to excel with IT. But that has meant that digital operations become an even larger and tastier honeypot for attackers. Thirty years ago when manual clerical processes were still common, an IT outage would be a hassle. Today, with e-commerce, digital supply chains and marketing, it brings down pretty much everything in its wake.\n\nWhat can IT do? The troubling answer is that there is no silver bullet, no patch, single point of failure or point solution. In part, that's because the ransomware threat is only partly technical; it also attempts to persuade human beings to yield information. As we know, ransomware often targets human beings' vulnerabilities to gain both psychological and digital keys to the kingdom.\n\nSo, education is key and increasingly incident response teams can deliver expertise. However, the ability to automate threat detection and rapidly restore services to the last known 'good' state offers a paradigm that goes way further than has previously been possible. If we go beyond backup's retrospective measures, reducing downtime from hours, days or weeks to about 15 minutes can be done right now.\n\nOur poll shows the chasm to be crossed: 29% said they had recovered in hours and 33% said they had taken days... and these are just the relatively positive results. Compare those to the 17% who took weeks and 21% who said several weeks and the scale of disruption becomes clear.\n\nThankfully, the pressing need to act seems to be a case of 'Message received and understood'. When asked about what priorities should be for CIOs and CTOs in 2024, the number-one answer was data security and ransomware detection. And this isn't just a techie answer: C-suite respondents prioritize only data privacy above ransomware. The large majority of respondents (92%) say their organizations need to reduce their exposure to ransomware and almost four in five (78%) say they will increase ransomware protection spend through 2024.\n\nThe ransomware challenge is ubiquitous and exists across verticals, led by banking and financial services, healthcare, manufacturing, energy/utilities, governmental agencies and education.\n\nAI and digital transformation may be the media's obsessions and modern memes but our data says ransomware is a bigger CIO concern. They need to plan to repel ransomware attacks and take practical steps that are not just focused on remediation, backup and addressing fallout from attacks.

The counts include numerous charges of extortion and fraud.\n\nThe U.S. Department of the Treasury, along with officials in Australia and the United Kingdom, also announced financial sanctions against Khoroshev, 31.\n\nAnd the State Department is offering up to $10 million for information that leads to his arrest.\n\nJustice officials say LockBit has targeted more than 2,000 victims globally and stolen more than $100 million in ransomware payments.\n\nKaustubh Medhe is the vice president for Research & Threat Intelligence with Cyble, a cyber threat intelligence company based in Atlanta. He said Lockbit took credit on its website for hacking Wichita.\n\nMedhe said LockBit likely has targeted more than 100 government and public agencies in the U.S. He said city and county governments often don't have sophisticated security systems, which makes them targets for groups like Lockbit.\n\n\"Most of these threat actors are actually looking for low-hanging fruit,\" Medhe said. \"Because obviously, at the end of the day, they run as a business.

He said people should be aware of any suspicious activity on their credit or debit card, and be alert to phony emails from government agencies.\n\n\"Even if they (the city) recover from the attack, there is a high chance or probability that the data is already out there,\" he said. \"And the threat actors may start monetizing the data in terms of going on the dark web, trying to put it up for sale.\"\n\nAs the city deals with its attack, clinical operations at Ascension Via Christi hospitals and clinics in Wichita are being disrupted by a multi-state cyberattack on the health nonprofit Ascension.\n\nA spokesperson says the organization detected unusual activity on its network Wednesday and is investigating.\n\nAscension operates hospitals, clinics and nursing homes in 19 states.", "source": {"uri": "kcur.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "KCUR 89.3 - NPR in Kansas City.

The municipal court was closed until Wednesday, due to the same issue. While officials haven't publicly called the incident a cyber attack, cyber security breaches are on the rise locally and nationally, and experts say that trend is likely to continue.\n\nCity officials first noticed there was an issue Saturday morning. As a result, hearings and trials had to be continued to later dates. People could not post bond. The court's email service was also down, along with other city officials' emails.\n\nKansas City spokesperson Sherae Honeycutt said as of May 6 and until the website is fully functioning, a grace period is in place for anyone having difficulty making payments through the city's systems. Cases filed before Nov. 6, 2023 will not be able to make payments through the Missouri Casenet system. Bonds can be posted at designated police stations.\n\nHoneycutt said while most city departments have continued to operate as usual, KC Water's payment services are still unavailable. Residents must pay with cash or check at 4800 E 63rd Street until the website is fully back up.\n\nThis week's incident marks the latest in a string of recent cyber disruptions to Kansas City government and surrounding municipalities -- illustrating an escalating pattern of cyber threats.\n\nOn Jan. 25, A ransomware attack impacted the Kansas City Area Transportation Authority, which is when bad actors seize control of computer systems and demand a ransom before they relinquish control. Regional call centers and KCATA landlines couldn't receive calls because of the attack.\n\nOn April 2, Jackson County's assessment, collections and record of deeds offices were closed due to a ransomware attack.\n\nA few weeks later, Kansas City Scout operators had an outage after a cyber attack that prompted officials to shut down the traffic information system for the metro as a protective measure. The Play Ransomware group claimed responsibility for the cyber attack Tuesday, according to Jack Danahy, vice president of strategy and innovation at Nuharbor Security. Official confirmation on who did the attack is not yet known. Officials say the KC Scout cameras and message boards could be down for months.\n\nLast year, a cyber attack also shuttered online access to Kansas courts for months. It was found to have been orchestrated by affiliates of a Russian-based ransomware group.\n\nDuring the pandemic, the Independence City Council voted to spend $4 million to beef up the city's cybersecurity protections and upgrade the outdated computer network. Four months later, the city's system was attacked. Officials at that time said it was caught before it could infect the whole network.\n\nWhy target local governments?\n\nRansomware attacks are increasingly directed at government agencies, law enforcement and public service departments because they tend to have comparatively weaker cyber security controls and measures compared to private companies, according to Kaustubh Medhe, vice president of research and threat intelligence with Cyble, which specializes in gathering intelligence from the different depths of the internet.\n\n\"Most of the ransomware groups have a variety of mechanisms to actually infiltrate a victim's network. It generally starts off either with a phishing mail or maybe a malware, which helps you steal credentials of users, or by exploiting some kind of a vulnerability,\" he said.\n\nIn fact, over 90% of successful cyber attacks start with a phishing email, according to Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency regional external affairs officer Jeffery Kelly.\n\nThe ecosystem surrounding ransomware has changed over the past few years, Danahy said, noting there's now a two-tier economy inside the ransomware groups. One creates the infrastructure used to run the technically difficult parts of the attack to spread the vulnerability. Then, they sell access to the platforms to affiliates, which Danahy defines as organizations that figure out how to run a phishing attack or find a way to get into the system. Once the attack is over, the groups do a revenue split.\n\n\"If you are the attack group that's creating the infrastructure, you get reuse of the tooling that you've built for whatever purposes. And then if you're one of the affiliates, you can actually get these relatively sophisticated attacks done without having to understand or use all the technical underpinnings of them yourself,\" he said.\n\nGovernments being targeted also means residents are at increased risk of having their information leaked to the dark web. The issue has become so prevalent, Danahy said, that people should recognize their information could very well already be out there.\n\nWhat do investigations look like?\n\nThe first step for investigators after an attack is to isolate the issue by disconnecting from the network, which could lead to shutting down websites, Medhe said. Governments and private companies typically have incident response plans in place to rely on.\n\nSecurity teams have to put together a timeline and figure out how the attacker got in, what they accessed and what was moved out of the network. This, he said, takes a lot of skill and time. Investigations can take anywhere from a few weeks to a few months depending on how widespread the infection was.\n\nDuring this time, residents could encounter issues with doing business or paying bills online, could contend with longer wait times and could lose access to the same level of service responsiveness from government agencies, Medhe said.\n\n\"My recommendation always is that as citizens we have a responsibility to both respect and have some patience with the team during the cleanup, but we also have the responsibility to demand transparency,\" Danahy said.\n\n\"The last thing you want to have happen is for the organization to feel pressured to get it over with quickly. And they leave some small amount behind, which allows the same attackers to have a back door to do it again.\"\n\nWhat can be done to prevent attacks\n\nAfter the attack, governments should \"make sure antivirus and endpoint security solutions are up to date on their endpoints and servers, so they can detect any suspicious activity and block them before an attack goes through,\" Medhe said.\n\nCompanies and governments must also have a strong patch management program to regularly look for vulnerabilities, educate staff on phishing attacks and teach the help desk about social engineering to prevent bad actors from calling and posing as employees in order to have a credential reset, according to John Bryant, cybersecurity advisor with the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency.\n\nThe agency offers no-cost resources that includes things from assessments to cyber hygiene scanning to workshops. They also offer training and tabletop exercises to mature cyber security programs.\n\nKansas City officials have not disclosed the cause of the latest computer outage and did not immediately respond to comment. The Kansas City FBI confirmed they've been in contact with the city, but did not provide further information.", "source": {"uri": "kansascity.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Kansas City

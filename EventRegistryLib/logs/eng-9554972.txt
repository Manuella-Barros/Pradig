His 41 points tied with teammate Carter Wilkie for most among players who have entered the transfer portal this offseason.\n\nWisconsin also pursued Wilkie but he joined North Dakota.\n\nThe Badgers had good success with one of the highest-scoring players in the portal in 2023, when David Silye followed coach Mike Hastings from Minnesota State. Silye was Wisconsin's top-line center last season.\n\nWisconsin also will be looking for a big contribution from Laskosky as a right wing. All six forwards who left the program were right-handed: Mathieu De St. Phalle and Silye signed pro deals with a season of eligibility remaining; Cruz Lucius (Arizona State), William Whitelaw (Michigan), Charlie Stramel (Michigan State) and Sam Stange (Omaha) have transferred.\n\n\"I think I can provide exactly what I was doing here at RIT: play a 200-foot game and it starts with the defensive side of the puck,\" Laskosky said. \"But I can provide some offense, whether that's 5-on-5 or on the power play.\"\n\nLaskosky had 32 goals and 84 points in 124 games over four seasons at RIT. He played four full seasons in the Alberta Junior Hockey League before that and finished with 40 goals in 56 regular-season games for his hometown Camrose Kodiaks in 2019-20.\n\nLaskosky was the fourth addition to the Badgers' roster via the transfer portal this offseason. Forwards Ryland Mosley and Kyle Kukkonen joined from Michigan Tech and Scarfone came from RIT. Wisconsin had to replace 11 departures from last season, in which the team won 13 more games than it did in 2022-23.\n\nWisconsin added depth to its defensive corps by getting a commitment from Weston Knox, captain of the Minot Minotauros of the North American Hockey League.\n\nIt's likely that the Badgers will still be looking to add another forward to fill out the 2024-25 roster. Forwards Gavin Morrissey and Ryan Botterill, defensemen Logan Hensler and Jack Phelan and goalie Anton Castro signed to join Wisconsin as freshmen next season.\n\n\"The team had a great season under coach Hastings for the first year,\" Laskosky said. \"I see a bright future for this program for the next couple of years under him. I'm so excited to get a chance to learn from him for a year.\"\n\nLove 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n\nTags Lee-national Sports Games And Toys Transportation Be the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.", "source": {"uri": "lacrossetribune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "La Crosse Tribune"}, "authors": [{"uri": "todd_d_milewski@lacrossetribune.com", "name": "Todd D.

Badgers coach Greg Gard addresses each player's departures from the program.\n\nEven amid a packed weekend for the University of Wisconsin men's basketball team, the Badgers still gave their full attention to 2025 four-star recruit EJ Walker, a forward at Lloyd Memorial High School in Erlanger, Kentucky.\n\nAs Central Arkansas transfer point guard Camren Hunter was leaving, and the day before Northern Illinois transfer forward Xavier Amos arrived, the Badgers target and his parents were greeted by Wisconsin assistant coach Sharif Chambliss and walked through a busy Madison campus on April 27 -- seeing the start (and the aftermath) of the Mifflin Street Block Party.\n\nPeople are also reading...

It's one they've given several times before now.\n\n\"I have a great relationship with coach (Gard) and coach (Chambliss),\" Walker said in a text to BadgerExtra. \"I can say they showed me and my family a great time.\"\n\nThe Badgers have put in a lot of time with Walker, the official visit being the latest example of their efforts. Though Wisconsin entered the summer needing to fill as many as seven scholarships that were set to be open ahead of the 2025-26 season, the program's work in the transfer portal has lessened the need to fill all of those vacancies with incoming freshmen.\n\nHunter and Amos each have a year of eligibility remaining after this upcoming season, and Gard said on May 3 that Wisconsin isn't done adding via the transfer portal, which could ease the pressure on the upcoming class even further if the Badgers bring on a player with eligibility past next season. In that regard, Wisconsin can zero in on its priority targets, and Walker has certainly emerged as a player the Badgers view among them.\n\nOn top of being around campus at a time the Badgers were adding to their future roster, Walker toured some of the new offices at the Kohl Center and met with strength and conditioning coach Jim Snider to see the weight room as it was under construction.\n\n\"When I came up for the Tennessee game, I got to see the locker room upgrades,\" Walker said, \"and this time around the best part we got to see, still under construction, but the weight room is going to be elite.\"\n\nThey sat with Gard and went through film, where Wisconsin reiterated Walker's fit and the team's vision of him playing a three-man role in the Badgers system if he continues to improve in the areas of his game he's been developing. Wisconsin already has one 2025 commitment in De Pere High School guard Zach Kinziger, and Walker's addition would add size and versatility to a class that could still end up quite large.\n\nWalker is aiming for the end of the summer for his commitment, so Wisconsin remains engaged late in his recruitment process. He has a visit to Ohio State in early June, and his father said they're \"still waiting on\" Purdue to set up a visit. A visit to Minnesota \"maybe\" will get set up, his father said before adding that new schools are still welcome, but they would have to be the right fit.\n\nWalker will eventually cut his list down to four or five before making a commitment. And so far, the Badgers have done enough to stay involved.\n\n\"I expect they will be in there when I cut my list next,\" Walker said.\n\nPhotos: Chucky Hepburn's Wisconsin men's basketball career

His 41 points are tied with teammate Carter Wilkie for most players to enter the transfer portal this offseason.\n\nWisconsin also pursued Wilkie, but he joined North Dakota.\n\nThe Badgers had a lot of success in 2023 with one of the highest scoring players in the portal David Silye followed coach Mike Hastings from Minnesota State. Silye was Wisconsin's top center last season.\n\nWisconsin will also be looking for a big contribution from Laskosky at right wing. All six forwards who left the program were right-handed: Mathieu De St. Phalle and Silye signed professional contracts with one season of eligibility remaining; Lucius Cruz (state of Arizona), Willem Witlaw (Michigan) Charlie Stramel (state of Michigan) and Stange himself (Omaha) have been transferred.\n\n\"I think I can provide exactly what I did here at RIT: play a 60-yard play and it starts with the defensive side of the puck,\" Laskosky said. \"But I can provide some offense, whether it's five-on-five or on the power play.\"\n\nLaskosky had 32 goals and 84 points in 124 games over four seasons at RIT. Before that, he played four full seasons in the Alberta Junior Hockey League, finishing with 40 goals in 56 regular season games for his hometown Camrose Kodiaks in 2019-2020.\n\nLaskosky was the fourth addition to the Badgers' roster through the transfer portal this offseason. Forward Ryland Mosley And Kyle Kukkonen came from Michigan Tech and Scarfone came from RIT. Wisconsin had to replace eleven departing players from last season, in which the team won thirteen more games than in the 2022-2023 season.\n\nWisconsin added depth to its defensive corps by getting a commitment from Weston Knox, captain of the Minot Minotauros of the North American Hockey League.\n\nIt's likely the Badgers are still looking for a new forward to fill out the 2024-2025 roster. Forwards Gavin Morrissey and Ryan Botterill, defensemen Logan Hensler and Jack Phelan and goaltender Anton Castro signed to attend Wisconsin as freshmen next season.\n\n\"The team had a great season the first year under coach Hastings,\" Laskosky said. \"I see a bright future for this program for the next few years under him. I am so excited to have the opportunity to learn from him for a year.\"", "source": {"uri": "exbulletin.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ExBulletin"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Badgers coach Greg Gard addresses each player's departures from the program.\n\nThat University of Wisconsin men's basketball wing John Tonje never got it going at the high-major level last season is not his own fault.\n\nGarding Against Cancer signature event comes together amid wild Wisconsin men's basketball offseason\n\nSo when Wisconsin coach Greg Gard was looking into the Missouri transfer this offseason, he looked back further than his eight games and 9.8 minutes per game with the Tigers -- limited that much due to an offseason foot injury -- to his time as a featured player at Colorado State.\n\n\"That really showed me what he can do at a high level,\" Gard said. \"So that was convincing for me there.\"\n\nPeople are also reading...

As a senior at Colorado State, Tonje scored 14.6 points per game on 47.3% shooting while making 38.9% of his 157 3-point attempts and 81.5% of his free throws.\n\nThose numbers didn't even earn Tonje a spot on one of the Mountain West's all-conference teams in a strong year -- San Diego State eventually advanced to the national championship, New Mexico spent parts of the 2022-23 season in the top 25 and neither of those teams had the conference player of the year, which went to San Jose State's Omari Moore.\n\nTonje, a 6-foot-6 wing, will immediately boost the Badgers' scoring from where it stood following the departure of AJ Storr to Kansas. Tonje looks capable of filling the role that Storr played within Wisconsin's offense somewhat seamlessly, even if he doesn't reach the level of impact that Storr -- a potential future NBA player -- had in his one year at Wisconsin, leading the Badgers in scoring with 16.8 points per game.\n\nBut there's a reason why Tonje will hear comparisons to Storr, and why Storr heard comparisons to Johnny Davis: wings with positional size, athleticism and the ability to create their own shot have fundamentally changed the Badgers' offense in recent years. Despite all three being different players, each has a function that seems to have become essential to Wisconsin, however they may operate within it.\n\nHere's who Wisconsin men's basketball will play in expanded Big Ten schedule\n\nTo get a fuller view of what Tonje can do against high-level competition, BadgerExtra watched in full Colorado State's 65-61 Mountain West Tournament loss to national runner-up San Diego State, among other footage.\n\nHere's a breakdown of what Tonje provides the Badgers.\n\nJohn Tonje's on-ball creation can complement Wisconsin's guards\n\nA lot of game clips showed Tonje working around high-screen actions off and on the ball. It's easy to see why the Badgers saw Tonje as a schematic fit for a Wisconsin team that will look to do a lot of the same to free players on the wing.\n\nOpen Jim: What is Wisconsin men's basketball's strategy in the transfer portal?\n\nTonje has a nice array of dribble moves to get to the rim and find his shot. Against the Aztecs, Tonje scored at the rim, in the post, in the mid-range and from behind the arc. He scored 17 points on 6-of-10 shooting. He was one of the most efficient shooters in the country in his senior season, ranking 179th among qualified players with a 59.9% true shooting percentage per KenPom.\n\nHis length and slippery movement looks a great deal like the way Davis moved on the floor, and it's clear in watching his highlights at Missouri that his mobility was impacted due to the injury. Even some of his misses showed good off-ball movement. It was the same with Storr last season, particularly in late-game situations when his playmaking was even more valued. If he doesn't finish at the rim, he could wind up at the line, ranking 319th in the nation in free throw rate (40.1%) per KenPom. At Wisconsin, Tonje can be utilized as an offensive spark no matter the situation.\n\nGames against Big Ten teams show Wisconsin men's basketball transfer's potential\n\nWisconsin's John Tonje can play above the rim\n\nOne of the first plays that stood out from Tonje's Colorado State highlight mix was a collection of dunks against Wyoming on Feb. 24, 2023. One of the biggest losses Wisconsin faced was the above-the-rim athleticism that Storr offered. It awakened the Badgers at several moments, and was surely an impactful element worth considering when building a team.\n\n3 reasons why transfer unlike previous Wisconsin men's basketball point guards\n\nTonje has shown -- even if he's not quite the leaper Storr was with the Badgers -- that he could provide something similar. Tonje had an example against San Diego State, too, running out in transition and finishing like Wisconsin saw from Storr many times.\n\nJohn Tonje will impact the Badgers' scoring in transition\n\nThe dunk against the Aztecs is one example of Tonje taking good angles up the floor. Playing with All-Mountain West first-teamer in point guard Isaiah Stevens, Tonje seemed accustomed to running the floor next to another offensive initiator.\n\nForward transferring to become NBA-level player for Wisconsin men's basketball\n\nThat will likely be a similar case at Wisconsin, as Central Arkansas transfer Camren Hunter, fifth-year Max Klesmit, senior Kamari McGee and sophomore John Blackwell will all spend a good amount of time handling the ball when they're in the game. Tonje looked poised scoring in transition with the ball or without it. And even at full speed, he is capable of creative finishes.\n\nPhotos: Bo Ryan's Wisconsin men's basketball coaching career Love 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n\nTags Sports Basketball Games And Toys

She tied her career high for goals (four) and points (11) this season.", "source": {"uri": "jsonline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Journal Sentinel"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisconsin_Badgers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wisconsin Badgers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisconsin", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wisconsin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wisconsin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frozen_(musical)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Frozen (musical)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Lawrence_Saints_men's_ice_hockey", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "St. Lawrence Saints men's ice hockey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-America", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "All-America"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Forward (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goaltender", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Goaltender"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio_State_University", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ohio State University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caroline_Harvey_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Caroline Harvey (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patty_Kazmaier_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Patty Kazmaier Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_football_national_championships_in_NCAA_Division_I_FBS", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "College football national championships in NCAA Division I FBS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Crosse,_Wisconsin", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "La Crosse, Wisconsin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "La Crosse, Wisconsin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Hockey", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Hockey", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Hockey/Field_Hockey", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Hockey/Field Hockey", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Hockey/Ice_Hockey", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Hockey/Ice Hockey", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Seasonings", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Seasonings", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Hockey/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Hockey/History", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/authoring/authoring-images/2024/03/17/PMJS/73008104007-uwwomice-st-lawrence-2-march-16-2024.JPG?auto=webp&crop=2935,1650,x3,y262&format=pjpg&width=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9554972", "eventUri": "eng-9554972", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "wgt": 153, "relevance": 1}

He is looking to make the jump to the Division I level with three years of eligibility remaining.\n\nWisconsin has depth at center with senior Steven Crowl back for a final season and sophomore Nolan Winter set to come off the bench. Boyed would likely enter below Winter on the depth chart, though could play his way into backup minutes.\n\nThe Badgers have made three transfer splashes thus far: guard John Tonje, point guard Camren Hunter and power forward Xavier Amos. Greg Gard and his staff remain active in the portal as the program looks to improve entering 2024-25 and beyond.\n\nBig Ten programs can never have enough depth and talent at forward and center, given the teams on the schedule.

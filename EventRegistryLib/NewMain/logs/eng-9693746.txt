SAMI MOKBEL takes us inside the England camp as players enjoy downtime between matches\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSpain are perhaps aided by playing Georgia in the last-16, the side least expected to reach the final out of any side left standing.\n\nThey would then face the winners of Germany's clash with Denmark in the quarter-finals, with a possible semi-final against Portugal or France in the semi-final should those sides reach that point of the competition.\n\nSpain to their credit are the only side that still maintain a 100 per cent record in the competition after winning all three group stage games.\n\nSouthgate will hope his England side can improve their displays and carry momentum into what is likely to be a difficult final.\n\nThey have been boosted by the return to training of Phil Foden today, after he returned to Germany last night following the birth of his third child.\n\nThe Football Association confirmed on Wednesday that the Manchester City star had returned to the UK to due to a 'pressing family matter'.\n\nFoden boarded a plane back to England straight after Tuesday's draw against Slovenia to be with his family.\n\nThe attacker's partner Rebecca Cooke has had a baby boy and Foden has made a swift return to Germany. He is back in training at England's Weimar base, ahead of their last-16 clash with Slovakia on Sunday.\n\nThere will be a lot of eyes on England's team selection following their underwhelming displays in the group stage.\n\nOne particular position will be in midfield, after Trent Alexander-Arnold and Conor Gallagher both struggled alongside Declan Rice.\n\nKobbie Mainoo made a positive impact off the bench against Slovenia and could be an option.\n\nThere have also been clamours for Anthony Gordon and Cole Palmer to feature after their impressive cameos.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk",

Despite winning Group C with one win and two draws, England's performances have left much to be desired, and their poor attacking showings have faced heavy criticism.\n\nGareth Southgate's side held on to win 1-0 against Serbia in their opening match of the tournament, before uninspiring draws against Denmark (1-1) and Slovenia (0-0) to finish the group campaign.\n\nCaptain Harry Kane scored once in those three games but has been criticised for his performances. However, much like in the last European Championship group stage, Kane tends to perform better in the knockouts.\n\nEngland's all-time record scorer has netted six goals in his last six appearances in the knockout stages of major tournaments for the Three Lions (two in two at the 2022 World Cup, four in four at Euro 2020). His seven goals overall in the knockouts are also the most of any England player.\n\nSouthgate will again ponder his attacking options and lament a lack of natural width on the left flank as he tries to find a winning formula to take his nation into another quarter-final.\n\nKey Stats\n\nThe Three Lions have never lost in six meetings against Slovakia, winning five and drawing one. The most recent encounter was a 2-1 victory in 2017, with goals from Eric Dier and Marcus Rashford.\n\nSlovakia has never gone past the last-16 stage at the Euros, having fallen in this round in 2016 before going out in the groups three years ago.\n\nAfter a surprise 1-0 win over Belgium in their tournament opener, Slovakia lost 2-1 to Ukraine before drawing 1-1 with Romania to go through as one of the best third-placed teams.\n\nEngland's only failure to defeat Slovakia was at Euro 2016 in a goalless draw in Saint-\u00c9tienne, where they had their most shots (29) in a European Championship match on record (since 1980).\n\nPredictions\n\nEngland are the big favourites coming into this Euro 2024 last-16 tie against Slovakia, with the Opta supercomputer predicting they will come out on top inside 90 minutes in 65.1% of pre-match simulations.\n\nOverall, the Three Lions have a 75.4% chance of getting through to the quarter-finals, only below Spain's likelihood (82.4%).\n\nWhile the nation hopes for more attacking intent, another pragmatic display is expected. England's two goals in three matches are a concern, but they looked solid defensively, conceding just one goal.\n\nSlovakia, who scored just one more goal than England in the groups, may not overly test the Three Lions.\n\nA nervous, low-scoring affair could be on the cards in Germany, but England should have the quality to create some openings and book their place in the next round.", "source": {"uri": "businessday.ng", "dataType": "news", "title": "Businessday NG"}, "authors": [{"uri": "anthony_nlebem@businessday.ng", "name": "Anthony Nlebem", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Lions", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Three Lions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_European_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "UEFA European Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovakia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Slovakia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Slovakia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Kane", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Harry Kane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gareth_Southgate", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gareth Southgate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arena_AufSchalke", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arena AufSchalke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gelsenkirchen", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gelsenkirchen"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gelsenkirchen"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovenia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Slovenia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Slovenia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Rashford", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marcus Rashford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Dier", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Eric Dier"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AS_Saint-\u00c9tienne", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "AS Saint-\u00c9tienne"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romania", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Romania"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Romania"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgium", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Belgium"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Belgium"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Work-Life_Balance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Work-Life Balance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Tournaments", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Paper_and_Pencil/Tic-Tac-Toe", "label": "dmoz/Games/Paper and Pencil/Tic-Tac-Toe", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://cdn.businessday.ng/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/England-vs-Slovakia.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9693746", "eventUri": "eng-9693746", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2, "wgt": 157, "relevance": 1}

TV channel, live stream and kick-off details", "body": "England are set to face Slovakia in the knockout stages of Euro 2024, hoping to bring some much-needed excitement to their campaign.\n\nThe Three Lions' performance in Germany has been lacklustre so far, with fans eagerly awaiting a display of the free-flowing football they've been missing this month.\n\nDespite finishing at the top of Group C, England managed only one victory in their three group matches, scoring a mere two goals against Serbia, Denmark, and Slovenia.\n\nA round of 16 showdown with Slovakia, who came third in Group E, is on the cards for the Euro 2020 runners-up today. A win would pit England against Switzerland in the quarter-finals.\n\nAhead of the crucial Sunday match, here's everything you need to know about England vs Slovakia, including kick-off time, TV channel, and how to stream the action.\n\nWhen does the match start?\n\nThe match will commence at 5pm on Sunday (June 30) at the Veltins Arena in Gelsenkirchen. This is the only stadium where England have tasted victory in the tournament so far, thanks to Jude Bellingham's winning goal against Serbia in England's Euro 2024 opener.\n\nWhere can I watch England vs Slovakia?\n\nThe England v Slovakia match will be broadcast on ITV1, with coverage starting from 3.30pm, hosted by lead anchor Mark Pougatch. The match can also be streamed live online via the ITVX platform and app, available on various devices.\n\nWhat's the team news?\n\nThe teams will be announced roughly an hour before the game is due to kick off, at around 4pm. No wholesale changes are expected, though Gareth Southgate is expected to name Kobbie Mainoo in the starting XI for the first time, with Chelsea's Conor Gallagher dropping back to the bench. There have also been calls for Anthony Gordon to start, with Phil Foden having missed a chunk of training this week for the birth of his child.\n\nThis article contains affiliate links, we will receive a commission on any sales we generate from it.

When Italy and England met in the last European Championship, it was that rarest of things: the two best teams in the tournament to that point actually both made it to the final to go head-to-head. This year, that already looks impossible.\n\nThat especially came home to us when compiling our power rankings of the remaining teams in the last 16 of the tournament. Spain and Germany were the obvious top two, but the field beyond that was very much of a muchness - and those two leading candidates were drawn such that they could face one another as early as the quarter-finals.\n\nSo who else is there? Portugal had looked unconvincing against the Czech Republic and lost to Georgia but we still had no real choice but to put them third. France still haven't got firing, yet were right behind them in fourth purely by default. We put England sixth, largely on the basis of 'well, at least their defence hasn't been total crap even if everything else has'.\n\nWhy Germany Have Been The Best Team At Euro 2024 (So Far)\n\nWe'd be exaggerating if we said that tournament has been something of a footballing spring for some of the unfancied contenders. Switzerland have been slowly but steadily improving for the better part of 20 years, going from group stage fodder to consistent last 16ers to now two-time Euros quarter-finalists. Austria's potential under Ralf Rangnick had not gone unnoticed by the stats bods in the build-up to the tournament.\n\nNor is it unusual for a dark horse or two to rear their heads and gallop into the latter stages of the tournament: witness Denmark in 1992 and 2021, the Czech Republic in 1996 and 2004, Greece in 2004, Turkey and Russia in 2008, Wales in 2016.\n\nWhat has been unusual is just how thoroughly the bigger countries have carked the bed out in Germany.\n\nThe last edition of the tournament was compelling from start to finish precisely because there were multiple contenders who dominated their groups and looked incredibly good doing it: Italy, Belgium and the Netherlands all took maximum points, England took seven of nine; France, Germany and Portugal had the excuse of all being drawn in the same group. The only true surprise was Spain finishing two points behind Sweden, who took seven points.\n\nThis year, only Germany and Spain made it to seven points - the fewest at a Euros since 2004, when there were only four groups rather than six. With no reprieve available for third-placed sides, Germany, Italy and Spain were all eliminated at the group stage.\n\nWe all know what happened then. Greece's shock elimination of France in the quarter-finals guaranteed that at least one unfancied side would reach the final - the Czech Republic and Denmark were the other two sides on their side of the draw - while the two other best sides at the tournament, Portugal and England, were drawn against one another in the quarters. Greece, of course, went on to shock Europe by beating Portugal in the final.\n\nOne half of all our Euro 2024 wall charts is now shaping up in similar fashion: should England make it past Slovakia in the round of 16 (and we're absolutely not taking that for granted), the only remaining traditional big name potentially left on the path towards the final are the Netherlands, thanks to Switzerland's victory over reigning champions Italy.\n\nBut of course, Italy's elimination also makes one thing crystal clear to Gareth Southgate and his side: if they fail to improve, they will fall, regardless how much name value their squad carries.\n\nGeorgia have already beaten Portugal, Austria have seen off the Dutch, England themselves have been held by Slovenia. In a one-off game under increasing pressure, the difference between the so-called best and the rest is not as big as England might like to think. They found that out first hand in their humbling at Iceland's hands in 2016.\n\nBut conversely...if England - or another of the big boys - can find their stride at this stage of the tournament, that could be enough for them to go all the way.\n\nWe have a guide on how to get Euro 2024 tickets if you're still looking to go to the tournament.

They were placed in Euro 2024 Group C alongside Serbia, Denmark and Slovenia.\n\nEngland started the group with a nervy 1-0 win over Serbia and had the chance to qualify top after two games. However, they drew with Denmark and Slovenia, finishing the group stage with the third-lowest xG (2.19) ahead of only Serbia (2.11) and Scotland (0.95), both of whom were knocked out.\n\nSo, who could Southgate's men take on if they progress through Euro 2024 knock-out stage?\n\nNew customer offer.

Please gamble responsibly.\n\nLast 16: England didn't learn their last 16 opponents until after the final whistle went on the group stage. In the end it was Slovakia who earned their spot in this fixture, after finishing third in Group E.\n\n1-0 vs Serbia - Not a scintillating performance from The Three Lions, but very much job done in Gelsenkirchen. An early goal from Jude Bellingham proved enough in a 1-0 victory and, in truth, England were never really troubled. There were whispers of discontent that England allowed Serbia to play themselves back into the game but if they can grow into the tournament, it could be a vital three points on their route to the final in Berlin.\n\n1-1 vs Denmark - As with their game against Serbia, England started well and took the lead, this time through Harry Kane. But unlike against Serbia, Denmark actually equalised and looked the more likely to take the win. It was a game that flattened a lot of the optimism surrounding this England team, and means they have to turn up against Slovenia.\n\n0-0 Slovenia - On paper, this was the easiest game of the group for England and one they would have welcomed as their final group game. England had 74% but managed just four shots on target and obviously failed to score. That said, Slovenia are on an nine-game unbeaten run, during which they also stood firm against Portugal. Plus Southgate's substitutes produced a spark of excitement. Cole Palmer in particular, of whom Roy Keane said, \"I wouldn't want to play against him.\"\n\nPre-tournament the quality of Harry Kane, Phil Foden, Jude Bellingham and Bukayo Saka should all fill England fans with dreams of glory this summer.\n\nThen they scored two goals between them in a group England were expected to dominate.\n\nHowever, England avoided the side of the draw that could have put them up against Germany, Spain, Portugal and France. So it could have been a lot worse.\n\nAs things stand, England have also conceded the lowest xG total at the tournament and the introduction of Kobbie Mainoo and (later) Cole Palmer led to more dynamism against Slovenia.\n\nThe creativity - as mentioned above - has been inferior to the likes of Georgia and Albania. It all seems to stem from the fact Southgate doesn't yet know what England's best team is.\n\nIt is also true that while England may have progressed to the latter stages in recent tournaments, when it's come to the biggest games they have been found wanting. The 2018 World Cup semi-final saw Croatia come from behind to win the match and it was a similar story in the Euro 2020 final, where Southgate wasn't able to see his side hold onto the lead against Italy, losing on penalties. The 2022 World Cup saw England fall to France at the quarter final stage, making it the third tournament in a row that England were unable to defeat nations that sit around them in the Fifa world rankings. This summer will be another test as to whether England have the ability to break out from the pack and become the elite national side that many believe they can.\n\nAll three of those defeats in recent years have fallen at the feet of Southgate, with many England fans blaming the coach for tactical mistakes or substitutions that were ill-judged or mistimed. With Southgate's future still under question following Euro 2024, this could be his last chance to prove that he can get the small things right and lead England to European glory.\n\nPalmer was England's most dynamic player upon replacing Bukayo Saka, though the Arsenal winger himself has been one of the brighter attackers throughout the group stage.\n\nMainoo's presence also coincided with an increased tempo while Trent Alexander-Arnold looked more comfortable at right-back. Could Kyle Walker be a viable left-back option? Luke Shaw is reportedly some way of match fitness and prior to being subbed, Kieran Trippier was seen gripping his calf -- an injury he was said to be nursing pre-match.\n\nThe quiet pre-tournament optimism among England fans is diminished and tense exchanges between players and pundits have played out in press conferences. The media can be the England squad's best friend or worst enemy and this summer is proving to be no different.\n\n*Using Bookmaker/Affiliate links on squawka.com may earn us a commission, at no additional cost to you. 18+ only.

A chance to move to the quarterfinal round is up for grabs. The Three Lions' last two games ended in a draw. On June 25, England and Slovenia ended in a 0-0 tie. Likewise, Slovakia tied with Romania 1-1 on June 26.\n\nKickoff is set for noon ET. The Three Lions are -240 favorites (risk $240 to win $100) in the latest England vs. Slovakia odds, while the Slovaks are +850 underdogs. A 90-minute draw is priced at +320 and the over/under for total goals scored is 2.5. Before locking in any Slovakia vs. England picks, you need to see what proven SportsLine soccer insider Martin Green has to say.\n\nAfter working in the sports betting industry for several years, Green became a professional sports writer and handicapper and has covered the game worldwide. Last year, Green was profitable in multiple areas on his soccer picks, including the Champions League (+3.05 units), FA Cup (+3.07), EFL Cup (+4.47) and Euro 2024 qualifiers (+6.30), among others. He also was solid with his Premier League picks this year, going 30-22-1 (+7.07).\n\nNow, Green has broken down England vs. Slovakia from every angle and has locked in his picks and Euro 2024 predictions. You can head to SportsLine now to see Green's picks. Here are the betting lines and trends for Slovakia vs. England:\n\nEngland vs. Slovakia money line: England -240, Draw +320, Slovakia +850England vs. Slovakia over/under: 2.5 goalsEngland vs. Slovakia to advance: England -700, Slovakia +400ENG: England's last two games ended in a tieSVK: Slovakia have scored three goals in the tournamentEngland vs. Slovakia picks: See picks hereWhy you should back England\n\nThe Three Lions are going to need multiple players to step up for them in this pivotal matchup. They may be looking at different players to deliver and midfielder Declan Rice could be someone that's depended on. During the 2023-24 English Premier League season for Arsenal, Rice finished with seven goals and eight assists.\n\nDefender Kieran Trippier is a tactical player on the back line for England. Trippier has been an active presence disturbing advances from opposing teams while being a precise passer on the counterattack. In the 2023-24 English Premier League for Newcastle, the 33-year-old had one goal and 10 assists. See which team to pick here.\n\nWhy you should back Slovakia\n\nThis is just the third time that Slovakia have qualified for the Euro in its history. In 2016, they made it to the Round of 16 but in 2020 they didn't make it past the group stage. Heading into the tourney, the Slovaks only dropped one game in their last seven outings. Meanwhile, in the group stage, they went 1-1-1. They are going to need more of an offensive push, logging three goals in three games.\n\nForward Ivan Schranz has been impressive thus far in the Euros. Schranz has done a sound job creating high-percentage scoring chances around the net and he's capitalized. In three group-stage games, the 30-year-old had a team-best two goals on three shots. Midfielder Ondrej Duda can be another weapon, scoring two goals in three Euro tournaments for Slovaks. See which team to pick here.\n\nHow to make Slovakia vs. England picks\n\nGreen has broken down England vs. Slovakia from every possible angle and is leaning Under on the goal total. He also has locked in three confident best bets. He's sharing his Euro 2024 picks and analysis only at SportsLine.\n\nSo who wins England vs. Slovakia on Sunday, and where does all the betting value lie?

It has fed the narrative that Gareth Southgate, who has the best knockout record of any manager in our country's history, often gets lucky with his opponents.\n\nHe became the first man since Terry Venables to lead England to a semi-final when he did so in 2018. Then, three years later, became only the second man after Sir Alf Ramsey to make the final of a major tournament, before coming up short.\n\nNow his next task at this Euros will be Slovakia as fans continue, despite a lack of quality thus far, to believe that it could be coming home. Southgate currently has the best crop of players he's ever had since taking over suddenly in 2016, but is struggling to get a winning tune out of them.\n\nAfter several near misses big things were expected as England came into the tournament as joint favourites with France. Now, as the draw falls kindly in their lap, expectation may only increase. The list of possible knockout opponents will only feed the idea that Southgate's record, whilst impressive, owes itself to fortuitous draws.\n\nWe take a look at the rankings of all of the opponents Southgate's England have taken on in major tournaments.\n\n2018\n\nTunisia 21st, Panama 55th, Belgium 3rd, Colombia 16th, Sweden 24th, Croatia 20th\n\nAverage: 23rd\n\nLittle was expected of the Three Lions when they headed to Russia and they negotiated the group as expected. Narrowly beat a Tunisia side that were competitive, hammered Panama 5-0 thanks to a Harry Kane hat-trick and struggled against the highly-ranked Belgium - who also went on to beat them in the third-place game.\n\nAfter finishing second though the draw, as it has done again, opened up for Southgate and co. The failure of Germany meant they were no longer a potential opponent. Argentina's flop meant they were also on the other half of the draw.\n\nThe English penalty hoodoo was ended when Colombia were dispatched in the last 16 before Sweden were also seen off easily enough. Kieran Trippier's goal to put England 1-0 up in their semi-final will remain iconic, but then the Croatian quality began to tell and few could argue they weren't good value for that win.\n\n2020\n\nCroatia 14th, Scotland 44th, Czech Republic 40th, Germany 12th, Ukraine 24th, Denmark 10th, Italy 7th\n\nAverage: 21st\n\nWith the majority of their games to be played at Wembley, provided England topped the group, this was a massive opportunity. A home tournament in all but name and Southgate's side came in as the 4th best team in the world, according to the rankings, and the third best in Europe.\n\nThey gained revenge over Croatia with a narrow win at Wembley, struggled against the Scots before seeing off the Czechs as they completed their group without conceding. A match against Germany presented a chance to settle old score. The Germans were a fading force with their manager's departure already announced and a historic win was achieved.\n\nThe feel good factor continued as Ukraine were hammered in Rome. The Danes, who had improved throughout the tournament, opened the scoring in the semi-final before England battled to victory in extra-time.\n\nThen came the Italians, who were on a record unbeaten run that dated back to well before the Euros. They'd seen off heavyweights in Belgium and Spain and recovered from going 1-0 down to the Three Lions to gain tournament success on penalties. Much like the Croatian game, despite going ahead, England were largely second best.\n\n2022\n\nIran 20th USA 16th, Wales 19th, Senegal 18th, France 4th\n\nAverage: 11th\n\nEngland remained one of the globe's leading nations but fans wanted the tournament success they so craved. Based on opposition, this was by far the toughest tournament Southgate had. Critics may also point to a correlation between that and the earliest exit of his tenure.\n\nGroup wins over Iran and Wales were sandwiched between a lacklustre draw with the USA that saw the Three Lions cop criticism. A routine last 16 success over Senegal led to a last eight clash with Les Bleuss. France ultimately came out on top, winning 2-1 despite England having periods of dominance.\n\nKane scored from the spot, but also blazed a penalty high into the stands as the Three Lions were left to think about what might've been. Southgate's England have faced teams ranked above them in major tournaments on three occasions and have never won.\n\nJoin our new WhatsApp communityand receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

Fans are pictured watching England's game against Denmark last week\n\nTens of thousands of England fans will be watching the game in Germany, with millions more watching at home\n\nVentusky Privacy Policy\n\nFans will pack out pubs or stock up on beers and burgers as they whack out the barbecues ahead of the huge clash\n\nThe Met Office predicts that the mercury will hit 23C in London, 22C in Southampton and 21C in Plymouth\n\nAfter a week of scorching heat and sunshine, today will be slightly cooler and cloudier - but afternoon temperatures are still expected to reach 23C (73F) in London, 22C (72F) in Southampton, 21C (70F) in Plymouth and 20C (68F) in Cardiff.\n\nBut the North will be cooler with highs of just 16C (61F) expected in Newcastle and 17C (63F) in Manchester. Glasgow will reach 17C, while Hull, Norwich and Birmingham could hit 18C (64F).\n\nThe slightly cooler temperatures may be welcomed by some Brits who have been whacking the fans on as they struggle to sleep at night.\n\nMet Office Meteorologist Ellie Glaisyer said: 'It's been a bit of a cloudy start for some of us this morning. We've seen a band of rain sinking its way southwards and that eventually clears its way to the southeast over the next couple of hours, leaving plenty of sunny spells for the majority of the UK.\n\n'It's Northern Ireland, western parts of Wales, and southwest England which are likely to see the best of the sunshine today.\n\n'Feeling pleasant in that sunshine, although temperatures perhaps a touch lower than what we saw yesterday, 22C or 23C in the south and quite widely elsewhere in those mid to high teens.'\n\nEngland fans will be flocking to beer gardens despite the game coming in the evening before Monday work again.\n\nSo far, England games have either fallen on Sundays or midweek, leaving many fans racing around to try and catch the games after work.\n\nEngland fans will be hoping the Three Lions can bounce back from their 0-0 draw against Slovenia\n\nRevellers who are spending the week at Glastonbury Festival will not be able to watch the game on a big screen after organisers confirmed last month that they would not show any England games\n\nGlastonbury organisers confirmed they will not show the match on Sunday, despite broadcasting the England men's and women's World Cup quarter finals in 2010 and 2019, respectively.\n\nEngland's game on Sunday is set to clash with Shania Twain, who will be finishing her set on the Pyramid Stage when the match kicks off, and Avril Lavigne on the Other Stage.\n\nRead More Harry Kane vows he will be at 'peak sharpness' for England's last-16 Slovakia showdown at Euro 2024\n\nIt means fans at the site on Worthy Farm in Pilton, Somerset, could be left unaware of the score with phone signal notoriously bad at the festival that will be full of 200,000 people.\n\nGlastonbury organiser Emily Eavis said this week that the festival set up a screen to watch fixtures during the World Cup in 1998, but times have changed.\n\n'We used to have a screen here as no-one had any means of finding out what even the result was because we were so cut off from the outside,' she added.\n\n'Now obviously, everyone's connected and I think you know it's a music festival. I'm sure if people want to see it enough they can check for results or whatever on their phones.\n\n'But hopefully I'm encouraging people to put their phones away and forget about the outside world.'\n\nEngland will go into Sunday's match following an underwhelming final group game against Slovenia on Tuesday which was watched by 14.5million viewers on ITV.\n\nThe game saw Southgate's side progress to the European Championship knockout phase as Group C winners, despite being held to a 0-0 draw.\n\nEngland fans will be hoping they can launch their pints in the air in celebration. Fans are pictured here celebrating an England goal against Slovenia in Boxpark which was later ruled out\n\nEngland fans react as they watch the Engalnd vs Slovenia match at Boxpark Wembley\n\nSome 14.5million people tuned in on watch on all devices, including ITV1 and ITVX, peaking at 15.4million.\n\nAn average of 9.2million viewers watched ITV's full live coverage, which ran from 6.45pm until 10.45pm, the broadcaster said.\n\nFans expressed frustration at England's performance after they were unable to turn their dominance into a morale-boosting victory.\n\nBut finishing as group winners resulted in the Three Lions getting a favourable draw against Slovakia who finished third in their group.\n\nIt also meant England avoided what appears to be the much tougher half of the draw for the knockout stages.\n\nThe goalless stalemate with Slovenia in Cologne on Tuesday was the continuation of England's struggles in Germany, where they have also so far drawn 1-1 with Denmark when Harry Kane scored and beat Serbia 1-0 courtesy of a Jude Bellingham header.\n\nEngland supporters at the Cologne Stadium on Tuesday during the match against Slovenia\n\nEngland fans in the Old Market in Cologne last Tuesday ahead of the game against Slovenia\n\nFans booed England off following a dour display against the Danes and followed suit after the Slovenia result, with beer cups thrown in the direction of manager Southgate, who has since called on any of the fans' ire to be aimed at him rather than his players.\n\nRead More SAMI MOKBEL takes us inside the England camp as players enjoy downtime between matches\n\nBut he will have been boosted by Spain, Germany, Portugal, France and Belgium all being on the other side of the draw, meaning England will avoid that quintet until a potential final in Berlin on July 14.\n\nInstead, Southgate's side return to Gelsenkirchen on Sunday to face Slovakia, who advanced as one of the best third-placed teams from the group stage.\n\nVictory on Sunday would see England progress to a quarter-final against either Switzerland which would take place on Saturday, July 6 at 5pm.\n\nIt comes as Mail Sport launched its 'We're Backing England' campaign, with Sir Keir Starmer joining Rishi Sunak and England fans in the new drive to unite the nation behind the squad.\n\nSir Keir, who has a season ticket at Arsenal and plays five-a-side football each week, said: 'There's been too much criticism [of the team so far], get behind them, get them over the line.\n\nRead More Sunak and Starmer put political differences aside and back Mail's We're backing England campaign\n\n'This is a really important competition. England always do a bit of this at the beginning of competitions.\n\n'Get behind the team - it's a full squad of players who've all had fantastic seasons for their respective clubs. Just get behind the team and I support this campaign.'\n\nMr Sunak, a Southampton fan, said: 'I remember when we could only dream about England qualifying top of their group and being favourites in their first knockout game. And we also know that this England team tends to shine when the pressure's on.\n\n'So I hope that, like me, the whole country will get behind Gareth and the boys when they play Slovakia on Sunday, and I'm confident they'll put on a show for us.'\n\nLiberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said: 'Let's unite behind Gareth and the team. We have world-class players who can bring it home. Our fans in the stadiums have been amazing.

England laboured to a 1-0 win over Serbia, a 1-1 draw with Denmark, and a goalless draw against Slovenia.\n\nMeanwhile, Slovakia finished third in Group E with a surprising win over Belgium, a defeat to Ukraine, and a draw against Romania.

In Sunday's late game at 3 p.m., Spain face Georgia. The latter is the only team with longer than 10-to-1 moneyline odds to win its round of 16 matchup.\n\nBoth England-Slovakia and Spain-Georgia will air on FOX.\n\nEngland remains the tournament favorite, even after an underwhelming showing in group play. Whether Gareth Southgate's team can improve enough in the final third to advance beyond the quarters is one of the biggest unanswered questions of Euro 2024.\n\nBut against Slovakia, which profiles as one of the worst teams that reached the round of 16, England should advance even if its struggles to generate scoring opportunities continue.\n\nSince stunning Belgium 1-0 on June 17 in one of the biggest upsets in Euro history, Slovakia have been who pundits thought they were, losing 2-1 to Ukraine and drawing Romania 1-1.\n\nBettors shouldn't expect Sunday's match to be a breeze for England. There's nevertheless not much of a case for Slovakia to upset England, which posted by far the lowest expected goals allowed (xGA) figure -- 1.1 -- of the 24 teams in group play.\n\nGeorgia is coming off a shocking win over Portugal in the final match of Group F. Napoli's 23-year-old star winger, Khvicha Kvaratskhelia, leads one of the stories of the tournament. The win over Portugal, which was sparked by an early goal from Kvaratskhelia, sealed a spot in the round of 16, a massive success for a country making its first appearance in this competition.\n\nGeorgia embodies the phrase \"playing with house money,\" but if the odds for this match are anything to go by, Sunday's battle with Spain looms as the end of the road.\n\nRemarkably, Georgia has made it this far despite boasting by far the highest xGA (8.0) of any team in the field.\n\nEuro 2024 Best Bets for June 30, 2024\n\nPlay 1: England to win and Slovakia not to score (-105) BetMGM\n\nDid we mention that England has been tough to crack? The only goal this team has allowed came on a brilliant long-range strike by Denmark's Morten Hjulmand from about 24 yards out.\n\nIf that's what it takes to beat this defense, betting on the Three Lions to keep a clean sheet makes a ton of sense.\n\nPlay 2: Both Teams to Score -- Yes (+145) DraftKings\n\nFor a higher-upside play in Spain vs. Georgia, see below.\n\nAlthough Switzerland and Germany both managed shutout victories on Saturday -- and England look poised to do the same -- this play makes sense here after a closer look at Spain's defensive performances to date.\n\nWhile La Roja allowed zero goals in group play, they may be due to concede after surrendering no shortage of scoring opportunities (2.7 xGA, to be exact) in their first three Euro 2024 matches.\n\nPlay 3: Spain vs. Georgia -- 3-Leg Single-Game Parlay (SGP): Spain Team Total Over 1.5 AND First Half Total Over 0.5 AND Both Teams to Score -- Yes (+220) DraftKings\n\nWe rarely recommend two-leg parlays, much less three-leggers, but you have to get creative to find value when the favorite is -500 or longer and the underdog is 14-to-1.\n\nSpain scoring two goals feels like a lock given Georgia's defensive issues.\n\nAs for this SGP's second leg, it's hard to know when the dam will break for Georgia against Spain, but one way or another, expect there to be at least one goal on the scoreboard by halftime.\n\nSee above for the logic behind including the plus-money BTTS prop in this SGP.", "source": {"uri": "newsweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsweek"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Switzerland knocked out the reigning European champions Italy in a surprise 2-0 win whilst hosts Germany sent Denmark packing after several contentious VAR decisions.\n\nTonight, it's England's turn in the spotlight as they look to step it up a gear in the round-of-16 after a rather flat start to the tournament as they whimpered through as Group C winners despite two draws and a narrow 1-0 win.\n\nEngland entered the competition as tournament favourites after cruelly missing out on Euros glory last time round as they lost the final to Italy on penalties. The tournament favourites have barely got going despite Bayern Munich talisman Harry Kane captaining the side.\n\nFans and pundits alike have been calling on manager Gareth Southgate to shake things up a bit and make some changes to his starting XI with Chelsea's Cole Palmer and Newcastle's Anthony Gordon favourites to start.\n\nSouthgate will be hopeful Jude Bellingham finds form again after a blistering start to the tournament as he netted against Serbia in the opening game but the Real Madrid midfielder seemed to go missing against Denmark and Slovenia.\n\nEngland will be desperate to avoid the game going to penalties. In World Cups and European Championships, they have experienced nine penalty shootouts and only won two of those.\n\nMeanwhile, their opponents Slovakia have appeared in three European Championships since they became independent in 1993 but have never got past the round-of-16. As Czechoslovakia they were crowned European Champions in 1976 with eight Slovaks in the starting XI.\n\nSlovakia came third in group E, the group where all four teams scored the same amount of points. They surprised everyone when they beat Belgium 1-0 in their opening game with Slavia Prague's striker, Ivan Schranz netting the winner. He scored again in their 2-1 defeat to Ukraine in the second game of the group stages.\n\nManager Francesco Calzona has made just one change so far in the tournament and is unlikely to begin experimenting now. However, striker Robert Bozenik is expected to return to the starting line-up today. Since Calzona took charge he has overseen 10 wins from 16 games.\n\nEngland face Slovakia today at 5pm on ITV1.\n\nLater on tonight, Spain will take on Georgia. Georgia are tournament debutants and the lowest ranked side in the competition. Despite low expectations, they pulled off a spectacular win against Portugal in their final group game, a side 68 places higher than them in the FIFA rankings, to secure progression to the last 16.\n\nStar man Khvicha Kvaratskhelia and Georges Mikautadze are perhaps the Georgians best chance of overcoming the Spanish side which contains the likes of Atletico Madrid striker Avaro Morata and PSG midfielder Fabian Ruiz.\n\nMany will no doubt be cheering for the underdogs Georgia but Barcelona winger Lamine Yamal, who became the youngest footballer to play at a European Championships at 16 years old has won over football fans around the world with his energy and charisma.\n\nEarlier in the week, he found out he had passed his exams whilst playing for Spain but he will be hoping his summer will only get better as he seeks his first goal of the tournament.\n\nSpain have won six of their previous seven meetings with Georgia. The two teams met in qualifying for the Euros 2024 with Spain winning 10-2 on aggregate (7-1 away and 3-1 at home) so it will take a lot for Georgia to cause another upset tonight.", "source": {"uri":

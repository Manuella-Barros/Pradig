With his stellar record of success in turning around a police department that desperately needed strong, forward-thinking leadership, Chief Garcia will most certainly be a target of countless cities across Texas looking to improve public safety with a new Chief, especially Houston. We expect every City Councilmember who promised to protect their constituents from violent crime will take all steps necessary, without the excuse of bureaucratic slowdowns, to ensure we keep Eddie Garcia as our police chief and maintain the positive momentum we currently have in reducing crime in Dallas. The committed men and women of the Dallas Police Association wholeheartedly support maintaining Chief Eddie Garcia as the leader of the Dallas Police Department.\"\n\nSources within the department say Garcia may be asked to run the Houston Police Department which can offer him a contract with higher pay and better job security.\n\nThat's because of the recent departure of Dallas City Manager TC Broadnax who hired him 3.5 years ago.\n\nGarcia has been credited for a 13 percent reduction in violent crime last year in Dallas, during a time when many other big cities are seeing increases.\n\nIt has raised the chief's profile and made him in demand among cities that can offer him a long-term contract which the City of Dallas charter currently prohibits for his position.\n\nThe speculation has been enough for Interim Dallas City Manager Kim Tolbert to release a statement this evening that says:\n\n\"I believe Chief Gracia wants to remain here. To the cities shopping in Dallas for a new chief, I have one message for you: 'Turn around and go back home.'

Those sources also said that the City of Austin was interested in Garcia.\n\nSo how does Dallas feel about those reports? Dallas interim city manager Kimberly Bizor Tolbert didn't' hold back, telling Houston and Austin to \"turn around and go back home.\"\n\nHere's her full statement:\n\n\"It's no surprise that other Texas cities are expressing interest in Dallas Police Chief Eddie Garcia. He has been the key leader who has delivered a lower crime rate to Dallas, and he has helped increase police morale while boosting residents' confidence in the direction of the department.\n\n\"Obviously, City Council members and I want to keep him in Dallas doing a good job. It will take flexibility, creativity with a hefty dose of accountability to accomplish that, but we are working tirelessly to develop solutions. I believe Chief Garcia wants to remain here.\n\n\"To the cities shopping in Dallas for a new chief, I have one message for you: 'turn around and go back home.' In the meantime, I will keep the City Council and the public informed about the progress on these issues.\"\n\nRELATED: Houston showing interest in Dallas police chief after Troy Finner's retirement, sources tell our sister station, WFAA\n\nRELATED: HPD's new acting chief answers tough questions on first day\n\nRELATED: 'An amazing job in creating relationships' | Houston residents react to Chief Finner's retirement\n\nRELATED: A closer look at what led up to Houston Police Chief Troy Finner's retirement\n\nBut is Houston courting Garcia?\n\nKHOU 11 reached out to the City of Houston. Here's how they answered.\n\n\"Mayor Whitmire wants to improve at HPD, get the department out of the media headlines and return to a focus on public safety. He is confident Acting Chief Satterwhite will be a strong leader and it is too soon to discuss the next steps in finding a new police chief.\"\n\nSo who is Edgardo Garcia? He was hired as chief in Dallas in 2021 and is currently employed in an at-will capacity, meaning he can leave at any time. The City of Dallas may need to offer a contract to stay, according to WFAA's sources.\n\nThe interest from Austin, according to WFAA, is because the police chief position has been open since August, when Joseph Chacon retired. It could also be attractive for Garcia because former Dallas City Manager T.C. Broadnax is now the city manager there. Broadnax hired Garcia in Dallas, according to WFAA.\n\nWFAA reports that under Garcia, violent crime in the city has been down for three consecutive years and is now at its lowest point in six years.\n\nBefore Garcia was in Dallas, he was chief of the San Jose Police Department from 2016 to 2020. That's where he started his law enforcement career.\n\nLarry Satterwhite is serving as the interim police chief while the search for a permanent replacement goes on.\n\nFinner's departure came amid the scandal surrounding the \"lack of personnel\" code that led to the suspension of thousands of cases.

Interim City Manager Kim Tolbert told our neighbors to \"go back home,\" but let's unpack her odd statement.\n\nDallas Police Chief Eddie Garcia is suddenly a wanted man in two of the state's other large cities, and our City Hall was caught looking. Houston and Austin are both without police chiefs; Houston's resigned amid a rather alarming department scandal and Austin's reportedly got fed up that the city couldn't agree to a contract with the police department and retired after 25 years.\n\nComplicating matters is that T.C. Broadnax has taken the city manager job in the state's capitol, and, if you'll recall, Garcia told reporters that he would \"go through a wall for that man\" once his boss' messy Dallas exit became public knowledge.\n\nAnd so it wasn't totally a surprise that interim City Manager Kim Tolbert sent out a statement on Wednesday night to reporters. Her phrasing, however, warrants a raised eyebrow. Without naming them, she told our neighbors to \"turn around and go back home.\" (She also misspelled his name as \"Gracia\" once. Maybe she just had thankfulness on her mind.)\n\nSo what's going on here? The crux of the issue, as the Dallas Morning News reported this morning, is that the Dallas city charter precludes the City Council from signing a contract with the police chief. He is an at-will employee, meaning the city manager could part ways with him at any time just as he could part ways with the city. I got on the phone this morning with sources around City Hall and tried to get a sense of what's happening behind the scenes. Here's what I can tell you, although I promised not to name names so folks could speak freely.\n\nNew city managers often want their own cabinets. The top of the org chart famously cleared out in 2017 when Broadnax came onboard, either by his hand or by the employees taking the hint. Already, as my colleague Bethany Erickson reported yesterday, Tolbert has reconfigured the city's reporting structure, made some promotions, and filled some positions -- and she's only doing the job on an interim basis. Two of Broadnax's top deputies appear set to leave for city manager gigs in DeSoto and Topeka, Kansas. Tolbert should be anticipating a further exodus, which means she will have more hiring to do. It would be a headache to find a new police chief on top of all that, and probably a migraine to find one who has the respect and support Garcia has among both the rank and file and his bosses.\n\nGarcia hasn't commented. But multiple City Hall sources say that the chief began wanting some additional contractual protection two years ago, when Mayor Eric Johnson and a few of his colleagues tried and failed to fire Broadnax. By all accounts, Garcia seems to enjoy his job and the city he's in charge of policing. But he also said it felt like he was losing his favorite coach when Broadnax resigned.\n\nHouston has a strong mayor system, which means Mayor John Whitmire will make the next hire with the City Council's approval. Broadnax is the man to watch in Austin, which shares with Dallas a council-manager system of government that will require the city manager to get his council's approval. It's hard to imagine either body turning down Garcia, who has had success lowering violent crime here.\n\nConveniently, the Dallas City Council is presently undergoing a review of its charter. The months of discussion during the review process never included an amendment to allow the Council to sign a contract with a police chief. Former Dallas City Councilmember Adam McGough has told the rest of the Council that there is a mechanism by which they could do so, but has not elaborated and did not return my phone calls. He was also on the charter review board and did not suggest an amendment related to a police chief contract.\n\nThe City Council has until May 17 to submit final charter amendments for discussion, so perhaps this is setting the table for such a deal. (Voters will have to approve any changes in November.) Until then, apparently our best public response is the city's chief executive sending statements not unlike Cavaliers owner Dan Gilbert's infamous Comic Sans screed after LeBron James left for the Heat.", "source": {"uri": "dmagazine.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "D Magazine"}, "authors": [{"uri": "matt_goodman@dmagazine.com", "name": "Matt Goodman", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eddie_Garcia", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Eddie Garcia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_manager", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "City manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_of_police", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief of police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Police_Department", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Police Department"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austin,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Austin, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Austin, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City_Council", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York City Council"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dallas_Morning_News", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Dallas Morning News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Municipal_charter", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Municipal charter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mayor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DeSoto,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "DeSoto, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "DeSoto, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bethany,_Oklahoma", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bethany, Oklahoma"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bethany, Oklahoma"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topeka,_Kansas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Topeka, Kansas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Topeka, Kansas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Johnson_(Texas_politician)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Eric Johnson (Texas politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Whitmire", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "John Whitmire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor\u2013council_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mayor\u2013council government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council\u2013manager_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Council\u2013manager government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charter", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Charter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Cavaliers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Cavaliers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violent_crime", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Violent crime"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Urban_Living", "label": "dmoz/Home/Urban Living", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Apartment_Living/Roommates", "label": "dmoz/Home/Apartment Living/Roommates", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://assets.dmagstatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Mayor-Eric-Johnson-and-Chief-Eddie-Garcia-Illustration-by-Dean-MacAdam.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9552133", "eventUri": "eng-9552133", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-17", "textStart": 3860, "textEnd": 3866}], "sentiment": -0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 159, "relevance": 1}

Middlebrooks, who also served on the Citizens Police Review Board in the past, said that speaks volumes.\n\n\"When you think about Dallas, DFW area, we are receiving anywhere from 300 to 300-plus new residents per day,\" said Middlebrooks. \"For Chief Garcia to still be able to achieve the crime rate being lower, I think that speaks to his caliber of work in which he's doing.\"\n\nWFAA sources said Houston and Austin have their eyes on Garcia as well. Their police chiefs have retired.\n\nIn order to stay, WFAA sources said the chief needs job security. He wants a contract, but the Dallas city charter does not allow that. Without one, Garcia can step down at any time. \"No, give nothing else consideration but staying,\" said Dr. Middlebrooks.\n\nWFAA reached out to the cities of Austin and Houston. Austin's spokesperson said, \"The search for Chief of Police has not yet been launched, therefore there are no candidates at this time.\"\n\nHouston Mayor's Office said, \"Mayor [John] Whitmire wants to improve at HPD, get the department out of the media headlines and return to a focus on public safety. He is confident Acting Chief [Larry] Satterwhite will be a strong leader and it is too soon to discuss the next steps in finding a new police chief.\"\n\nStill, that has not stopped the buzz around Dallas.\n\n\"I think we should leave it at that and let the city manager, chief of police work all the details out and then bring it to the public,\" said Tennell Atkins, Dallas Mayor Pro Tem representing District 8.\n\nAtkins said it is a city management issue.\n\n\"As a policymaker, it's not my decision,\" Atkins said. \"That is city management. We are the policymakers.\"\n\nWhile his focus is on police and fire pensions, Atkins still commends Garcia for his work in his district.\n\n\"I try to make sure the neighborhood police officers stay there,\" Atkins said. \"That's one thing Chief Garcia did.\"\n\nIt is something that communities have noticed too.\n\n\"The open-door policy. He's approachable,\" said Middlebrooks.\n\nShe added a message to cities interested in Garcia.\n\n\"Find your own,\" Middlebrooks said. \"Stay Chief Garcia. Stay! We need you. There's still work to be done.\"", "source": {"uri": "wfaa.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WFAA-TV Channel 8"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WFAA", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "WFAA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAACP", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NAACP"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas\u2013Fort_Worth_metroplex", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas\u2013Fort Worth metroplex"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_of_police", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief of police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Police_Department", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Police Department"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austin,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Austin, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Austin, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston_Police_Department", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Houston Police Department"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Municipal_charter", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Municipal charter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_manager", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "City manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mayor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor_of_Dallas", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mayor of Dallas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan's_8th_congressional_district", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michigan's 8th congressional district"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_tempore", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pro tempore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pension", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pension"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 72}], "image": "https://media.wfaa.com/assets/WFAA/images/ea7b424a-11a8-4522-a7e9-b7fa428f39da/ea7b424a-11a8-4522-a7e9-b7fa428f39da_1140x641.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9552133", "eventUri": "eng-9552133", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 155, "relevance": 1}

City Manager Broadnax begins national search.", "body": "In his first major decision, Austin City Manager T.C. Broadnax, whose first official day on the job was Monday, will conduct a national search for the city's next police chief and hopes to name a leader to the position this summer.\n\nThe city is hiring the search firm Mosaic Public Partners, the same company that recruited Broadnax, for the search and to bring forward finalists for the job, said Michele Gonzalez, a spokeswoman for the city.\n\nThe position is expected to be posted within days, and the city is currently working with the recruiter to develop a profile for the type of police leader they say Austin needs.\n\nInterim Police Chief Robin Henderson, who has held the position vacated by Chief Joe Chacon since September, told the American-Statesman that she plans to review the posting and evaluate her next steps.\n\nBroadnax said immediately after his hiring in late March that the appointment of a permanent police chief is among his highest priorities. He reiterated that in a statement Monday.\n\nThe hiring process for the position, likely to pay in the $300,000 range, is expected to include a period of public input to give the community an opportunity to interview finalists.\n\nBroadnax's appointment requires city council approval.\n\nThe Austin Police Department has struggled in recent years with fewer officers - it has 321 vacant positions among 1,812 positions right now - and the city and police union currently are in negotiations for a new labor agreement.\n\nMichael Bullock, president of the Austin Police Association, said: \"The priority should be someone who will first and foremost take care of officers currently with the department and their needs. You're not going to recruit new people if you don't take care of the ones already here. Chief Henderson has exemplified that and has worked diligently towards addressing the many challenges we have.\"\n\nKathy Mitchell, senior advisor for Equity Action, said that Austin needs a police chief \"who is ready to address the real problems with our department with transparency, tenacity and integrity.\"\n\nShe cited high attrition from the department's cadet training classes for vacancy rates and the neglect of criminal investigations as high priorities for the next chief.\n\n\"There are major management level issues, and we need a manager who will make the needed changes, stand up to the internal resistance and show the community what is being done,\" Mitchell said.\n\nWFAA-TV, citing anonymous sources, reported Wednesday that both Austin and Houston had begun courting Dallas Police Chief Eddie Garcia to become its police leader. The station said that Dallas city leaders wished to keep Garcia, who also is president of the Major City Chiefs Association, on the job.\n\nBroadnax was the Dallas city manager before leaving earlier this year and worked closely with Garcia.\n\nHouston's police chief, Troy Finner, also retired this week after a controversy that included suspending criminal investigations for lack of personnel. A newly surfaced email, obtained by KHOU-TV, indicated that he knew about the practice years earlier than he previously stated, an allegation Finner has denied.\n\nGonzalez said the city currently has no applicants because the job has not been posted.\n\nAustin has typically conducted national searches for its police chiefs. That was the case when the city hired Chacon in 2021, and the only time it has deviated from that tradition over the past three decades was the hiring of former Chief Brian Manley in 2018, who led the city through a series of bombing attacks that killed two people in a 19-day span that year.\n\nCity officials cited his leadership during that time in appointing Manley.", "source": {"uri": "eu.statesman.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "USA TODAY"}, "authors": [{"uri": "austin_american_statesman@eu.statesman.com", "name": "Austin American-Statesman", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_of_police", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chief of police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_manager", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "City manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austin,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Austin, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Austin, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austin_Police_Department", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Austin Police Department"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosaic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mosaic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_school", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "State school"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henderson,_Nevada", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Henderson, Nevada"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Henderson, Nevada"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eddie_Garcia", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Eddie Garcia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kathy_Beale", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kathy Beale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Action film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WFAA", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "WFAA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_(journalism)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Source (journalism)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KHOU", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "KHOU"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston_Police_Department", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Houston Police Department"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manager (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City_Chiefs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kansas City Chiefs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cadet", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cadet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Police_Department", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Police Department"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Email"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troy,_New_York", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Troy, New York"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Troy, New York"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law_Enforcement", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law Enforcement", "wgt": 33}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Employment", "label": "dmoz/Business/Employment", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Employment/Job_Search", "label": "dmoz/Business/Employment/Job Search", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Information_Technology/Employment", "label": "dmoz/Business/Information Technology/Employment", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Employment/Recruitment_and_Staffing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Employment/Recruitment and Staffing", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 48}], "image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/authoring/authoring-images/2024/03/26/NAAS/73101057007-aem-austin-city-manager-search-202417.jpg?auto=webp&crop=2879,1621,x0,y149&format=pjpg&width=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9552133", "eventUri": "eng-9552133", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.04313725490196085, "wgt": 134, "relevance": 1}

(AP) -- The former interpreter for Los Angeles Dodgers star Shohei Ohtani pleaded guilty to bank and tax fraud on Tuesday and admitted to stealing nearly $17 million from the Japanese baseball player to pay off sports betting debts.\n\nIppei Mizuhara 's crimes stunned the baseball world, shattering his image as Ohtani's shadow at ballparks around the U.S. He entered his guilty plea Tuesday in federal court in Santa Ana, California.\n\nThe ex-interpreter had exploited his personal and professional relationship with Ohtani to plunder millions from the two-way player's account for years, at times impersonating Ohtani to bankers. Mizuhara signed a plea agreement that detailed the allegations on May 5, and prosecutors announced it several days later.\n\nMizuhara's attorney declined to comment outside the courthouse. Mizuhara spoke briefly in court acknowledging his guilt. \"I worked for victim A and had access to his bank account and had fallen into major gambling debt,\" he told the court. \"I went ahead and wired money ... with his bank account.\"\n\nFederal prosecutors declined to comment outside the courthouse.\n\nTuesday's court hearing lasted approximately 45 minutes.\n\nMizuhara's winning bets totaled over $142 million, which he deposited in his own bank account and not Ohtani's. But his losing bets were around $183 million, a net loss of nearly $41 million. He did not wager on baseball.\n\nMizuhara pleaded guilty to one count of bank fraud and one count of subscribing to a false tax return. The bank fraud charge carries a maximum of 30 years in federal prison, and the false tax return charge carries a sentence of up to three years in federal prison. The sentencing hearing is scheduled for Oct. 25.\n\nHe also is required to pay Ohtani restitution that could total nearly $17 million, as well as more than $1 million to the IRS. Those amounts, however, could change prior to sentencing.\n\nFederal prosecutor Jeff Mitchell told the court Mizuhara was hired as an interpreter for a Major League Baseball player who didn't speak English, and helped translate between him and his financial advisors, who did not speak Japanese. In 2018, Mizuhara helped the player open a bank account in Phoenix to deposit payroll and received login information for the account, Mitchell said.\n\nWhen Mizuhara was unable to pay sports gambling debts, he deceived the bank to get money from the account to pay them off, Mitchell said. He did this by signing into the account online and changing the registered phone number and email for the account so communication would be routed to Mizuhara instead of the player, Mitchell said. On multiple occasions from 2021 to 2024, Mizuhara initiated wire transfers from the account and received a six-digit code from the bank to complete the transactions, Mitchell said.\n\nMitchell said the amounts transferred exceeded $16 million.\n\nMizuhara's plea deal was negotiated with prosecutors before he was even arraigned in federal court in Los Angeles in mid-May. He was initially charged with one count of bank fraud.\n\nThere was no evidence Ohtani was involved in or aware of Mizuhara's gambling, and the player cooperated with investigators, authorities said.\n\nThe Los Angeles Times and ESPN broke the news of the prosecution in late March, prompting the Dodgers to fire the interpreter and MLB to open its own investigation.\n\nMLB rules prohibit players and team employees from wagering on baseball, even legally. MLB also bans betting on other sports with illegal or offshore bookmakers.\n\nIn a statement Tuesday, MLB said: \"Based on the thoroughness of the federal investigation that was made public, the information MLB collected, and the criminal proceeding being resolved without being contested, MLB considers Shohei Ohtani a victim of fraud and this matter has been closed.\"\n\nOhtani has sought to focus on the field as the case winds through the courts. Hours after his ex-interpreter first appeared in court in April, he hit his 175th home run in MLB, tying Hideki Matsui for the most by a Japan-born player, during the Dodgers' 8-7 loss to the San Diego Padres in 11 innings.\n\nMizuhara's hearing came hours after MLB banned San Diego Padres infielder Tucupita Marcano from baseball for life in the wake of another gambling scandal. MLB said Marcano placed 387 baseball bets totaling more than $150,000 in October 2022 and from last July through November with a legal sportsbook. He became the first active player in a century banned for life because of gambling. Four others were suspended Tuesday.", "source": {"uri": "wkbn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WKBN"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shohei_Ohtani", "type":

The hearing comes about a month after prosecutors and Mizuhara, a long-time friend of Ohtani's, reached a plea agreement as part of a broader federal sports gambling investigation.\n\nThe 39-year-old Newport Beach resident is expected to plead guilty to one count of bank fraud and one count of subscribing to a false tax return. The bank fraud charge has a maximum sentence of 30 years in federal prison. Mizuhara faces a maximum sentence of up to three years in federal prison for the false tax return charge.\n\n\"The interpreter is going to get a huge break, assuming he comes through with cooperation with the feds,\" said NBCLA legal analyst Royal Oakes. \"This guy is not a big fish, but he's going to flip if he helps the prosecution. That means, they're going to reward him with a very light sentence.\"\n\nSentencing and restitution proceedings have not been scheduled.\n\nProsecutors accused Mizuhara of placing a staggering number of bets using money stolen from a long-time friend and one of the world's most popular and well-paid athletes to support a \"voracious appetite\" for sports betting. The allegations against the Orange County man were outlined in a lengthy criminal complaint in support of federal bank fraud charge.\n\nA day after the federal charges were announced in April, Mizuhara apologized to Ohtani in a statement made through his attorney that indicated a deal was likely. Attorney Michael G. Freedman issued the statement, saying Mizuhara hopes to \"reach an agreement with the government to resolve this case as quickly as possible so that he can take responsibility.\" He further added Mizuhara \"wishes to apologize to Mr. Ohtani, the Dodgers, Major League Baseball, and his family.\"\n\nAccording to the criminal complaint filed in the gambling scandal, Mizuhara placed about 19,000 wagers between December 2021 and January 2024 with nearly 25 bets per day on average. The wagers ranged in value from roughly $10 to $160,000 per bet, with an average bet amount of roughly $12,800.\n\nMizuhara's winning bets totaled more than $142,256,000 and losing bets about $182,935,000. Total losses amounted to more than $40,679,000, the affidavit said.\n\nThe complaint, written by an IRS senior special agent, cites wire transfers, text messages, phone records and interviews. In a text message to a bookmaker, Mizuhara admitted that he was stealing the money from Ohtani's account, prosecutors said. The investigation into Mizuhara was part of a larger probe involving illegal gambling operations.\n\nProsecutors have said there is no evidence Ohtani authorized the transfers from his account and characterized the baseball superstar as a victim in the case. Ohtani reportedly has been assisting authorities with the investigation.\n\nThe records do not indicate any bets on baseball.\n\nThe scandal broke in mid-March after Mizuhara was fired for an alleged theft from Ohtani's bank accounts to cover illegal gambling losses. Those gambling debts were to an illegal bookmaker in Orange County who was under IRS investigation.\n\nAccording to prosecutors, Mizuhara accompanied Ohtani to a bank branch in Arizona when they opened the account in 2018, with Mizuhara translating for Ohtani to set up the account. Ohtani's salary was deposited into the account, prosecutors said, and he never gave Mizuhara control of the account or any of his other financial accounts, according to the affidavit.\n\nInvestigators believe Ohtani's earnings from endorsement deals and investments went to a different account.\n\nMizuhara later identified himself as Ohtani in communications with the bank, which allowed him to lift an online banking suspension on the account.\n\nMizuhara began gambling with an illegal sportsbook in 2021, according to prosecutors. Months later, he started losing \"substantial\" amounts of money and, at about the same time, contact information on Ohtani's bank account was changed to link it to Mizuhara's phone number and an anonymous email, prosecutors said.\n\nMizuhara told ESPN on March 19 that Ohtani paid his gambling debts at the interpreter's request, saying the bets were on international soccer, the NBA, the NFL and college football. But the following day, ESPN said Mizuhara dramatically changed his story, claiming Ohtani had no knowledge of the gambling debts and had not transferred any money to bookmakers.\n\nOhtani and his attorneys have maintained that he was completely unaware of the \"massive theft\" until the news came to light last month when the Dodgers were opening the season in South Korea against the San Diego Padres.\n\nMajor League Baseball launched its own investigation concurrent to the federal one by the IRS.", "source": {"uri": "nbcchicago.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC Chicago"}, "authors":

"Shohei Ohtani's former interpreter, Ippei Mizuhara, pleaded guilty on Tuesday in federal court to stealing nearly $17 million from the baseball star to pay off illegal gambling debts.\n\nMizuhara has admitted to one count of bank fraud, which carries a maximum 30-year prison sentence, and one count of filing a false tax return, which has a maximum three-year prison sentence, according to the US Attorney's Office.\n\nUS District Judge John Holcomb has scheduled sentencing for October 25.\n\nMizuhara, 39, appeared at a hearing in federal court in Santa Ana, mobbed by photographers as he entered the courthouse, after reaching a deal with prosecutors as part of a broader federal sports gambling investigation.\n\nLos Angeles Dodgers' star Ohtani's long-time friend took millions of dollars from the star's bank account to finance an \"insatiable appetite\" for illegal sports gambling, prosecutors said.\n\nMizuhara surrendered to federal authorities in April 12 and was released on bond.\n\nJapanese slugger and pitching star Ohtani, whose two-way skills had many comparing him to iconic Babe Ruth among Major League Baseball's greatest legends, signed the richest contract in North American sports history to join the Dodgers last December, a deal worth $700 million.\n\nAfter an initial April court appearance, Mizuhara's lawyer said his client wished to apologize to \"Ohtani, the Dodgers, and Major League Baseball\" for his actions and wanted to \"take responsibility\" for what he had done.\n\nThe revelations surrounding Mizuhara erupted as the baseball season began in March, but prosecutors have stressed that Ohtani was an innocent victim of Mizuhara's deception and that there was no evidence to suggest the Dodgers star was aware of illegal gambling or involved in such matters.\n\nMizuhara had worked for Ohtani as an interpreter since the Japanese star joined the Los Angeles Angels six years ago, setting up a bank account for Ohtani in Arizona, the eventual source of wire transfers by Mizuhara to the illegal gambling operation, US Attorney Martin Estrada said.\n\nEstrada said Mizuhara allegedly lied to bank officials and was recorded on telephone calls impersonating Ohtani to \"convince the bank to approve large wire transfers of large amounts of money to the bookmakers.\"\n\nEstrada said Mizuhara would \"plunder\" Ohtani's bank account to commit \"fraud on a massive scale.\"\n\nA criminal complaint released by prosecutors detailed a staggering volume of bets placed by Mizuhara, who exploited the language barrier to keep Ohtani, his management team and financial advisers unaware of his moves.\n\nThe complaint revealed that between December 2021 and January 2024, Mizuhara placed approximately 19,000 bets ranging in value from $10 to $160,000 at an average of around $12,800 per bet.\n\nMizuhara had winning bets worth $142.3 million, and losing bets of $182.9 million -- leaving him with losses of roughly $40.7 million.\n\nThe Dodgers fired Mizuhara earlier this year once the investigation became public.\n\n- No bets on baseball -\n\nOhtani denied any knowledge of Mizuhara's activities, saying, \"I never bet on baseball or any other sports or never have asked somebody to bet on my behalf,\" adding that Mizuhara \"has been stealing money from my account and has told lies.\"\n\nEstrada said no illegal bets by Mizuhara were placed on baseball games.\n\nProsecutors said Mizuhara took money from Ohtani to pay for $325,000 in baseball cards and $60,000 worth of dental work.\n\nThe tax return charge stems from 2022, in which Mizuhara claimed only $136,865 in taxable income when the true figure, prosecutors said, was above $4.1 million.\n\nIn the plea deal, Mizuhara admitted owing more than $1.1 million in 2022 taxes.",

The hearing comes about a month after prosecutors and Mizuhara, a long-time friend of Ohtani's, reached a plea agreement as part of a broader federal sports gambling investigation.\n\nThe 39-year-old Newport Beach resident is expected to plead guilty to one count of bank fraud and one count of subscribing to a false tax return. The bank fraud charge has a maximum sentence of 30 years in federal prison. Mizuhara faces a maximum sentence of up to three years in federal prison for the false tax return charge.\n\nSentencing and restitution proceedings have not been scheduled.\n\nProsecutors accused Mizuhara of placing a staggering number of bets using money stolen from a long-time friend and one of the world's most popular and well-paid athletes to support a \"voracious appetite\" for sports betting. The allegations against the Orange County man were outlined in a lengthy criminal complaint in support of federal bank fraud charge.\n\nA day after the federal charges were announced in April, Mizuhara apologized to Ohtani in a statement made through his attorney that indicated a deal was likely. Attorney Michael G. Freedman issued the statement, saying Mizuhara hopes to \"reach an agreement with the government to resolve this case as quickly as possible so that he can take responsibility.\" He further added Mizuhara \"wishes to apologize to Mr. Ohtani, the Dodgers, Major League Baseball, and his family.\"\n\nAccording to the criminal complaint filed in the gambling scandal, Mizuhara placed about 19,000 wagers between December 2021 and January 2024 with nearly 25 bets per day on average. The wagers ranged in value from roughly $10 to $160,000 per bet, with an average bet amount of roughly $12,800.\n\nMizuhara's winning bets totaled more than $142,256,000 and losing bets about $182,935,000. Total losses amounted to more than $40,679,000, the affidavit said.\n\nThe complaint, written by an IRS senior special agent, cites wire transfers, text messages, phone records and interviews. In a text message to a bookmaker, Mizuhara admitted that he was stealing the money from Ohtani's account, prosecutors said. The investigation into Mizuhara was part of a larger probe involving illegal gambling operations.\n\nProsecutors have said there is no evidence Ohtani authorized the transfers from his account and characterized the baseball superstar as a victim in the case. Ohtani reportedly has been assisting authorities with the investigation.\n\nThe records do not indicate any bets on baseball.\n\nThe scandal broke in mid-March after Mizuhara was fired for an alleged theft from Ohtani's bank accounts to cover illegal gambling losses. Those gambling debts were to an illegal bookmaker in Orange County who was under IRS investigation.\n\nAccording to prosecutors, Mizuhara accompanied Ohtani to a bank branch in Arizona when they opened the account in 2018, with Mizuhara translating for Ohtani to set up the account. Ohtani's salary was deposited into the account, prosecutors said, and he never gave Mizuhara control of the account or any of his other financial accounts, according to the affidavit.\n\nInvestigators believe Ohtani's earnings from endorsement deals and investments went to a different account.\n\nMizuhara later identified himself as Ohtani in communications with the bank, which allowed him to lift an online banking suspension on the account.\n\nMizuhara began gambling with an illegal sportsbook in 2021, according to prosecutors. Months later, he started losing \"substantial\" amounts of money and, at about the same time, contact information on Ohtani's bank account was changed to link it to Mizuhara's phone number and an anonymous email, prosecutors said.\n\nMizuhara told ESPN on March 19 that Ohtani paid his gambling debts at the interpreter's request, saying the bets were on international soccer, the NBA, the NFL and college football. But the following day, ESPN said Mizuhara dramatically changed his story, claiming Ohtani had no knowledge of the gambling debts and had not transferred any money to bookmakers.\n\nOhtani and his attorneys have maintained that he was completely unaware of the \"massive theft\" until the news came to light last month when the Dodgers were opening the season in South Korea against the San Diego Padres.\n\nMajor League Baseball launched its own investigation concurrent to the federal one by the IRS.", "source": {"uri": "nbclosangeles.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC Southern

The judge will ultimately make the final sentencing determination.\n\nMizuhara, 39, was fired by the Dodgers on March 21 amid news reports that at least $4.5 million was wired from Ohtani's accounts to an alleged illegal bookmaker, Mathew Bowyer. Ohtani accused Mizuhara of \"massive theft,\" alleging that Mizuhara had taken the money without his knowledge. Federal authorities charged Mizuhara with bank fraud on April 11, releasing a 37-page affidavit outlining how the former interpreter gained access to Ohtani's accounts and used the money to \"feed his insatiable appetite for illegal sports betting,\" U.S. Attorney Martin Estrada said.\n\nUltimately, authorities said that Mizuhara took almost $17 million from Ohtani.\n\nMizuhara had worked for Ohtani since the player's arrival in the United States in 2018, when Ohtani hired Mizuhara as his de facto manager and interpreter, according to court documents. Their relationship spanned longer than that, as Mizuhara worked for the Nippon-Ham Fighters of NPB when Ohtani played professionally in Japan from 2013 to 2017. The investigation unearthed no evidence that Ohtani teamed with Mizuhara to place bets, nor that Mizuhara had placed any bets on baseball, prosecutors said.\n\nMizuhara pleaded not guilty to bank and tax fraud charges on May 14, a formality ahead of the plea deal negotiated with federal prosecutors, Mizuhara's attorney, Michael Freedman, said.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news",

The bank fraud charge carries a possible prison term of up to 30 years, while the tax charge carries up to three years in federal prison.\n\n\"I worked for (Ohtani) and I had access to his accounts,\" Mizuhara said during the hearing as he entered his plea. \"I fell into gambling debt and the only way I could think of was to access his money. I wired money for my gambling debt from his account.\"\n\nU.S. District Judge John Holcomb scheduled sentencing for Oct. 25.\n\nMizuhara surrendered to federal authorities on April 12 and was released on $25,000 bond.\n\nWhen the criminal case was announced, U.S. Attorney Martin Estrada said Mizuhara had an \"insatiable appetite\" for illegal sports betting, which landed him millions of dollars in debt to a bookmaker and led him to transfer money out of Ohtani's bank account without the slugger's knowledge.\n\nMizuhara worked as an interpreter for Ohtani since the slugger joined the Angels organization six years ago. In that capacity, he helped Ohtani set up a bank account in Arizona, which eventually became the source of wire transfers to the illegal gambling operation, Estrada said.\n\nEstrada stressed that Ohtani was a victim in the case and had no knowledge of Mizuhara's actions.\n\nAccording to Estrada, Mizuhara also allegedly lied to bank officials, and was captured on tape-recorded calls impersonating Ohtani to \"convince the bank to approve large wire transfers of large amounts of money to the bookmakers.\"\n\nEstrada said Mizuhara acted \"to plunder\" Ohtani's bank account to satisfy his \"insatiable appetite for illegal sports betting,\" and he \"committed fraud on a massive scale.\"\n\nAccording to an affidavit filed in federal court by Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigations special agent Chris Seymour, records obtained from a source within the illegal gambling operation showed that between December 2021 and January 2024, about 19,000 wagers were attributed to Mizuhara, averaging roughly 25 per day and ranging in amounts from about $10 to $160,000.\n\nDuring that period, the records showed Mizuhara had winning bets worth nearly $142.3 million, and losing bets of $182.9 million, leaving him with a roughly $40.7 million deficit.\n\nSeymour wrote in the document that Mizuhara was acting as a \"de facto manager\" for Ohtani, and he began placing bets with the illegal gambling operation in late 2021. At about that time, bank records showed that the contact information on the Arizona bank account, which was opened in March 2018, was changed to a phone number and email linked to Mizuhara.\n\nThe Dodgers fired Mizuhara earlier this year when news of the criminal investigation broke.\n\nAt a subsequent news conference, Ohtani denied any knowledge of Mizuhara's actions. He also vehemently denied that he was involved in any gambling activity.\n\n\"I never bet on baseball or any other sports or never have asked somebody to bet on my behalf,\" he insisted.\n\nOhtani said Mizuhara \"has been stealing money from my account and has told lies.\"\n\nEstrada said none of the illegal bets allegedly placed by Mizuhara were on baseball games.\n\nAccording to various reports, wire transfers were made from Ohtani's bank account to an illegal bookmaking operation allegedly run by Orange County resident Mathew Bowyer, who is under federal investigation.\n\nBowyer's San Juan Capistrano home was searched by federal agents last year.\n\nProsecutors said Mizuhara also took money from Ohtani's account to pay other expenses, including $60,000 in dental work and $325,000 worth of baseball cards.\n\nThe false tax return charge stems from 2022, when Mizuhara falsified his taxable income by claiming only $136,865, when in fact the figure was more than $4.1 million stemming from his bank fraud, prosecutors said. He admits in his plea agreement that he owes more than $1.1 million in taxes for 2022.", "source": {"uri": "mynewsla.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "My News LA"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

Mizuhara signed a plea agreement that detailed the allegations on May 5, and prosecutors announced it several days later.\n\nMizuhara's attorney declined to comment outside the courthouse. Mizuhara spoke briefly in court acknowledging his guilt. \"I worked for victim A and had access to his bank account and had fallen into major gambling debt,\" he told the court. \"I went ahead and wired money ... with his bank account.\"\n\nTuesday's court hearing lasted approximately 45 minutes.\n\nMizuhara's winning bets totaled over $142 million, which he deposited in his own bank account and not Ohtani's. But his losing bets were around $183 million, a net loss of nearly $41 million. He did not wager on baseball.\n\nMizuhara pleaded guilty to one count of bank fraud and one count of subscribing to a false tax return. The bank fraud charge carries a maximum of 30 years in federal prison, and the false tax return charge carries a sentence of up to three years in federal prison. The sentencing hearing is scheduled for Oct. 25.\n\nHe also is required to pay Ohtani restitution that could total nearly $17 million, as well as more than $1 million to the IRS. Those amounts, however, could change prior to sentencing.\n\nMizuhara's plea deal was negotiated with prosecutors before he was even arraigned in federal court in Los Angeles in mid-May. He was initially charged with one count of bank fraud.\n\nThere was no evidence Ohtani was involved in or aware of Mizuhara's gambling, and the player cooperated with investigators, authorities said.\n\nThe Los Angeles Times and ESPN broke the news of the prosecution in late March, prompting the Dodgers to fire the interpreter and MLB to open its own investigation.\n\nMLB rules prohibit players and team employees from wagering on baseball, even legally. MLB also bans betting on other sports with illegal or offshore bookmakers.\n\nOhtani has sought to focus on the field as the case winds through the courts. Hours after his ex-interpreter first appeared in court in April, he hit his 175th home run in MLB, tying Hideki Matsui for the most by a Japan-born player, during the Dodgers' 8-7 loss to the San Diego Padres in 11 innings.\n\nMizuhara's hearing came hours after MLB banned San Diego Padres infielder Tucupita Marcano from baseball for life in the wake of another gambling scandal.

Prosecutors say the interpreter ultimately stole millions of dollars from Ohtani's accounts to pay his debts, taking extraordinary measures to do so -- including impersonating Ohtani on phone calls to the bank and modifying the player's bank account to allow Mizuhara direct access to funds.\n\nIn court on Tuesday, Mizuhara looked calm and expressionless as the facts of the case were described in court. He faces up to 33 years in federal prison.\n\nMizuhara placed around 19,000 bets in just over two years, a rate of about two dozen wagers every day, according to the criminal complaint, which cited a betting record provided to them by a cooperator inside the bookmaking operation. None of Mizuhara's bets were placed on baseball games, prosecutors say.\n\nMizuhara's bets averaged about $12,800 apiece. In total, Mizuhara lost more than $40 million, court records show.\n\nProsecutors say Mizuhara wired more than $16 million from Ohtani's checking account to bank accounts associated with an illegal sportsbook. Ohtani has said, both in public statements and in interviews with law enforcement, that he did not authorize the transfers.\n\nAmong the evidence tying Mizuhara to the payments are digital forensics connecting Mizuhara's devices and IP addresses to the transfers. Bank records show that security protocols for Ohtani's account were updated to allow access with Mizuhara's mobile phone number and an email address used by Mizuhara, and Ohtani's bank recorded phone calls in which Mizuhara impersonated Ohtani.\n\nPhone records from Mizuhara's device show that he contacted bookmakers regularly beginning in 2021, according to prosecutors. His text messages show the rapidly growing size and frequency of payments for his gambling debt: first $15,000, then $50,000, then $300,000, then half a million each week by 2023.\n\nIn the messages, Mizuhara repeatedly acknowledged his losses, records show. \"I'm terrible at this sport betting thing huh? Lol,\" he wrote in November 2022, according to the criminal complaint.\n\nIppei's bets and the involvement of Ohtani's bank accounts came to light during a federal investigation into the sportsbook, allegedly run by Mathew Bowyer, an Orange County, Calif., resident.\n\nCourt records show that a sportsbook based in southern California had been the target of investigation by the IRS and Department of Homeland Security since at least 2023, when a federal judge authorized a search warrant of the bookmaker's home.\n\nMizuhara's sentencing is set for Oct. 25. The bank fraud charge carries a maximum sentence of 30 years in prison and a fine of $1 million, while the charge related to his tax return has a maximum sentence of three years' imprisonment. As part of the plea deal, prosecutors will recommend a lighter sentence.\n\nIn addition, Mizuhara will be ordered to pay restitution of $16,975,010 to Ohtani and at least $1.1 million to the IRS.\n\nOhtani has had little to say about the investigation since March, when the allegations first came to light. Ippei had originally claimed in an interview with ESPN that Ohtani knew of the debts and had agreed to cover them, but he soon retracted that claim.\n\nAll parties now say that Ohtani had no knowledge of the debts or payments. Ohtani has cooperated with investigators.\n\n\"I'm very saddened and shocked that someone who I trusted has done this,\" Ohtani said at a press conference in March. \"I never bet on baseball or any other sports, or never have asked someone to do that on my behalf.\"\n\nThis season, Ohtani has played as a designated hitter while he recovers from Tommy John surgery, a procedure to repair pitchers' elbow ligaments that Ohtani underwent during the offseason. He currently holds the fourth-best batting average in the major leagues.", "source": {"uri": "npr.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "NPR"}, "authors": [{"uri": "becky_sullivan@npr.org", "name": "Becky Sullivan", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shohei_Ohtani", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Shohei Ohtani"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_judiciary_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal judiciary of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambling", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gambling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ippei_Mizuhara", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ippei Mizuhara"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Angels", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Angels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bookmaker_(gambling)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bookmaker (gambling)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sportsbook", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sportsbook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plea_bargain", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Plea bargain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_prison", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal prison"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bank fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_betting", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sports betting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theft", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Theft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Dodgers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Dodgers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complaint", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Complaint"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orange_County,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Orange County, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Orange County, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_forensics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Digital forensics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooperative", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cooperative"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "IP address"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_phone", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mobile phone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Email"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_California", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Southern California"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Banking_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Banking Services", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Holding_Companies", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Holding Companies", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Gambling", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Gambling", "wgt": 16}], "image": "https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/4576x2574+0+237/resize/1400/quality/100/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fb0%2Ff6%2F576890714f369859333f80cb4fbd%2Fgettyimages-2152413016.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9622563", "eventUri": "eng-9622563", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-10-25", "textStart": 3147, "textEnd": 3154}], "sentiment": -0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 210, "relevance": 1}

A sentencing hearing has been scheduled for Oct. 25.\n\n\"I had fallen into major gambling debt. The only thing I could think was using his money to help pay for the debt,\" Mizuhara told the court, according to Los Angeles ABC station KABC.\n\nAccording to the plea agreement, Mizuhara helped Ohtani, who does not speak English, set up a bank account in Phoenix in 2018, during which he interpreted the login information for the player's account. In September 2021, Mizuhara started placing sports bets with an illegal bookmaker to whom he quickly became indebted, according to the plea agreement.\n\n\"Unable to pay his gambling debts, Mizuhara orchestrated a scheme to deceive and cheat the bank to fraudulently obtain money from the account,\" the DOJ previously said in a release.\n\nMizuhara accessed Ohtani's bank account and updated security information so bank employees would contact him, not Ohtani, when attempting to verify wire transfers from the account, according to the plea agreement. He also impersonated Ohtani on 24 occasions in calls to the bank, according to the agreement.\n\nFrom November 2021 to March 2024, Mizuhara transferred nearly $17 million from the account to associates of the bookmaker in more than 40 wires without Ohtani's permission, according to the plea agreement.\n\nMizuhara also admitted in the plea agreement to falsely claiming that his total taxable income for 2022 was $136,865 when, in fact, he failed to report an additional $4.1 million in income.\n\n\"The source of the unreported income was from his scheme to defraud the bank,\" the DOJ said, noting that he owes approximately $1,149,400 in additional taxes for the tax year 2022, plus additional interest and penalties.\n\nU.S. Attorney Martin Estrada previously stressed that Ohtani is a victim in the case and has cooperated \"fully and completely\" in the investigation.\n\nThe Dodgers announced they had fired the Japanese interpreter on March 20, after the gambling controversy surfaced. The team did not provide a specific reason for Mizuhara's termination.\n\nMizuhara was charged in the matter in April. Following his initial appearance in federal court on April 12, his attorney, Michael Freedman, said in a statement to ABC News that Mizuhara is \"continuing to cooperate with the legal process and is hopeful that he can reach an agreement with the government to resolve this case as quickly as possible so that he can take responsibility.\"\n\n\"He wishes to apologize to Mr. Ohtani, the Dodgers, Major League Baseball, and his family,\" the statement continued. \"As noted in court, he is also eager to seek treatment for his gambling.\"\n\nOhtani addressed the scandal for the first time on March 25 during a press conference.

Mizuhara is expected to appear in federal court, likely on Friday, for a bond hearing. He will not enter a plea, and an arraignment hearing is expected to be scheduled. The investigation unearthed evidence of the \"massive theft\" that Ohtani's attorneys alleged after the Dodgers fired Mizuhara on March 20.\n\nIn the 37-page complaint, the government painted Mizuhara as a compulsive gambler who kept Ohtani in the dark during a three-year span in which he made approximately 19,000 bets totaling hundreds of millions of dollars. The investigation determined Mizuhara lost roughly $40 million to gambling. The money he used to pay those debts came from Ohtani's bank account, which Mizuhara helped set up in 2018.\n\nThe scandal led to scrutiny of Ohtani's character and culpability after the two-way star told reporters on March 25 he was completely unaware of Mizuhara's gambling problems and alleged theft. Mizuhara had been his interpreter and closest companion for six seasons with the Los Angeles Angels and this past spring with the Dodgers. The duo drove to work together each day and rarely left each other's sight at the ballpark. Ohtani declined to reveal how Mizuhara could have stolen the money. The federal investigation offered some answers.\n\n\"Mr. Ohtani is considered a victim in this case,\" U.S. Attorney Martin Estrada said during a news conference in Los Angeles.\n\nThe investigation unearthed no evidence that Ohtani teamed with Mizuhara to place bets. In reviewing text conversations between the two men, the government found no discussion of gambling and no authorization for Mizuhara to transfer money from Ohtani's accounts. In a statement on Thursday, a spokesperson for Major League Baseball indicated the sport's own investigation will be paused \"until resolution of the criminal proceeding to determine whether further investigation is warranted.\"\n\nIn the fall of 2021, after Mizuhara became acquainted with an alleged illegal bookmaker named Mathew Bowyer, the interpreter began to lose money gambling. His bets \"do not appear to have been made on baseball,\" Estrada said.\n\nTo pay the debts, the complaint alleged that Mizuhara began impersonating Ohtani as he talked to bank employees to gain access to his account. Once Mizuhara succeeded, he wired at least $15 million between Feb. 2022 and October 2023 to an account associated with alleged illegal bookmakers. Those bank calls were recorded and eventually shared with federal investigators.\n\nMizuhara used the money \"largely to finance his voracious appetite for illegal sports gambling,\" Estrada said.\n\nThe New York Times reported Wednesday that Mizuhara was negotiating with federal authorities to plead guilty. The extent of Mizuhara's proposed plea deal was not yet known.\n\nMizuhara, prosecutors allege, was vigilant in shielding any knowledge of his problems from Ohtani and denied access to his bank account to anyone else. He did not let Ohtani's agent, Nez Balelo, or any of Ohtani's financial advisors monitor the bank account, according to interviews conducted by federal agents. The bank account contained the money Ohtani earned from the Los Angeles Angels; his earnings through endorsements and other endeavors were distributed elsewhere.\n\nFederal agents were led to Mizuhara as a result of a previous investigation by the IRS and Department of Homeland Security that was looking into illegal bookmaking in Southern California and how it laundered money through Las Vegas casinos, according to an affidavit filed by IRS special agent Chris Seymour. That investigation has already led to charges or convictions for 12 people, in addition to a money service company. The government has also come to non-prosecution agreements with two Vegas casinos.\n\nMizuhara's connection to the gambling world came to light on March 20. In separate interviews with ESPN, Mizuhara told the news outlet that Ohtani paid an estimated $4.5 million to help him with gambling debt. Mizuhara subsequently recanted that story and indicated Ohtani had no knowledge of his gambling problem. The Dodgers fired Mizuhara after Ohtani learned Mizuhara had told team officials that Ohtani paid the debts.\n\nHomeland Security agents stopped Mizuhara at Los Angeles International Airport on March 21 after he got off a flight from South Korea. Mizuhara surrendered his phone. By then, Mizuhara's world was already unraveling, according to text messages and interviews documented in the complaint.\n\nAt one point, Mizuhara sent a message to one of three unidentified bookmakers referenced in the complaint asking if the bookmaker had seen the stories about his dismissal.\n\n\"Yes, but that's all bulls -- -hit,\" the bookmaker wrote. \"Obviously you didn't steal from him. I understand it's a cover job I totally get it.\"\n\n\"Technically I did steal from him,\" Mizuhara replied. \"It's all over for me.\"\n\nDuring interviews on April 2 and 3, on days when the Dodgers played the San Francisco Giants in Los Angeles, Ohtani said he had first learned about Mizuhara's gambling problems in South Korea, after Mizuhara addressed the Dodgers in the postgame locker room following their game in Seoul.\n\nBalelo told investigators that he didn't talk to Ohtani directly, either in person or text, and only through Mizuhara. When Balelo asked Mizuhara about the bank account, the agent told investigators that Mizuhara told him it was private and Ohtani didn't want him monitoring it. Ohtani, however, told federal investigators that he had not given control of his accounts to Mizuhara.\n\nTheir relationship had lasted more than a decade. They met when Ohtani was still a rising star for the Nippon Ham Fighters in Japan, where Mizuhara acted an interpreter for English-speaking players. When Ohtani signed with the Angels in 2017, Mizuhara reached out to him and asked about working as his interpreter, Ohtani told investigators.\n\nThe Angels employed Mizuhara as Ohtani's interpreter while Ohtani employed him as his assistant and to handle some day-to-day responsibilities. Mizuhara was with Ohtani when he opened his bank account in 2018 in Arizona and translated for him when he gave personal details to set it up.\n\nBut federal prosecutors allege that Mizuhara kept Ohtani insulated from his gambling exploits and in the dark about the use of his account. At one point, according to the complaint, an unidentified bookmaker seemed to imply he would go straight to Ohtani himself to sort out a growing dispute over unmade payments. In Nov. 2023, as Mizuhara kept running up losses with the bookmaker and asked for ever-increasing limits of debt, he received a text from the bookmaker, according to the federal complaint, which refers to Ohtani as \"Victim A.\"\n\n\"Hey Ippie [sic], it's 2 o'clock on Friday,\" the bookmaker wrote. \"I don't know why you're not returning my calls. I'm here in Newport Beach and I see [Victim A] walking his dog. I'm just gonna go up and talk to him and ask how I can get in touch with you since you're not responding? Please call me back immediately.\"\n\nMizuhara responded two days later to ask if he could negotiate a number he could repay. He told the bookie that he had lost too much money on cryptocurrency and through his sports betting, though he added, \"of course I know it's my fault.\"\n\nMizuhara, the complaint said, made an average of 25 bets a day between Dec. 2021 through January 2024. His bets ranged from $10 to $160,000, and at an average of $12,800. Those records showed that Mizuhara's account was credited with total winning bets equal to $142,256,769.74 and his losses to be $182,935,206.68. Any winnings went to Mizuhara's personal account, rather than Ohtani's.\n\n\"Our investigation has revealed that due to the position of trust he occupied with Mr. Ohtani, Mr. Mizuhara had unique access to Mr. Ohtani's finances,\" Estrada said. \"Mr. Mizuhara used and abused that position of trust in order to take advantage of Mr. Ohtani. Mr. Mizuhara used and abused that position of trust in order to plunder Mr. Ohtani's bank account to the tune of over $16 million. And Mr. Mizuhara did all this to feed his insatiable appetite for illegal sports betting.\"", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [],

The sentence for bank fraud reportedly carries a sentence of up to 30 years in prison, and three years for filing a false tax return. His sentencing is expected at a later date.\n\nOhtani has claimed not to have any knowledge Mizuhara stole from him until the former interpreter confessed after the Dodgers' season-opening victory in Seoul, South Korea on March 20:\n\n\"I'm very grateful for the Department of Justice's investigation,\" Ohtani said in March. \"For me personally, this marks a break from this, and I'd like to focus on baseball.\"\n\nSince then, Ohtani has been able to do exactly that. He leads the Dodgers in home runs (14), RBIs (38), and batting average (.322). His .988 on-base plus slugging percentage ranks second in the National League. The Dodgers signed the reigning American League MVP to a record $700 million contract last December.\n\nA federal investigation revealed that Mizuhara began placing sports bets with an illegal bookmaker in Sept. 2021, and then transferred money from Ohtani's personal account to cover the debts.\n\nAccording to a court document cited by the Associated Press, Mizuhara \"fraudulently transferred and willfully caused to be transferred approximately $16.5 million.\" Prosecutors alleged Mizuhara used the money to pay off some personal expenses as well as the illegal gambling debts.\n\n\"The extent of this defendant's deception and theft is massive,\" U.S. Department of Justice Attorney Martin Estrada said at a press conference in Los Angeles in April. \"He took advantage of his position of trust to take advantage of Mr. Ohtani and fuel a dangerous gambling habit.\"\n\nThe DOJ's 37-page complaint against Mizuharadetailed the breadth of his gambling activities.

He entered his guilty plea Tuesday in federal court in Santa Ana, Calif.\n\nThe ex-interpreter had exploited his personal and professional relationship with Ohtani to plunder millions from the two-way player's account for years, at times impersonating Ohtani to bankers. Mizuhara signed a plea agreement that detailed the allegations on May 5, and prosecutors announced it several days later.\n\nMizuhara's attorney declined to comment outside the courthouse. Mizuhara spoke briefly in court acknowledging his guilt. \"I worked for victim A and had access to his bank account and had fallen into major gambling debt,\" he told the court. \"I went ahead and wired money with his bank account.\"\n\nFederal prosecutors declined to comment outside the courthouse.\n\nTuesday's court hearing lasted approximately 45 minutes.\n\nMizuhara's winning bets totalled over $142 million, which he deposited in his own bank account and not Ohtani's. But his losing bets were around $183 million, a net loss of nearly $41 million. He did not wager on baseball.\n\nMizuhara pleaded guilty to one count of bank fraud and one count of subscribing to a false tax return. The bank fraud charge carries a maximum of 30 years in federal prison, and the false tax return charge carries a sentence of up to three years in federal prison. The sentencing hearing is scheduled for Oct. 25.\n\nWATCH | Ohtani addresses gambling scandal:\n\nHe also is required to pay Ohtani restitution that could total nearly $17 million, as well as more than $1 million to the IRS. Those amounts, however, could change prior to sentencing.\n\nMizuhara's plea deal was negotiated with prosecutors before he was even arraigned in federal court in Los Angeles in mid-May. He was initially charged with one count of bank fraud.\n\nThere was no evidence Ohtani was involved in or aware of Mizuhara's gambling, and the player co-operated with investigators, authorities said.\n\nThe Los Angeles Times and ESPN broke the news of the prosecution in late March, prompting the Dodgers to fire the interpreter and MLB to open its own investigation.\n\nMLB rules prohibit players and team employees from wagering on baseball, even legally. MLB also bans betting on other sports with illegal or offshore bookmakers.\n\nIn a statement Tuesday, MLB said: \"Based on the thoroughness of the federal investigation that was made public, the information MLB collected, and the criminal proceeding being resolved without being contested, MLB considers Shohei Ohtani a victim of fraud and this matter has been closed.\"\n\nOhtani has sought to focus on the field as the case winds through the courts. Hours after his ex-interpreter first appeared in court in April, he hit his 175th home run in MLB, tying Hideki Matsui for the most by a Japan-born player, during the Dodgers' 8-7 loss to the San Diego Padres in 11 innings.\n\nMizuhara's hearing came hours after MLB banned San Diego Padres infielder Tucupita Marcano from baseball for life in the wake of another gambling scandal.

According to reports Tuesday, Mizuhara will plead guilty at a later date.\n\nMizuhara stole nearly $17 million from Ohtani to pay off his own sports gambling bets to an alleged illegal bookmaker, Matthew Bowyer. According to the Justice Department, Mizuhara made approximately 19,000 wagers between Nov. 2021 and March 2024, ranging from $10 to $160,000 per bet. The money was sent to the bookmaker by wire transfers -- reportedly received by a reality TV star.\n\nMizuhara started working for Ohtani when he came to Major League Baseball in 2018 with the Los Angeles Angels as his de facto manager and interpreter. However, the pair has known each other since 2013, as Mizuhara worked for the Nippon-Ham Fighters while Ohtani played professionally in Japan.\n\nThe Dodgers fired Mizuhara on March 21 following reports of at least a $4.5 million transfer from Ohtani's bank account to the bookmaker. Mizuhara faced a bank fraud charge on April 11 after federal authorities released a 37-page complaint exposing how Mizuhara gained access to Ohtani's accounts.\n\nOhtani has portrayed himself as the victim in the case, which the Justice Department's report corroborated. MLB also launched an investigation into the saga and has yet to release any of its conclusions.\n\nThe final steps in Mizuhara's legal saga could clear the way for MLB to close the books on any specter of guilt around Ohtani once and for all.\n\nPhoto Credit: Kirby Lee-USA TODAY Sports", "source": {"uri": "dodgersnation.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Dodgers Nation"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jp_hoornstra@dodgersnation.com", "name": "Jp Hoornstra", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shohei_Ohtani", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Shohei Ohtani"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bookmaker_(gambling)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bookmaker (gambling)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ippei_Mizuhara", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ippei Mizuhara"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bank fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Income_tax", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Income tax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_district_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States district court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Dodgers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Dodgers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Bowyer", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Matthew Bowyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Angels", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Angels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_facto", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "De facto"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wire_transfer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wire transfer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manager (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_betting", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sports betting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reality_television", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Reality television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hokkaido_Nippon-Ham_Fighters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hokkaido Nippon-Ham Fighters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Banking_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Banking Services", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Fraud", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Fraud", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Research", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Research", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 87}], "image": "https://dodgersnation.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/USATSI_22129932_168396005_lowres.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9622563", "eventUri": "eng-9622563", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-03-21", "textStart": 1166, "textEnd": 1174}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-11", "textStart": 1312, "textEnd": 1320}], "sentiment": -0.2156862745098039, "wgt": 208, "relevance": 1}

(AP) -- The former interpreter for Los Angeles Dodgers star Shohei Ohtani pleaded guilty to bank and tax fraud on Tuesday and admitted to stealing nearly $17 million from the Japanese baseball player to pay off sports betting debts.\n\nIppei Mizuhara 's crimes stunned the baseball world, shattering his image as Ohtani's shadow at ballparks around the U.S. He entered his guilty plea Tuesday in federal court in Santa Ana, California.\n\nThe ex-interpreter had exploited his personal and professional relationship with Ohtani to plunder millions from the two-way player's account for years, at times impersonating Ohtani to bankers. Mizuhara signed a plea agreement that detailed the allegations on May 5, and prosecutors announced it several days later.\n\nMizuhara's attorney declined to comment outside the courthouse. Mizuhara spoke briefly in court acknowledging his guilt. \"I worked for victim A and had access to his bank account and had fallen into major gambling debt,\" he told the court. \"I went ahead and wired money ... with his bank account.\"\n\nFederal prosecutors declined to comment outside the courthouse.\n\nTuesday's court hearing lasted approximately 45 minutes.\n\nMizuhara's winning bets totaled over $142 million, which he deposited in his own bank account and not Ohtani's. But his losing bets were around $183 million, a net loss of nearly $41 million. He did not wager on baseball.\n\nMizuhara pleaded guilty to one count of bank fraud and one count of subscribing to a false tax return. The bank fraud charge carries a maximum of 30 years in federal prison, and the false tax return charge carries a sentence of up to three years in federal prison. The sentencing hearing is scheduled for Oct. 25.\n\nHe also is required to pay Ohtani restitution that could total nearly $17 million, as well as more than $1 million to the IRS. Those amounts, however, could change prior to sentencing.\n\nMizuhara's plea deal was negotiated with prosecutors before he was even arraigned in federal court in Los Angeles in mid-May. He was initially charged with one count of bank fraud.\n\nThere was no evidence Ohtani was involved in or aware of Mizuhara's gambling, and the player cooperated with investigators, authorities said.\n\nThe Los Angeles Times and ESPN broke the news of the prosecution in late March, prompting the Dodgers to fire the interpreter and MLB to open its own investigation.\n\nMLB rules prohibit players and team employees from wagering on baseball, even legally. MLB also bans betting on other sports with illegal or offshore bookmakers.\n\nIn a statement Tuesday, MLB said: \"Based on the thoroughness of the federal investigation that was made public, the information MLB collected, and the criminal proceeding being resolved without being contested, MLB considers Shohei Ohtani a victim of fraud and this matter has been closed.\"\n\nOhtani has sought to focus on the field as the case winds through the courts. Hours after his ex-interpreter first appeared in court in April, he hit his 175th home run in MLB, tying Hideki Matsui for the most by a Japan-born player, during the Dodgers' 8-7 loss to the San Diego Padres in 11 innings.\n\nMizuhara's hearing came hours after MLB banned San Diego Padres infielder Tucupita Marcano from baseball for life in the wake of another gambling scandal. MLB said Marcano placed 387 baseball bets totaling more than $150,000 in October 2022 and from last July through November with a legal sportsbook. He became the first active player in a century banned for life because of gambling.

The bank fraud charge carries a possible prison term of up to 30 years, while the tax charge carries up to three years in federal prison.\n\nU.S. District Judge John Holcomb scheduled sentencing for Oct. 25.\n\nMizuhara surrendered to federal authorities on April 12 and was released on $25,000 bond.\n\nWhen the criminal case was announced, U.S. Attorney Martin Estrada said Mizuhara had an \"insatiable appetite\" for illegal sports betting, which landed him millions of dollars in debt to a bookmaker and led him to transfer money out of Ohtani's bank account without the slugger's knowledge.\n\nMizuhara worked as an interpreter for Ohtani since the slugger joined the Angels organization six years ago. In that capacity, he helped Ohtani set up a bank account in Arizona, which eventually became the source of wire transfers to the illegal gambling operation, Estrada said.\n\nEstrada stressed that Ohtani was a victim in the case and had no knowledge of Mizuhara's actions.\n\nAccording to Estrada, Mizuhara also allegedly lied to bank officials, and was captured on tape-recorded calls impersonating Ohtani to \"convince the bank to approve large wire transfers of large amounts of money to the bookmakers.\"\n\nEstrada said Mizuhara acted \"to plunder\" Ohtani's bank account to satisfy his \"insatiable appetite for illegal sports betting,\" and he \"committed fraud on a massive scale.\"\n\nAccording to an affidavit filed in federal court by Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigations special agent Chris Seymour, records obtained from a source within the illegal gambling operation showed that between December 2021 and January 2024, about 19,000 wagers were attributed to Mizuhara, averaging roughly 25 per day and ranging in amounts from about $10 to $160,000.\n\nDuring that period, the records showed Mizuhara had winning bets worth nearly $142.3 million, and losing bets of $182.9 million, leaving him with a roughly $40.7 million deficit.\n\nSeymour wrote in the document that Mizuhara was acting as a \"de facto manager\" for Ohtani, and he began placing bets with the illegal gambling operation in late 2021. At about that time, bank records showed that the contact information on the Arizona bank account, which was opened in March 2018, was changed to a phone number and email linked to Mizuhara.\n\nThe Dodgers fired Mizuhara earlier this year when news of the criminal investigation broke.\n\nAt a subsequent news conference, Ohtani denied any knowledge of Mizuhara's actions. He also vehemently denied that he was involved in any gambling activity.\n\n\"I never bet on baseball or any other sports or never have asked somebody to bet on my behalf,\" he insisted.\n\nOhtani said Mizuhara \"has been stealing money from my account and has told lies.\"\n\nEstrada said none of the illegal bets allegedly placed by Mizuhara were on baseball games.\n\nAccording to various reports, wire transfers were made from Ohtani's bank account to an illegal bookmaking operation allegedly run by Orange County resident Mathew Bowyer, who is under federal investigation.\n\nBowyer's San Juan Capistrano home was searched by federal agents last year.\n\nProsecutors said Mizuhara also took money from Ohtani's account to pay other expenses, including $60,000 in dental work and $325,000 worth of baseball cards.\n\nThe false tax return charge stems from 2022, when Mizuhara falsified his taxable income by claiming only $136,865, when in fact the figure was more than $4.1 million stemming from his bank fraud, prosecutors said. He admits in his plea agreement that he owes more than $1.1 million in taxes for 2022.", "source": {"uri": "mynewsla.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "My News LA"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

Mizuhara has confessed to stealing nearly $17 million from Ohtani, money that he then used to place illegal sports bets and pay off gambling debts.\n\n\"Based on the thoroughness of the federal investigation that was made public, the information MLB collected, and the criminal proceeding being resolved without being contested, MLB considers Shohei Ohtani a victim of fraud and this matter has been closed,\" MLB said in a statement.\n\nThe Dodgers also issued the following statement: \"With today's plea in the criminal proceedings against Ippei Mizuhara and the conclusion of both federal and MLB investigations, the Dodgers are pleased that Shohei and the team can put this entire matter behind them and move forward in pursuit of a World Series title.\"\n\nOhtani had only just made his Dodgers team debut on March 20 against the San Diego Padres as part of MLB's season-opening series in Seoul, South Korea when news broke that Mizuhara was involved in a federal gambling investigation. Mizuhara originally claimed that Ohtani knew about his gambling and had offered to pay off his debts before later changing his story. It was subsequently revealed that Ohtani had no knowledge of Mizuhara's gambling, and that Mizuhara had committed bank fraud and had stolen millions upon millions from Ohtani. (As CBS Sports explained back in March, it's not unusual for interpreters to take on additional roles for their players, including day-to-day tasks that require access to financial accounts.)\n\nIn an odd twist of fate, Ohtani's vindication comes on the same day that MLB suspended two big-league players for unrelated gambling violations, including banning injured San Diego Padres infielder Tucupita Marcano for life after it was discovered that he had placed bets on games that he had a direct connection with.", "source": {"uri": "cbssports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "r_j_anderson@cbssports.com", "name": "R.J.

(AP) -- The former interpreter for Los Angeles Dodgers star Shohei Ohtani is scheduled to plead guilty Tuesday to bank and tax fraud in a sports betting case where he will admit to stealing nearly $17 million from the Japanese baseball player.\n\nTuesday's change-of-plea hearing for Ippei Mizuhara in federal court in Santa Ana, California, comes as the gambling scandal has shocked baseball fans from Japan to the U.S. and ratcheted up a media frenzy that's ever-present around Ohtani. It occurs as the Dodgers begin a three-game series in Pittsburgh.\n\nThe duo's personal and professional relationship allowed Mizuhara to exploit his access to the two-way player. Prosecutors say he plundered millions from Ohtani's account for years, at times impersonating him to bankers, to pay off sports gambling debts.\n\nMizuhara's winning bets totaled over $142 million, which he deposited in his own bank account and not Ohtani's. His losing bets were around $183 million, a net loss of nearly $41 million. He did not wager on baseball.\n\nAuthorities say there was no evidence Ohtani was involved in or aware of Mizuhara's gambling, and the player cooperated with investigators.\n\nMLB rules prohibit players and team employees from wagering on baseball, even legally. MLB also bans betting on other sports with illegal or offshore bookmakers.\n\nMizuhara signed a plea agreement that detailed the allegations on May 5, and federal prosecutors announced it several days later.\n\nMizuhara is expected to plead guilty to one count of bank fraud and one count of subscribing to a false tax return. The bank fraud charge carries a maximum of 30 years in federal prison, and the false tax return charge carries a sentence of up to three years in federal prison.\n\nSentencing and restitution proceedings have not yet been scheduled.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

But his losing bets were around $183 million, a net loss of nearly $41 million. He did not wager on baseball.\n\nMizuhara pleaded guilty to one count of bank fraud and one count of subscribing to a false tax return. The bank fraud charge carries a maximum of 30 years in federal prison, and the false tax return charge carries a sentence of up to three years in federal prison. The sentencing hearing is scheduled for Oct. 25.\n\nHe also is required to pay Ohtani restitution that could total nearly $17 million, as well as more than $1 million to the IRS. Those amounts, however, could change prior to sentencing.\n\nMizuhara's plea deal was negotiated with prosecutors before he was even arraigned in federal court in Los Angeles in mid-May. He was initially charged with one count of bank fraud.\n\nThere was no evidence Ohtani was involved in or aware of Mizuhara's gambling, and the player cooperated with investigators, authorities said.\n\nThe Los Angeles Times and ESPN broke the news of the prosecution in late March, prompting the Dodgers to fire the interpreter and MLB to open its own investigation.\n\nMLB rules prohibit players and team employees from wagering on baseball, even legally. MLB also bans betting on other sports with illegal or offshore bookmakers.\n\nOhtani has sought to focus on the field as the case winds through the courts. Hours after his ex-interpreter first appeared in court in April, he hit his 175th home run in MLB, tying Hideki Matsui for the most by a Japan-born player, during the Dodgers' 8-7 loss to the San Diego Padres in 11 innings.\n\nMizuhara's hearing came hours after MLB banned San Diego Padres infielder Tucupita Marcano from baseball for life in the wake of another gambling scandal. MLB said Marcano placed 387 baseball bets totaling more than $150,000 in October 2022 and from last July through November with a legal sportsbook. He became the first active player in a century banned for life because of gambling. Four others were suspended Tuesday.", "source": {"uri": "reformer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Brattleboro Reformer"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@reformer.com", "name": "Associated

His sentencing will occur at a later date.\n\nThe Justice Department said Mizuhara has admitted he owes more than $1.1 million in taxes for 2022 and the IRS Criminal Investigation and Homeland Security Investigations are looking into the case.\n\nMizuhara, who is out of custody on $25,000 bond, could be deported as he is not a US citizen, the plea agreement and the US attorney's office said. Mizuhara is a legal permanent resident who has a green card, the US Attorney's Office for the Central District of California told CNN.\n\nThe scandal upended what had been perceived as a close friendship between the star and his interpreter and brought renewed scrutiny to the normalization and legalization of sports gambling in recent years.\n\nMizuhara and Ohtani, who does not speak English, first worked together from 2013 to 2017 at Japan's Nippon Professional Baseball League team Nippon-Ham Fighters, where Mizuhara worked as an interpreter for non-Japanese speaking players, according to MLB.com. Mizuhara then became Ohtani's interpreter in his rookie season with the Los Angeles Angels in 2018.\n\nOhtani starred for six seasons with the Angels as both a slugger and a pitcher, twice winning the American League's Most Valuable Player Award. This past offseason, he signed a historic $700 million, 10-year contract with the Dodgers.\n\nThe allegations against Mizuhara came to light in March when, after reporting from ESPN and the Los Angeles Times, Ohtani's lawyers accused Mizuhara of \"massive theft\" of millions of dollars and placing bets with a bookie under federal investigation.\n\nIn April, Ohtani said he was \"very grateful for the Department of Justice's investigation,\" according to a statement given to CNN by his representatives. \"For me personally, this marks a break from this, and I'd like to focus on baseball.\"\n\nDespite the scandal, Ohtani has excelled in his first year with the Dodgers and remains one of the best sluggers in baseball.\n\nCNN's Jacob Lev and Stephanie Becker contributed to this

He was released on a $25,000 bond and will return to court for the next hearing on May 9.\n\nMizuhara, who had shackles around his ankles and was dressed in a suit with no tie, was ordered to surrender his passport, was barred from gambling and from entering casinos, and was instructed not to have any contact with Shohei Ohtani, the star baseball player from whom he is accused of stealing roughly $16 million. Judge Maria Audero also ordered that Mizuhara attend a program to treat gambling addiction and that he seek employment and remain employed.\n\nThe shackles were ultimately removed at the request of Mizuhara's attorney, Michael G. Freedman. In a statement, Freedman said that Mizuhara \"is continuing to cooperate with the legal process and is hopeful that he can reach an agreement with the government to resolve this case as quickly as possible so that he can take responsibility.\"\n\nThe statement also noted that Mizuhara \"wishes to apologize to Mr. Ohtani, the Dodgers, Major League Baseball, and his family. As noted in court, he is also eager to seek treatment for his gambling.\"\n\nMizuhara's Friday appearance at the Roybal Federal Building comes on the heels of the Thursday filing of a criminal complaint against the former Ohtani interpreter, who was fired by the Dodgers on March 20. Federal prosecutors charged Mizuhara with felony bank fraud after an investigation discovered he transferred more than $16 million out of Ohtani's bank accounts. The maximum sentence is 30 years in prison.\n\nMizuhara used the money \"largely to finance his voracious appetite for illegal sports gambling,\" United States attorney Martin Estrada said during a news conference in Los Angeles.\n\nAccording to the complaint, Mizuhara manipulated Ohtani's bank accounts beginning in 2021, around the time Mizuhara began wagering on sports. Mizuhara controlled an account that collected Ohtani's baseball salary. He shielded access to the account from others in Ohtani's orbit saying the player wanted the account to be private. Mizuhara also impersonated Ohtani in conversations with bank officials, prosecutors said.\n\nMizuhara and Ohtani met in 2013 when Ohtani was playing in Japan and Mizuhara was working as an interpreter for American players on the Nippon Ham Fighters.

The bank fraud charge carries a possible prison term of up to 30 years, while the tax charge carries up to three years in federal prison.\n\nAfter U.S. District Judge John Holcomb accepts Mizuhara's guilty plea, a sentencing date will be scheduled, most likely several months in the future.\n\nMizuhara was charged in April with bank fraud and surrendered to federal authorities on April 12. He was released on $25,000 bond.\n\nWhen the criminal case was announced, U.S. Attorney Martin Estrada said Mizuhara had an \"insatiable appetite\" for illegal sports betting, which landed him millions of dollars in debt to a bookmaker and led him to transfer money out of Ohtani's bank account without the slugger's knowledge.\n\nMizuhara worked as an interpreter for Ohtani since the slugger joined the Angels organization six years ago. In that capacity, he helped Ohtani set up a bank account in Arizona, which eventually became the source of wire transfers to the illegal gambling operation, Estrada said.\n\nEstrada stressed that Ohtani was a victim in the case and had no knowledge of Mizuhara's actions.\n\nAccording to Estrada, Mizuhara also allegedly lied to bank officials, and was captured on tape-recorded calls impersonating Ohtani to \"convince the bank to approve large wire transfers of large amounts of money to the bookmakers.\"\n\nEstrada said Mizuhara acted \"to plunder\" Ohtani's bank account to satisfy his \"insatiable appetite for illegal sports betting,\" and he \"committed fraud on a massive scale.\"\n\nAccording to an affidavit filed in federal court by Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigations special agent Chris Seymour, records obtained from a source within the illegal gambling operation showed that between December 2021 and January 2024, about 19,000 wagers were attributed to Mizuhara, averaging roughly 25 per day and ranging in amounts from about $10 to $160,000.\n\nDuring that period, the records showed Mizuhara had winning bets worth nearly $142.3 million, and losing bets of $182.9 million, leaving him with a roughly $40.7 million deficit.\n\nSeymour wrote in the document that Mizuhara was acting as a \"de facto manager\" for Ohtani, and he began placing bets with the illegal gambling operation in late 2021. At about that time, bank records showed that the contact information on the Arizona bank account, which was opened in March 2018, was changed to a phone number and email linked to Mizuhara.\n\nThe Dodgers fired Mizuhara earlier this year when news of the criminal investigation broke.\n\nAt a subsequent news conference, Ohtani denied any knowledge of Mizuhara's actions. He also vehemently denied that he was involved in any gambling activity.\n\n\"I never bet on baseball or any other sports or never have asked somebody to bet on my behalf,\" he insisted.\n\nOhtani said Mizuhara \"has been stealing money from my account and has told lies.\"\n\nEstrada said none of the illegal bets allegedly placed by Mizuhara were on baseball games.\n\nAccording to various reports, wire transfers were made from Ohtani's bank account to an illegal bookmaking operation allegedly run by Orange County resident Mathew Bowyer, who is under federal investigation.\n\nBowyer's San Juan Capistrano home was searched by federal agents last year.\n\nProsecutors said Mizuhara also took money from Ohtani's account to pay other expenses, including $60,000 in dental work and $325,000 worth of baseball cards.\n\nThe false tax return charge stems from 2022, when Mizuhara falsified his taxable income by claiming only $136,865, when in fact the figure was more than $4.1 million stemming from his bank fraud, prosecutors said. He admits in his plea agreement that he owes more than $1.1 million in taxes for 2022.", "source": {"uri": "mynewsla.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "My News LA"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

Mizuhara signed a plea agreement that detailed the allegations on May 5, and prosecutors announced it several days later.\n\nMizuhara's attorney declined to comment outside the courthouse. Mizuhara spoke briefly in court acknowledging his guilt. \"I worked for victim A and had access to his bank account and had fallen into major gambling debt,\" he told the court. \"I went ahead and wired money ... with his bank account.\"\n\nTuesday's court hearing lasted approximately 45 minutes.\n\nMizuhara's winning bets totaled over $142 million, which he deposited in his own bank account and not Ohtani's. But his losing bets were around $183 million, a net loss of nearly $41 million. He did not wager on baseball.\n\nMizuhara pleaded guilty to one count of bank fraud and one count of subscribing to a false tax return. The bank fraud charge carries a maximum of 30 years in federal prison, and the false tax return charge carries a sentence of up to three years in federal prison. The sentencing hearing is scheduled for Oct. 25.\n\nHe also is required to pay Ohtani restitution that could total nearly $17 million, as well as more than $1 million to the IRS. Those amounts, however, could change prior to sentencing.\n\nMizuhara's plea deal was negotiated with prosecutors before he was even arraigned in federal court in Los Angeles in mid-May. He was initially charged with one count of bank fraud.\n\nThere was no evidence Ohtani was involved in or aware of Mizuhara's gambling, and the player cooperated with investigators, authorities said.\n\nThe Los Angeles Times and ESPN broke the news of the prosecution in late March, prompting the Dodgers to fire the interpreter and MLB to open its own investigation.\n\nMLB rules prohibit players and team employees from wagering on baseball, even legally. MLB also bans betting on other sports with illegal or offshore bookmakers.\n\nOhtani has sought to focus on the field as the case winds through the courts. Hours after his ex-interpreter first appeared in court in April, he hit his 175th home run in MLB, tying Hideki Matsui for the most by a Japan-born player, during the Dodgers' 8-7 loss to the San Diego Padres in 11 innings.\n\nMizuhara's hearing came hours after MLB banned San Diego Padres infielder Tucupita Marcano from baseball for life in the wake of another gambling scandal.

It occurs as the Dodgers begin a three-game series in Pittsburgh.\n\nThe duo's personal and professional relationship allowed Mizuhara to exploit his access to the two-way player.

Mandatory Credit: Kirby Lee-USA TODAY Sports / Kirby Lee-USA TODAY Sports\n\nThe disgraced former interpreter to Los Angeles Dodgers star Shohei Ohtani is set to plead guilty to federal charges of bank and tax fraud in court Tuesday, according to multiple reports.\n\nIppei Mizuhara, 39, reportedly will admit to stealing nearly $17 million from Ohtani, who was by his side for more than six years as his interpreter for the Angels and Dodgers.\n\nThe plea will nearly bring to a conclusion a shocking sports gambling saga that ensnared the Dodgers' $700 million star in March. Mizuhara is not expected to be sentenced Tuesday, but the bank fraud charge reportedly carries a maximum of 30 years in federal prison, and the false tax return charge carries a sentence of up to three years in federal prison.\n\nAccording to the Justice Department, Mizuhara made approximately 19,000 wagers over more than three years, up to $160,000 per bet. The money was sent to an illegal bookmaker by wire transfers and reportedly received by a reality TV star.\n\n\"From no later than November 2021 to March 2024, Mizuhara used Ohtani's password to successfully sign into the bank account and then changed the account's security protocols without Ohtani's knowledge or permission,\" the Justice Department said. \"In total, Mizuhara called the bank and impersonated Ohtani on approximately 24 occasions.\"\n\nOhtani has maintained all along that he was a victim of Mizuhara's activity, and not aware of the money being taken from his personal bank account.\n\nAt a press conference in March, Ohtani said he learned of the theft from him only when Mizuhara admitted it to the team after the Dodgers' season-opening victory in Seoul, South Korea.\n\nIn 58 games this season, Ohtani leads the team with 14 home runs, 38 RBIs and a .322 batting average.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ippei_Mizuhara", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ippei Mizuhara"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shohei_Ohtani", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Shohei Ohtani"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Dodgers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Dodgers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dodger_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dodger Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_evasion", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tax evasion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_prison", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal prison"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Designated_hitter", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Designated hitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bank fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_betting", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sports betting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Batting average (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bookmaker_(gambling)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bookmaker (gambling)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theft", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Theft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_batted_in", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Run batted in"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reality_television", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reality television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seoul", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Seoul"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Seoul"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Korea"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Stars", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Stars", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Banking_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Banking Services", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Holding_Companies", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Holding Companies", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Prisons", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Prisons", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Religious_and_Inspirational", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Religious and Inspirational", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 46}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_8001,h_4500,x_0,y_0/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/inside_the_dodgers/01hzhq9c5hctgbxvhrye.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9622563", "eventUri": "eng-9622563", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2014-12-", "textStart": 0, "textEnd": 6}], "sentiment": -0.207843137254902, "wgt": 202, "relevance": 1}

He was fired by the Dodgers shortly afterwards, at which point the complicated story began to unravel.\n\nIn the weeks since, MLB, the Internal Revenue Service, the United States Attorney's Office in Los Angeles and the Federal Bureau of Investigation initiated their own investigations, revealing along the way that Mizuhara allegedly took more than $16 million to pay an illegal Orange County-based bookmaker.\n\nMizuhara is accused of helping Ohtani, who primarily speaks Japanese, set up bank accounts upon his move to the United States after he signed with the Los Angeles Angels in 2017. Estrada said that one of these bank accounts, which was set up in Arizona, became the source of wire transfers to the bookmaker.\n\n\"I am very saddened and shocked someone whom I trusted has done this,\" the Japanese star said through a new interpreter after the news broke. \"Ippei has been stealing money from my account and has been telling lies. ... I never bet on sports or have willfully sent money to the bookmaker.\"\n\nOhtani and Mizuhara ended their six-year run in Anaheim when the two-way player signed a monstrous 10-year, $700 million deal with the Dodgers after the 2023 season came to an end.\n\nHe is also accused of filing a false tax return in 2022, when he claimed to make $136,865. Instead, he earned more than $4.1 million from his bank fraud, according to prosecutors.\n\nOn top of gambling payments, prosecutors also allege that Mizuhara took more than $60,000 to fund personal dental work and purchase $325,000 worth of baseball cards.\n\nIllegal gambling has become an unforeseen chapter of the 2024 MLB season, with former Angels infielder David Fletcher becoming ensnared in an investigation for placing bets with the same bookmaker in late-May. On Monday, league officials also announced that San Diego Padres infielder Tucupita Marcano is facing a lifetime ban for betting on baseball games last season when he was with the Pittsburgh Pirates.", "source": {"uri": "cbsnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shohei_Ohtani", "type": "person", "score": 5,

Sentencing will be on Oct. 25. A 33-page record of the deal, in which Mizuhara, 39, agreed to plead guilty to one count of felony bank fraud and one count of subscribing to a false tax return, was previously filed in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles.\n\nA federal bank fraud conviction carries a statutory maximum sentence of 30 years in prison, with the tax offense punishable by up to three years behind bars. Mizuhara was accused of embezzling nearly $17 million from a bank account of Ohtani's that Mizuhara had helped open in Phoenix in 2018, and transferring the funds without the ballplayer's knowledge to an illegal bookmaking operation to cover Mizuhara's gambling debts.\n\nThe former interpreter's lawyer declined to comment. Announcing the original bank fraud charge on April 11, U.S. Attorney E. Martin Estrada stressed there was nothing to suggest wrongdoing by Ohtani, who signed a record $700 million, 10-year contract to join the Dodgers this season, becoming the highest paid player in Major League Baseball.\n\nOhtani, 29, whose talents as a slugger and a pitcher have earned him comparisons to Babe Ruth, has said he was an unwitting victim of theft and has never bet on baseball or knowingly paid a bookmaker. According to prosecutors, Mizuhara began gambling with an illegal sports book in late 2021 and lost substantial sums.\n\nTo cover his debts, Mizuhara impersonated Ohtani over the phone on more than two dozen occasions to deceive bank employees into authorizing wire transfers from Ohtani's account, prosecutors said.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shohei_Ohtani", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Shohei Ohtani"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bank fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambling", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gambling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ippei_Mizuhara", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ippei Mizuhara"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_facto", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "De facto"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_interpretation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Language interpretation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manager (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Dodgers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Dodgers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitcher", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pitcher"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bookmaker_(gambling)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bookmaker (gambling)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embezzlement", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Embezzlement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Felony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statute", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Statute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_district_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States district court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix,_Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Phoenix, Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Phoenix, Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E._Martin_Estrada", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "E.

Sentencing will be on Oct. 25.\n\nA 33-page record of the deal, in which Mizuhara, 39, agreed to plead guilty to one count of felony bank fraud and one count of subscribing to a false tax return, was previously filed in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles.\n\nA federal bank fraud conviction carries a statutory maximum sentence of 30 years in prison, with the tax offense punishable by up to three years behind bars.\n\nMizuhara was accused of embezzling nearly $17 million from a bank account of Ohtani's that Mizuhara had helped open in Phoenix in 2018, and transferring the funds without the ballplayer's knowledge to an illegal bookmaking operation to cover Mizuhara's gambling debts.\n\nThe former interpreter's lawyer declined to comment.\n\nAnnouncing the original bank fraud charge on April 11, U.S. Attorney E.

He is facing a maximum of 33 years in prison. The bank fraud charge carries a maximum of 30 years in federal prison, and the false tax return charge carries a sentence of up to three years in federal prison.\n\nHe also is required to pay Ohtani restitution that could total nearly $17 million, as well as more than $1 million to the IRS. Those amounts, however, could change prior to sentencing.\n\nThe 39-year-old helped with setting up a bank account for Ohtani, which contained his Major League Baseball salary. Mizuhara also lied to the bank in order to access the account. According to ESPN, the former interpreter would identify himself as Ohtani to the bank in order to \"trick and deceive\" employees to authorize the transactions.\n\nMizuhara spoke to ESPN in March when he claimed Ohtani agreed to pay off the gambling debts, but later told the outlet that the two-way phenom had nothing to do with it, and had no knowledge of what was going on.\n\nThe Dodgers fired Mizuhara, and Ohtani addressed the media days later with a prepared statement. The 29-year-old told reporters he was \"duped\" by his longtime friend, and had no idea about what was going on until a few days before the news broke.\n\nMLB released a statement shortly after Mizhuara's guilty plea saying the league \"considers Shohei Ohtani a victim\" and has closed its investigation.", "source": {"uri": "masslive.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MassLive"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shohei_Ohtani", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Shohei Ohtani"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_prison", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Federal prison"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ippei_Mizuhara", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ippei Mizuhara"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_evasion", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tax evasion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bank fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambling", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gambling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Dodgers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Dodgers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_Revenue_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Internal Revenue Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Banking_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Banking Services", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Accounting/Tax_Negotiation_and_Representation", "label": "dmoz/Business/Accounting/Tax Negotiation and Representation", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Prisons", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Prisons", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Gambling", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Gambling", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 56}], "image": "https://www.masslive.com/resizer/v2/RZJUDFAERFFN7CBODZVRZUY5TI.jpg?auth=4b7a1450b037c359a7af637d0ab84febb3c68be73750b8b7e64a8476b8e097ca&width=1280&quality=90", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9622563", "eventUri": "eng-9622563", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-10-25", "textStart": 297, "textEnd": 304}], "sentiment": -0.388235294117647, "wgt": 194, "relevance": 1}

His sentencing will occur at a later date.\n\nThe Justice Department said Mizuhara has admitted he owes more than $1.1 million in taxes for 2022 and the IRS Criminal Investigation and Homeland Security Investigations are looking into the case.\n\nMizuhara, who is out of custody on $25,000 bond, could be deported as he is not a US citizen, the plea agreement and the US attorney's office said. Mizuhara is a legal permanent resident who has a green card, the US Attorney's Office for the Central District of California told CNN.\n\nThe scandal upended what had been perceived as a close friendship between the star and his interpreter and brought renewed scrutiny to the normalization and legalization of sports gambling in recent years.\n\nMizuhara and Ohtani, who does not speak English, first worked together from 2013 to 2017 at Japan's Nippon Professional Baseball League team Nippon-Ham Fighters, where Mizuhara worked as an interpreter for non-Japanese speaking players, according to MLB.com. Mizuhara then became Ohtani's interpreter in his rookie season with the Los Angeles Angels in 2018.\n\nOhtani starred for six seasons with the Angels as both a slugger and a pitcher, twice winning the American League's Most Valuable Player Award. This past offseason, he signed a historic $700 million, 10-year contract with the Dodgers.\n\nThe allegations against Mizuhara came to light in March when, after reporting from ESPN and the Los Angeles Times, Ohtani's lawyers accused Mizuhara of \"massive theft\" of millions of dollars and placing bets with a bookie under federal investigation.\n\nIn April, Ohtani said he was \"very grateful for the Department of Justice's investigation,\" according to a statement given to CNN by his representatives. \"For me personally, this marks a break from this, and I'd like to focus on baseball.\"\n\nDespite the scandal, Ohtani has excelled in his first year with the Dodgers and remains one of the best sluggers in baseball.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

But U.S. District Judge John W. Holcomb is expected to accept his guilty plea after prosecutors reached an agreement with Mizuhara.\n\nMizuhara is accused of illegally transferring nearly $17 million from Ohtani's bank account, without the player's knowledge or permission, to pay off his own substantial gambling debts throughout about half of the six years they worked together.\n\nAfter Mizuhara enters his plea, a sentencing date will be set, likely for several months from now. He's facing up to 33 years in federal prison between both counts.\n\nMizuhara was released on an unsecured $25,000 bond with conditions, which includes undergoing gambling addiction treatment. He spoke only to answer Magistrate Judge Jean P. Rosenbluth's questions, as reported by the Associated Press.\n\nMichael G. Freedman, Mizuhara's defense attorney, didn't immediately respond to LAist's request for comment.\n\nMajor League Baseball has been investigating the gambling allegations surrounding Mizuhara and Ohtani since late March, just a few days after the interpreter was fired by the Dodgers when news of the scandal broke while the team was playing the first game of the season in South Korea.\n\nWhile the league allows its players to bet on sports other than baseball, sports betting isn't allowed in California, and using illegal bookmakers is against the rules.\n\nMLB Commissioner Rob Manfred told The Carton Show that Ohtani has been credible and transparent, but they need to verify the story. He said the investigation is moving along, and he thinks it can be a \"relatively short\" process.\n\n\"The fact that there is a parallel federal investigation, I think in this particular case, may actually help us,\" Manfred said in the April 5 interview.\n\nThe league has also opened an investigation into Ohtani's former Angels teammate, David Fletcher, for allegedly placing sports bets with the same illegal bookmaking operation Mizuhara is accused of entangling with, as reported by ESPN.\n\nAccording to ESPN, Fletcher said in a March 18 interview that he was there for the 2021 poker game in San Diego where Mizuhara first met the bookmaker.", "source": {"uri": "laist.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "LAist"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Mizuhara spoke briefly in court acknowledging his guilt. \"I worked for victim A and had access to his bank account and had fallen into major gambling debt,\" he told the court. \"I went ahead and wired money ... with his bank account.\"\n\nTuesday's court hearing lasted approximately 45 minutes.\n\nMizuhara's winning bets totaled over $142 million, which he deposited in his own bank account and not Ohtani's. But his losing bets were around $183 million, a net loss of nearly $41 million. He did not wager on baseball.\n\nMizuhara pleaded guilty to one count of bank fraud and one count of subscribing to a false tax return. The bank fraud charge carries a maximum of 30 years in federal prison, and the false tax return charge carries a sentence of up to three years in federal prison. The sentencing hearing is scheduled for Oct. 25.\n\nHe also is required to pay Ohtani restitution that could total nearly $17 million, as well as more than $1 million to the IRS. Those amounts, however, could change prior to sentencing.\n\nMizuhara's plea deal was negotiated with prosecutors before he was even arraigned in federal court in Los Angeles in mid-May. He was initially charged with one count of bank fraud.\n\nThere was no evidence Ohtani was involved in or aware of Mizuhara's gambling, and the player cooperated with investigators, authorities said.\n\nThe Los Angeles Times and ESPN broke the news of the prosecution in late March, prompting the Dodgers to fire the interpreter and MLB to open its own investigation.\n\nMLB rules prohibit players and team employees from wagering on baseball, even legally. MLB also bans betting on other sports with illegal or offshore bookmakers.\n\nOhtani has sought to focus on the field as the case winds through the courts. Hours after his ex-interpreter first appeared in court in April, he hit his 175th home run in MLB, tying Hideki Matsui for the most by a Japan-born player, during the Dodgers' 8-7 loss to the San Diego Padres in 11 innings.\n\nMizuhara's hearing came hours after MLB banned San Diego Padres infielder Tucupita Marcano from baseball for life in the wake of another gambling scandal. MLB said Marcano placed 387 baseball bets totaling more than $150,000 in October 2022 and from last July through November with a legal sportsbook. He became the first active player in a century banned for life because of gambling. Four others were suspended Tuesday.\n\nStefanie Dazio And Amy Taxin, The Associated Press", "source": {"uri": "lethbridgenewsnow.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Lethbridge News Now"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shohei_Ohtani", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Shohei Ohtani"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_prison", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Federal prison"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bank fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambling", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gambling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plea_bargain", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Plea bargain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_judiciary_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal judiciary of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_Revenue_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Internal Revenue Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Dodgers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Dodgers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tucupita_Marcano", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tucupita Marcano"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bookmaker_(gambling)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bookmaker (gambling)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hideki_Matsui", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hideki Matsui"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sportsbook", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sportsbook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Infielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego_Padres", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "San Diego Padres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Times"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/History", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Gambling", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Gambling", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://d2ksr9467jthww.cloudfront.net/2024060417064/665f496e023d1607a07a9563jpeg.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9622563", "eventUri": "eng-9622563", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-10-25", "textStart": 885, "textEnd": 892}], "sentiment": -0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 166, "relevance": 1}

In the story Ohtani told the public days after Mizuhara recanted his initial claims and was fired by the Dodgers, the interpreter stole the money to pay off his gambling debts.\n\nBoth versions of the story generated a question that stumped the general public: Why would a bookie extend a line of credit of at least $4.5 million to someone who said he was drawing an $85,000 salary as an interpreter with the Los Angeles Angels? The scenario was easier to understand for those acquainted with the inner workings of gambling markets.\n\n\"Credit is the lifeblood of illegal bookmakers,\" said Chris Grove, a gambling industry entrepreneur and investor. \"So we shouldn't be surprised when an illegal bookmaker utilizes credit to attract a high-value customer, especially when that customer has shown they are good for it.\"\n\nThe scandal has captivated the industry of baseball and the larger sporting world at a time when gambling has become intertwined with sports consumption. Ohtani, the 29-year-old two-time American League MVP who recently signed a 10-year, $700 million contract, said he never bet on baseball or any other sports, and he has not been accused of any wrongdoing. He described himself as a victim duped by a friend. \"Ippei has been stealing money from my account and has told lies,\" he said through his new interpreter, Will Ireton. Major League Baseball has opened an investigation. The IRS's Los Angeles field office has partnered with the Department for Homeland Security to investigate Mizuhara and Bowyer.\n\nThe story also opened a portal for the public into the lesser-understood world of illegal bookmaking. Since the Supreme Court struck down a 1992 federal law that effectively banned sports betting in most states, the majority of the country has gained access to legally wagering on games. Yet a 2022 report by the American Gaming Association estimated that Americans wagered a total of $63.8 billion with illegal bookies and unregulated offshore sites in 2021. So why do these bookies and offshore operations maintain such a thriving business?\n\nThe allure of credit -- the ability to bet money you don't actually have -- is the primary reason, as gleaned from interviews with gambling attorneys, entrepreneurs, researchers and professional gamblers. These experts framed most of their commentary on the broader world of illegal gambling, rather than the saga of Ohtani and Mizuhara. But they also pointed to a variety of additional factors that drive bettors toward bookmakers, including the promise of privacy, the ability to avoid taxes on winnings, the removal of artificial betting limits and the lasting appeal of convenience.\n\n\"The Ohtani situation is a good reminder that there's still a thriving illegal market, because there's still folks in the illegal market willing to offer things to consumers that the regulated market can't or won't,\" Grove said.\n\nThe prosecution team tracking Bowyer is the same group that investigated a different gambling ring run by former minor-league baseball player Wayne Nix, the Los Angeles Times reported. One of the dozen people charged in that probe is former Dodgers outfielder Yasiel Puig, who pleaded not guilty. The Nix probe demonstrated the modernity of the practice. The concept of meeting a bookie in a darkened alley or a seedy saloon is outdated. Nix used a network of bookies who collected bets through a website and a telephone line, according to the Washington Post.\n\nThe convenience adds to the appeal, especially when placing an illegal bet only requires clicking a few buttons rather than walking into a casino in Las Vegas, said one professional gambler. \"The last thing a guy wants to do is go to Circa Sportsbook every day and put down $20,000 on (games),\" Ingram said. \"Some people just text a person, or they go to the website.\"\n\nBookies often maintain a personal relationship with their clients, forgiving certain bets, offering free play credits or commiserating over \"bad beats,\" the unlucky results that bond all gamblers. \"They offer customer service that sometimes can't be offered through an app,\" said Timothy Fong, co-director of the UCLA Gambling Studies Program.\n\nFong, a psychiatrist, studies the causes and treatment options for gambling addicts. Some of those who bet through illegal bookmakers desire anonymity. Others don't want to pay taxes on a potential jackpot.\n\nDaniel Wallach, a sports betting and gambling attorney in Florida who has previously written for The Athletic, suggested a sense of loyalty can keep bettors intertwined with bookies. \"Those patterns may be hard to break, given all the incentives,\" Wallach said. \"There may be better lines, better odds\" for a regular.\n\nBookies also offer bets that legal betting companies either can't or won't, depending on state laws or risks of exposure. Some states, for instance, bar betting on their local college teams, and against the backdrop of the March Madness college basketball tournaments, the NCAA is trying to restrict college betting further; last week, NCAA president Charlie Baker urged states to ban prop betting on college athletes entirely. Bookies exist in a world unconcerned by those developments, which can be attractive to bettors looking for specific types of action that legal books might not offer.\n\n\"Instead of 30 kinds of cereal that they're offering,\" Fong said, \"I can get 100 different kinds of cereal that my bookie is offering.\"\n\nIn the case of Mizuhara and Ohtani, location matters. California is one of 12 states without legal sports betting. In 2022, voters there struck down a pair of competing ballot initiatives to keep it that way, showing just how tough it will be to legalize bets amid an expensive and often bitter fight between tribal casinos and private betting companies. Proposition 26 would have legalized in-person betting at tribal casinos and horse tracks. Proposition 27 would have permitted online sports betting.\n\nBy the time voters rejected those initiatives, Mizuhara was already facing more than $1 million in gambling debt, he told ESPN. Mizuhara said he had met Bowyer at a poker game in San Diego in 2021. To boost his business, Bowyer told associates that Ohtani was his customer, the Los Angeles Times reported. Diane Bass, Bowyer's attorney, has said her client had zero contact with Ohtani.\n\nIn many cases, a player must be referred to a bookie by an existing client, with the existing client sometimes getting a referral bonus when the new player bets. If the new player does not pay the bookie when needed, the referral will be cut off; peer pressure often serves as enough of a first resort to keep bettors paying their gambling debts.\n\nBookies also offer incentives for clients to pay in the form of free play or other forms of free bets; the bettor is incentivized to pay up, and use the free bets to keep chasing their losses and get back into the black. In cases where bettors are deeply in debt, bookies accept partial payments or put clients on weekly or monthly payment plans. Payments are frequently made on cash transfer apps like Venmo or PayPal, though at times cash is mailed, depending on the size of the transaction.\n\nMizuhara told ESPN that Bowyer extended him a line of credit that allowed his losses to extend into the millions, which experts described as customary for a bookmaker who felt confident in the bettor's ability to pay.\n\nBookmakers can make a lucrative living, especially if they can attract a few deep-pocketed, high-value clients -- assuming they can stay out of the crosshairs of the authorities. Bettors themselves rarely, if ever, face legal consequences for betting with illegal bookies; the government has generally looked to prosecute operators, not clients, when it goes after illegal bookmaking at all. At the same time, though, the lack of government oversight can also come back to sting bettors who win big. If the bookie decides not to pay out a significant win, players are left with few options.\n\nSome of the largest unregulated betting operations are outside the jurisdiction of U.S. state regulators altogether -- because they are based in foreign countries. These so-called \"offshore\" sites often model themselves to look like regulated American sportsbooks, and have domain names like \".lv\" to suggest they are based in Las Vegas (in that example, lv stands for Latvia). These typically do not offer the personal experience that US-based illegal bookies do, generally do not offer credit, and transferring cash in and out can be difficult; some gamblers use cryptocurrency to make transactions with these books. A small subset of bettors have placed wagers on sites like these without knowing they were illegal, having stumbled onto one of the raft of unregulated sites that offer the veneer of propriety.\n\n\"You look at it: it's clean, it's fresh, it looks like a regulated thing,\" Fong said. \"It looks no different than a cheap version of DraftKings or FanDuel. It's got all the bets on it.\" The unaware consumer, Fong explained, \"has no idea that what they're actually participating in is unregulated, unprotected gambling activity.\"\n\nIf they do well enough -- and can be certain of being paid out -- betting with an illegal operation can be lucrative for the bettor, as well; besides taxing a player's winnings, regulated websites also sometimes limit the action of gamblers perceived to be winners, experts said. The bookmaker may offer more freedom, certainly from taxes but also from limits. \"In the illegal market, you're not likely going to find any restraints or restrictions on the amount you can wager,\" said Wallach.\n\nThe evidence suggests Mizuhara was far from a winning bettor. Mizuhara painted himself as an addict unable to win back his losses. In those cases, the usage of credit aids the bookmaker, too.\n\n\"What they do is they let these people go in deep in money that they don't have,\" said the professional gambler. \"It's very predatory. It's sad, really, because this is how a lot of the world works, in gambling.\"", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri":

The rush he first chased with fantasy sports became problematic in college when he was connected with a bookie. Malek put $10 on the Royals to beat the Blue Jays. The Royals won, 15-5. Easy money. Malek won a $20 bet that weekend, underdog Bears over Steelers in overtime. Soon Malek started betting bigger -- $50, then $100 -- and losing. The wary voice in his head was drowned out by a more confident one claiming a big win was around the corner.\n\n\"Even if I were down thousands of dollars,\" Malek said, \"each game felt like the start of a new streak for me of getting back positive.\"\n\nThat sort of sentiment is found throughout the 37-page criminal complaint against Mizuhara, who is charged with felony bank fraud and has been court-ordered to attend a program to treat gambling addiction. While the sums in Mizuhara's case may be remarkable -- nearly 25 bets per day, averaging $12,800, and a net loss of $40 million over two years -- the behaviors exhibited are unfortunately universal, according to several problem gambling experts.\n\n\"I'd like to say it's uncommon, but I'd be lying,\" said Lia Nower, director of the Center for Gambling Studies at Rutgers University, \"It's becoming more and more common, actually.\"\n\nNower, like the other experts interviewed, spoke generally about gambling trends because she is not involved in Mizuhara's treatment. While the last national survey regarding the prevalence of problem gambling was released in 1999 (\"At that point, we're looking at riverboat casino and lottery,\" Nower said), a Rutgers study conducted in 2021 found a prevalence rate of high-risk problem gambling of about 6 percent.\n\nThe gambling environment has changed drastically since a 2018 Supreme Court ruling struck down a federal law prohibiting sports gambling in most states. Sports betting is now legal in 38 states. It's often just a click away, with more options than ever to bet on with in-game wagering. The commercial gaming industry is setting revenue records year after year.\n\nKeith Whyte, executive director of the National Council on Problem Gambling, which commissioned three surveys on gambling attitudes and experiences, said the risk of problem gambling has risen significantly since 2018.\n\n\"We think both the rate and severity of gambling problems are increasing in the United States,\" Whyte said, adding, \"That increase is mainly due to the massive growth of online sports betting.\"\n\nIt's unclear what betting experience Mizuhara had prior to meeting bookie Mathew Bowyer, but one of the more jarring parts of the Mizuhara criminal complaint is how quickly he started losing substantial sums. About a month after first using the illegal sports book, Mizuhara requested to pay his losses in smaller denominations -- $15,000 on consecutive days -- due to wiring restrictions. Two weeks later, he allegedly impersonated Ohtani to bank employees and sent his first payment, for $40,010, from Ohtani's account.\n\nExperts refer to the phenomenon of a new gambler almost immediately getting in over their heads as \"telescoping,\" and young men betting online are believed to be especially vulnerable.\n\n\"They're playing in a lot more high-risk ways, with little experience,\" Whyte said, \"and there's that telescoping effect where they seem to be going from initiation to problems in a very, very rapid timeframe.\"\n\nWithin a few months of his first $10 bet, Malek had a conversation with his parents, who'd noticed the bank transfers leaving his account. They talked about the risks of sports betting, and Malek stopped for a bit -- mostly because he'd run out of money to pay bookies. Then, one week, he realized his credit line with a bookie had reloaded despite not making a payment. He saw that as his chance to win it all back. He lost it all instead. That was Malek's introduction to playing on credit. He started betting money he didn't have. When Malek ran out of credit with one bookie, he'd block their phone number and find another bookie, hoping he'd win enough to pay back the previous bookie. When he ran out of bookies, he made a dating profile with photos of a woman he knew and used it to ask would-be suitors if they knew any bookies.\n\n\"It sped up pretty quickly,\" he said.\n\nCompulsive bettors often operate under the illusion of control, thinking that in sports betting, compared to a game of chance like slot machines, their expertise will give them an upper hand. Nower said problem gamblers, some of whom will have pre-existing vulnerabilities, will confront operant conditioning -- the interval ratio reinforcement schedule tells them a win is coming, but they don't know when -- and develop erroneous cognition.\n\n\"You start to think you can control the outcome of random chance, which of course you can't,\" Nower said.\n\n\"The step of going from betting in a controlled manner and with resources you have and can afford to lose, versus tipping over into a loss of control, is very individual,\" said Rachel Volberg, an epidemiology professor at the University of Massachusetts-Amherst who studies problem gambling. \"When we consider things like slot machines, the trigger there can often be a very large win early on in your gambling career. That seems to set your brain up to expect that it may happen again. You end up chasing after that and losing a great deal.\"\n\nChasing losses -- increasing bets to win back money -- is, in theory, a way to make up ground quickly. In practice, it is a great way to get deeper in the hole. A tendency to chase losses requires access to more and more money or credit. Mizuhara had both. Aside from allegedly stealing from Ohtani's account, Mizuhara regularly asked his bookie to \"bump\" (or extend) his line of credit.\n\nJan. 15, 2022: F -- I lost it all lol ... can you ask (Bowyer) if he can bump me 50k? That will be my last one for a while if I lose it.\n\nNov. 14, 2022: I'm terrible at this sport betting thing huh? Lol . . . Any chance u can bump me again?? As you know, you don't have to worry about me not paying!!\n\nDec. 9, 2022: Can u bump me last 200? I swear on my mom this will be the last ask before I pay it off once I get back to the states. Sorry for keep on asking. . . .\n\nJune 23, 2023: I'm the worst lol . . . can't catch a break. . . . Can I get one last bump? I swear this is gonna be my last until I get the balance down significantly . . . . I promise this will be the last bump for a while.\n\nJune 24, 2023: I have a problem lol. . . . Can I get one last last last bump? This one is for real. . . . Last one for real\n\n\"I would imagine that if someone has access to a large amount of money, they may believe that they can borrow the money, win it back and put it back in,\" said Dr. Marc Potenza, a psychiatrist at the Yale School of Medicine. \"Then when that doesn't happen and they get deeper into a hole, they believe that they can win back that money and things spiral increasingly out of control.\"\n\nIn many cases, a compulsive gambler is not necessarily satisfied by just breaking even; they're chasing the thrill of the action. As with other addictions, gamblers build tolerance, Whyte said, so they start to bet bigger. Our bodies haven't developed a physical defense to compulsive gambling. \"There's not enough money in the world to overdose somebody with a gambling problem,\" Whyte said. \"It is infinitely scalable, it seems, which is really tough if that's the high you're chasing.\"\n\nOn March 10, 2022, two years before his gambling became public, Mizuhara messaged Bowyer asking to lower his line of credit from $300,000 to $100,000. \"I'll get too reckless with 300,\" Mizuhara wrote. But this attempt to put a guardrail in place, to minimize the harm his habit could do, didn't last long. Mizuhara owed his bookie more than a million dollars in May 2022, according to investigators, and he continued to receive betting-limit bumps -- some at his request, other times offered by Bowyer.\n\n\"(Problem gambling) is rarely linear,\" Whyte said. \"There are a lot of stops and starts. People try to cut back, or they have a huge loss or big win. Even though the downward spiral is still pretty consistent, it's not a smooth curve. There's lots of bumps along the road.\"\n\n\"These are all really, really sad stories,\" added Volberg. \"I've sat in Gamblers Anonymous meetings and listened to some horrific stuff. Mizuhara's (story) is really a tragedy.\"\n\nThere are some safeguards available, but they are not mandatory across the United States. Bettors can set limits on their bank accounts. They can install bet-blocking software on their phone or computer. If they are betting with a regulated book like DraftKings or FanDuel, they can implement limit-setting features in betting apps to cap how much they can bet in a given timeframe. \"A very small percentage of people -- we're talking 4 percent to 6 percent at the most -- even use these features,\" Nower said. \"It's really unfortunate.\" (Mizuhara was betting with an illegal bookie, which lacked any protections like the self-regulating options often required of legal sportsbooks.)\n\nSeveral experts have called for increased federal support regarding problem gambling. Nower has lobbied for a federal regulatory agency to set minimal standards in several gambling areas, and for regulators from different states to put together uniform best practices across states. Whyte said gambling policy needs to begin with educating kids long before they place a bet, and it'll take will and funding to build that framework. Given how much the gambling environment has changed recently, Dr. Potenza said, \"We have to collect the information to make sure that we protect vulnerable individuals and promote public health.\"\n\nMizuhara appeared in federal court last week, one day after prosecutors charged him with felony bank fraud, which carries a sentence of up to 30 years in prison. He surrendered to authorities and was released on a $25,000 bond. He was also barred from gambling or entering casinos and was ordered to enter a gambling addiction treatment program.\n\nWhyte's advice for any compulsive gambler: install limit-setting tools, then tell a friend. \"Addiction breeds in shame, stigma and silence,\" he said. The National Council on Problem Gambling fielded over 325,000 calls and texts to their 1-800-GAMBLER national helpline last year. \"It's still only a fraction of the 9 million people we think have (gambling) problems,\" Whyte said. \"But for some of those 325,000, that's the first time they've told anybody in the world. It's an anonymous person on the other end of the phone, but with that one step everything else becomes possible.\"\n\nMalek started going to Gamblers Anonymous meetings at his parents' urging before his junior year of college. He owed somewhere between $20,000 and $25,000 across eight bookies and he had run out of bookies. \"I was like how people describe a dry drunk, just white-knuckling. I didn't have any access.\"\n\nAfter a breakup, Malek confided in a Gamblers Anonymous mentor about how betting had upended his life. He was suicidal. He couldn't sleep. He was lying and cheating. \"I had no real hope in life with the way I was going,\" he said.\n\nHe tried the Gamblers Anonymous 12-step program, and he stuck to it.\n\nAlmost six years later, Malek is still paying off some of his debt. But he is now a public speaker, traveling the country talking about gambling addiction. He reads Mizuhara's account and it brings back conversations he had with bookies, the way he spoke with them like old friends, like he was just a light-hearted, easy-going guy who was dealing just fine with the fact he was losing money he didn't have.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "stephen_j_nesbitt@nytimes.com", "name": "Stephen J.

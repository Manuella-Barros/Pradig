With approval from 75% of its secured creditors, the company is now set to present its demerger plan to an Indian tribunal. This move comes as part of Vedanta's broader strategy to enhance operational efficiency and tackle its debt, which has haunted the firm for years. Despite previous hurdles - including a failed privatization attempt in 2020 and government pushback on a $2.98 billion debt reduction deal - Vedanta Resources aims to cut down its debt by $3 billion over the next three years. The demerger will lead to the creation of six specialized companies, each focusing on a distinct sector: aluminium, oil & gas, power, steel and ferrous materials, base metals, and the all-encompassing Vedanta Limited.\n\nThe demerger is expected to unlock greater operational efficiency for Vedanta's individual units. For instance, Vedanta Steel and Ferrous Materials will likely benefit from India's booming infrastructure and construction sectors, driving higher steel demand. With specialized focus, each new entity could become more agile and competitive in its respective market. Investors should keep an eye on these developments as the demerger could lead to enhanced market performance for the units.\n\nThe bigger picture: A bold step towards financial stability.\n\nThis strategic split is not just about corporate restructuring; it's a significant move towards achieving financial stability and reducing hefty debt loads. Vedanta's aim to decrease its debt by $3 billion in the next three years is ambitious but could set a strong foundation for future growth. With India's largest aluminium producer and zinc producer under its belt, the new entities have a solid base and market leadership to leverage in their respective domains. This demerger could also serve as a blueprint for other conglomerates facing similar financial and operational challenges globally.", "source": {"uri": "finimize.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Finimize"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demerger", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Demerger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vedanta", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vedanta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creditor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Creditor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_sector_of_the_economy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Secondary sector of the economy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferrous", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ferrous"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Steel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vedanta_Limited", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vedanta Limited"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_metal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Base metal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vedanta_Resources", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vedanta Resources"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privatization", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Privatization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fossil_fuel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fossil fuel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aluminium", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aluminium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restructuring", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Restructuring"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conglomerate_(company)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Conglomerate (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zinc", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Zinc"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/International_Business_and_Trade/Import_and_Export", "label": "dmoz/Business/International Business and Trade/Import and Export", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/E-Commerce/Marketplaces", "label": "dmoz/Business/E-Commerce/Marketplaces", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://finimize-img.imgix.net/https%3A%2F%2Fchivas-assets.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com%2Fstatic%2Fimages%2Fdefault_prefix-img-OqOfyRcOaIgMwowH4W5VnTvX.png?ixlib=python-3.1.2&s=ec1de7fb45a60a41451ed4eafc3ddc7b", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9776108", "eventUri": "eng-9776108", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1058823529411765, "wgt": 205, "relevance": 1}

The India VIX, an indicator of market volatility, fell 0.5 per cent to 12.88 points.\n\nGlobal market cues remained stable. In the US, a decline in big tech stocks overshadowed gains in the broader markets, with the S&P 500 ending in the red while the Dow Jones and Nasdaq closed in the green. Asian markets traded within a familiar range, not moving too high or going too low.\n\nAhead of the opening bell in India, here's a look at stocks to watch:\n\nGAIL: GAIL (India) Ltd reported a 77.5 per cent rise in consolidated net profit to Rs 3,183.35 crore for the first quarter of fiscal year 2024-25, up from Rs 1,792.99 crore a year ago.

This demand is based on disallowances and additions imposed in previous years, which Hindustan Zinc had previously contested successfully before the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal.\n\nIndus Towers: The company approved a buyback of its equity shares along with its June quarter results. Indus Towers will repurchase up to 5.67 crore equity shares, or 2.1 per cent of the total equity, for a total consideration of Rs 2,640 crore.\n\nTorrent Power: Torrent Power has established a wholly-owned subsidiary, Torrent Urja 18 Private Limited, to produce and sell hydrogen and its byproducts, such as ammonia and natural gas. The subsidiary will also generate and trade renewable energy, including hydrogen-based power.\n\nVedanta: Vedanta announced that 75 per cent of its secured creditors have approved its demerger scheme. The company will now seek clearance from stock exchanges and file the scheme with the National Company Law Tribunal. Post-demerger, Vedanta will have six independent entities: Vedanta Aluminium, Vedanta Oil & Gas, Vedanta Power, Vedanta Steel and Ferrous Materials, Vedanta Base Metals, and Vedanta Limited.\n\nTata Consumer: Tata Consumer Products Ltd, which owns Tetley tea and Ching's Secret noodles, reported a consolidated net profit of Rs 290 crore for the first quarter of fiscal year 2024-25, down 8.5 per cent from Rs 317 crore a year ago.

Its gross debt was \u20b971,759 crore, of which 82% in Indian rupees, and the rest in foreign currency. The company has term debt of \u20b969,062 crore, a working capital loan of \u20b91,159 crore and short-term borrowings of \u20b91,538 crore.\n\nThe natural resources major had announced this demerger in September last year, and intends to form six companies, each of which will house its different businesses - aluminium, power, oil and gas, base metals and steel.\n\n\"Demerger of our businesses will lead to the creation of 6 strong companies, each a Vedanta in its own right. This will unlock massive value,\" chairman Anil Agarwal said at the company's annual general meeting earlier this month. \"Each demerged entity will chart their own course but will follow Vedanta's core values, its enterprising spirit and global leadership,\" he said.\n\nAgarwal has reiterated that the demerger is on track to be completed by December.\n\nEarlier this month, the company raised Rs 8,500 crore through its first ever Qualified Institutional Placement, allocating shares at Rs 440 a piece. On Tuesday, shares of Vedanta closed at Rs 447.20 on the NSE, down 0.4% from the previous close.\n\nVedanta is in talks to prepay a loan of Rs 7,000 crore which it had borrowed from Union Bank of India through the proceeds of the QIP offering. The loan was due next year and had some covenants.\n\n\"The proceeds from the QIP will be used to continue to de-leverage Vedanta Limited balance sheet and to help deliver the Company's $10 billion EBITDA targets in the near term,\" the company said in a statement.", "source": {"uri": "economictimes.indiatimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Economic Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canara_Bank", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Canara Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_Maharashtra", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bank of Maharashtra"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Overseas_Bank", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indian Overseas Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punjab_National_Bank", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Punjab National Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_Bank_of_India", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Union Bank of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vedanta", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vedanta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_Baroda", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bank of Baroda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_Bank_of_India", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "State Bank of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_rupee", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indian rupee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crore", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Crore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICICI_Bank", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "ICICI Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HDFC_Bank", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "HDFC Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axis_Bank", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Axis Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Company_Law_Tribunal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Company Law Tribunal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_exchange", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stock exchange"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_resource", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Natural resource"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State-owned_enterprise", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "State-owned enterprise"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_sector", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Public sector"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currency", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Currency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vedanta_Limited", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vedanta Limited"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Stock_Exchange_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Stock Exchange of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fossil_fuel", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fossil fuel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balance_sheet", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Balance sheet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aluminium", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aluminium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steel", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Steel"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Banking_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Banking Services", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Investment_Banks", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Investment Banks", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Holding_Companies", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Holding Companies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Auctions/Boats", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Auctions/Boats", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-112154488,width-1200,height-630,imgsize-38150,overlay-etmarkets/photo.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9776108", "eventUri": "eng-9776108", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 165, "relevance": 1}

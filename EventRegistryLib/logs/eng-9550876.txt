Here's What Homebuyers and Sellers Should Know", "body": "The Multiple Listing Service (MLS) is an essential tool in the real estate market, acting as a comprehensive database created and managed by real estate professionals to help clients buy and sell property more effectively. Here's what homebuyers and sellers should know about the MLS:\n\nThe MLS is a service real estate agents use to post home listings to ensure broad market exposure. This database is highly regulated and provides detailed, up-to-date data about properties for sale, including photographs, features, pricing, and market availability.\n\nAccess to the MLS is exclusive to real estate professionals who pay for membership and agree to adhere to a specific set of rules designed to protect the integrity and accuracy of the data. While the public can view some MLS listings through various online real estate sites, such as Zillow, full access is limited to licensed members, which includes brokers and agents.\n\nFor Sellers: Listing a property on the MLS ensures that it reaches the widest audience of potential buyers. This exposure increases the chances of receiving competitive offers, potentially driving up the final sale price.\n\nFor Buyers: The MLS provides access to a vast array of properties in multiple regions, allowing buyers to explore numerous options, compare market prices, and find homes that match their specific needs.\n\nMLS databases are updated frequently, often in real-time, ensuring that the information is current. This reduces the risk of falling in love with a property that is no longer available, a common issue on less regulated platforms.\n\nReal estate agents leverage the MLS to gather detailed property information to advise their clients accurately. They can perform comparative market analysis, access historical data, and utilize advanced search features that are not available to the general public.\n\nThe MLS is not a single entity but a collection of over 800 regional databases. Each has its own rules and membership fees, and while they often share data, discrepancies can exist.\n\nThe Multiple Listing Service (MLS) is a crucial tool for real estate professionals, but it's not the only resource available for buying or selling properties. Here are some alternatives to the MLS that homebuyers and sellers should consider:\n\nUnderstanding the MLS and how it functions can significantly enhance the buying or selling process, providing both buyers and sellers with valuable insights and exposure to ensure informed decisions and successful real estate transactions.", "source": {"uri": "gobankingrates.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GOBankingRates"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Soccer", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Major League Soccer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_estate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Real estate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_estate_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Real estate agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_listing_service", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Multiple listing service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broker", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Broker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zillow", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Zillow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/License", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "License"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_analysis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Market analysis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leverage_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Leverage (finance)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Real_Estate", "label": "dmoz/Business/Real Estate", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Real_Estate/Marketing_and_Advertising", "label": "dmoz/Business/Real Estate/Marketing and Advertising", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Real_Estate", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Real Estate", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Real_Estate/Agents_and_Agencies", "label": "dmoz/Business/Real Estate/Agents and Agencies", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Agriculture_and_Forestry/Farm_Real_Estate", "label": "dmoz/Business/Agriculture and Forestry/Farm Real Estate", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 84}], "image": "https://cdn.gobankingrates.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/model-house-coins-real-estate-investing-concept_iStock-817726962.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550876", "eventUri": "eng-9550876", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2784313725490195, "wgt": 189, "relevance": 1}

Next to the stadium are two well-kept practice fields.\n\nIt's all surrounded by those tall pine trees with the sun setting behind them on a picture-perfect night at kickoff for a Southern States SC versus Dothan United exhibition match. It's a tight-knit community, but one that is buzzing at the news that was two years in the making.\n\nSouthern States was recently announced as an MLS Next expansion club. It's the first in Mississippi and will begin play next year.\n\n\"MLS Next was probably the biggest part of that plan purely for the reason that we get to play against the best teams in the country - with a little bit more travel - but we get to play against the best players in the country,\" Southern States strategic partnerships consultant Danny Reynolds said.\n\nMLS Next is not to be confused with MLS Next Pro.\n\nMLS Next is a youth developmental league, while MLS Next Pro is a professional league similar to that of a AAA minor league baseball team. Most MLS Next Pro teams have MLS affiliates, while most MLS Next clubs don't.\n\nMLS Next fields 677 teams for the 2023-24 season between the United States and Canada. Its divisions range from U-13 to U-19, though Southern States will only have teams at U-13, U-14 and U-15 that will debut in 2024-25. Reynolds said Southern States hopes to be granted the full-player pathway next year, meaning having MLS Next teams from U-13 to U-19.\n\n\"It's the highest youth league in America,\" Reynolds said. \"You're going to play against the best.\"\n\nCavan Sullivan, for example, was part of the Philadelphia Union's MLS Next system.

Carl Reynolds, Danny's brother and the director of player development, is a former All-American at William Carey.\n\nSouthern States is one of eight expansion clubs for the 2024-25 season.\n\nDanny Reynolds said MLS Next status will mostly help with exposure. Sullivan's case is a more extreme example, but players in the community will have better opportunities to play collegiately, too.\n\n\"It's going to increase the exposure in Mississippi and it's going to increase the exposure in the southern states area,\" he said. \"A big thing is that college coaches don't normally come to Mississippi to recruit. With an MLS Next team, now college coaches are going to have to come to Mississippi to recruit, otherwise they're missing some of the very, very good players that we have.\"\n\nSam Sklar is the Southern Miss beat reporter for the Hattiesburg American.

Valued at \u00a36 million more and ranked at 31st is Guadalajara (\u00a3568.12m).\n\n30-21 AS Roma above Ajax and West Ham\n\nThe Most Valuable Football Clubs - 30-21\n\nRank\n\nTeam\n\nLeague\n\nValuation\n\n30.\n\nPortland Timber\n\nMLS\n\n\u00a3572.12m\n\n29.\n\nDC United\n\nMLS\n\n\u00a3576.12m\n\n28.\n\nToronto FC\n\nMLS\n\n\u00a3580.12m\n\n27.\n\nWest Ham United\n\nPremier League\n\n\u00a3580.12m\n\n26.\n\nAjax\n\nEredivisie\n\n\u00a3592.13m\n\n25.\n\nClub America\n\nLiga MX\n\n\u00a3600.13m\n\n24.\n\nAS Roma\n\nSerie A\n\n\u00a3616.13m\n\n23.\n\nLyon\n\nLigue 1\n\n\u00a3624.13m\n\n22.\n\nSeattle Sounders\n\nMLS\n\n\u00a3636.14m\n\n21.\n\nAustin FC\n\nMLS\n\n\u00a3640.14m\n\nThe plethora of high-valued MLS teams does not dwindle as Portland Timber, valued at \u00a3572.12m, is 30th, while DC United (\u00a3576.12m) and Toronto FC (\u00a3580.12m) are 29th and 28th, respectively.\n\nThe first non-MLS side of this category is east London-based outfit West Ham United, whose value is the same as Toronto FC. West Ham, who are regular fixtures in the Premier League, were victorious in last term's rendition of the Europa Conference League and their accounts would have seen a sizeable boost for the continental exploits.\n\nEredivisie's Ajax, the most recognisable team from the Netherlands, are valued ever so slightly higher than West Ham at \u00a3592.13m but are worth less than \u00a3600.13m-worth Club America, who play their football in Liga MX. Roma, Lyon and MLS duo Seattle Sounders and Austin FC round off the category.\n\n20-11 Inter and AC Milan separated by \u00a3110m\n\nThe Most Valuable Football Clubs - 50-41\n\nRank\n\nTeam\n\nLeague\n\nValuation\n\n20.\n\nNew York City FC\n\nMLS\n\n\u00a3672.14m\n\n19.\n\nLA Galaxy\n\nMLS\n\n\u00a3800m\n\n18.\n\nInter Miami\n\nMLS\n\n\u00a3820m\n\n17.\n\nAtlanta United\n\nMLS\n\n\u00a3840m\n\n16.\n\nInter Milan\n\nSerie A\n\n\u00a3850m\n\n15.\n\nLos Angeles FC\n\nMLS\n\n\u00a3920m\n\n14.\n\nAC Milan\n\nSerie A\n\n\u00a3960m\n\n13.\n\nAtletico Madrid\n\nLa Liga\n\n\u00a31.30bn\n\n12.\n\nBorussia Dortmund\n\nBundesliga\n\n\u00a31.31bn\n\n11.\n\nJuventus\n\nSerie A\n\n\u00a31.42bn\n\nHalf of the teams in this category ply their trade in the MLS - and, at first glance, that may be surprising. However, MLS clubs are boosted by factors such as \"cost controls, modern stadiums and a single-entity structure that fosters ownership collaboration\". New York City FC (\u00a3672.14m) and LA Galaxy (\u00a3800m) kick off this section but are quickly followed by Inter Miami, whose \u00a3820m can be largely attributed to Lionel Messi's arrival.\n\nThe pair from the Italian capital, AC and Inter Milan, despite sharing the same city, have their differences in valuation. On this occasion, the bragging rights go to AC Milan - valued at \u00a3960m - despite their blue counterparts reaching the Champions League semi-final last season.\n\nBased on Sportico's MLS team valuations from January, 15th-ranked Los Angeles FC, who are sandwiched between the Milan duo, is the highest-valued club among those residing in the United States - with them being valued at \u00a3920m. Atletico Madrid (\u00a31.30bn), Borussia Dortmund (\u00a31.31bn), a side who recently reached the final of the 2023/24 Champions League, and Juventus (\u00a31.42bn) are the trident of European behemoths that round off the section overseeing the 20-11.\n\nRelated How Much Referees are Paid in Europe's Top Five Leagues and MLS Premier League referees could potentially make nearly three times as much as some Bundesliga officials. 10-1 Includes six clubs from the Premier League\n\nThe Most Valuable Football Clubs - 50-41\n\nRank\n\nTeam\n\nLeague\n\nValuation\n\n10.\n\nChelsea\n\nPremier League\n\n\u00a32.78bn\n\n9.\n\nTottenham Hotspur\n\nPremier League\n\n\u00a32.79bn\n\n8.\n\nArsenal\n\nPremier League\n\n\u00a33.13bn\n\n7.\n\nParis Saint-Germain\n\nLigue 1\n\n\u00a33.24bn\n\n6.\n\nManchester City\n\nPremier League\n\n\u00a33.80bn\n\n5.\n\nBayern Munich\n\nBundesliga\n\n\u00a33.84bn\n\n4.\n\nLiverpool\n\nPremier League\n\n\u00a34.09bn\n\n3.\n\nBarcelona\n\nLa Liga\n\n\u00a34.22bn\n\n2.\n\nReal Madrid\n\nLa Liga\n\n\u00a34.85bn\n\n1.\n\nManchester United\n\nPremier League\n\n\u00a34.96bn\n\nStarting off with Premier League trio Chelsea, Tottenham Hotspur - who will be financially boosted by potential Champions League qualification - and Arsenal, who are ranked 10th, 9th and 8th, respectively, a clear pattern begins to emerge. Unsurprisingly, the top 10 is largely controlled by teams who reside in the English top flight.\n\nNext up in seventh are Qatar-owned French outfit Paris Saint-Germain, whose main revenue comes thanks to them being perennial winners of Ligue 1. Current holders of the Premier League and Champions League, Manchester City, are valued slightly higher than PSG at \u00a33.80bn and are only poised to become more valuable as they continue to add more silverware to their well-stacked cabinet.\n\nFar and away as the Bundesliga's best-valued club is, by no surprise, Bayern Munich. Despite not retaining their status as German champions this season, the magnitude of the Bavarians stands them in good stead in this list - stationed in 5th at \u00a33.84bn.\n\nRelated 30 Best Football Teams in the World Ranked Man City, Real Madrid, Liverpool and Bayern Munich all feature as the 30 best teams in world football are ranked by data analysts.\n\nLiverpool are ranked fourth with a valuation of \u00a34.09bn but are still worth less than Barcelona and Real Madrid, two of the world's most recognised sides. Los Blancos (\u00a34.85bn) take second spot while the Catalan outfit will have to settle for third with a value of \u00a34.22bn.\n\nIt is, however, 13-time Premier League champions, Manchester United, who are currently crowned as the most valuable asset in the world of football at a staggering \u00a34.96bn. Despite the Red Devils' on-the-pitch struggles, they are so commercially robust that they'll always be nearing the summit of these lists.\n\nAll figures per Sportico - correct as of 08/05/2024",

Many of the newer, Western Conference teams have soccer-specific stadiums, whereas several prominent clubs, like New England Revolution, must use an NFL stadium. Ranking the best of the current choices might be a matter of opinion, but ultimately, some stadiums are simply better than others.\n\nHere's a breakdown of 90min's top MLS stadiums in the 2024 season.\n\nCheck out the four best MLS stadiums across the Eastern and Western Conferences.\n\nMercedes-Benz Stadium was constructed in 2017 and is the home to 2018 MLS Cup Champions, Atlanta United. Out of the 29 teams and stadiums in the league, the Mercedes-Benz is always electric, and even briefly held the attendance record for an MLS game thanks to its NFL-level capacity.\n\nUnlike the MLS stadiums built solely for soccer teams, though, the Mercedes-Benz stadium also hosts NFL and College Football games, making some seats in the large stadium undesirable seats for watching soccer.\n\nBMO Stadium is one of the newest soccer-specific stadiums in the MLS. Built solely for a world-class soccer viewing and playing experience, the stadium offers a prime location for Los Angeles-based fans. Most importantly, though, the stadium features a grass playing surface, greatly diminishing the possibility of serious injuries that often occur on turf.\n\nProvidence Park is an elite MLS stadium located in Portland, Oregon. Of all the previous MLS Cup Championship matches, the Portland Timbers' home field against NYCFC was a sight to behold. Although the squad lost in penalties that night, they will always remember how galvanizing the crowd was throughout the match.\n\nLike Mercedes-Benz Stadium, Providence Park unfortunately still has artificial turf. In fact, it is the only soccer-specific stadium in the MLS that does not have a grass field.\n\nThe newest MLS expansion team, St. Louis City S.C., has arguably the best soccer-specific stadium in the MLS. CityPark, built in 2022, resembles plenty of Premier League stadiums across England, and is only getting better as the season continues. According to Tom Timmermann of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, the club is installing new grass to keep the playing surface as pristine as possible for the rest of the 2024 season.", "source": {"uri": "90min.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "90min.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Soccer", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Major League Soccer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MLS_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "MLS Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soccer-specific_stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Soccer-specific stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England_Revolution", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New England Revolution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Conference_(MLS)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Western Conference (MLS)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercedes-Benz", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mercedes-Benz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_men's_national_soccer_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States men's national soccer team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMO_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "BMO Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_United_FC", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta United FC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercedes-Benz_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mercedes-Benz Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Providence_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Providence Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CityPark", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CityPark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portland_Timbers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Portland Timbers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expansion_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Expansion team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City_FC", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York City FC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis_Post-Dispatch", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "St. Louis Post-Dispatch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "England national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_turf", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Artificial turf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_shoot-out_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Penalty shoot-out (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "St. Louis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "St. Louis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portland,_Oregon", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Portland, Oregon"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Portland, Oregon"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONCACAF", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONCACAF", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Stadiums", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Stadiums", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Greyhound_Racing/Tracks", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Greyhound Racing/Tracks", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_4217,h_2372,x_0,y_0/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/90min_en_international_web/01hwtjk1yhrf5sh62bd4.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550876", "eventUri": "eng-9550876", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.419607843137255, "wgt": 172, "relevance": 1}

Nowadays, having lost that explosive pace from his younger days, how does the Argentinian icon compare to the best dribblers in MLS?\n\nHe may no longer be the fastest player around, but Messi's close control remains a thing of wonder - and has seen him dribble past hapless MLS defenders time and again this season.\n\nHere are the 10 players that have completed the most successful dribbles in the 2024 MLS season.\n\nMessi only just sneaks into the top 10, but it's impressive that he does given that he's only started seven of Inter Miami's 12 games so far this season, with fewer minutes than anyone else that features here.\n\nThe eight-time Ballon d'Or winner averages a successful dribble every 33 minutes, which is a rate comparable to the names at the top end of this list.\n\nREAD: The 10 players with the most goals and assists in MLS in 2024: Can anyone catch Lionel Messi?\n\nHouston Dynamo's 22-year-old Nigerian winger is a talent worth keeping an eye out for.\n\nHe signed for a reported \u20ac2million fee from Croatian outfit Lokomotiva Zagreb last year and looks set to play a starring role under Ben Olsen this season. We wouldn't be surprised to see him get a first senior Super Eagles call up sooner or later.\n\nThe experienced Sweden international, formerly a long-serving stalwart for RB Leipzig, is now turning out for their sister club, New York Red Bulls.\n\nForsberg has made a solid start in his debut MLS season, having notched three goals and two assists from his first nine appearances for the club. Twenty-two successful dribbles from just 46 attempted isn't bad going, either.\n\nREAD NEXT: The 10 oldest players in MLS 2024 feat. forgotten Barca man & two ex Premier League stalwarts...\n\nTRY A QUIZ: The Ultimate Lionel Messi Quiz: 30 tough questions to test your knowledge of the GOAT\n\nBack in March, the Colombian winger produced a statement performance in Real Salt Lake's 3-0 victory over LAFC, scoring twice and setting up the other.\n\nHe was unplayable that night, notching five successful dribbles alongside his direct goal contributions. Gomez has completed 22 dribbles in total.\n\nLAFC's Gabon international loves to drive at the opposition - an approach that's helped yield a respectable tally of six goals and two assists so far this season.\n\nBut his dribbling comes with limited success. He's also notched 49 unsuccessful dribbles this season, the most of any player in MLS, while his 31% rate of success is comfortably the lowest of any player in this top 10.\n\nA fan favourite at Portland Timbers, Colombian attacking midfielder had been linked with the likes of Leeds United and Rangers before he signed for the MLS outfit in 2021.\n\n\"He is a player that we believe can provide an impact in multiple positions in the attack,\" promised Timbers president Gavin Wilkinson when the deal was announced.\n\n\"We are excited to continue supporting his development, and see him becoming an important contributor to the club.\"\n\nWe're certainly seeing evidence of that now.\n\nYet another South American - six of this top 10 hail from the continent - we'd be surprised if Uruguay boss Marcelo Bielsa hasn't fastidiously studied every minute of Rodriguez's 11 MLS appearances for New York City FC this season.\n\nThe 24-year-old is yet to make his senior international debut, but Bielsa could do worse than giving him a closer look. You imagine he'd love nothing more than to represent his country when the United States hosts the Copa America this summer.\n\nPart of Argentina's World Cup-winning squad, Almada is the poster boy for a new breed of rising MLS stars that undoubtedly possess the quality to shine in the more traditional powerhouse leagues across the Atlantic.\n\nBut the 23-year-old is enjoying himself at Atlanta United, now into his third season, and doesn't appear to be in any rush to sign for a European club.\n\nThere's a simple efficiency about Almada's game, too. His 31 successful dribbles have come from just 49 attempts - that success rate of 63% is comfortably the best of any player in this top 10.\n\nNo player in MLS in 2024 has attempted more dribbles (77) than FC Cincinnati's Argentinian wizard.\n\nLike Bouanga, his success rate isn't the best - just 42% - but he's undoubtedly one of the most dynamic and watchable MLS players on his day. There's end product, too.\n\nThe 29-year-old has also notched five goals and five assists in his last 10 appearances and is invariably Cincinnati's standout player.\n\nYou'll no doubt remember the midfielder from his role in Italy's Euro 2020 victory over England, or his peak years winning back-to-back Scudetti with Juventus.\n\nBernardeschi isn't your average European star in MLS, having joined FC Toronto as a 28-year-old back in 2022.\n\nStill somewhere around his physical peak and making the most of it. Bernardeschi has been the MLS dribble king so far in 2024, averaging a successful dribble every 29 minutes.", "source": {"uri": "planetfootball.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Planet Football"},

For comparison, The Crown had averaged 1.26 and 1.24 points per game in the last two seasons.\n\nSmith is still relatively new to the job, and he will hope to substantially improve on this record in order to show that he was the right person to take the club forward.\n\nCementing a spot in the top seven of the Eastern Conference and guaranteeing his side a place in the MLS Cup Playoffs would go a long way to proving this.\n\n\u00a9 Reuters\n\nCharlotte's recent form has been mixed, having lost three of their last five including a defeat in early April to New England, who sit bottom of their table in 15th place.\n\nSmith's side have won two matches in this time, a hectic 3-2 victory against third-placed Toronto from the Western Conference on April 14, and a comfortable 2-0 win against Portland Timbers last weekend.\n\nInterestingly, while just four sides in the Eastern Conference have scored fewer than their 12 goals, Smith's team have scored half of their total in the last four games.\n\nAlthough Charlotte have been inconsistent overall this season, their home record has been impressive, winning four out of six MLS games this season and only losing twice in their last 21 home league matches.\n\nAs for Nashville, while they won their most recent fixture against Montreal, they come into the game with just two wins in their last 11 matches, and only one win from their last six MLS games.\n\n\u00a9 Reuters\n\nAdditionally, they have also failed to keep a clean sheet in nine of their 10 MLS matchups this season, and have only kept the opposition from scoring in nine of their last 43 league fixtures.\n\nThough Nashville have only played three times away from home in MLS they have conceded nine times, scoring just twice, and are yet to win on the road.\n\nHowever, given that the away side already defeated Charlotte 2-1 in mid-March, perhaps manager Gary Smith should have reason for optimism.\n\nNashville are just three points behind Charlotte, and with a game in hand, victory on Sunday could help them to build momentum following their win last time out, and help put them in a promising position for the second half of the season as they aim to qualify for the MLS Cup Playoffs.\n\nCharlotte FC Major League Soccer form: D L W L L W\n\nNashville SC Major League Soccer form: L D L L D W\n\nTeam News\n\n\u00a9 Reuters\n\nCharlotte's injury list is not particularly extensive, with Benjamin Bender ruled out due to a knee injury.\n\nElsewhere, Brandon Cambridge will also be absent on Sunday as he recovers from an ankle issue, while forward Liel Abada and defender Bill Tuiloma are doubts for the game as they both nurse thigh injuries.\n\nStriker Kerwin Calderon Vargas can be expected to return after missing out on his team's victory last weekend due to suspension.\n\nAs for the away side, Nashville will once again be without centre-back Lukas MacNaughton, who underwent ankle surgery in late April.\n\nAdditionally, Tyler Boyd and Shaq Moore are doubts for the match with hip injuries, and it remains to be seen whether centre-back and captain Walker Zimmerman will start for a second time in a row since returning from the knee issue he suffered in early March against Inter Miami.\n\nCharlotte FC possible starting lineup:\n\nKahlina; Uronen, Privett, Malanda, Byrne; Urso, Petkovic, Westwood; Dejaegere, Copetti, Vargas\n\nNashville SC possible starting lineup:\n\nWillis; Muyl, Bauer, Zimmerman, Maher, Shaffelburg; Yearwood, Godoy, Davis; Mukhtar, Surridge\n\nWe say: Charlotte FC 1-1 Nashville SC\n\nNashville's struggle to keep clean sheets could prove to be problematic against Charlotte, but captain Zimmerman could be key to marshalling their defence.\n\nOn the other hand, Charlotte have had difficulties in front of goal, and it remains to be seen whether their recent increased output is reflective of genuine, sustained improvement under Dean Smith.\n\nFor data analysis of the most likely results, scorelines and more

The Canadian government would subsidize a portion of the capital cost.\n\nHonda has a manufacturing plant in Alliston, Ontario, about an hour's drive north of Toronto, where it puts together Honda CR-V and Civic models. The company makes hybrid vehicles at factories in Ohio and Indiana, according to its website, and it plans to start manufacturing its first US-made fully electric vehicles in Marysville, Ohio next year.\n\nThe Honda investment comes at an anxious moment for the auto sector, with consumer adoption of electric vehicles playing out slowly in some regions because of high prices and a shortage of charging stations. Tesla Inc. is cutting more than 10 per cent of its global workforce, Chinese producer BYD Co. reported a sharp drop in deliveries of electric vehicles in the first quarter, and other automakers have delayed EV investments.\n\nStill, manufacturers are making long-term bets. Last month, Honda and Nissan Motor Co. announced a plan to collaborate on technology for battery-based electric vehicles, including software, as they seek to keep up with Chinese rivals.\n\nThe negotiations between Honda and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's government have taken many months and centred on investment tax credits, or ITCs, as the means by which the government will help pay for the capital costs of the factories. It will differ from the agreements Canada struck last year with Volkswagen, Chrysler parent Stellantis and Sweden's Northvolt, the people said; those companies were offered billions of dollars over a period of years to subsidize battery production.\n\nEV ECOSYSTEM\n\nTrudeau's government will tout the Honda deal as a success story directly related to those contracts, one government official said. Those agreements created an ecosystem around Canada's EV supply chain, attracting other auto firms and allowing the government to transition to its own system of tax incentives, officials within the Trudeau administration will say.\n\nIn this case, the primary incentive, called the clean technology manufacturing ITC, provides a refundable tax credit for 30 per cent of equipment costs. Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland's budget last week also introduced a new tax credit that would apply to 10 per cent of the cost of buildings used for electric vehicle manufacturing -- if a company has significant portions of its EV supply chain within Canada.\n\nFreeland was closely involved in the Honda negotiations and the new EV tax credit was specifically geared to landing the Japanese firm, according to people familiar with the discussions, though other EV companies will also qualify if they build enough of their supply chain in Canada.\n\nThe Honda deal doesn't include ongoing production subsidies of the type received by Volkswagen and Stellantis, according to people who spoke with Bloomberg about it. They declined to divulge the total estimated cost of government support.\n\nEarlier this year, the Japanese news outlet Nikkei reported that Honda was considering a US $14 billion investment in Canada, but hadn't made a decision yet. A spokesperson for Honda in Canada did not reply to a request for comment Sunday.\n\nKEEPING UP WITH U.S.\n\nTrudeau's government has argued that large taxpayer support for automakers is necessary to ensure that Canada maintains its share of the North American auto business after U.S. President Joe Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act into law in 2022, providing financial help for firms building EVs in the US.\n\nRead More: Subsidy Wars Heat Up With US Allies Forced to Pay Up or Lose Out\n\nThe auto sector is particularly important to Ontario, Canada's largest province by population and home to assembly plants owned by Ford Motor Co., General Motors Co., Toyota Motor Corp., and Stellantis, as well as scores of parts suppliers.\n\n\"The windows of opportunity for this kind of thing are short,\" Industry Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne told Bloomberg in a recent interview discussing last year's subsidy deals. He said the government had to act after the US enacted the Inflation Reduction Act, or risk losing the plants south of the border. \"That window was there and we seized it.\"\n\nStellantis and partner LG Energy Solution are in the middle of building a battery plant in Windsor, Ontario, across the border from Detroit. Volkswagen's proposed site is southwest of Toronto and Northvolt's is near Montreal. Canada's subsidy packages for those companies are being partially paid by provincial governments in Ontario and Quebec.", "source": {"uri": "canada.autonews.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

A spokesperson for Honda in Canada did not reply to a request for comment Sunday.\n\nKEEPING UP WITH U.S.\n\nTrudeau's government has argued that large taxpayer support for automakers is necessary to ensure that Canada maintains its share of the North American auto business after U.S. President Joe Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act into law in 2022, providing financial help for firms building EVs in the US.\n\nThe auto sector is particularly important to Ontario, Canada's largest province by population and home to assembly plants owned by Ford Motor Co., General Motors, Toyota Motor Corp., and Stellantis, as well as scores of suppliers.\n\n\"The windows of opportunity for this kind of thing are short,\" Industry Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne told Bloomberg in a recent interview discussing last year's subsidy deals. He said the government had to act after the U.S. enacted the Inflation Reduction Act, or risk losing the plants south of the border. \"That window was there and we seized it.\"\n\nStellantis and partner LG Energy Solution are in the middle of building a battery plant in Windsor, Ontario, across the border from Detroit. Volkswagen's proposed site is southwest of Toronto and Northvolt's is near Montreal. Canada's subsidy packages for those companies are being partially paid by provincial governments in Ontario and Quebec.", "source": {"uri": "autonews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Automotive

The Canadian government would subsidize a portion of the capital cost.\n\nHonda has a manufacturing plant in Alliston, Ontario, about an hour's drive north of Toronto, where it puts together Honda CR-V and Civic models. The company makes hybrid vehicles at factories in Ohio and Indiana, according to its website, and it plans to start manufacturing its first US-made fully electric vehicles in Marysville, Ohio next year.\n\nThe Honda investment comes at an anxious moment for the auto sector, with consumer adoption of electric vehicles playing out slowly in some regions because of high prices and a shortage of charging stations. Tesla Inc. is cutting more than 10% of its global workforce, Chinese producer BYD Co. reported a sharp drop in deliveries of electric vehicles in the first quarter, and other automakers have delayed EV investments.\n\nStill, manufacturers are making long-term bets. Last month, Honda and Nissan Motor Co. announced a plan to collaborate on technology for battery-based electric vehicles, including software, as they seek to keep up with Chinese rivals.\n\nThe negotiations between Honda and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's government have taken many months and centred on investment tax credits, or ITCs, as the means by which the government will help pay for the capital costs of the factories. It will differ from the agreements Canada struck last year with Volkswagen AG, Chrysler parent Stellantis NV and Sweden's Northvolt AB, the people said; those companies were offered billions of dollars over a period of years to subsidize battery production.\n\nTrudeau's government will tout the Honda deal as a success story directly related to those contracts, one government official said. Those agreements created an ecosystem around Canada's EV supply chain, attracting other auto firms and allowing the government to transition to its own system of tax incentives, officials within the Trudeau administration will say.\n\nIn this case, the primary incentive called the clean technology manufacturing ITC, provides a refundable tax credit for 30% of equipment costs. Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland's budget last week also introduced a new tax credit that would apply to 10% of the cost of buildings used for electric vehicle manufacturing -- if a company has significant portions of its EV supply chain within Canada.\n\nFreeland was closely involved in the Honda negotiations and the new EV tax credit was specifically geared to landing the Japanese firm, according to people familiar with the discussions, though other EV companies will also qualify if they build enough of their supply chain in Canada.\n\nThe Honda deal doesn't include ongoing production subsidies of the type received by Volkswagen and Stellantis, according to people who spoke with Bloomberg about it.

The Canadian government would subsidize a portion of the capital cost.\n\nHonda has a manufacturing plant in Alliston, Ontario, about an hour's drive north of Toronto, where it puts together Honda CR-V and Civic models. The company makes hybrid vehicles at factories in Ohio and Indiana, according to its website, and it plans to start manufacturing its first US-made fully electric vehicles in Marysville, Ohio next year.\n\nThe Honda investment comes at an anxious moment for the auto sector, with consumer adoption of electric vehicles playing out slowly in some regions because of high prices and a shortage of charging stations. Tesla Inc. is cutting more than 10% of its global workforce, Chinese producer BYD Co. reported a sharp drop in deliveries of electric vehicles in the first quarter, and other automakers have delayed EV investments.\n\nBig Take: Tesla Is Consumed by Chaos in Shift to Musk's Robotaxi Dream\n\nStill, manufacturers are making long-term bets.

The company makes hybrid vehicles at factories in Ohio and Indiana, according to its website, and it plans to start manufacturing its first U.S.-made fully electric vehicles in Marysville, Ohio next year.\n\nThe Honda investment comes at an anxious moment for the auto sector, with consumer adoption of electric vehicles playing out slowly in some regions because of high prices and a shortage of charging stations. Tesla Inc. is cutting more than 10% of its global workforce, Chinese producer BYD Co. reported a sharp drop in deliveries of electric vehicles in the first quarter, and other automakers have delayed EV investments.\n\nStill, manufacturers are making long-term bets. Last month, Honda and Nissan Motor Co. announced a plan to collaborate on technology for battery-based electric vehicles, including software, as they seek to keep up with Chinese rivals.\n\nHours after Bloomberg News reported the agreement, Ontario Premier Doug Ford appeared to confirm it, though he didn't mention Honda by name. \"This week we landed a new deal,\" he said Monday at a conference in Toronto. \"It'll be the largest deal in Canadian history. It'll be double the size of Volkswagen. So stay tuned, I'll be announcing it this week.\"\n\nFord was referring to a C$7 billion ($5.1 billion) Volkswagen AG battery assembly plant announced last year for southern Ontario.\n\nThe negotiations between Honda and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's government have taken many months and centered on investment tax credits, or ITCs, as the means by which the government will help pay for the capital costs of the factories. It will differ from the agreements Canada struck last year with Volkswagen, Chrysler parent Stellantis NV and Sweden's Northvolt AB, the people said; those companies were offered billions of dollars over a period of years to subsidize battery production.\n\nTrudeau's government will tout the Honda deal as a success story directly related to those contracts, one government official said. Those agreements created an ecosystem around Canada's EV supply chain, attracting other auto firms and allowing the government to transition to its own system of tax incentives, officials within the Trudeau administration will say.\n\n'Windows of opportunity'\n\nThe government's primary incentive, called the clean technology manufacturing ITC, provides a refundable tax credit for 30% of equipment costs. Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland's budget last week also introduced a new tax credit that would apply to 10% of the cost of buildings used for electric vehicle manufacturing - if a company has significant portions of its EV supply chain within Canada.\n\nFreeland was closely involved in the Honda negotiations and the new EV tax credit was specifically geared to landing the Japanese firm, according to people familiar with the discussions, though other EV companies will also qualify if they build enough of their supply chain in Canada.\n\nThe Honda deal doesn't include ongoing production subsidies of the type received by Volkswagen and Stellantis, according to people who spoke with Bloomberg about it. They declined to divulge the total estimated cost of government support.\n\nEarlier this year, the Japanese news outlet Nikkei reported that Honda was considering a $14 billion investment in Canada, but hadn't made a decision yet. A spokesperson for Honda in Canada did not reply to a request for comment Sunday.\n\nTrudeau's government has argued that large taxpayer support for automakers is necessary to ensure that Canada maintains its share of the North American auto business after U.S. President Joe Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act into law in 2022, providing financial help for firms building EVs in the U.S.\n\nThe auto sector is particularly important to Ontario, Canada's largest province by population and home to assembly plants owned by Ford Motor Co., General Motors Co., Toyota Motor Corp., and Stellantis, as well as scores of parts suppliers.\n\n\"The windows of opportunity for this kind of thing are short,\" Industry Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne told Bloomberg in a recent interview discussing last year's subsidy deals. He said the government had to act after the U.S. enacted the Inflation Reduction Act, or risk losing the plants south of the border. \"That window was there and we seized it.\"\n\nStellantis and partner LG Energy Solution are in the middle of building a battery plant in Windsor, Ontario, across the border from Detroit. Volkswagen's proposed site is southwest of Toronto and Northvolt's is near Montreal. Canada's subsidy packages for those companies are being partially paid by provincial governments in Ontario and Quebec.\n\n(With assistance from Mathieu Dion and Thomas Seal.)", "source": {"uri":

Senior officials from the company in Japan also travelled to Toronto three times to meet with government officials, including twice with Ford.\n\nDuring a trip by the Honda executives to Toronto in March 2023, Ontario officials including Fedeli pitched the province as a prime destination for electric vehicle and battery investments, part of a strong push from the government to make Ford's vision of an end-to-end electric vehicle supply chain in the province a reality.\n\nNegotiations took a major step forward that July, when Ontario sent a formal letter to Honda Canada, signalling its willingness to offer incentives for a battery plant and EV production. Honda Canada executives then met with Ford in November and December.\n\nThe latter meeting sealed the deal, the sources said.", "source": {"uri": "toronto.ctvnews.ca", "dataType": "news", "title":

Trudeau, Ontario Premier Doug Ford and Honda executives are expected to announce today that the Japanese automaker is building a multi-billion-dollar electric vehicle battery plant in Alliston, Ont.THE CANADIAN PRESS/Cole Burston\n\nHonda is set to build an electric vehicle battery plant next to its Alliston, Ont., assembly plant, which it is retooling to produce fully electric vehicles, all part of a $15-billion project that will include up to $5 billion in public money.\n\nThe two plants are expected to create 1,000 jobs on top of retaining the existing 4,200 jobs at the assembly plant. Once the vehicle facility is fully operational in 2028, it is set to produce up to 240,000 vehicles per year.\n\nPrime Minister Justin Trudeau said Canada is able to attract major investments because it has great natural resources, clean energy, and skilled workers.\n\n\"Today's announcement is a game changer for manufacturing in Canada,\" he said during a press conference detailing the project on Thursday.\n\n\"Honda's investment is a vote of confidence in Canada, in Canadian auto workers, and in our manufacturing sector. Together, we're creating good-paying jobs, growing our economy, and keeping our air clean.\"\n\nThe deal does not involve production subsidies, which were used to woo two other automakers to build battery plants in Ontario instead of the United States with its incentives under the Inflation Reduction Act.\n\nBut the federal government is set to give the Japanese automaker around $2.5 billion through tax credits.\n\nFederal Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland's recent budget announced a 10 per cent Electric Vehicle Supply Chain investment tax credit on the cost of buildings related to EV production as long as the business invests in assembly, battery production and cathode active material production in Canada.\n\nThat's on top of an existing 30 per cent Clean Technology Manufacturing investment tax credit on the cost of investments in new machinery and equipment.\n\nOntario has committed to providing up to $2.5 billion directly - such as for capital costs - and indirectly, such as covering site servicing costs.\n\nThe $15-billion project includes the retooled plant, an electric vehicle battery plant nearby, as well as two key battery parts facilities located elsewhere in Ontario. Honda and POSCO Future M Co., Ltd. will build a cathode active material and precursor processing plant, and the automaker will also build a separator plant through a joint venture with Asahi Kasei Corporation.\n\nHonda's global CEO, Toshihiro Mibe, suggested the company is not stopping there.\n\n\"In the future, Honda will consider building a comprehensive battery chain beyond the four areas of EVs, EV batteries, cathode material and separators,\" he said, saying that battery recycling is key as well.\n\n\"Honda will realize low carbon value creation throughout the battery life cycle. In this way, Honda will establish a highly profitable business foundation and contribute to realizing a carbon neutral society.\"\n\nThe Honda facility will be the third electric vehicle battery plant in Ontario, following in the footsteps of Volkswagen in St. Thomas and a Stellantis LG plant in Windsor.\n\nThe deal comes after years of meetings and discussions between Honda executives and the Ontario government, which began after the last big government announcement at Honda's Alliston facility.\n\nTrudeau, Premier Doug Ford and Honda executives were on hand in March 2022 when the Japanese automaker announced hybrid production at the plant, with $131.6 million in assistance from each of the two levels of government.\n\nThat kickstarted conversations about a larger potential investment into electric vehicles, and negotiations began that summer.\n\nIn the midst of those negotiations, in May of 2023, Stellantis and LG stopped construction on their $5-billion electric vehicle battery facility, as they pressed the federal government to match what the United States would offer under its then-new Inflation Reduction Act.\n\nThey ultimately reached a deal with Canada and Ontario that will see the companies receive performance incentives of up to $15 billion over about 10 years.\n\nThe offer was also extended to Volkswagen for its electric vehicle battery facility and that deal could see up to $13 billion in incentives.\n\nFreeland has said large production incentives were necessary for both Volkswagen and Stellantis to help establish Canada's green economy and ensure the companies were not lured away to the United States by the benefits under the IRA.\n\nThe federal government later indicated that tap was turned off, and Ontario Economic Development Minister Vic Fedeli said in an interview that it didn't derail the negotiations with Honda.\n\n\"Production incentives were meant to match the American production incentives, but it's just far too much to continue with on an ongoing basis,\" he said.\n\n\"I think they were good to get started, but the rest of the industry now is starting to realize, right across North America, that you need to be where you really should be for the talent, clean energy and critical minerals.\"\n\nThe other two battery plants in the works have also started to draw other parts of the supply chain, Fedeli said, which became another part of the pitch for Honda - and perhaps others.\n\n\"We wanted EV manufacturers, we wanted a couple of battery manufacturers, and now we're filling in the major supply chain: cathode, anode, separator, electrolyte, copper foil, lithium hydroxide, those six major components,\" he said.\n\n\"We still have some room in our incentive packages for that line of six. After that, the incentive is: we brought you a customer. We brought you a battery maker ... You have to go and do your deal with them. You have enough incentive to come here.\"", "source": {"uri": "castanet.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "Castanet"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

PHOTO BY MANDEL NGAN/AFP/GETTY IMAGES\n\nBy Brian Platt\n\nCanada is on the verge of an agreement with Honda Motor Co. that would see the Japanese firm build electric vehicles and their components in the province of Ontario, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nThe deal, expected to be announced within a week, involves a multibillion-dollar commitment by Honda for new facilities to process cathode active materials, build batteries, and assemble battery-powered vehicles -- making southern Ontario a key hub of company's EV manufacturing plans in North America. The Canadian government would subsidize a portion of the capital cost.\n\nHonda has a manufacturing plant in Alliston, Ontario, about an hour's drive north of Toronto, where it puts together Honda CR-V and Civic models. The company makes hybrid vehicles at factories in Ohio and Indiana, according to its website, and it plans to start manufacturing its first U.S.-made fully electric vehicles in Marysville, Ohio next year.\n\nThe Honda investment comes at an anxious moment for the auto sector, with consumer adoption of electric vehicles playing out slowly in some regions because of high prices and a shortage of charging stations. Tesla Inc. is cutting more than 10 per cent of its global workforce, Chinese producer BYD Co. reported a sharp drop in deliveries of electric vehicles in the first quarter, and other automakers have delayed EV investments.\n\nStill, manufacturers are making long-term bets. Last month, Honda and Nissan Motor Co. announced a plan to collaborate on technology for battery-based electric vehicles, including software, as they seek to keep up with Chinese rivals.\n\nThe negotiations between Honda and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's government have taken many months and centred on investment tax credits, or ITCs, as the means by which the government will help pay for the capital costs of the factories. It will differ from the agreements Canada struck last year with Volkswagen AG, Chrysler parent Stellantis NV and Sweden's Northvolt AB, the people said; those companies were offered billions of dollars over a period of years to subsidize battery production.\n\nTrudeau's government will tout the Honda deal as a success story directly related to those contracts, one government official said. Those agreements created an ecosystem around Canada's EV supply chain, attracting other auto firms and allowing the government to transition to its own system of tax incentives, officials within the Trudeau administration will say.\n\nIn this case, the primary incentive, called the clean technology manufacturing ITC, provides a refundable tax credit for 30 per cent of equipment costs. Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland's budget last week also introduced a new tax credit that would apply to 10 per cent of the cost of buildings used for electric vehicle manufacturing -- if a company has significant portions of its EV supply chain within Canada.\n\nFreeland was closely involved in the Honda negotiations and the new EV tax credit was specifically geared to landing the Japanese firm, according to people familiar with the discussions, though other EV companies will also qualify if they build enough of their supply chain in Canada.\n\nThe Honda deal doesn't include ongoing production subsidies of the type received by Volkswagen and Stellantis, according to people who spoke with Bloomberg about it. They declined to divulge the total estimated cost of government support.\n\nEarlier this year, the Japanese news outlet Nikkei reported that Honda was considering a US$14 billion investment in Canada, but hadn't made a decision yet. A spokesperson for Honda in Canada did not reply to a request for comment Sunday.\n\nTrudeau's government has argued that large taxpayer support for automakers is necessary to ensure that Canada maintains its share of the North American auto business after U.S. President Joe Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act into law in 2022, providing financial help for firms building EVs in the U.S.\n\nThe auto sector is particularly important to Ontario, Canada's largest province by population and home to assembly plants owned by Ford Motor Co., General Motors Co., Toyota Motor Corp., and Stellantis, as well as scores of parts suppliers.\n\n\"The windows of opportunity for this kind of thing are short,\" Industry Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne told Bloomberg in a recent interview discussing last year's subsidy deals. He said the government had to act after the U.S. enacted the Inflation Reduction Act, or risk losing the plants south of the border. \"That window was there and we seized it.\"\n\nStellantis and partner LG Energy Solution are in the middle of building a battery plant in Windsor, Ontario, across the border from Detroit. Volkswagen's proposed site is southwest of Toronto and Northvolt's is near Montreal. Canada's subsidy packages for those companies are being partially paid by provincial governments in Ontario and Quebec.", "source": {"uri": "energynow.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "Energy News

A general view of production along the Honda CRV production line is shown during a tour of the Honda plant in Alliston on Wednesday, Apr. 5, 2023. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Cole BurstonTORONTO - Honda Canada is set to build an electric vehicle battery plant near its auto manufacturing facility in Alliston, Ont., where it also plans to produce fully electric vehicles. The Canadian Press has learned that the federal and Ontario governments will make the announcement this week. Senior sources with information on the project confirmed the deal but were not yet able to give any dollar figures. Ontario Premier Doug Ford on Monday morning told a First Nations conference that there will be an announcement this week about a new deal that he said will be double the size of a Volkswagen deal announced last year. That EV battery plant set to be built in St. Thomas, Ont., comes with a $7-billion capital price tag. The Honda facility will be the third electric vehicle battery plant in Ontario, following in the footsteps of Volkswagen and a Stellantis LG plant in Windsor, and while those two deals involved billions of dollars in production subsidies as a way of competing with the United States' Inflation Reduction Act subsidies, Honda's is expected to involve capital commitments and tax credits. Federal Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland's recent budget announced a 10 per cent Electric Vehicle Supply Chain investment tax credit on the cost of buildings related to EV production as long as the business invests in assembly, battery production and cathode active material production in Canada. That's on top of an existing 30 per cent Clean Technology Manufacturing investment tax credit on the cost of investments in new machinery and equipment. Honda's deal also involves two key parts suppliers for their batteries - cathodes and separators - with the locations of those facilities elsewhere in Ontario set to be announced at a later date. The deal comes after years of meetings and discussions between Honda executives and the Ontario government, the sources said. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, Premier Doug Ford and Honda executives were on hand in March 2022 in Alliston when the Japanese automaker announced hybrid production at the facility, with $131.6 million in assistance from each of the two levels of government. Around the time of that announcement, conversations began about a larger potential investment into electric vehicles, the sources said, and negotiations began that summer. Ontario Economic Development Minister Vic Fedeli travelled to Japan that fall, the first of three visits to meet with Honda Motor executives about the project. Senior officials from the company in Japan also travelled to Toronto three times to meet with government officials, including twice with Ford. During a trip by the Honda executives to Toronto in March 2023, Ontario officials including Fedeli pitched the province as a prime destination for electric vehicle and battery investments, part of a strong push from the government to make Ford's vision of an end-to-end electric vehicle supply chain in the province a reality. Negotiations took a major step forward that July, when Ontario sent a formal letter to Honda Canada, signalling its willingness to offer incentives for a battery plant and EV production. Honda Canada executives then met with Ford in November and December. The latter meeting sealed the deal, the sources said.

That plant is set to produce up to 240,000 vehicles per year when fully operational in 2028.\n\nPrime Minister Justin Trudeau said the jobs involved are at the heart of the deal.\n\n\"It's about, yes, creating green products that Canadians can rely on into the future, but it's primarily about investing in the workers and the communities that they are part of as these plants get built and as they work for generations to come,\" he said Thursday at a news conference detailing the project.\n\nThe deal does not involve production subsidies, which were used to woo two other automakers to build battery plants in Ontario instead of the United States with its incentives under the Inflation Reduction Act.\n\nBut the federal government is set to give the Japanese automaker around $2.5 billion through tax credits.\n\nFederal Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland's recent budget announced a 10 per cent Electric Vehicle Supply Chain investment tax credit on the cost of buildings related to EV production as long as the business invests in assembly, battery production and cathode active material production in Canada.\n\nThat's on top of an existing 30 per cent Clean Technology Manufacturing investment tax credit on the cost of investments in new machinery and equipment.\n\nOntario has committed to providing up to $2.5 billion directly - such as for capital costs - and indirectly, such as covering site servicing costs.\n\nTrudeau defended the public money that is being put toward the project, saying countries around the world are competing for investments in greener manufacturing and Honda's project will benefit Canada's economy and communities.\n\n\"That's not just creating jobs, great jobs for 1,000 new people around here, that's contributing to an ecosystem that will involve parts suppliers, it'll involve communities with vibrant art scenes and strong main streets, it'll involve future generations of Canada building the kinds of solutions the world needs,\" he said.\n\n\"Yes, there are politicians who sit back and say, 'No, no, no, no, no. We've got to balance the budget at all costs, even if it means not investing in Canadian workers and investing in the future.' Well, I think they're wrong.\"\n\nOntario Premier Doug Ford said Honda's investment is a generational commitment.\n\n\"This is decades and decades down the road,\" he said.\n\n\"What price do you put on that? There is no price you can put on that because we're investing into the people. The money is staying here in Ontario. It's not going overseas, it's not going down to the U.S., it's staying right here in Ontario for decades and generations to come.\"\n\nThe federal Opposition Conservatives suggested that other foreign companies that have received Canadian government subsidies have not filled their jobs with Canadian workers. Concerns have been raised about international workers being used to help build another EV battery plant in Windsor, Ont.\n\n\"We can't trust that his latest announcement of $5 billion in Canadian taxpayer money to another large multinational corporation will be any different,\" two critics wrote in a joint statement.\n\n\"Conservatives will not let Justin Trudeau sell out Canadian union workers and taxpayers yet again.\"\n\nThe $15-billion Honda project includes the retooled plant, an electric vehicle battery plant nearby, as well as two key battery parts facilities located elsewhere in Ontario. Honda and POSCO Future M Co., Ltd. will build a cathode active material and precursor processing plant, and the automaker will also build a separator plant through a joint venture with Asahi Kasei Corporation.\n\nHonda's global CEO, Toshihiro Mibe, suggested the company is not stopping there.\n\n\"In the future, Honda will consider building a comprehensive battery chain beyond the four areas of EVs, EV batteries, cathode material and separators,\" he said, noting that battery recycling is key as well.\n\n\"Honda will realize low carbon value creation throughout the battery life cycle. In this way, Honda will establish a highly profitable business foundation and contribute to realizing a carbon neutral society.\"\n\nThe Honda facility will be the third electric vehicle battery plant in Ontario, following in the footsteps of Volkswagen in St. Thomas, Ont., and a Stellantis LG plant in Windsor.\n\nThe deal comes after years of meetings and discussions between Honda executives and the Ontario government, which began after the last big government announcement at Honda's Alliston facility.\n\nTrudeau, Ford and Honda executives were on hand in March 2022 when the Japanese automaker announced hybrid production at the plant, with $131.6 million in assistance from each of the two levels of government.\n\nThat kickstarted conversations about a larger potential investment into electric vehicles, and negotiations began that summer.\n\nIn the midst of those negotiations, in May of 2023, Stellantis and LG stopped construction on their $5-billion electric vehicle battery facility, as they pressed the federal government to match what the United States would offer under its then-new Inflation Reduction Act.\n\nThey ultimately reached a deal with Canada and Ontario that will see the companies receive performance incentives of up to $15 billion over about 10 years.\n\nThe offer was also extended to Volkswagen for its electric vehicle battery facility and that deal could see up to $13 billion in incentives.\n\nFreeland has said large production incentives were necessary for both Volkswagen and Stellantis to help establish Canada's green economy and ensure the companies were not lured away to the United States by the benefits under the IRA.\n\nThe federal government later indicated that tap was turned off, and Ontario Economic Development Minister Vic Fedeli said in an interview that it didn't derail the negotiations with Honda.\n\n\"Production incentives were meant to match the American production incentives, but it's just far too much to continue with on an ongoing basis,\" he said.\n\n\"I think they were good to get started, but the rest of the industry now is starting to realize, right across North America, that you need to be where you really should be for the talent, clean energy and critical minerals.\"\n\nThe other two battery plants in the works have also started to draw other parts of the supply chain, Fedeli said, which became another part of the pitch for Honda - and perhaps others.\n\n\"We wanted EV manufacturers, we wanted a couple of battery manufacturers, and now we're filling in the major supply chain: cathode, anode, separator, electrolyte, copper foil, lithium hydroxide, those six major components,\" he said.\n\n\"We still have some room in our incentive packages for that line of six. After that, the incentive is: we brought you a customer. We brought you a battery maker ... you have to go and do your deal with them. You have enough incentive to come here.\"", "source": {"uri": "bnnbloomberg.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "BNN"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

That plant is set to produce up to 240,000 vehicles per year when fully operational in 2028.\n\nPrime Minister Justin Trudeau said the jobs involved are at the heart of the deal.\n\n\"It's about, yes, creating green products that Canadians can rely on into the future, but it's primarily about investing in the workers and the communities that they are part of as these plants get built and as they work for generations to come,\" he said Thursday at a news conference detailing the project.\n\nThe deal does not involve production subsidies, which were used to woo two other automakers to build battery plants in Ontario instead of the United States with its incentives under the Inflation Reduction Act.\n\nBut the federal government is set to give the Japanese automaker around $2.5 billion through tax credits.\n\nFederal Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland's recent budget announced a 10 per cent Electric Vehicle Supply Chain investment tax credit on the cost of buildings related to EV production as long as the business invests in assembly, battery production and cathode active material production in Canada.\n\nThat's on top of an existing 30 per cent Clean Technology Manufacturing investment tax credit on the cost of investments in new machinery and equipment.\n\nOntario has committed to providing up to $2.5 billion directly - such as for capital costs - and indirectly, such as covering site servicing costs.\n\nTrudeau defended the public money that is being put toward the project, saying countries around the world are competing for investments in greener manufacturing and Honda's project will benefit Canada's economy and communities.\n\n\"That's not just creating jobs, great jobs for 1,000 new people around here, that's contributing to an ecosystem that will involve parts suppliers, it'll involve communities with vibrant art scenes and strong main streets, it'll involve future generations of Canada building the kinds of solutions the world needs,\" he said.\n\n\"Yes, there are politicians who sit back and say, 'No, no, no, no, no. We've got to balance the budget at all costs, even if it means not investing in Canadian workers and investing in the future.' Well, I think they're wrong.\"\n\nOntario Premier Doug Ford said Honda's investment is a generational commitment.\n\n\"This is decades and decades down the road,\" he said.\n\n\"What price do you put on that? There is no price you can put on that because we're investing into the people. The money is staying here in Ontario. It's not going overseas, it's not going down to the U.S., it's staying right here in Ontario for decades and generations to come.\"\n\nThe federal Opposition Conservatives suggested that other foreign companies that have received Canadian government subsidies have not filled their jobs with Canadian workers. Concerns have been raised about international workers being used to help build another EV battery plant in Windsor, Ont.\n\n\"We can't trust that his latest announcement of $5 billion in Canadian taxpayer money to another large multinational corporation will be any different,\" two critics wrote in a joint statement.\n\n\"Conservatives will not let Justin Trudeau sell out Canadian union workers and taxpayers yet again.\"\n\nThe $15-billion Honda project includes the retooled plant, an electric vehicle battery plant nearby, as well as two key battery parts facilities located elsewhere in Ontario. Honda and POSCO Future M Co., Ltd. will build a cathode active material and precursor processing plant, and the automaker will also build a separator plant through a joint venture with Asahi Kasei Corporation.\n\nHonda's global CEO, Toshihiro Mibe, suggested the company is not stopping there.\n\n\"In the future, Honda will consider building a comprehensive battery chain beyond the four areas of EVs, EV batteries, cathode material and separators,\" he said, noting that battery recycling is key as well.\n\n\"Honda will realize low carbon value creation throughout the battery life cycle. In this way, Honda will establish a highly profitable business foundation and contribute to realizing a carbon neutral society.\"\n\nThe Honda facility will be the third electric vehicle battery plant in Ontario, following in the footsteps of Volkswagen in St. Thomas, Ont., and a Stellantis LG plant in Windsor.\n\nThe deal comes after years of meetings and discussions between Honda executives and the Ontario government, which began after the last big government announcement at Honda's Alliston facility.\n\nTrudeau, Ford and Honda executives were on hand in March 2022 when the Japanese automaker announced hybrid production at the plant, with $131.6 million in assistance from each of the two levels of government.\n\nThat kickstarted conversations about a larger potential investment into electric vehicles, and negotiations began that summer.\n\nIn the midst of those negotiations, in May of 2023, Stellantis and LG stopped construction on their $5-billion electric vehicle battery facility, as they pressed the federal government to match what the United States would offer under its then-new Inflation Reduction Act.\n\nThey ultimately reached a deal with Canada and Ontario that will see the companies receive performance incentives of up to $15 billion over about 10 years.\n\nThe offer was also extended to Volkswagen for its electric vehicle battery facility and that deal could see up to $13 billion in incentives.\n\nFreeland has said large production incentives were necessary for both Volkswagen and Stellantis to help establish Canada's green economy and ensure the companies were not lured away to the United States by the benefits under the IRA.\n\nThe federal government later indicated that tap was turned off, and Ontario Economic Development Minister Vic Fedeli said in an interview that it didn't derail the negotiations with Honda.\n\n\"Production incentives were meant to match the American production incentives, but it's just far too much to continue with on an ongoing basis,\" he said.\n\n\"I think they were good to get started, but the rest of the industry now is starting to realize, right across North America, that you need to be where you really should be for the talent, clean energy and critical minerals.\"\n\nThe other two battery plants in the works have also started to draw other parts of the supply chain, Fedeli said, which became another part of the pitch for Honda - and perhaps others.\n\n\"We wanted EV manufacturers, we wanted a couple of battery manufacturers, and now we're filling in the major supply chain: cathode, anode, separator, electrolyte, copper foil, lithium hydroxide, those six major components,\" he said.\n\n\"We still have some room in our incentive packages for that line of six. After that, the incentive is: we brought you a customer. We brought you a battery maker ... you have to go and do your deal with them. You have enough incentive to come here.\"\n\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published April 25, 2024.", "source": {"uri": "ca.finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

That plant is set to produce up to 240,000 vehicles per year when fully operational in 2028.\n\nPrime Minister Justin Trudeau said the jobs involved are at the heart of the deal.\n\n\"It's about, yes, creating green products that Canadians can rely on into the future, but it's primarily about investing in the workers and the communities that they are part of as these plants get built and as they work for generations to come,\" he said Thursday at a news conference detailing the project.\n\nThe deal does not involve production subsidies, which were used to woo two other automakers to build battery plants in Ontario instead of the United States with its incentives under the Inflation Reduction Act.\n\nBut the federal government is set to give the Japanese automaker around $2.5 billion through tax credits.\n\nFederal Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland's recent budget announced a 10 per cent Electric Vehicle Supply Chain investment tax credit on the cost of buildings related to EV production as long as the business invests in assembly, battery production and cathode active material production in Canada.\n\nThat's on top of an existing 30 per cent Clean Technology Manufacturing investment tax credit on the cost of investments in new machinery and equipment.\n\nOntario has committed to providing up to $2.5 billion directly - such as for capital costs - and indirectly, such as covering site servicing costs.\n\nTrudeau defended the public money that is being put toward the project, saying countries around the world are competing for investments in greener manufacturing and Honda's project will benefit Canada's economy and communities.\n\n\"That's not just creating jobs, great jobs for 1,000 new people around here, that's contributing to an ecosystem that will involve parts suppliers, it'll involve communities with vibrant art scenes and strong main streets, it'll involve future generations of Canada building the kinds of solutions the world needs,\" he said.\n\n\"Yes, there are politicians who sit back and say, 'No, no, no, no, no. We've got to balance the budget at all costs, even if it means not investing in Canadian workers and investing in the future.' Well, I think they're wrong.\"\n\nOntario Premier Doug Ford said Honda's investment is a generational commitment.\n\n\"This is decades and decades down the road,\" he said.\n\n\"What price do you put on that? There is no price you can put on that because we're investing into the people. The money is staying here in Ontario. It's not going overseas, it's not going down to the U.S., it's staying right here in Ontario for decades and generations to come.\"\n\nThe federal Opposition Conservatives suggested that other foreign companies that have received Canadian government subsidies have not filled their jobs with Canadian workers. Concerns have been raised about international workers being used to help build another EV battery plant in Windsor, Ont.\n\n\"We can't trust that his latest announcement of $5 billion in Canadian taxpayer money to another large multinational corporation will be any different,\" two critics wrote in a joint statement.\n\n\"Conservatives will not let Justin Trudeau sell out Canadian union workers and taxpayers yet again.\"\n\nThe $15-billion Honda project includes the retooled plant, an electric vehicle battery plant nearby, as well as two key battery parts facilities located elsewhere in Ontario. Honda and POSCO Future M Co., Ltd. will build a cathode active material and precursor processing plant, and the automaker will also build a separator plant through a joint venture with Asahi Kasei Corporation.\n\nHonda's global CEO, Toshihiro Mibe, suggested the company is not stopping there.\n\n\"In the future, Honda will consider building a comprehensive battery chain beyond the four areas of EVs, EV batteries, cathode material and separators,\" he said, noting that battery recycling is key as well.\n\n\"Honda will realize low carbon value creation throughout the battery life cycle. In this way, Honda will establish a highly profitable business foundation and contribute to realizing a carbon neutral society.\"\n\nThe Honda facility will be the third electric vehicle battery plant in Ontario, following in the footsteps of Volkswagen in St. Thomas, Ont., and a Stellantis LG plant in Windsor.\n\nThe deal comes after years of meetings and discussions between Honda executives and the Ontario government, which began after the last big government announcement at Honda's Alliston facility.\n\nTrudeau, Ford and Honda executives were on hand in March 2022 when the Japanese automaker announced hybrid production at the plant, with $131.6 million in assistance from each of the two levels of government.\n\nThat kickstarted conversations about a larger potential investment into electric vehicles, and negotiations began that summer.\n\nIn the midst of those negotiations, in May of 2023, Stellantis and LG stopped construction on their $5-billion electric vehicle battery facility, as they pressed the federal government to match what the United States would offer under its then-new Inflation Reduction Act.\n\nThey ultimately reached a deal with Canada and Ontario that will see the companies receive performance incentives of up to $15 billion over about 10 years.\n\nThe offer was also extended to Volkswagen for its electric vehicle battery facility and that deal could see up to $13 billion in incentives.\n\nFreeland has said large production incentives were necessary for both Volkswagen and Stellantis to help establish Canada's green economy and ensure the companies were not lured away to the United States by the benefits under the IRA.\n\nThe federal government later indicated that tap was turned off, and Ontario Economic Development Minister Vic Fedeli said in an interview that it didn't derail the negotiations with Honda.\n\n\"Production incentives were meant to match the American production incentives, but it's just far too much to continue with on an ongoing basis,\" he said.\n\n\"I think they were good to get started, but the rest of the industry now is starting to realize, right across North America, that you need to be where you really should be for the talent, clean energy and critical minerals.\"\n\nThe other two battery plants in the works have also started to draw other parts of the supply chain, Fedeli said, which became another part of the pitch for Honda - and perhaps others.\n\n\"We wanted EV manufacturers, we wanted a couple of battery manufacturers, and now we're filling in the major supply chain: cathode, anode, separator, electrolyte, copper foil, lithium hydroxide, those six major components,\" he said.\n\n\"We still have some room in our incentive packages for that line of six. After that, the incentive is: we brought you a customer. We brought you a battery maker ... you have to go and do your deal with them. You have enough incentive to come here.\"\n\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published April 25, 2024.", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"},

The company makes hybrid vehicles at factories in Ohio and Indiana, according to its website, and it plans to start manufacturing its first U.S.-made fully electric vehicles in Marysville, Ohio next year.\n\nThe Honda investment comes at an anxious moment for the auto sector, with consumer adoption of electric vehicles playing out slowly in some regions because of high prices and a shortage of charging stations. Tesla Inc. is cutting more than 10% of its global workforce, Chinese producer BYD Co. reported a sharp drop in deliveries of electric vehicles in the first quarter, and other automakers have delayed EV investments.\n\nStill, manufacturers are making long-term bets. Last month, Honda and Nissan Motor Co. announced a plan to collaborate on technology for battery-based electric vehicles, including software, as they seek to keep up with Chinese rivals.\n\nHours after Bloomberg News reported the agreement, Ontario Premier Doug Ford appeared to confirm it, though he didn't mention Honda by name. \"This week we landed a new deal,\" he said Monday at a conference in Toronto. \"It'll be the largest deal in Canadian history. It'll be double the size of Volkswagen. So stay tuned, I'll be announcing it this week.\"\n\nFord was referring to a C$7 billion ($5.1 billion) Volkswagen AG battery assembly plant announced last year for southern Ontario.\n\nThe negotiations between Honda and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's government have taken many months and centered on investment tax credits, or ITCs, as the means by which the government will help pay for the capital costs of the factories. It will differ from the agreements Canada struck last year with Volkswagen, Chrysler parent Stellantis NV and Sweden's Northvolt AB, the people said; those companies were offered billions of dollars over a period of years to subsidize battery production.\n\nTrudeau's government will tout the Honda deal as a success story directly related to those contracts, one government official said. Those agreements created an ecosystem around Canada's EV supply chain, attracting other auto firms and allowing the government to transition to its own system of tax incentives, officials within the Trudeau administration will say.\n\n...continued", "source": {"uri": "arcamax.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ArcaMax"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

battery plant, part of a $15B investment -  BNN Bloomberg", "body": "If you build it, they will come, but it didn't happen for electric vehicles: Stein\n\nPrime Minister Justin Trudeau, Ontario Premier Doug Ford and Honda executives are expected to announce today that the Japanese automaker is building an electric vehicle battery plant in Alliston, Ont., part of a $15-billion investment.\n\nSenior sources with information on the project have told The Canadian Press that Honda is also retooling its assembly plant in Alliston to produce fully electric vehicles.\n\nThe $15-billion project includes the retooled plant, an electric vehicle battery plant in close proximity, as well as two key battery parts facilities located elsewhere in Ontario.\n\nThere will likely be some capital investment from at least one level of government, but the sources say the deal does not involve production subsidies, which were used to woo two other automakers to build battery plants in Ontario instead of the United States with its incentives under the Inflation Reduction Act.\n\nInstead, the federal government has proposed in its recent budget a 10 per cent Electric Vehicle Supply Chain investment tax credit, which Honda could claim on top of an existing 30 per cent Clean Technology Manufacturing Investment tax credit.\n\nThe Honda facility will be the third electric vehicle battery plant in Ontario, following in the footsteps of Volkswagen in St. Thomas and a Stellantis LG plant in Windsor.\n\nHonda's deal also involves two key parts suppliers for their batteries -- cathodes and separators -- with the locations of those facilities set to be announced at a later date.\n\nThe deal comes after years of meetings and discussions between Honda executives and the Ontario government that began after the last big government announcement at Honda's Alliston facility.\n\nTrudeau, Ford and Honda executives were on hand in March 2022 when the automaker announced hybrid production at the plant, with $131.6 million in assistance from each of the two levels of government.\n\nThat kick-started conversations about a larger potential investment into electric vehicles, and negotiations began that summer, the sources said.", "source": {"uri": "bnnbloomberg.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "BNN"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Honda to Invest $15 Billion in Canada Electric-Vehicle Plan With New Government EV Supply Chain Tax Credit", "body": "Automaker will focus on a manufacturing site north of Toronto\n\nHonda Motor Co. announced it will spend C$15 billion (US$11 billion) to build electric vehicles north of Toronto, with lawmakers in Canada promising significant financial aid though a new EV supply chain tax credit in the amount of $2.5 Billion.\n\nThe investment is being announced Thursday morning in Alliston, Ontario, by Honda officials and government leaders including Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Ontario Premier Doug Ford. Bloomberg News first reported on April 21 that Honda and the Canadian government were near a deal.\n\nFor Honda, it's part of a long-term bet on consumer demand for electric vehicles in North America. The Japanese company makes hybrid cars in the US and has said it plans to start manufacturing its first US-made fully electric vehicles in Marysville, Ohio next year.\n\nFor Trudeau and Ford, the announcement is a major milestone in their quest to secure a share of the North American auto business for Canada as the industry retools toward EVs. The two politicians have already pledged tens of billions of dollars to convince other manufacturers, including Volkswagen AG, to build huge EV battery plants in the country.\n\nThursday's announcement will see Honda pledge to build a new battery assembly plant in Alliston, a town that's a little more than an hour's drive north of Toronto, where it produces gasoline-powered Honda CR-V and Civic models. Existing plants there will be expanded for electric vehicles, according to a person with direct knowledge of the plan, speaking on condition they not be identified.\n\nHonda also plans to invest in a cathode materials facility and a battery components plant in Ontario, but those will involve other companies and the exact details will likely come later, the person said.\n\nFederal government support for Honda's investment is in the form of tax credits for clean manufacturing and electric vehicle production. But the precise cost to the public treasury will depend on how much Honda actually spends in Canada. The province of Ontario will subsidize some of the capital costs of the project, and may also provide cash for needed infrastructure upgrades such as new roads and sewers, the person said.\n\nThe subsidies are structured differently from the ones Canada promised last year to Volkswagen, Stellantis NV and Sweden's Northvolt. Those companies received contracts that will pay a portion of the cost of each battery produced in their Canadian plants -- in effect matching the money that's available to EV battery makers under the US Inflation Reduction Act.\n\nHonda was not offered a production subsidy, government officials have told Bloomberg. Trudeau has repeatedly said Canada can only afford to go so far in matching US manufacturing incentives.", "source": {"uri": "energynow.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "Energy News for the Canadian

Trudeau, Ontario Premier Doug Ford and Honda executives are expected to announce today that the Japanese automaker is building a multi-billion-dollar electric vehicle battery plant in Alliston, Ont.THE CANADIAN PRESS/Cole BurstonHonda is set to build an electric vehicle battery plant next to its Alliston, Ont., assembly plant, which it is retooling to produce fully electric vehicles, all part of a $15-billion project that is expected to include up to $5 billion in public money. The two plants are expected to create 1,000 jobs on top of retaining the existing 4,200 jobs at the assembly plant. The deal does not involve production subsidies, which were used to woo two other automakers to build battery plants in Ontario instead of the United States with its incentives under the Inflation Reduction Act. But the federal government is expected to give the Japanese automaker around $2.5 billion through tax credits for clean technology manufacturing and electric vehicle supply chain investments. Ontario has committed to providing up to $2.5 billion directly \"\" such as for capital costs \"\" and indirectly, such as covering site servicing costs. The $15-billion project includes the retooled plant, an electric vehicle battery plant nearby, as well as two key battery parts facilities \"\" for cathodes and separators \"\" located elsewhere in Ontario. The Honda facility will be the third electric vehicle battery plant in Ontario, following in the footsteps of Volkswagen in St. Thomas and a Stellantis LG plant in Windsor. The deal comes after years of meetings and discussions between Honda executives and the Ontario government, which began after the last big government announcement at Honda's Alliston facility. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, Premier Doug Ford and Honda executives were on hand in March 2022 when the Japanese automaker announced hybrid production at the plant, with $131.6 million in assistance from each of the two levels of government. That kickstarted conversations about a larger potential investment into electric vehicles, and negotiations began that summer. In the midst of those negotiations, in May of 2023, Stellantis and LG stopped construction on their $5-billion electric vehicle battery facility, as they pressed the federal government to match what the United States would offer under its then-new Inflation Reduction Act. They ultimately reached a deal with Canada and Ontario that will see the companies receive performance incentives of up to $15 billion over about 10 years. The offer was also extended to Volkswagen for its electric vehicle battery facility and that deal could see up to $13 billion in incentives. Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland has said large production incentives were necessary for both Volkswagen and Stellantis to help establish Canada's green economy and ensure the companies were not lured away to the United States by the benefits under the IRA. The federal government later indicated that tap was turned off, and Fedeli said in an interview that it didn't derail the negotiations with Honda. \"Production incentives were meant to match the American production incentives, but it's just far too much to continue with on an ongoing basis,\" he said. \"I think they were good to get started, but the rest of the industry now is starting to realize, right across North America, that you need to be where you really should be for the talent, clean energy and critical minerals.\" The other two battery plants in the works have also started to draw other parts of the supply chain, Fedeli said, which became another part of the pitch for Honda \"\" and perhaps others. \"We wanted EV manufacturers, we wanted a couple of battery manufacturers, and now we're filling in the major supply chain: cathode, anode, separator, electrolyte, copper foil, lithium hydroxide, those six major components,\" he said. \"We still have some room in our incentive packages for that line of six. After that, the incentive is: we brought you a customer. We brought you a battery maker ... You have to go and do your deal with them. You have enough incentive to come here.\" This report by The Canadian Press was first published April 25, 2024.", "source": {"uri": "medicinehatnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Medicine Hat

automakers to build battery plants in Ontario instead of the United States with its incentives under the Inflation Reduction Act.\n\nInstead, the federal government has proposed in its recent budget a 10 per cent Electric Vehicle Supply Chain investment tax credit, which Honda could claim on top of an existing 30 per cent Clean Technology Manufacturing Investment tax credit.\n\nThe Honda facility will be the third electric vehicle battery plant in Ontario, following in the footsteps of Volkswagen in St. Thomas and a Stellantis LG plant in Windsor.\n\nHonda's deal also involves two key parts suppliers for their batteries -- cathodes and separators -- with the locations of those facilities set to be announced at a later date.\n\nThe deal comes after years of meetings and discussions between Honda executives and the Ontario government that began after the last big government announcement at Honda's Alliston facility.\n\nTrudeau, Ford and Honda executives were on hand in March 2022 when the automaker announced hybrid production at the plant, with $131.6 million in assistance from each of the two levels of government.\n\nThat kick-started conversations about a larger potential investment into electric vehicles, and negotiations began that summer, the sources said.\n\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published April 25, 2024.", "source": {"uri":

Bloomberg News first reported on April 21 that Honda and the Canadian government were near a deal.\n\nFor Honda, it's part of a long-term bet on consumer demand for electric vehicles in North America. The Japanese company makes hybrid cars in the US and has said it plans to start manufacturing its first US-made fully electric vehicles in Marysville, Ohio next year.\n\nFor Trudeau and Ford, the announcement is a major milestone in their quest to secure a share of the North American auto business for Canada as the industry retools toward EVs. The two politicians have already pledged tens of billions of dollars to convince other manufacturers, including Volkswagen AG, to build huge EV battery plants in the country.\n\nRead More: Electric Cars Pass Mass Adoption Tipping Point in 31 Countries\n\nThursday's announcement will see Honda pledge to build a new battery assembly plant in Alliston, a town that's a little more than an hour's drive north of Toronto, where it produces gasoline-powered Honda CR-V and Civic models. Existing plants there will be expanded for electric vehicles, according to a person with direct knowledge of the plan, speaking on condition they not be identified.\n\nHonda also plans to invest in a cathode materials facility and a battery components plant in Ontario, but those will involve other companies and the exact details will likely come later, the person said.\n\nFederal government support for Honda's investment is in the form of tax credits for clean manufacturing and electric vehicle production. But the precise cost to the public treasury will depend on how much Honda actually spends in Canada. The province of Ontario will subsidize some of the capital costs of the project, and may also provide cash for needed infrastructure upgrades such as new roads and sewers, the person said.\n\nThe subsidies are structured differently from the ones Canada promised last year to Volkswagen, Stellantis NV and Sweden's Northvolt. Those companies received contracts that will pay a portion of the cost of each battery produced in their Canadian plants -- in effect matching the money that's available to EV battery makers under the US Inflation Reduction Act.\n\nHonda was not offered a production subsidy, government officials have told Bloomberg.

Or follow us on Google News!\n\nHonda will build batteries for electric vehicles in Ontario with financial support from the Canadian and provincial governments under a plan to be announced this week, a source with direct knowledge of the deal told Reuters. Under the terms of the agreement with Ottawa and Ontario, Honda will build batteries, process the cathode materials needed for the batteries, and also assemble electric vehicles in Ontario.\n\nCanada has been aggressively pursuing auto manufacturers who want to build electric vehicles by matching or in some cases exceeding the financial incentives available in the US Inflation Reduction Act. That plan is working, as both Volkswagen, Northvolt, and Stellantis have committed to building battery factories in Canada.\n\nA final announcement from Honda is expected on April 25, according to Ontario premier Doug Ford. He told reporters on Monday the deal was the largest in Canadian history and would be worth double the C$7 billion that a planned Volkswagen EV electric vehicle plant in Ontario is expected to cost. Last year, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said that Canada was looking for more \"targeted\" investments after the government gave hefty subsidies to Volkswagen, Northvolt, and a Stellantis- LG Energy Solution joint venture for their planned battery factories.\n\nThe Trudeau government sees the Honda deal as a success story directly related to those agreements. One government official told Bloomberg they created an ecosystem around Canada's EV supply chain which attracted other auto-related manufactures and allowed the government to transition to its own system of tax incentives.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg, the negotiations between Honda and the Canadian government have taken many months and focused on investment tax credits as the means by which the government will help pay for the capital costs of the factories. Canada has been matching the 30% ITC provided by the US Inflation Reduction Act, but last week it sweetened the deal with a 10% rebate on the costs of constructing new buildings used in key segments of the electric vehicle supply chain if a company has a significant portion of its EV supply chain within Canada.\n\nFinance minister Chrystia Freeland introduced the new tax credit last week in her proposed budget. She was closely involved in the Honda negotiations and the new EV tax credit was specifically geared to landing the Japanese firm, according to people familiar with the discussions. It will be available to other EV companies if they have enough of their supply chain in Canada.\n\nThe Honda deal does not include ongoing production subsidies of the type received by Volkswagen and Stellantis, according to people who spoke with Bloomberg. They declined to divulge the total estimated cost of government support. The Trudeau government has argued that large taxpayer support for automakers is necessary to ensure that Canada maintains its share of the North American auto business and does not allow those businesses to be lured to the US because of the incentives provided by the Inflation Reduction Act\n\n\"The windows of opportunity for this kind of thing are short,\" industry minister Francois-Philippe Champagne told Bloomberg in a recent interview in which he discussed the subsidy arrangements his government made with Volkswagen, Northvolt, and Stellantis last year. He said the government had to act after the US enacted the Inflation Reduction Act or risk losing the plants south of the border. \"That window was there and we seized it.\"\n\nThe auto sector is particularly important to Ontario, which is the largest province in Canada by population and home to assembly plants owned by Ford, General Motors, Toyota, and Stellantis. Those companies are also supported by hundreds of companies who supply parts and finished goods to the Canadian auto industry.\n\nStellantis and partner LG Energy Solution are in the middle of building a battery plant in Windsor, Ontario, across the border from Detroit. Volkswagen's proposed site is southwest of Toronto and Northvolt's is near Montreal. Canada's subsidy packages for those companies are being partially paid by provincial governments in Ontario and Quebec.\n\nThe planned Canadian battery factory would be Honda's second in North America. It is already planning to manufacture batteries with LG Energy Solutions in Ohio in a factory that is expected to come online next year. The factory near Jeffersonville, Ohio, will have an annual capacity of 40 GWh. Honda will also convert its existing manufacturing plants in Ohio to produce electric cars based on its e:Architecture platform in 2026.\n\nChip in a few dollars a month to help support independent cleantech coverage that helps to accelerate the cleantech revolution!\n\nAccording to Nikkei, North America accounts for roughly 40% of Honda's global sales. Most of the vehicles sold there still have combustion engines, however, the company plans for electric cars to account for 40% of sales in North America by 2030 and up to 80% by 2035.\n\nEarlier this week, it unveiled three new electric cars for China, an announcement that made executive editor Zachary Shahan peevish. Where are the electric cars for North America, he asked? \"Those of us outside of China, particularly in the US, can wish all we want that Honda would provide such offerings where we live and give electrics attention outside of China, but without strong policies requiring it, Honda's going to just keep on Honda-ing in these less advanced markets. Hybrids are good enough for Honda here, apparently.\"\n\nWell, patience, Zachary. EV sales are a third of the Chinese market but only about 10% of sales in the US, with the vast majority of those skewed toward blue states. Red states want nothing much to do with these newfangled devices. Presumably Honda intends the batteries it plans to manufacture in Canada to power electric cars in the US.\n\nEarlier this year, Honda announced it would invest $14 billion to produce several new models of electric cars in Canada. Some of that money obviously would go to manufacture the batteries those cars will use. But details about the cars it plans to produce for North America are still vague. It currently has the Prologue -- a competent electric SUV -- for sale in America, but that car is manufactured at the GM factory in Spring Hill, Tennessee. Recently Honda announced it was terminating its joint development agreement with GM, which leaves the fate of the Prologue up in the air.\n\nIf you are feeling confused about what Honda has planned for electric cars in North America, join the club. It has made some bold pronouncements but provided few details. One supposes all will be revealed in due time. For now, we have to trust that Honda knows what it is doing, even if the outward signs suggest the opposite. Will Honda become the standard bearer for affordable, reliable electric cars has it has done with its gasoline powered cars? \"We'll see,\" says the Zen master.", "source": {"uri":

After that, the incentive is: we brought you a customer. We brought you a battery maker ... You have to go and do your deal with them.

(TYO: 7267) is close to finalizing an agreement with the Canadian government that would see the Japanese automaker invest billions of dollars to build electric vehicles and battery components in the province of Ontario, according to Bloomberg which cited sources familiar with the negotiations.\n\nThe deal, expected to be announced this week, involves Honda constructing new facilities in southern Ontario to manufacture cathode materials, build batteries, and assemble battery-powered vehicles. This would make the region a key hub for Honda's electric vehicle production in North America.\n\nWhile financial details remain undisclosed, the Canadian federal government reportedly plans to provide Honda with investment tax credits to subsidize a portion of the capital costs in the form of a refundable tax credit for 30% of equipment costs. The 2024 federal budget also includes a new tax credit applicable to 10% of building cost for electric vehicle manufacturing provided the company has a significant portion of its EV supply chain in Canada.\n\nThis arrangement will be different from the deals closed last year with Volkswagen (ETR: VOW3), Stellantis (BIT: STLAM), and Northvolt AB. In those agreements, the government offered billions of dollars over a number of years to spur battery manufacturing in Canada.\n\nThe Honda investment comes amid a precarious period for the auto industry's shift to electric vehicles. Adoption has lagged in some markets due to high prices and lack of charging infrastructure. Nonetheless, automakers continue betting big on EVs long-term, with Honda recently partnering with Nissan on joint EV technology development.\n\nFor Canada, securing Honda's commitment is being positioned by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's government as a success stemming directly from last year's EV supply chain investments that created an attractive ecosystem.\n\nHonda already has an assembly plant in Alliston, Ontario producing gas-powered models. The anticipated EV investment allows the company to localize more of its electric supply chain in North America as it prepares to launch its first US-made EV next year.\n\nInformation for this story was found via Bloomberg, and the sources and companies mentioned.

Bloomberg, citing unnamed sources, reported the company is nearing a multibillion-dollar commitment to build a plant in Ontario that will be announced within a week.\n\nHonda has long built vehicles and engines in Alliston, Ont., but it has yet to say how it will adapt those operations before Canada's zero-emission vehicle mandate kicks in between 2026 and 2035.\n\nHonda is staying quiet for now, but not everyone is.\n\n\"There's lot of breadcrumbs to follow,\" Brendan Sweeney, managing director of the Trillium Network for Advanced Manufacturing at Western University, which advocates for advanced industry in Ontario, said about government policies that could be tailored to attract Honda to invest in a new EV plant. \"I think they're pretty close, and I think there's a couple things going on that give us reasons to be optimistic.\"\n\nEV tax credit\n\nThe budget promised a 10 per cent investment tax credit that would apply to the cost of buildings used in key segments of the EV supply chain: EV assembly, battery vehicle manufacturing and battery cathode production.\n\nThat rang a bell for Sweeney and others who have been actively wondering about Honda's plans for a few months. In January, the Japanese news outlet, Nikkei Asia, reported that Honda is considering a US$14-billion project in Canada that would include EV manufacturing and possibly batteries too, though it did not say where its information came from.\n\nHonda declined to reveal its plans.\n\n\"Honda Canada is considering a number of initiatives and is in contact with governments at all levels as we move into the electrified era,\" spokesperson Ken Chiu said in an email. \"In order to achieve our 2040 electrification target of 100 per cent electrified vehicles, we are considering various options to increase local production capacity, however, we have nothing further to share at this time.\"\n\nNonetheless, the Nikkei Asia article has fuelled several reports that speculate on Honda's intentions in Canada.\n\nOther supporting factors include frequent mentions of trips to Japan by both Industry Minister Fran\u00e7ois-Philippe Champagne and Ontario Industry Minister Vic Fedeli.\n\nThis past December, Fedeli promised more EV projects are on the way while appearing as a guest on a podcast hosted by the industry trade publication Automotive News.\n\n\"I would say that our philosophy and aggressive approach to the EV sector have not waned in any way, shape or form,\" he said. \"It is still our intention to push hard on electric vehicles being made in Ontario ... it is our intention to look for battery opportunities, to continue the work there.\"\n\nEV makers\n\nOf the five automakers that already have operations in Canada, including General Motors Co., Ford Motor Company, Stellantis NV, Toyota Motor Corp. and Honda, only the latter two have not formalized plans to produce EVs here.\n\nIn 2022, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Ontario Premier Doug Ford visited Honda's Alliston plant to announce they would each commit $131.6 million towards a $1.4-billion retooling so the next generation of Honda CRVs, including hybrids, could be produced there.\n\nBut that's a long way away from the US$14-billion Honda project that Nikkei Asia referenced, and which Sweeney and others have been speculating about. The article said Honda was considering a number of sites, but only named Ontario, and said the company would make a decision by year-end.\n\nLast year, Volkswagen AG announced it would build a $7-billion battery cell manufacturing plant in St. Thomas, Ont. But the federal government enticed it with production tax credits that the company can claim based on how many batteries it produces.\n\nSimilarly, Stellantis in 2022 announced a $5-billion battery cell manufacturing plant in Windsor, Ont., through a joint venture with South Korea's LG Energy Solution Ltd., for which it is also receiving production tax credits.\n\nEV deals\n\nCritics of such deals said that government largesse would cancel out any benefits to the economy. They received more ammo for their arguments when the Parliamentary Budget Office estimated the VW deal could end up costing the federal government $16.3 billion in direct and tax support.\n\nThe estimate did not include the provincial government's $500-million contribution, but estimated the VW plant would have a \"marginal\" impact on the economy, forecasting it would increase real gross domestic product by 0.01 per cent above baseline projections by 2027.\n\nSweeney criticized the PBO for building a model that's too simplistic. Much of the federal government's contributions to VW are based on production tax credits, which are tied to when the plant starts manufacturing and, more broadly, how many EVs it ends up selling each year.\n\nAnother question is whether the federal government could create a package comparable to what VW and Stellantis received to entice Honda, or potentially Toyota, which currently builds more vehicles in Ontario than any other company.\n\nIn addition to the 10 per cent tax credit introduced in the 2024 budget, there is also a 30 per cent Clean Technology Manufacturing investment tax credit on new machinery and equipment, plus provincial support.\n\nSweeney said he thinks the federal government wants to move away from production tax credits, a form of incentive initially introduced in the United States through the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA).\n\n\"We got painted into a corner with the IRA and we kind of had to follow suit,\" he said. \"And we did it, but it's better when we write our own story.\"\n\nBut the story as it relates to Honda will only come to light if and when it announces it is building a complex in Canada, and after the government discloses what type of incentives it provided.", "source": {"uri": "ca.finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

battery and vehicle plant in Canada", "body": "Alliston (Canada) (AFP) - Japanese auto giant Honda announced Thursday the largest automotive investment in Canada's history, worth Can$15 billion (US$11 billion), for a massive new EV battery and vehicle assembly plant.\n\nHonda chief executive Toshihiro Mibe told a joint news conference with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and other officials that electric vehicles (EVs) will start rolling off the new assembly line in 2028.\n\nOnce fully operational, the factory will have a production capacity of 240,000 vehicles per year, and a batteries output of 36 GWh per year.\n\n\"The world is changing rapidly, and we must work toward realizing carbon neutrality to sustain the global environment,\" Mibe said.\n\nHonda estimates that 1,000 new jobs will be created at the facility, which is to be built next to its existing Civic and CR-V assembly plants north of Toronto that already employ 4,200 workers.\n\nTrudeau touted Ottawa's efforts to set up \"a whole ecosystem\" around the production of electric batteries, positioning Canada as an attractive destination for electric vehicle investment, with generous tax incentives, renewable energy access and its rare mineral deposits.\n\n\"Because of the choices our government has made over the past few years, Canada now ranks first, globally in Bloomberg's ranking of lithium-ion battery supply chains,\" Trudeau said.\n\nLeading the 'EV revolution'\n\nOntario Premier Doug Ford noted that his province is \"the only place in the world that six of the largest automakers call home\" and with Honda's investment is now \"leading the world in the electric vehicle revolution.\"\n\nIn the federal budget last week, Trudeau's government introduced a new business tax credit, granting companies a 10 percent rebate on construction costs for new facilities used in key segments of the electric vehicle supply chain.\n\nThe estimated value of the federal tax credit for Honda's new facility is Can$2.5 billion, while Ford said the province is contributing another Can$2.5 billion in incentives.\n\nIn the last four years, automotive and battery makers have announced more than Can$31 \u202fbillion in investments in electric vehicle manufacturing across Canada.\n\nCanada's strategy follows that of the neighboring United States, whose Inflation Reduction Act has provided a host of incentives for green industry.\n\nSince 2021, Honda has made big outlays as it aggressively pursues its objective of becoming 100 percent electric in its automobile segment by 2040.\n\nIts new facility in Alliston, Ontario will be the first to tap into Canada's EV supply chain investment tax credit and joins recently announced Volkswagen and Stellantis battery plants in Canada.\n\nHonda will also build a cathode active material and precursor processing plant as well as a separator plant through joint ventures with chemical companies POSCO Future M and Asahi Kasei in order to complete its local EV supply chain.", "source": {"uri": "france24.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "France 24"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric-vehicle_battery",

The investment plans include creating Canada's first comprehensive EV supply chain by 2028. Honda wants to build cathodes, batteries, and vehicles in Ontario, signaling a strong commitment to EVs\n\nAfter months of rumors and speculation, Honda Canada - along with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, and Ontario premier Doug Ford - announced today its plan to invest 15 Billion $ in the province of Ontario to build electric vehicles (EVs), as well as a vertically integrated EV battery chain.\n\nThe investment itself, which Justin Trudeau qualified as the largest automotive investment in Canada, but also Honda's largest manufacturing investment, ever, will add more than 1,000 additional jobs to Honda Canada's existing manufacturing operations.\n\nRelated Here's How Much It Costs To Charge The Honda Prologue The Honda Prologue's 85 kWh battery features impressive range claims and attractive charging costs.\n\nNot Just Electric Vehicles, But An Entire Battery Supply Chain\n\nHonda Canada's EV news comes as a continuation of Honda's existing Alliston plant in Ontario, which has been in operation since 1986, and currently builds Civics and CR-Vs. Honda has so far invested 6 billion $ in Canada, and this latest news will come as an extension to Honda's current EV hub in Ohio.\n\nThe main distinction about this new announcement is that Honda won't just build EVs in Ontario, but will create Canada's first comprehensive EV supply chain. Through four distinct plants, Honda will create cathodes, batteries and vehicles using Canadian raw materials. When completed in 2028, the carmaker projects an annual EV production of 240,000 vehicles per year, with an energy output of 36 Gigawatt-hours.\n\nMore details about this news will come later, but Honda plans on building these new facilities around the current Alliston assembly plant. It also claims that it will erect an all-new battery recycling operation in order to create the full loop, from battery raw materials, all the way to its end of life.\n\nHonda may be late to the game in terms of its EV offerings, but this latest announcement is a testament to its willingness to go all-in on EVs.

largest automotive investment in Canada's history.\n\nHonda CEO Toshihiro Mibe told a joint news conference with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and other officials that electric vehicles will start rolling off the new assembly line in 2028.\n\nOnce fully operational, the factory will have a production capacity of 240,000 vehicles per year and a battery output of 36 gigawatt hours (GWh) per year.\n\n\"The world is changing rapidly, and we must work toward realizing carbon neutrality to sustain the global environment,\" Mibe said.\n\nHonda estimates that 1,000 new jobs will be created at the facility, which is to be built next to its existing Civic and CR-V assembly plants north of Toronto that already employ 4,200 workers.\n\nTrudeau touted Ottawa's efforts to set up \"a whole ecosystem\" around the production of electric batteries, positioning Canada as an attractive destination for electric vehicle investment, with generous tax incentives, renewable energy access and its rare mineral deposits.\n\n\"Because of the choices our government has made over the past few years, Canada now ranks first, globally in Bloomberg's ranking of lithium-ion battery supply chains,\" Trudeau said.\n\nOntario Premier Doug Ford noted that his province is \"the only place in the world that six of the largest automakers call home\" and with Honda's investment is now \"leading the world in the electric vehicle revolution.\"\n\nIn the federal budget last week, Trudeau's government introduced a new business tax credit, granting companies a 10% rebate on construction costs for new facilities used in key segments of the electric vehicle supply chain.\n\nThe estimated value of the federal tax credit for Honda's new facility is C$2.5 billion, while Ford said the province is contributing another C$2.5 billion in incentives.\n\nIn the last four years, automotive and battery makers have announced more than C$31 billion in investments in electric vehicle manufacturing across Canada.\n\nCanada's strategy follows that of the neighboring United States, whose Inflation Reduction Act has provided a host of incentives for green industry.\n\nSince 2021, Honda has made big outlays as it aggressively pursues its objective of becoming 100% electric in its automobile segment by 2040.\n\nIts new facility in Alliston, Ontario will be the first to tap into Canada's EV supply chain investment tax credit and joins recently announced Volkswagen and Stellantis battery plants in Canada.\n\nHonda will also build a cathode active material and precursor processing plant as well as a separator plant through joint ventures with chemical companies POSCO Future M and Asahi Kasei in order to complete its local EV supply chain.", "source": {"uri": "dailysabah.com", "dataType":

The investment plans include creating Canada's first comprehensive EV supply chain by 2028. Honda wants to build cathodes, batteries, and vehicles in Ontario, signaling a strong commitment to EVs\n\nAfter months of rumors and speculation, Honda Canada - along with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, and Ontario premier Doug Ford - announced today its plan to invest 15 Billion $in the province of Ontario to build electric vehicles (EVs), as well as a vertically integrated EV battery chain.\n\nThe investment itself, which Justin Trudeau qualified as the largest automotive investment in Canada, will add more than 1,000 additional jobs to Honda Canada's existing manufacturing operations.\n\nRelated Here's How Much It Costs To Charge The Honda Prologue The Honda Prologue's 85 kWh battery features impressive range claims and attractive charging costs.\n\nNot Just Electric Vehicles, But An Entire Battery Supply Chain\n\nHonda Canada's EV news comes as a continuation of Honda's existing Alliston plant in Ontario, which has been in operation since 1986, and currently builds Civics and CR-Vs. Honda has so far invested 6 billion $ in Canada, and this latest news will come as an extension to Honda's current EV hub in Ohio.\n\nThe main distinction about this new announcement is that Honda won't just build EVs in Ontario, but will create Canada's first comprehensive EV supply chain. Through four distinct plants, Honda will create cathodes, batteries and vehicles using Canadian raw materials. When completed in 2028, the carmakers projects an annual EV production of 240,000 vehicles per year, with an energy output of 36 Gigawatt-hours.\n\nMore details about this news will come later, but Honda plans on building these new facilities around the current Alliston assembly plant. It also claims that it will erect an all-new battery recycling operation in order to create the full loop, from battery raw materials, all the way to its end of life.\n\nHonda may be late to the game in terms of its EV offerings, but this latest announcement is a testament to its willingness to go all-in on EVs.

Mr. Mibe also confirmed Honda will be investing $15 billion in the project.\n\n\"Honda is making steady progress to our goal to make battery electric and fuel cell electric vehicles represent 100 percent of our vehicle sales by 2040,\" he said.\n\nMr. Trudeau touted the deal as the largest automotive deal in Canadian history and stated that the investment would create over 1,000 manufacturing jobs.\n\n\"These investments will create well over 1,000 well-paying manufacturing jobs as well as many many construction jobs, and of course, jobs all across Ontario and the country for auto parts suppliers,\" he said.\n\nMr. Trudeau noted that Canada has surpassed China as the number one supplier of lithium-ion batteries saying, \"Canada is recognized as the clean economy global supplier of solutions for a net-zero carbon world.\"\n\n\"This deal is another example of our two governments working together,\" Premier Doug Ford said, calling the deal a \"game-changer for the industry.\"\n\n\"It's the largest auto investment in Canadian history. It's a tremendous win for Ontario, for our workers for all of Canada,\" he added.\n\nThe $15 billion investment includes the retooling of an assembly plant in Alliston that will be able to fully manufacture electric vehicles. The new battery plant will be the third in Ontario as Stellantis LG already has a plant in Windsor and Volkswagen in St. Thomas, Ont.\n\nTwo other key battery parts facilities in Ontario are also part of the deal, manufacturing cathodes and separators. The locations for the two key battery parts facilities will be announced in the future.\n\nThe Honda deal is also linked to the 10 percent Electric Vehicle Supply Chain investment tax credit, which is part of the 2024 federal budget. Honda is also able to claim an existing 30 percent Clean Technology Manufacturing Investment tax credit on top of the 10 percent credit.\n\nMr. Giroux said Ottawa is likely to pay $12.8 billion in federal production support, $700 million in contributions through the Strategic Innovation Fund, and a further $2.8 billion in tax adjustments as part of the deal.\n\nThe plan has drawn criticism from Alberta Premier Danielle Smith who argued last year that the regulations were \"unconstitutional\" and vowed to challenge the implementation of them in Alberta.\n\nWhile Ms. Smith stated she supported Albertans who wished to drive low or zero-emission vehicles, but added, \"these efforts must be led by and support consumers and businesses, and the federal government has no legal or moral authority to tell Albertans what vehicles they can and cannot buy.\"", "source": {"uri": "theepochtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "www.theepochtimes.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The company will manufacture 240,000 vehicles a year at the facility, while a standalone battery plant in Alliston, Ontario -- a town that's a little more than an hour's drive north of Toronto where it currently produces gasoline-powered Honda CR-V and Civic models. The battery plant will have a capacity of 36 gigawatt hours.\n\nThe push to develop the battery supply chain will also see Honda begin talks with South Korea's POSCO Future M Co. for a cathode materials facility, and it plans to partner with Japan's Asahi Kasei Corp. on separator production.\n\nFor Honda, it's part of a long-term bet on consumer demand for electric vehicles in North America and pushes it toward its goal of having electrified cars account for 100% of sales by 2040. The company already makes hybrid cars in the United States and has said it plans to start manufacturing its first U.S.-made fully electric vehicles in Marysville, Ohio, next year.\n\nHonda's new investments are also set to wean its reliance on external manufacturers for batteries and brings it closer to the raw materials crucial to the clean-energy transition.\n\n\"We want to use Canada's rich resources and energy to be able to establish an EV-focused value chain,\" Executive Vice-President Shinji Aoyoma said at the company's headquarters in Tokyo on Thursday. Honda expects it can cut its battery-making costs 20% by producing them on its own, he said.\n\nThe investment is a major milestone for Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Ontario Premier Doug Ford in their quest to secure a share of the North American auto business for Canada as the industry retools toward EVs. The two politicians have already pledged tens of billions of dollars to convince other manufacturers, including Volkswagen AG, to build huge EV battery plants in the country.\n\nThe company will be able to access investment tax credits from the government of Canada, as well as direct and indirect incentives provided by the province of Ontario. The total package of government help may be worth as much as C$5 billion.\n\nThe subsidies are structured differently from the ones Canada promised last year to Volkswagen, Stellantis NV and Sweden's Northvolt. Those companies received contracts that will pay a portion of the cost of each battery produced in their Canadian plants -- in effect matching the money that's available to EV battery makers under the US Inflation Reduction Act.\n\nHonda was not offered a production subsidy, government officials have told Bloomberg. Trudeau has repeatedly said Canada can only afford to go so far in matching U.S. manufacturing incentives.", "source": {"uri": "detroitnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Detroit News"},

He called it a double down on Canada and an announcement that I think will be heard around the world.\n\nHonda doesn't make speculative bets, he said. They've been in Canada for almost 40 years. They've never retreated, they've never gone back. This is, for Canadian suppliers, an extremely bankable customer to get.\n\nEnjoying the hype this announcement is generating means ignoring, for the time being, the fact that most of Northern Ontario's critical minerals are years (if not decades) away from powering all the new EVs Canadians will be federally mandated to purchase after 2035 to meet federal carbon emissions targets.\n\nIt means overlooking the fact that Ford's government remains well short of the Indigenous partnerships and permissions it will need to fulfil its Ring of Fire mining aspirations. It means dismissing the failure to date of early consumer incentives and spiking spring gas prices to set off a rush of EV sales, and the fact that many of the new EVs on Ontario's roads were imported from a Tesla gigafactory in Shanghai.\n\nHere in Ontario, we've become a world leader in the electric vehicle revolution, Ford bragged.\n\nFord said the deal coming this week will be double the size of Volkswagen.\n\nThe $7 billion VW battery plant now under construction in St. Thomas, Ont., covers roughly 150 hectares -- over 200 football fields. It's like a city in itself, Ford said.\n\nIt was not clear from Ford's comments if he meant Honda's new operation will cover twice the acreage of the Volkswagen plant, or if its investment is double the size of the Volkswagen deal. Either way, it's historic.\n\nIn January, the Japanese news outlet Nikkei was the first to report Honda was considering an investment of 2 trillion yen (about $18 billion Cdn) to start up an EV supply chain in Canada.\n\nFord's economic development minister, Vic Fedeli, appeared to confirm Thursday's figures could be on that scale when speaking to reporters at Queen's Park on Monday.\n\nOntario's EV investments went from zero to $28 billion in three years, he said, before hedging slightly.\n\nIf the premier, if his comments are correct, he added, then next week we'll be announcing $43 billion in EV, or a number in and around there.\n\nSo is Honda about to invest $15 billion in Ontario?\n\nNot so fast. In a subsequent report published Tuesday, Nikkei said Honda was preparing a one-trillion yen announcement (approximately $8.8 billion.)\n\nAs the premier told his Monday audience, stay tuned.\n\nThe timing of Honda's announcement was a business decision -- but it's a happy coincidence for Prime Minister Justin Trudeau that it fell in the midst of his ministers' post-budget marketing tour.\n\nOnly a few months after Trudeau signalled that the federal government was running out of money for automotive subsidies -- prompting fears that Toyota Canada would hit the brakes on further Ontario expansion (new window) -- a change in government tactics apparently paid off.\n\nCanada's share of North American manufacturing could have been in jeopardy if the federal and provincial governments hadn't stepped up with both investment tax credits and production subsidies to compete with the Inflation Reduction Act introduced by U.S. President Joe Biden.\n\nThose billions were enough to land Ontario its first two battery plants: the VW plant in St. Thomas and the Stellantis facility in Windsor. But the Trudeau government warned at the time that their production subsidies aren't sustainable.\n\nThe sweeteners offered to land this Honda deal are more predictable because they're based on the value of Honda's investment, not future production levels.\n\nIn the 2023 federal budget, the Liberals introduced a clean manufacturing investment tax credit that rebates 30 per cent of the cost of new machinery and equipment. Its implementation legislation, C-59, has yet to pass; the Liberals hope it receives royal assent by June.\n\nLast week, the 2024 federal budget introduced a ten per cent electric vehicle supply chain investment tax credit to offset the cost of buildings. Companies receiving the tax credit must invest in three parts of the EV supply chain: EV assembly, battery production and production of cathode active material for those batteries.\n\nFinance Minister Chrystia Freeland's department took the lead in federal talks with Honda; her budget forecasts a $80 million expenditure on this tax credit over the next five years. The federal government has hinted it anticipates about $800 million in investment on eligible buildings between now and 2029.\n\nHonda appears set to be the first -- and possibly the only -- carmaker to make the vertical investments required to access this credit, with an expansion of its facilities in Alliston as well as other yet-to-be announced expansions in Ontario.\n\nWATCH: Honda set to bet big on Canada's EV sector\n\nCBC News has confirmed that Honda is gearing up to announce a multibillion-dollar deal to build electric vehicles in Canada. Though not all the details are known, Ontario's premier hinted it's the 'largest deal in Canadian history.'\n\nCBC News has not confirmed that a site earmarked for EV battery production in St. Clair township near Sarnia, Ont. (new window), is part of Honda's negotiations. Fedeli said Monday that land in Wilmot township near Waterloo, Ont (new window)., was not part of Honda's plans.\n\nQuebec's economy minister, Pierre Fitzgibbon, told reporters at the National Assembly Tuesday that he was in talks to land a piece of Honda's business at the industrial park in B\u00e9cancour, Que., where other automotive giants are setting up cathode materials manufacturing.\n\nFitzgibbon admitted he was outbid by Ontario (new window).\n\nTo help attract EV investment, Ontario's 2023 provincial budget included a 10 per cent refundable corporate income tax credit for eligible investments in buildings, machinery and equipment, worth up to $2 million a year for individual corporations.\n\nThe Toronto Star has reported (new window) that when the Stellantis deal was in jeopardy, the federal government convinced the Ford government to pile on more provincial subsidies in return for federal cooperation on the environmental assessments required to build Highway 413.\n\nIt's not known whether a similar last-minute squeeze happened in the Honda talks. Ontario Finance Minister Peter Bethlenfalvy's statement in reaction to the April 16 federal budget nodded to this Highway 413 quid pro quo and revived Ontario's demand for the federal government to eliminate duplicative reviews and processes that are slowing down Ring of Fire projects.\n\nVolpe said the new rules hammered out during the NAFTA renegotiation talks anticipated the transition to electrified powertrain products and batteries by making sure carmakers couldn't source components offshore (China, mainly) without risking tariffs.\n\nDuring a 2023 visit to Canada, Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida called China a central challenge.\n\nGeopolitically, Japan is far more comfortable working with Canada to source the critical minerals its automotive engineers need.\n\nLast September, Japan's economy, trade and investment minister Yasutoshi Nishimura visited Ottawa (new window) with a delegation of Japanese businesspeople from its battery supply chain association (BASC (new window)) and corporations like Panasonic Energy, Asahi-Kasei, Mitsubishi, Mitsui and Sumitomo. They signed memoranda of cooperation with Canadian companies about sharing technology and business intelligence.\n\nThis week's Honda announcement will be Canada's biggest EV investment deal so far. But it wasn't the first and it's not expected to be the last.\n\nNow that Honda's seen enough to place its bet and become Ontario's third EV battery maker, attention will turn to whether Toyota might reconsider becoming the fourth -- and whether Canada's clean power grids can accommodate more ambition.", "source": {"uri": "ici.radio-canada.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "Radio Canada"},

week, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's government introduced a new business tax credit, granting companies a 10 percent rebate on construction costs for new buildings used in key segments of the electric vehicle supply chain.\n\nCanada's strategy follows that of the neighboring United States, whose Inflation Reduction Act has provided a host of incentives for green industry.\n\nHonda hopes to

Mr. Fedeli said Honda was attracted to Ontario by its skilled workforce, its comparatively clean energy grid, and the fact that the critical minerals needed in EV batteries can be found in the province.\n\nMr. Fedeli said the plan would see 240,000 vehicles a year manufactured at the site, and preserve its existing 4,200 jobs while adding another 1,000. The planned EV battery assembly plant would be about a third of the size of the massive battery factory the governments were able to attract Volkswagen to build in St. Thomas, Ont.\n\nHe said the deal also involves South Korea's POSCO Future M Co., Ltd and Japan's Asahi Kasei Corp., both of whom are to build plants to build EV battery components - cathodes and separators - in other cities in Ontario. Those details, he said, would be announced at a later date.\n\nFederal Industry Minister Fran\u00e7ois Champagne told The Globe and Mail the deal was historic.\n\n\"This is massive. This is beyond anything we've seen in the auto sector yet,\" he said.\n\nThe Globe and Mail has previously reported that the deal with Honda includes a standalone battery-manufacturing plant, a retooled car-assembly plant, as well as facilities for battery components.\n\nEarlier this week, Mr. Ford said the new deal was \"the largest deal in Canadian history,\" and that it would be \" \"double the size of Volkswagen.\n\nBoth the scope of Honda's investment and the way that governments will back it mark a pivot in Canada's strategy to establish itself a major player in the global race to build EV supply chains, as the auto sector shifts away from making vehicles powered by fossil fuels.\n\nTo date, federal and provincial governments have committed as much as $33-billion in production subsidies to land three EV battery factories - up to $15-billion for Stellantis (in partnership with LG Energy Solution), up to $13.2-billion for Volkswagen in Ontario and up to $4.6-billion for Northvolt AB in Quebec. (Those maximum totals would only be reached if the factories began full-capacity production of batteries at the earliest possible date, because the subsidies are time-limited.)\n\nThe governments have also announced approximately $5-billion to support the capital costs of those three projects combined. Additional billions have cumulatively been promised to land separate commitments by automakers to retool their vehicle-assembly lines, and to attract investments in battery materials higher up the supply chain.", "source": {"uri": "theglobeandmail.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Globe and Mail"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_battery",

The majority of it is in Ontario where the largest other traditional automakers - General Motors, Ford Motor, Toyota and Stellantis - have plants and close ties by road and trade with their Detroit headquarters in the United States. It's another boost to the province's goal of mining battery minerals in the north for plants in the south around Lake Ontario's Golden Horseshoe.\n\nTax incentives\n\nHonda may benefit from $5 billion in government tax breaks. Ottawa can offer about $2.5 billion through the proposed electric vehicle supply chain and clean technology manufacturing investment tax credits. Ontario may provide up to $2.5 billion through direct and indirect incentives, according to the government.\n\nThe assembly and battery manufacturing plants are expected to create more than 1,000 jobs, and the processing and separator plants would create thousands more direct and indirect jobs, the company said. Ontario Premier Doug Ford said each new job would in fact add seven to the economy because of their impact.\n\n\"This is generational investments that their families, their kids may be working here, and we've seen this grow as one of the number one industries and sectors right here in Ontario,\" Ford said in Alliston, where the new plants are to be built. \"The mayor said it best: 'Honda is a class act.' They're a key pillar in the community.\"\n\nThe existing Honda operation at Alliston includes two auto plants and one engine factory. They can produce more than 400,000 vehicles and 190,000 engines a year. The company employs more than 4,200 workers in Alliston and has a network of more than 280 dealerships across the country. Ottawa and Queen's Park had each given Honda $131.6 million to help it retool its manufacturing operations in Alliston for hybrid EVs.\n\nZero emission\n\nCanada is targeting all vehicle sold by 2035 will be zero-emission. The country's automotive sector is one of its largest export industries. It builds more than 1.5 million vehicles a year and supports nearly 550,000 direct and indirect jobs.\n\nRecent EV supply chain investments in Canada include $7 billion for a new battery manufacturing facility by Northvolt Batteries North America in Saint-Basile-le-Grand and McMasterville, Que.; $7 billion for Volkswagen's first overseas EV battery manufacturing plant, in St. Thomas, Ont.; and more than $5 billion from Stellantis and LG Energy Solution to make EV batteries in Windsor, Ont.\n\nOthers are $1.8 billion for Ford's repurposed battery-EV production plant in Oakville, Ont.;\n\n$1.5 billion for Umicore to make battery components in Loyalist Township, Ont.; $1.2 billion for a new battery materials plant by Ford, South Korea's EcoProBM and SK On in B\u00e9cancour, Que.; and $600 million for a GM and POSCO Future M Co cathode facility in B\u00e9cancour.", "source": {"uri": "northernminer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Northern Miner"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Check out their Stories!\n\nJapanese auto giant Honda announced Thursday the largest automotive investment in Canada's history, worth Can$15 billion (US$11 billion), for a massive new EV battery and vehicle assembly plant.\n\nHonda chief executive Toshihiro Mibe told a joint news conference with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and other officials that electric vehicles (EVs) will start rolling off the new assembly line in 2028.\n\nOnce fully operational, the factory will have a production capacity of 240,000 vehicles per year, and a batteries output of 36 GWh per year.\n\n\"The world is changing rapidly, and we must work toward realizing carbon neutrality to sustain the global environment,\" Mibe said.\n\nHonda estimates that 1,000 new jobs will be created at the facility, which is to be built next to its existing Civic and CR-V assembly plants north of Toronto that already employ 4,200 workers.\n\nTrudeau touted Ottawa's efforts to set up \"a whole ecosystem\" around the production of electric batteries, positioning Canada as an attractive destination for electric vehicle investment, with generous tax incentives, renewable energy access and its rare mineral deposits.\n\n\"Because of the choices our government has made over the past few years, Canada now ranks first, globally in Bloomberg's ranking of lithium-ion battery supply chains,\" Trudeau said.\n\nOntario Premier Doug Ford noted that his province is \"the only place in the world that six of the largest automakers call home\" and with Honda's investment is now \"leading the world in the

facilities used in key segments of the electric vehicle supply chain.\n\nThe estimated value of the federal tax credit for Honda's new facility is Can$2.5 billion, while Ford said the province is

The company will manufacture 240,000 vehicles a year at the facility, while a standalone battery plant in Alliston, Ontario -- a town that's a little more than an hour's drive north of Toronto where it currently produces gasoline-powered Honda CR-V and Civic models. The battery plant will have a capacity of 36 gigawatt hours.\n\nThe push to develop the battery supply chain will also see Honda begin talks with South Korea's POSCO Future M Co. for a cathode materials facility, and it plans to partner with Japan's Asahi Kasei Corp. on separator production.\n\nBloomberg News reported details of Honda's plan earlier Thursday.\n\nFor Honda, it's part of a long-term bet on consumer demand for electric vehicles in North America and pushes it toward its goal of having electrified cars account for 100% of sales by 2040. The company already makes hybrid cars in the US and has said it plans to start manufacturing its first US-made fully electric vehicles in Marysville, Ohio next year.\n\nHonda's new investments are also set to wean its reliance on external manufacturers for batteries and brings it closer to the raw materials crucial to the clean-energy transition.\n\n\"We want to use Canada's rich resources and energy to be able to establish an EV-focused value chain,\" Executive Vice-President Shinji Aoyoma said at the company's headquarters in Tokyo on Thursday. Honda expects it can cut its battery-making costs 20% by producing them on its own, he said.\n\nThe investment is a major milestone for Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Ontario Premier Doug Ford in their quest to secure a share of the North American auto business for Canada as the industry retools toward EVs. The two politicians have already pledged tens of billions of dollars to convince other manufacturers, including Volkswagen AG, to build huge EV battery plants in the country.\n\nRead More: Electric Cars Pass Mass Adoption Tipping Point in 31 Countries\n\nThe company will be able to access investment tax credits from the government of Canada, as well as direct and indirect incentives provided by the province of Ontario. The total package of government help may be worth as much as C$5 billion.\n\nThe subsidies are structured differently from the ones Canada promised last year to Volkswagen, Stellantis NV and Sweden's Northvolt. Those companies received contracts that will pay a portion of the cost of each battery produced in their Canadian plants -- in effect matching the money that's available to EV battery makers under the US Inflation Reduction Act.\n\nHonda was not offered a production subsidy, government officials have told Bloomberg. Trudeau has repeatedly said Canada can only afford to go so far in matching US manufacturing incentives.", "source": {"uri": "bnnbloomberg.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "BNN"}, "authors": [],

According to local government officials, the deal could be worth double what Volkswagen announced last year.\n\nOntario Premier Doug Ford and Economic Development Minister Vic Fedeli have suggested that the project is worth 14 to 15 billion Canadian dollars, which is about 10 to 11 billion US dollars. Volkswagen's battery subsidiary PowerCo plans to invest 7 billion Canadian dollars in its above-mentioned battery plant in St Thomas by 2030.\n\nBut back to Honda: Japanese media previously reported that Honda is looking to build its own batteries in Canada. According to that information, the new plant could go into operation by 2028. Reuters reports, citing insiders, that the carmaker will build batteries and process cathode material needed for the latter. EV production will take place at the existing auto manufacturing facility in Alliston.\n\nIt would be the third EV battery plant in Ontario, following the announcements of PowerCo and Stellantis and LGES. The latter are building a factory in Windsor. Both projects received hefty subsidies, so it is safe to assume that Honda will as well. Moreover, the Canadian government just introduced a new investment tax credit, giving companies 10 per cent off the costs of setting up new buildings to house key segments of the EV supply chain.\n\nThe planned Canadian electric vehicle plant would be Honda's second in North America. The carmaker already wants to manufacture batteries with LG Energy Solutions in the US state of Ohio from 2025. The factory near Jeffersonville will have an annual capacity of 40 GWh. Honda will also convert its existing Honda plants in Ohio, the Marysville Auto Plant (MAP), East Liberty Auto Plant (ELP) and Anna Engine Plant (AEP), with the aim of starting production and sales of electric cars based on the new Honda e:Architecture in 2026.\n\nThis all comes as Honda is looking to increase EV sales in North America. According to Nikkei, North America accounts for roughly 40 per cent of Honda's global sales. Most of the vehicles sold there still have combustion engines. However, the Japanese want electric cars to account for 40 per cent of sales in North America by 2030 - and even 80 per cent by 2035.", "source": {"uri": "electrive.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Honda has begun evaluating the requirements to build an innovative and environmentally responsible Honda EV plant and a stand-alone Honda EV battery plant in Alliston, Ontario. The proposed Honda EV value chain will also include a cathode active material and precursor (CAM/pCAM) processing plant through a joint venture partnership with POSCO Future M Co., Ltd. and a separator plant through a joint venture partnership with Asahi Kasei Corporation, with announcements to follow in their respective Ontario communities.\n\nHonda expects that electric vehicle production will begin in 2028. Once fully operational, the EV plant will have a production capacity of 240,000 EVs per year and the EV battery plant will have a capacity of 36 GWh per year. In addition to securing the current employment level of 4,200 associates at its two existing manufacturing facilities in Ontario, Honda estimates it will add a minimum of 1,000 new associates for the EV and EV battery manufacturing facilities. The investment in the new facilities will also create significant spinoff jobs across all sites, including in the construction sector.\n\nHonda has begun the process of evaluating the scope of its investment and completing negotiations with its joint venture partners. This work is expected to be finalized during the next six months and more details will be shared at that time.\n\nTo support this project, Honda is collaborating with the governments of Canada and Ontario to drive innovation in low-emissions manufacturing by accessing performance-based initiatives available through the federal government's new Investment Tax Credits and provincial direct and indirect incentives.", "source": {"uri": "global.honda", "dataType": "news", "title": "Honda Global"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honda_EV_Plus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Honda EV Plus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_venture", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joint venture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Electric vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honda", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Honda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_chain", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Value chain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "North America"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Canadian dollar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontario", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ontario"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ontario"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alliston", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alliston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Alliston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_battery", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electric battery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric-vehicle_battery", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electric-vehicle battery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathode", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cathode"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilowatt-hour", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kilowatt-hour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asahi_Kasei", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Asahi Kasei"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_credit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tax credit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporate_spin-off", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Corporate spin-off"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Canada", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Government of Canada"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Venture_Capital", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Venture Capital", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Socially_Responsible", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Socially Responsible", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Electric_Vehicles", "label": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Electric Vehicles", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Motorcycles/Maintenance", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Motorcycles/Maintenance", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://global.honda/en/common/dam_img/honda_sns.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9500357", "eventUri": "eng-9500357", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.7490196078431373, "wgt": 179, "relevance": 1}

The battery plant will have a capacity of 36 gigawatt hours.\n\nThe push to develop the battery supply chain will also see Honda begin talks with South Korea's Posco Future M for a cathode materials facility, and it plans to partner with Japan's Asahi Kase on separator production.\n\nBloomberg News reported details of Honda's plan earlier on Thursday.\n\nFor Honda, it's part of a long-term bet on consumer demand for electric vehicles in North America and pushes it towards its goal of having electrified cars account for 100 per cent of sales by 2040. The company already makes hybrid cars in the US and has said it plans to start manufacturing its first US-made fully electric vehicles in Marysville, Ohio next year.\n\nHonda's new investments are also set to wean its reliance on external manufacturers for batteries and brings it closer to the raw materials crucial to the clean-energy transition.\n\n\"We want to use Canada's rich resources and energy to be able to establish an EV-focused value chain,\" Executive vice-president Shinji Aoyoma said at the company's headquarters in Tokyo on Thursday. Honda expects it can cut its battery-making costs 20 per cent by producing them on its own, he said.\n\nThe investment is a major milestone for Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Ontario Premier Doug Ford in their quest to secure a share of the North American auto business for Canada as the industry retools towards EVs. The two politicians have already pledged tens of billions of US dollars to convince other manufacturers, including Volkswagen, to build huge EV battery plants in the country.\n\nThe company will be able to access investment tax credits from the government of Canada, as well as direct and indirect incentives provided by the province of Ontario. The total package of government help may be worth as much as C$5 billion.\n\nThe subsidies are structured differently from the ones Canada promised last year to Volkswagen, Stellantis and Sweden's Northvolt. Those companies received contracts that will pay a portion of the cost of each battery produced in their Canadian plants - in effect matching the money that's available to EV battery makers under the US Inflation Reduction Act.\n\nHonda was not offered a production subsidy, government officials have told Bloomberg. Trudeau has repeatedly said Canada can only afford to go so far in matching US manufacturing incentives.

Details of the investment are due to be finalised later this year.\n\nThe EV and battery plants will be constructed adjacent to existing four-wheeled vehicle and engine plants and the total workforce will increase by around 1,000 people from 4,200 now, Honda said.\n\nIt also announced a plan to work with South Korean steel giant POSCO for the production of battery cathode materials, and with Asahi Kasei to make separators.\n\nBy handling everything from material development to vehicle assembly in Ontario - including bringing battery production in house and sourcing locally - Honda expects to reduce costs by more than 20% from current methods.\n\nCanada has wooed companies involved in all parts of the EV supply chain to bolster its manufacturing heartland in Ontario as the world seeks to cut carbon emissions.\n\n\"Honda's investment is a vote of confidence in Canada, in Canadian auto workers, and in our manufacturing sector. Together, we're creating good-paying jobs, growing our economy, and keeping our air clean,\" Trudeau said.\n\nNorth America accounts for approximately 30% of Honda's global four-wheeled vehicle sales.\n\nHonda is currently overhauling facilities at its U.S. plant in Ohio, with an investment of $700 million, and constructing a battery plant in a joint venture with LG Energy Solution for $4.4 billion.\n\n($1 = 1.3676 Canadian dollars) (Additional reporting by David Ljunggren in Ottawa;

The company makes hybrid vehicles at factories in Ohio and Indiana, according to its website, and it plans to start manufacturing its first U.S.-made fully electric vehicles in Marysville, Ohio next year.\n\nThe Honda investment comes at an anxious moment for the auto sector, with consumer adoption of electric vehicles playing out slowly in some regions because of high prices and a shortage of charging stations. Tesla Inc. is cutting more than 10 per cent of its global workforce, Chinese producer BYD Co. reported a sharp drop in deliveries of electric vehicles in the first quarter, and other automakers have delayed EV investments.\n\nStill, manufacturers are making long-term bets. Last month, Honda and Nissan Motor Co. announced a plan to collaborate on technology for battery-based electric vehicles, including software, as they seek to keep up with Chinese rivals.\n\nThe negotiations between Honda and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's government have taken many months and centred on investment tax credits, or ITCs, as the means by which the government will help pay for the capital costs of the factories.

Ltd. that would see the company build a comprehensive electric vehicle chain in the province, according to sources familiar with the project.\n\nThe deal with Honda includes a standalone battery manufacturing and a retooled car assembly plant, as well as facilities for both cathode materials and separator components, according to two sources. The Globe and Mail is not identifying the sources who are not authorized to speak publicly about internal matters. The battery and assembly plants will be in Alliston, Ont., where the company already manufactures vehicles. The other two will be at another location in Ontario, the sources said.\n\nThe specifics of the deal are not yet known. But speaking at a First Nations conference in Toronto on Monday morning, Ontario Premier Doug Ford said the size of the investment will surpass other electric-vehicle deals in the province.\n\n\"This week, we've landed a new deal. It'll be the largest deal in Canadian history. It'll be double the size of Volkswagen. So stay tuned, we'll be announcing it this week,\" he said. The Volkswagen EV plant in St. Thomas, Ont., is expected to cost $7-billion in capital costs.\n\nOntario's involvement in the project extends back years. In March 2022, Honda announced the retooling of its Alliston plant to manufacturing the company's next generation models, including hybrids, and that summer Ontario officials met with Honda to discuss a potential investment in battery electric vehicle production, according to sources.\n\nSince 2022, Vic Fedeli, Ontario's Minister of Economic Development, Job Creation and Trade, and his team travelled to Japan three times, and Japanese Honda executives travelled to Toronto three times. The province also sent two formal letters to Honda Canada to signal Ontario's support for an investment in battery electric vehicle production in Alliston, as well as the province's willingness to consider an incentive package for Honda's EV and EV battery investment. According to sources, the deal was solidified at a Dec. 15, 2023 meeting with Mr. Ford and his team. Mr. Fedeli travelled to Tokyo as recently as April 4.\n\nLast week's federal budget included a new tax credit that would provide companies with a 10-per-cent rebate on the costs of constructing new buildings to be used in the electric-vehicle supply chain.\n\nIt would be atop other such incentives to which Ottawa has previously committed, including a 30-per-cent manufacturing investment tax credit, as well as provincial supports.\n\nBut unlike those other credits, this one would only be available to companies making across-the-board investments in battery-making, the manufacturing of battery components known as cathode active materials, and vehicle assembly.\n\nHonda is the only automaker known to be in advanced talks with the federal and provincial governments for a Canadian EV-sector commitment of that breadth. Earlier this year, the Japanese news group Nikkei reported that the company is considering an investment here of up to $18.5-billion - pointing toward more comprehensive Canadian supply chain plans

Honda has begun evaluating the requirements to build an innovative and environmentally responsible Honda EV plant and a stand-alone Honda EV battery plant in Alliston, Ontario. The proposed Honda EV value chain will also include a cathode active material and precursor (CAM/pCAM) processing plant through a joint venture partnership with POSCO Future M Co., Ltd. and a separator plant through a joint venture partnership with Asahi Kasei Corporation, with announcements to follow in their respective Ontario communities.\n\nHonda expects that electric vehicle production will begin in 2028. Once fully operational, the EV plant will have a production capacity of 240,000 EVs per year and the EV battery plant will have a capacity of 36 GWh per year. In addition to securing the current employment level of 4,200 associates at its two existing manufacturing facilities in Ontario, Honda estimates it will add a minimum of 1,000 new associates for the EV and EV battery manufacturing facilities. The investment in the new facilities will also create significant spinoff jobs across all sites, including in the construction sector.\n\nHonda has begun the process of evaluating the scope of its investment and completing negotiations with its joint venture partners. This work is expected to be finalized during the next six months and more details will be shared at that time.\n\nTo support this project, Honda is collaborating with the governments of Canada and Ontario to drive innovation in low-emissions manufacturing by accessing performance-based initiatives available through the federal government's new Investment Tax Credits and provincial direct and indirect incentives.\n\nStriving to realize carbon neutrality for all its products and corporate activities by 2050, Honda has set a goal to make BEVs and FCEVs represent 100% of vehicle sales by 2040. To achieve this goal, Honda will continue offering attractive products in this electrified era globally, including its largest market of North America.\n\nAs the first step in achieving this electrification goal in North America, Honda positioned its existing auto production plants in the state of Ohio in the U.S. as its EV Hub for production, including the retooling of existing plants, an investment of USD$700 million, and the construction of a joint venture EV battery plant with LG Energy Solution, with an expected investment of USD$4.4 billion.\n\nThe Ohio EV hub will serve as the foundation for future EV and EV battery production, sharing knowledge and expertise with other Honda plants in North America, including the new EV assembly and battery plants in Ontario, Canada. Honda expects EV production to begin at the Marysville Auto Plant in late 2025.\n\nAs a second step in this initiative, Honda will strive to establish a comprehensive EV value chain that includes all aspects of EV production in Canada, from the procurement of raw materials mainly for batteries, to the production of finished EVs. Honda will leverage EV production knowledge learned at the Ohio EV Hub, combined with the abundant resources and clean energy available in Canada, to establish a stable supply system for batteries, the key component of EVs, and increase cost competitiveness of its EVs as a whole.\n\nFor more information, photos and future updates, please visit www.hondanews.ca.\n\nComments by Toshihiro Mibe, Global CEO of Honda:\n\n\"Honda is making progress in our global initiatives toward the realization of our 2050 carbon neutrality goal. In North America, following the initiative to establish our EV production system capability in the U.S., we will now begin formal discussions toward the establishment of a comprehensive EV value chain here in Canada, with the support of the governments of Canada and Ontario. We will strengthen our EV supply system and capability with an eye toward a future increase in EV demand in North America.\"\n\nComments by Jean Marc Leclerc, President and CEO of Honda Canada Inc.:\n\n\"Honda of Canada Manufacturing is one of the premier automotive manufacturing facilities in the world and for nearly forty years, our work has been guided by determination, innovation, and a relentless drive to evolve.

Details of the investment are due to be finalised later this year.\n\nThe EV and battery plants will be constructed adjacent to existing four-wheeled vehicle and engine plants and the total workforce will increase by around 1,000 people from 4,200 now, Honda said.\n\nIt also announced a plan to work with South Korean steel giant POSCO for the production of battery cathode materials, and with Asahi Kasei to make separators.\n\nBy handling everything from material development to vehicle assembly in Ontario - including bringing battery production in house and sourcing locally - Honda expects to reduce costs by more than 20 per cent from current methods.\n\nCanada has wooed companies involved in all parts of the EV supply chain to bolster its manufacturing heartland in Ontario as the world seeks to cut carbon emissions.\n\n\"Honda's investment is a vote of confidence in Canada, in Canadian auto workers, and in our manufacturing sector. Together, we're creating good-paying jobs, growing our economy, and keeping our air clean,\" Trudeau said.\n\nNorth America accounts for approximately 30 per cent of Honda's global four-wheeled vehicle sales.\n\nHonda is currently overhauling facilities at its U.S. plant in Ohio, with an investment of $700 million, and constructing a battery plant in a joint venture with LG Energy Solution for $4.4 billion.\n\n(Additional reporting by David Ljunggren in Ottawa; Editing by David Dolan, Mark Potter, Elaine Hardcastle)", "source": {"uri": "channelnewsasia.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Honda has begun evaluating the requirements to build an innovative and environmentally responsible Honda EV plant and a stand-alone Honda EV battery plant in Alliston, Ontario. The proposed Honda EV value chain will also include a cathode active material and precursor (CAM/pCAM) processing plant through a joint venture partnership with POSCO Future M Co., Ltd. and a separator plant through a joint venture partnership with Asahi Kasei Corporation, with announcements to follow in their respective Ontario communities.\n\nHonda expects that electric vehicle production will begin in 2028. Once fully operational, the EV plant will have a production capacity of 240,000 EVs per year and the EV battery plant will have a capacity of 36 GWh per year. In addition to securing the current employment level of 4,200 associates at its two existing manufacturing facilities in Ontario, Honda estimates it will add a minimum of 1,000 new associates for the EV and EV battery manufacturing facilities. The investment in the new facilities will also create significant spinoff jobs across all sites, including in the construction sector.\n\nHonda has begun the process of evaluating the scope of its investment and completing negotiations with its joint venture partners. This work is expected to be finalized during the next six months and more details will be shared at that time.\n\nTo support this project, Honda is collaborating with the governments of Canada and Ontario to drive innovation in low-emissions manufacturing by accessing performance-based initiatives available through the federal government's new Investment Tax Credits and provincial direct and indirect incentives.\n\nStriving to realize carbon neutrality for all its products and corporate activities by 2050, Honda has set a goal to make BEVs and FCEVs represent 100% of vehicle sales by 2040. To achieve this goal, Honda will continue offering attractive products in this electrified era globally, including its largest market of North America.\n\nAs the first step in achieving this electrification goal in North America, Honda positioned its existing auto production plants in the state of Ohio in the U.S. as its EV Hub for production, including the retooling of existing plants, an investment of USD$700 million, and the construction of a joint venture EV battery plant with LG Energy Solution, with an expected investment of USD$4.4 billion.\n\nThe Ohio EV hub will serve as the foundation for future EV and EV battery production, sharing knowledge and expertise with other Honda plants in North America, including the new EV assembly and battery plants in Ontario, Canada. Honda expects EV production to begin at the Marysville Auto Plant in late 2025.\n\nAs a second step in this initiative, Honda will strive to establish a comprehensive EV value chain that includes all aspects of EV production in Canada, from the procurement of raw materials mainly for batteries, to the production of finished EVs. Honda will leverage EV production knowledge learned at the Ohio EV Hub, combined with the abundant resources and clean energy available in Canada, to establish a stable supply system for batteries, the key component of EVs, and increase cost competitiveness of its EVs as a whole.\n\nFurthermore, with an eye toward secondary use and the recycling of batteries, Honda will realize low-carbon value creation throughout the entire battery life cycle, through which Honda will establish a highly profitable business foundation and contribute to the realization of a carbon-neutral society.\n\nFor more information, photos and future updates, please visit www.hondanews.ca.\n\nComments by Toshihiro Mibe, Global CEO of Honda:\n\n\"Honda is making progress in our global initiatives toward the realization of our 2050 carbon neutrality goal. In North America, following the initiative to establish our EV production system capability in the U.S., we will now begin formal discussions toward the establishment of a comprehensive EV value chain here in Canada, with the support of the governments of Canada and Ontario. We will strengthen our EV supply system and capability with an eye toward a future increase in EV demand in North America.\"\n\nComments by Jean Marc Leclerc, President and CEO of Honda Canada Inc.:\n\n\"Honda of Canada Manufacturing is one of the premier automotive manufacturing facilities in the world and for nearly forty years, our work has been guided by determination, innovation, and a relentless drive to evolve.

Standalone announcements that include full details of both facilities will be made at later dates, but in a separate announcement April 25, Asahi Kasei said it plans to build a roughly $1.5-billion separator plant in Ontario that will open in 2027.\n\nRECORD INVESTMENT\n\nThe $15 billion in combined spending sets a new high-water mark for Canadian automotive investment, eclipsing Volkswagen Group's $7-billion commitment to build a sprawling battery-cell plant in St. Thomas, Ont. made just over a year ago.\n\nThe EV battery plant planned for Alliston is the fourth battery plant Canada has secured over the past two years, as both federal and provincial governments work overtime to establish the country as a key battery and EV production hub.\n\nIn addition to Volkswagen's plans, Sweden-based Northvolt said it would build a $7-billion cell plant outside Montreal in September 2023. A joint venture between South Korea battery-cell maker LG Energy Solution and Stellantis made the first battery commitment to Canada in March 2022; the companies are now well into construction on a $5-billion cell site in Windsor, Ont.\n\nHonda's plans are the most highly integrated of the four battery plants, with the automaker playing an active role in EV assembly, battery manufacturing and battery component production. This will qualify Honda for the new 10 per cent Electric Vehicle Supply Chain investment tax credit proposed in the 2024 federal budget.\n\nThe federal government pledged up to $2.5 billion in investment tax credits to support Honda's set of projects, while the Ontario government will contribute up to a matching $2.5 billion in direct and indirect incentives.\n\nThe capital-spending support for Honda differs from the three battery-cell manufacturing deals previously struck by Ottawa, which were structured to match production subsidies offered in the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). The federal government estimates costs for those three deals will total $37.7 billion over the next decade.\n\nThe EV supply chain spending will vastly increase Honda's presence in Canada, where it currently builds its CR-V crossover, Civic sedan and four-cylinder engines.\n\nNEW PRODUCT UNKNOWN\n\nThe company did not specify which future products it will build in Alliston, but auto analyst Sam Fiorani forecasts Honda will begin production of a small electric crossover at its campus in 2027, after production of the current Civic has run its course. An electric crossover from luxury brand Acura will follow in 2028, he added.\n\nFiorani, the vice-president of global vehicle forecasting at U.S.-based AutoForecast Solutions, projects CR-V production will continue in Alliston through these changes.\n\nThe investment will also supercharge Honda's North American electrification efforts.\n\nThe automaker, which has long been criticized as an EV laggard, premiered the Honda Prologue, its first battery-electric vehicle available in Canada, this spring. The crossover is built by General Motors in Mexico and underpinned by the U.S. automaker's Ultium architecture, but Honda's in-house EVs are scheduled to follow starting in 2025.\n\nUp until this point, however, Honda's North American electrification efforts have centred on the United States. It formed a joint venture with LG Energy Solution to build a US$4.4 billion battery plant in Ohio in early 2023, as well as committed $700 million to retool several local plants to build EVs.",

Sign in You are logged in Switch accounts\n\nThe source said the deal is worth billions of dollars, and would be based on federal funding through investment tax credits -- rather than direct subsidies worth billions of dollars that attracted other automakers, including Volkswagen and Stellantis, to set up EV battery plants in Ontario -- along with unspecified support from the provincial government.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nA second federal government source confirmed the Honda agreement is coming, but did not provide any details.\n\nMedia reports revealing the deal prompted Premier Doug Ford to hail what he described as the \"largest deal\" yet in his government's push -- alongside Ottawa and Qu\u00e9bec -- to attract companies to set up manufacturing in Canada for the emerging industry of electric vehicle and their components.\n\nSpeaking in Toronto, Ford said Honda's investment in Alliston would dwarf the massive Stellantis electric vehicle battery factory in Windsor and the even larger Volkswagen project in St. Thomas, each of which received billions of dollars in subsidies from Queen's Park and the federal government.\n\nSwedish battery manufacturer Northvolt has also committed to building a battery mega-factory outside Montreal, with $4.6 billion in subsides from Ottawa and Quebec City.\n\n\"Over the past three years alone, we've attracted over $28 billion in auto and EV battery investments -- and folks, stay tuned,\" Ford told the First Nations Major Projects Coalition meeting Monday.\n\n\"But this week, we landed a new deal. It will be the largest deal in Canadian history. It'll be double the size of Volkswagen so stay tuned, we'll be announcing it this week,\" the premier enthused.\n\nFord noted Stellantis was spending $5 billion on a 4.2-million-square-foot facility in Windsor, and VW another $7 billion on a 16-million-square-foot gigafactory in St. Thomas that will be the fourth largest building in the world.\n\n\"Ontario now is the only place in the entire world -- think of this -- where the six largest automakers call home,\" he said.\n\nIn a statement, Honda Canada spokesperson Ken Chiu declined to confirm the company's plans, but said Honda is \"considering a number of initiatives and is in contact with governments at all levels as we move into the electrified era.\"\n\nChiu added that, \"in order to achieve our 2040 electrification target of 100 per cent electrified vehicles, we are considering various options to increase local production capacity, however we have nothing further to share at this time.\"\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nAt Queen's Park, provincial Economic Development Minister Vic Fedeli was tight-lipped while touting \"the largest Canadian auto announcement ever.\"\n\n\"It's very exciting,\" said Fedeli, declining to even specifically mention the word Honda due to commercial sensitivities.\n\n\"We've never talked about any of our prospects by name but I would say the scenario is that we do have incentives,\" said the minister, referring to tax breaks and other sweeteners Queen's Park and Ottawa have put in place.\n\n\"That's where we think our tax dollars are best invested because we had 100,000 jobs that were at risk in the auto sector,\" he said, pointing to competition stateside.\n\n\"Not only did we save those 100,000 jobs, we've created tens of thousands more.\"\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nAsked about Ford of Canada recently slashing EV production in Oakville, Fedeli emphasized \"no money is distributed to any company until they've met their hiring goals and their construction goals.\"\n\nBloomberg first reported that a deal with Honda, which has long been rumoured, was expected to be announced this week.\n\nHonda's potential $18.4 billion auto assembly and EV battery factory would expand the complex 107 kilometres north of Toronto that currently makes gasoline-powered Civics and CR-Vs.\n\nAsked about that dollar figure, a federal government source declined to share specifics but said the total is \"in the ballpark\" of what will be announced with Honda this week.\n\nFedeli would only say that Ontario's overall $28 billion in EV investments would balloon to around $43 billion within the next week, suggesting a $15 billion Honda investment.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nTo Flavio Volpe, head of the Automotive Parts Manufacturers' Association, the prospect such a deal is \"incredible.\" He said it would be an even bigger coup after the federal government signalled there would be no more direct subsidies like those it used to land EV factories from Stellantis, Volkswagen and Northvolt in Quebec.\n\nVolpe pointed to a new measure unveiled in the recent federal budget, which promised a new \"electric vehicle supply chain investment tax credit\" worth 10 per cent of the cost that companies put toward buildings used in \"key segments\" of the industry.\n\nVolpe said that tax credit seems tailor-made for major companies like Honda, and noted that Ottawa and the Ontario and Quebec governments are also still trying to court Toyota -- another major Japanese automaker -- to set up electric vehicle manufacturing in Canada.\n\nIf the tax credit helped attract a big company like Honda, that would mark a significant victory for the government's shift from direct subsidies to a simpler offering that doesn't need to be negotiated with the same depth.\n\nThat could position Canada to better compete for jobs and manufacturing in the sector with the United States, which has its own massive suite of incentives under President Joe Biden's Inflation Reduction Act.\n\n\"I've got to give them full credit, no pun intended, on (potentially) pulling in a big fish -- maybe the biggest -- with credits,\" Volpe said.", "source": {"uri": "thestar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Star"}, "authors": [{"uri": "alex_ballingall@thestar.com", "name": "Alex

Honda said it expects to contribute 60%-70% of the total investment, with the rest coming from joint venture partners and Ontario government subsidies.\n\nHonda Motor plans to invest C$15 billion ($11 billion) in new EV and battery production plants alongside its existing facilities in Ontario, it said on Thursday, the Japanese automaker's largest ever investment in Canada. The investment, announced by company executives and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, signals Honda's expectation for more growth in North American demand for EVs.\n\nLike other Japanese car companies, Honda has been a relative latecomer to EVs, and is now pushing to better compete with fast-moving Chinese rivals. In Canada, it intends to produce essential EV components through joint ventures with companies such as Asahi Kasei , setting up a production system that covers everything from materials to finished vehicles.\n\nOperations are targeted to start by 2028, with annual production capacity estimated to be a maximum of 240,000 EVs and 36 gigawatt-hours for batteries. Although global EV demand has slowed, Honda executive Shinji Aoyama told reporters the supply network would help Honda achieve its goal for all of its North American sales to be either EVs or fuel cell vehicles by 2040.\n\nHonda said it expects to contribute 60%-70% of the total investment, with the rest coming from joint venture partners and Ontario government subsidies. Support from the federal Canadian government and Ontario could total around C$5 billion, Trudeau's office said. Details of the investment are due to be finalised later this year.\n\nThe EV and battery plants will be constructed adjacent to existing four-wheeled vehicle and engine plants and the total workforce will increase by around 1,000 people from 4,200 now, Honda said. It also announced a plan to work with South Korean steel giant POSCO for the production of battery cathode materials, and with Asahi Kasei to make separators.\n\nBy handling everything from material development to vehicle assembly in Ontario - including bringing battery production in house and sourcing locally - Honda expects to reduce costs by more than 20% from current methods. Canada has wooed companies involved in all parts of the EV supply chain to bolster its manufacturing heartland in Ontario as the world seeks to cut carbon emissions.\n\n\"Honda's investment is a vote of confidence in Canada, in Canadian auto workers, and in our manufacturing sector. Together, we're creating good-paying jobs, growing our economy, and keeping our air clean,\" Trudeau said. North America accounts for approximately 30% of Honda's global four-wheeled vehicle sales.\n\nHonda is currently overhauling facilities at its U.S. plant in Ohio, with an investment of $700 million, and constructing a battery plant in a joint venture with LG Energy Solution for $4.4 billion.

Thank you, Honda, for choosing Ontario. \"\n\n\"Honda of Canada Manufacturing has one of the best automotive manufacturing plants in the world, and for nearly forty years our work has been guided by determination, innovation and an unwavering desire to evolve. Today's announcement represents an unprecedented investment by a manufacturer in the Canadian automotive industry. It demonstrates the expertise of our highly skilled industry collaborators, who have earned a global reputation for manufacturing excellence, and demonstrates that Honda recognizes the long-term appeal of Canada's electric vehicle manufacturing ecosystem. \"\n\nIn Budget 2024, the federal government announced plans to introduce a new 10% electric vehicle supply chain investment tax credit to attract investment in at least three segments of the supply chain :\n\nthe assembly of electric vehicles.\n\nthe production of batteries for electric vehicles.\n\nthe production of cathode active materials.\n\nThe new electric vehicle supply chain investment tax credit is the government's sixth major investment tax credit. It complements the 30% tax credit for investment in clean technology manufacturing. The government intends to prioritize all major investment tax credits.\n\nIt is estimated that Honda's new investments in eligible segments of the electric vehicle supply chain could benefit from up to $2.5 billion in federal support through two proposed tax credits, the Electric Vehicle Supply Chain Investment Tax Credit and the Clean Technology Manufacturing Investment Tax Credit.\n\nThe Ontario government will support these segments with $2.5 billion through various direct and indirect incentives.\n\nPreparatory work for Honda's new Alliston plant is expected to be completed in six months, at which time the company will be able to provide more details. Honda, the Government of Canada and the Government of Ontario are working collaboratively to support this project.\n\nHonda's proposed comprehensive electric vehicle supply chain will include a new processing plant for cathode active materials and cathode active material precursors, in a joint venture with Korean battery materials producer POSCO Future M Co. , Ltd., as well as a new separator plant, in a joint venture with Japanese chemical manufacturer Asahi Kasei Corporation. These two factories will be located in Ontario, and announcements will be made later in the communities that will host them.\n\nThis project is part of Honda's efforts to achieve carbon neutrality. The company aims to sell only zero-emission electric vehicles in North America by 2040.\n\nHonda is a global automotive industry leader headquartered in Tokyo, Japan. The company was the first Japanese automaker to manufacture cars in Canada. It established Honda Canada in 1969 and began production in Alliston, Ontario, in 1986. These facilities - the only ones where Honda manufactures cars in Canada - currently include two automobile plants and an engine plant. They have the capacity to produce more than 400,000 vehicles and 190,000 engines per year. The company employs more than 4,200 people in Alliston and has a network of more than 280 dealerships across the country.\n\nThe governments of Canada and Ontario have already invested $131.6 million each to help Honda Canada retool its manufacturing facilities in Alliston to build the next generation of hybrid electric vehicles.\n\nThis is the latest in a series of unprecedented investments that Canada has attracted into its electric vehicle supply chain, from mining to manufacturing. Including Honda's new project, these investments now amount to more than $46 billion since 2020. They include the following:\n\n$7 billion from Northvolt Batteries North America for a new electric vehicle battery production plant in Saint-Basile-le-Grand and McMasterville, Quebec.\n\n$7 billion from Volkswagen for its first overseas electric vehicle battery production plant in St. Thomas, Ontario.\n\nMore than $5 billion from Stellantis and LG Energy Solution to create a joint venture for electric vehicle battery production in Windsor, Ontario.\n\n$1.8 billion from Ford to convert its assembly plant in Oakville, Ontario, into a battery electric vehicle manufacturing plant.\n\n$1.5 billion from Umicore to build a new world-class carbon-neutral factory in Loyalist Township, Ontario, specializing in the manufacturing of critical battery components for electric vehicles.\n\n$1.2 billion for the construction of a new battery materials production plant in B\u00e9cancour, Quebec, by a consortium formed by Ford Motor Company and Korean companies EcoProBM and SK On.\n\n$600 million for a cathode active materials processing plant to be built as a joint venture between General Motors and POSCO Future M Co., Ltd. in B\u00e9cancour, Quebec.\n\nIn Budget 2023, the government announced a new refundable clean technology investment tax credit of up to 30% of the costs of machinery and equipment used to manufacture or process clean technologies and extract , transform or recycle key critical minerals.\n\nThe Canadian automotive sector produces more than 1.5 million vehicles each year, or one every 21 seconds. It provides nearly 550,000 direct and indirect jobs, added $18 billion in 2023 to Canada's gross domestic product and is one of the country's largest export sectors. It is solidified by the presence of five automobile manufacturers: Stellantis, Ford, General Motors, Toyota and Honda.\n\nThe transportation sector is responsible for a quarter of emissions in Canada. The government has therefore set itself an ambitious objective, that is, for all vehicles sold in the country to be zero-emission vehicles by 2035. This objective is accompanied by support measures which include charging infrastructure and purchase incentives. .\n\nOverall electric vehicle sales are forecast to be more than three times larger in 2030 than in 2023, and Canada is well-positioned to be a big player in electric vehicle production.\n\nEDITOR'S NOTE: This article is a translation.

In the last four years, automotive and battery makers have announced more than $31 billion in investments in electric vehicle manufacturing across Canada. They want a reliable partner with world-class talent, and this is exactly what we have to offer.\n\nAnd the world is taking notice.\n\nThe Prime Minister, Justin Trudeau, and the Premier of Ontario, Doug Ford, today welcomed Honda Canada's milestone investment of approximately $15 billion to create Canada's first comprehensive electric vehicle supply chain, located in Ontario.\n\nThis large-scale project will see four new manufacturing plants in Ontario. Honda will build an innovative and world-class electric vehicle assembly plant - the first of its kind for Honda Motor Co., Ltd. - as well as a new stand-alone battery manufacturing plant at Honda's facilities in Alliston, Ontario. To complete the supply chain, Honda will also build a cathode active material and precursor (CAM/pCAM) processing plant through a joint venture partnership with POSCO Future M Co., Ltd. and a separator plant through a joint venture partnership with Asahi Kasei Corporation. Once fully operational in 2028, the new assembly plant will produce up to 240,000 vehicles per year.\n\nHonda's investments in an electric vehicle assembly plant and a battery manufacturing plant in Alliston will create over one thousand well-paying manufacturing jobs in Ontario, with the CAM/pCAM processing plant and separator plant helping to create thousands of additional direct and indirect jobs in Ontario and across Canada, including during the construction phase and across Ontario's leading auto parts supplier and research and development ecosystems.\n\nThis investment is a strong vote of confidence in Canada and Ontario's highly skilled workers, strong economies, and competitive business environments.\n\nCanada's auto sector has been an engine of economic growth, driving innovation and creating good middle-class jobs. As the demand for electric vehicles continues to grow, we will attract even more investment and position our auto, battery manufacturing, and battery material production industries as global leaders across the entire electric vehicle supply chain, to create economic growth and opportunities now and for generations to come.\n\n\"Today's announcement is a game changer for manufacturing in Canada. Honda's investment is a vote of confidence in Canada, in Canadian auto workers, and in our manufacturing sector. Together, we're creating good-paying jobs, growing our economy, and keeping our air clean.\"\n\n-- The Rt. Hon. Justin Trudeau, Prime Minister of Canada\n\n\"Today's historic $15 billion investment by Honda delivers on our government's promise to bring back manufacturing as part of our plan to rebuild Ontario's economy, with thousands of good-paying union jobs and economic benefits for workers and families across the province. From our abundant critical minerals in the Ring of Fire to our highly skilled workforce, Ontario has what it takes to secure the jobs of the future as the world leader in electric vehicle manufacturing, with better jobs and bigger paycheques for our world-class workers.\"\n\n-- The Hon. Doug Ford, Premier of Ontario\n\n\"Canada is home to the talented workers, raw materials, clean electricity, and specialized production capabilities needed to build electric vehicles. Today's announcement \u2012 Honda's largest investment in North America \u2012 is about seizing that opportunity for Canadian workers. We are securing Canada's electric vehicle advantage by building out the entire electric vehicle supply chain ecosystem, from raw materials to battery manufacturing to auto assembly lines \u2012 ensuring workers benefit today and for decades to come.\"\n\n-- The Hon. Chrystia Freeland, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance\n\n\"As the world shifts toward more sustainable vehicles, Canada is seizing the opportunity and positioning itself as a global leader when it comes to building the cars of the future. This historic investment by Honda is a testament to Canada's attractive and competitive business environment. With a highly skilled workforce, clean energy, an abundance of critical minerals, access to markets, and a flourishing electric vehicle ecosystem, Canada has everything that companies like Honda need to grow.\"\n\n-- The Hon. Fran\u00e7ois-Philippe Champagne, Minister of Innovation, Science and Industry\n\n\"Several years in the making, Honda's historic investment represents a vote of confidence in Ontario's status as a leading jurisdiction in the global production and development of electric vehicles, batteries, and battery materials. As our province continues to build a fully integrated end-to-end electric vehicle supply chain, Honda's investment will play an integral role in advancing the innovative technologies that will define the future of automotive design, while securing thousands of good-paying jobs for workers in Alliston and across the province. Thank you, Honda, for choosing Ontario.\"\n\n-- The Hon. Vic Fedeli, Ontario's Minister of Economic Development, Job Creation and Trade\n\n\"Honda of Canada Manufacturing is one of the premier automotive manufacturing facilities in the world and, for nearly forty years, our work has been guided by determination, innovation, and a relentless drive to evolve. Today's announcement is a historic investment by a manufacturer in the Canadian auto industry. It proudly honours the highly skilled associates who have earned a global reputation for manufacturing excellence and represents Honda's recognition of the long-term attractiveness of the Canadian electric vehicle manufacturing ecosystem.\"\n\n-- Jean Marc Leclerc, President and Chief Executive Officer, Honda Canada\n\nQuick Facts", "source": {"uri": "streetinsider.com", "dataType": "news",

The money will come from performance-based initiatives available through the federal government's new Investment Tax Credits and provincial direct and indirect incentives.\n\n\"Today's announcement is a historic investment by a manufacturer in the Canadian auto industry,\" said Jean Marc Leclerc, President and CEO of Honda Canada. \"It proudly honours the highly skilled associates who have earned a global reputation for manufacturing excellence and represents Honda's recognition of the long-term attractiveness of the Canadian electric vehicle manufacturing ecosystem.\"\n\nThe future Honda EV plant and standalone Honda EV battery plant will be located in Alliston near the company's existing manufacturing facilities. There will also be a cathode active material and precursor (CAM/pCAM) processing plant through a joint venture partnership with POSCO Future, as well as a separator plant through a joint venture partnership with Asahi Kasei Corporation.\n\nHonda expects that EV production will begin in 2028. Once fully operational, the EV plant will have a production capacity of 240,000 EVs per year and the EV battery plant will have a capacity of 36 GWh per year.\n\nIn addition to securing the current employment level of 4,200 associates at its two existing manufacturing facilities in Ontario, Honda estimates it will add a minimum of 1,000new associates for the EV and EV battery manufacturing facilities. The investment in the new facilities will also create significant spinoff jobs across all sites, including in the construction sector.\n\nHonda has begun the process of evaluating the scope of its investment and completing negotiations with its joint venture partners. This work is expected to be finalized during the next six months and more details will be shared at that time.\n\nThe new facilities in Alliston will add to the Ohio EV hub that Honda is creating in the U.S. to serve as the foundation for future EV and EV battery production.

He called it a \"double down\" on Canada and \"an announcement that I think will be heard around the world.\"\n\nHonda doesn't make speculative bets, he said. \"They've been in Canada for almost 40 years. They've never retreated, they've never gone back. This is, for Canadian suppliers, an extremely bankable customer to get.\"\n\nEnjoying the hype this announcement is generating means ignoring, for the time being, the fact that most of Northern Ontario's critical minerals are years (if not decades) away from powering all the new EVs Canadians will be federally mandated to purchase after 2035 to meet federal carbon emissions targets.\n\nIt means overlooking the fact that Ford's government remains well short of the Indigenous partnerships and permissions it will need to fulfil its Ring of Fire mining aspirations. It means dismissing the failure to date of early consumer incentives and spiking spring gas prices to set off a rush of EV sales, and the fact that many of the new EVs on Ontario's roads were imported from a Tesla gigafactory in Shanghai.\n\n\"Here in Ontario, we've become a world leader in the electric vehicle revolution,\" Ford bragged.\n\nFord said the deal coming this week will be \"double the size of Volkswagen.\"\n\nThe $7 billion VW battery plant now under construction in St. Thomas, Ont. covers roughly 150 hectares -- over 200 football fields. It's \"like a city in itself,\" Ford said.\n\nIt was not clear from Ford's comments if he meant Honda's new operation will cover twice the acreage of the Volkswagen plant, or if its investment is double the size of the Volkswagen deal. Either way, it's historic.\n\nIn January, the Japanese news outlet Nikkei was the first to report Honda was considering an investment of 2 trillion yen (about $18 billion Cdn) to start up an EV supply chain in Canada.\n\nFord's economic development minister, Vic Fedeli, appeared to confirm Thursday's figures could be on that scale when speaking to reporters at Queen's Park on Monday.\n\nOntario's EV investments \"went from zero to $28 billion in three years,\" he said, before hedging slightly.\n\n\"If the premier, if his comments are correct,\" he added, \"then next week we'll be announcing $43 billion in EV, or a number in and around there.\"\n\nSo is Honda about to invest $15 billion in Ontario?\n\nNot so fast. In a subsequent report published Tuesday, Nikkei said Honda was preparing a one-trillion yen announcement (approximately $8.8 billion.)\n\nAs the premier told his Monday audience, \"stay tuned.\"\n\nThe timing of Honda's announcement was a business decision -- but it's a happy coincidence for Prime Minister Justin Trudeau that it fell in the midst of his ministers' post-budget marketing tour.\n\nOnly a few months after Trudeau signalled that the federal government was running out of money for automotive subsidies -- prompting fears that Toyota Canada would hit the brakes on further Ontario expansion -- a change in government tactics apparently paid off.\n\nCanada's share of North American manufacturing could have been in jeopardy if the federal and provincial governments hadn't stepped up with both investment tax credits and production subsidies to compete with the Inflation Reduction Act introduced by U.S. President Joe Biden.\n\nThose billions were enough to land Ontario its first two battery plants: the VW plant in St. Thomas and the Stellantis facility in Windsor. But the Trudeau government warned at the time that their production subsidies aren't sustainable.\n\nThe sweeteners offered to land this Honda deal are more predictable because they're based on the value of Honda's investment, not future production levels.\n\nIn the 2023 federal budget, the Liberals introduced a clean manufacturing investment tax credit that rebates 30 per cent of the cost of new machinery and equipment. Its implementation legislation, C-59, has yet to pass; the Liberals hope it receives royal assent by June.\n\nLast week, the 2024 federal budget introduced a ten per cent electric vehicle supply chain investment tax credit to offset the cost of buildings. Companies receiving the tax credit must invest in three parts of the EV supply chain: EV assembly, battery production and production of cathode active material for those batteries.\n\nFinance Minister Chrystia Freeland's department took the lead in federal talks with Honda; her budget forecasts a $80 million expenditure on this tax credit over the next five years. The federal government has hinted it anticipates about $800 million in investment on eligible buildings between now and 2029.\n\nHonda appears set to be the first -- and possibly the only -- carmaker to make the vertical investments required to access this credit, with an expansion of its facilities in Alliston as well as other yet-to-be announced expansions in Ontario.\n\nCBC News has not confirmed that a site earmarked for EV battery production in St. Clair township near Sarnia, Ont. is part of Honda's negotiations. Fedeli said Monday that land in Wilmot township near Waterloo, Ont. was not part of Honda's plans.\n\nQuebec's economy minister, Pierre Fitzgibbon, told reporters at the National Assembly Tuesday that he was in talks to land a piece of Honda's business at the industrial park in B\u00e9cancour, Que. where other automotive giants are setting up cathode materials manufacturing.\n\nFitzgibbon admitted he was outbid by Ontario.\n\nTo help attract EV investment, Ontario's 2023 provincial budget included a 10 per cent refundable corporate income tax credit for eligible investments in buildings, machinery and equipment, worth up to $2 million a year for individual corporations.\n\nThe Toronto Star has reported that when the Stellantis deal was in jeopardy, the federal government convinced the Ford government to pile on more provincial subsidies in return for federal cooperation on the environmental assessments required to build Highway 413.\n\nIt's not known whether a similar last-minute squeeze happened in the Honda talks. Ontario Finance Minister Peter Bethlenfalvy's statement in reaction to the April 16 federal budget nodded to this Highway 413 quid pro quo and revived Ontario's demand for the federal government to \"eliminate duplicative reviews and processes that are slowing down\" Ring of Fire projects.\n\nVolpe said the new rules hammered out during the NAFTA renegotiation talks anticipated the transition to electrified powertrain products and batteries by making sure carmakers couldn't source components offshore (China, mainly) without risking tariffs.\n\nDuring a 2023 visit to Canada, Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida called China a \"central challenge.\"\n\nGeopolitically, Japan is far more comfortable working with Canada to source the critical minerals its automotive engineers need.\n\nLast September, Japan's economy, trade and investment minister Yasutoshi Nishimura visited Ottawa with a delegation of Japanese businesspeople from its battery supply chain association (BASC) and corporations like Panasonic Energy, Asahi-Kasei, Mitsubishi, Mitsui and Sumitomo. They signed memoranda of cooperation with Canadian companies about sharing technology and business intelligence.\n\nThis week's Honda announcement will be Canada's biggest EV investment deal so far. But it wasn't the first and it's not expected to be the last.\n\nNow that Honda's seen enough to place its bet and become Ontario's third EV battery maker, attention will turn to whether Toyota might reconsider becoming the fourth -- and whether Canada's clean power grids can accommodate more ambition.\n\n\"Every single car company is spending all of their future R&D dollars on electrified product or fuel cell project product, anything that's zero emission,\" Volpe said, dismissing the naysayers who've lost faith due to slow consumer sales.", "source": {"uri": "cbc.ca", "dataType": "news",

The Japanese automaker already has a number of factories in the US, Mexico, and Canada, and it's this last one that will benefit from the expansion, with four EV-related plants planned for Ontario.\n\nHonda says it has begun evaluating requirements for what it's calling an \"innovative and environmentally responsible\" EV factory as well as a standalone EV battery plant, both in Alliston, Ontario, which is already home to Honda's two existing Canadian manufacturing facilities.\n\nAdditionally, the automaker wants to set up another two sites as joint ventures. One will be a plant that processes cathode active materials and their precursors -- the various elements like nickel and manganese that are combined with lithium in lithium-ion batteries -- set up in a partnership with POSCO Future M, a South Korean battery material and chemical company. (POSCO is already working with General Motors on another joint venture battery precursor material facility in Betancour, Quebec, that is supposed to become operational in 2026.)\n\nA second joint venture will be a partnership with Asahi Kasei, which will manufacture battery separators, the material that keeps the anode and cathode apart. The locations of these two joint ventures have not yet been announced.\n\nHonda thinks it will be able to start making EVs in Ontario in 2028 and says the assembly plant will have the capacity to build 240,000 EVs per year. Meanwhile, the battery plant is planned to have an annual output of 36 GWh.\n\n\"Honda is making progress in our global initiatives toward the realization of our 2050 carbon neutrality goal,\" said Honda CEO Toshihiro Mibe. \"In North America, following the initiative to establish our EV production system capability in the US, we will now begin formal discussions toward the establishment of a comprehensive EV value chain here in Canada, with the support of the governments of Canada and Ontario. We will strengthen our EV supply system and capability with an eye toward a future increase in EV demand in North America.\"\n\nThese investments in EV manufacturing by Honda are in addition to $700 million that it has spent retooling some of its factories in Ohio for electrification, plus a joint venture battery factory with LG Energy Solutions, also in Ohio, that has risen in cost to $4.4 billion. Honda says it expects to begin production of an electric sedan, shown off at CES earlier this year, in Ohio in late 2025. The brand currently has a single EV for the US market -- the Honda Prologue -- which shares one of GM's Ultium platforms. It is also developing an EV with Sony under the Afeela brand.", "source": {"uri": "arstechnica.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Ars Technica"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jonathan_m_gitlin@arstechnica.com", "name": "Jonathan M.

Ltd. is set to announce that it will build a new electric-vehicle and battery manufacturing operation in Canada on Thursday morning in Alliston, Ont., according to a source familiar with the matter.\n\nTwo other sources said they expect the Japanese automaker to make an announcement this week, and added that it will be the largest EV and battery complex in Canada ever announced.\n\nHonda has confirmed it is holding discussions with \"all levels of government\" in Canada and considering expanding its local operations, but declined to comment further.\n\nA spokesperson for Simcoe County -- where Alliston is located -- also declined to comment on any proposed plans, but described Honda as \"an important partner, providing thousands of jobs to people across the county while investing in our communities.\"\n\nHonda currently manufactures its CRV and Civic models in Alliston -- about 85 kilometres north of Toronto -- and has said it plans to produce only electrified vehicles by 2040.\n\nThe announcement could mark a shift in clean technology incentive policy in Canada. In recent years, the federal government wooed Volkswagen AG and Stellantis NV to build battery cell manufacturing plants by offering lucrative production tax credits, similar to what would be available in the United States under the Inflation Reduction Act.\n\nThose were specific deals negotiated with VW and Stellantis.\n\nShift in EV incentives\n\nBut sources said the federal government is wooing Honda through different incentives. The 2024 federal budget, released last week, proposes a new Electric Vehicle Supply Chain tax credit of 10 per cent on the cost of any building.\n\nThe credit would be effective until 2032, decline to five per cent in 2033 and 2034, and then expire. The budget estimated it would cost $80 million over five years, plus an additional $1.02 billion between 2029-30 and 2034-35.\n\nTo be eligible, a company must claim the Clean Technology Manufacturing investment tax credit -- which is a 30 per cent credit on applicable new machinery and equipment -- in three segments of the supply chain: EV assembly, EV battery production and cathode active material production.\n\nA company can invest in only two of the three segments if it owns a minority interest in a company that invests in the third segment.\n\nThat tax policy, introduced in the 2023 budget, contains a proposed sunset clause of 2035.\n\nSo far, neither tax proposal has been passed into law.\n\nSources also said the federal government is interested in moving away from one-off deals with individual companies for production tax credits, and towards a more open policy that companies can claim for making investments in Canada.\n\nGM, Ford could tap tax credit\n\nThat would mean other automakers, including General Motors Co. and Ford Motor Co., which already have investments in the EV supply chain, could also eventually be eligible for the 10 per cent tax credit proposed in the 2024 budget.\n\nFor example, GM assembles BrightDrop EV at its CAMI plant in Ingersoll, Ont., and is building a cathode active material plant in B\u00e9cancour, Que. It could qualify for the tax credit by either building a battery cell manufacturing plant, or by owning a minority interest in a company that builds a battery plant in Canada.\n\nFord has proposed retooling its Oakville, Ont., assembly plant so it can produce EVs.\n\nSources said Honda may receive other incentives as well. The federal government has not always immediately disclosed the details of its deals with automakers investing in the battery and EV supply chain.\n\nThere are also provincial incentives in the form of loans and direct support, which when combined with the federal incentives collectively amount to more than $1 billion across a half-dozen projects.\n\nOntario's Ministry of Economic Development, Job Creation and Trade said via email that the province has attracted more than $28 billion in EV and battery supply chain-related investments in the past three years.\n\nA spokesperson said the ministry does not discuss specific prospective projects, but noted: \"We are grateful for Honda's longstanding history in Ontario, and will continue to seek out opportunities to promote job growth and ensure Ontario remains a competitive jurisdiction.\"", "source": {"uri": "ca.finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

One plant with South Korea-based partner Posco Future M will produce precursor and cathode active material for Honda's battery cells. The other, headed by Japan-based chemical company Asahi Kasei, will produce battery separators.\n\nRecord investment\n\nThe $11 billion in combined spending sets a new high-water mark for Canadian automotive investment, eclipsing Volkswagen Group's $5-billion commitment to build a sprawling battery-cell plant in St. Thomas, Ont. made just over a year ago.\n\nThe EV battery plant planned for Alliston is the fourth battery plant Canada has secured over the past two years, as both federal and provincial governments work overtime to establish the country as a key battery and EV production hub.\n\nIn addition to Volkswagen's plans, Sweden-based Northvolt said it would build a $7-billion cell plant outside Montreal in September 2023. A joint venture between South Korea battery-cell maker LG Energy Solution and Stellantis made the first battery commitment to Canada in March 2022; the companies are now well into construction on a $5-billion cell site in Windsor, Ont.\n\nHonda's plans are the most highly integrated of the four battery plants, with the automaker playing an active role in EV assembly, battery manufacturing and battery component production. This will qualify Honda for the new 10 percent Electric Vehicle Supply Chain investment tax credit proposed in the 2024 federal budget.\n\nThe capital-spending support for Honda differs from the three battery-cell manufacturing deals previously struck by Ottawa, which were structured to match production subsidies offered in the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). The federal government estimates costs for those three deals will total $27.6 billion (C$37.7 billion) over the next decade.\n\nThe EV supply chain spending will vastly increase Honda's presence in Canada, where it currently builds its CR-V crossover, Civic sedan and four-cylinder engines.\n\nNew product unknown\n\nSpecifics about the vehicles to be built in Alliston were not yet known, but auto analyst Sam Fiorani forecasts Honda will begin production of a small electric crossover at its campus in 2027, after production of the current Civic has run its course. An electric crossover from luxury brand Acura will follow in 2028, he added.\n\nFiorani, the vice-president of global vehicle forecasting at U.S.-based AutoForecast Solutions, projects CR-V production will continue in Alliston through these changes.\n\nThe investment will also supercharge Honda's North American electrification efforts.\n\nThe automaker, which has long been criticized as an EV laggard, premiered the Honda Prologue, its first battery-electric vehicle available in Canada, this spring. The crossover is built by General Motors in Mexico and underpinned by the U.S. automaker's Ultium architecture, but Honda's in-house EVs are scheduled to follow starting in 2025.\n\nUp until this point, however, Honda's North American electrification efforts have centered on the U.S. It formed a joint venture with LG Energy Solution to build a $4.4 billion battery plant in Ohio in early 2023, as well as committed $700 million to retool several local plants to build EVs.", "source": {"uri": "autonews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Automotive News"}, "authors": [{"uri":

conference in Toronto.\n\n\"This week, we landed a new deal,\" the Premier said. \"It'll be the largest deal in Canadian history; it'll be double the size of Volkswagen.\"\n\nThat EV battery plant is

to expand its outreach across North America.\n\nThe Federal government's budget promised a 10 percent investment tax credit that would apply to the cost of buildings used in the EV supply chain as an incentive to attract more automotive partners to the country.\n\nIn March 2022, the Premier and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau attended an announcement in Alliston where the Japanese Automaker launched hybrid production at its facility, with $131.6 million in assistance from both levels of government.", "source": {"uri": "barrie.ctvnews.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "CTV Newsnet

The Honda Prologue, a sport-utility vehicle made in Mexico, is the company's only fully electric vehicle on sale in the United States.\n\nBut the investment adjacent to the company's factory in Alliston, Ontario, near Toronto, is a shift in direction, raising the possibility that Honda and other Japanese carmakers could use their manufacturing expertise to push down the cost of electric vehicles and make them affordable to more people.\n\n\"This is a very big day for the region, for the province and for the country,\" Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said at an announcement event in Alliston, where Honda manufactures the Civic sedan and CR-V S.U.V. The investment is the largest by an automaker in Canadian history, he said.\n\nThe company also plans to retool its flagship factory in Marysville, Ohio, near Columbus, to produce electric vehicles in 2026. The investment in Canada is a sign that Honda expects the technology to grow in popularity, despite a recent slowdown in sales.\n\nCanadian leaders have been wooing carmakers with financial incentives as it tries to become a major player in the electric vehicle supply chain. Vehicles made in Canada can qualify for $7,500 U.S. federal tax credits, which are available only to cars made in North America.\n\nVolkswagen said last year it would invest up to $5 billion to construct a battery factory in Thomas, Ontario. Northvolt, a Swedish battery company, announced plans last year for a $5 billion battery factory near Montreal.\n\nHonda will benefit from up to $1.8 billion in tax credits available to companies that invest in electric vehicle projects, Chrystia Freeland, the Canadian finance minister, said Thursday at the event.\n\nCanada also has reserves of lithium and other materials needed to make batteries, and generates a lot of its electricity from nuclear and hydroelectric plants, which allows carmakers to advertise that their vehicles are made with energy that releases no greenhouse gas emissions.\n\n\"As we aim to conduct our business with zero environmental impact, Canada is very attractive,\" Toshihiro Mibe, the chief executive of Honda, said Thursday in Alliston. Honda will also work with partners to convert raw materials into battery components, he said.\n\nHowever, recent declines in the price of lithium have raised questions about whether mining the metal in Canada will be profitable.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

In the last four years, automotive and battery makers have announced more than $31 billion in investments in electric vehicle manufacturing across Canada. They want a reliable partner with world-class talent, and this is exactly what we have to offer.\n\nAnd the world is taking notice.\n\nThe Prime Minister, Justin Trudeau, and the Premier of Ontario, Doug Ford, today welcomed Honda Canada's milestone investment of approximately $15 billion to create Canada's first comprehensive electric vehicle supply chain, located in Ontario.\n\nThis large-scale project will see four new manufacturing plants in Ontario. Honda will build an innovative and world-class electric vehicle assembly plant - the first of its kind for Honda Motor Co., Ltd. - as well as a new stand-alone battery manufacturing plant at Honda's facilities in Alliston, Ontario. To complete the supply chain, Honda will also build a cathode active material and precursor (CAM/pCAM) processing plant through a joint venture partnership with POSCO Future M Co., Ltd. and a separator plant through a joint venture partnership with Asahi Kasei Corporation. Once fully operational in 2028, the new assembly plant will produce up to 240,000 vehicles per year.\n\nHonda's investments in an electric vehicle assembly plant and a battery manufacturing plant in Alliston will create over one thousand well-paying manufacturing jobs in Ontario, with the CAM/pCAM processing plant and separator plant helping to create thousands of additional direct and indirect jobs in Ontario and across Canada, including during the construction phase and across Ontario's leading auto parts supplier and research and development ecosystems.\n\nThis investment is a strong vote of confidence in Canada and Ontario's highly skilled workers, strong economies, and competitive business environments.\n\nCanada's auto sector has been an engine of economic growth, driving innovation and creating good middle-class jobs. As the demand for electric vehicles continues to grow, we will attract even more investment and position our auto, battery manufacturing, and battery material production industries as global leaders across the entire electric vehicle supply chain, to create economic growth and opportunities now and for generations to come.\n\n\"Today's announcement is a game changer for manufacturing in Canada. Honda's investment is a vote of confidence in Canada, in Canadian auto workers, and in our manufacturing sector. Together, we're creating good-paying jobs, growing our economy, and keeping our air clean.\"\n\n\"Today's historic $15 billion investment by Honda delivers on our government's promise to bring back manufacturing as part of our plan to rebuild Ontario's economy, with thousands of good-paying union jobs and economic benefits for workers and families across the province. From our abundant critical minerals in the Ring of Fire to our highly skilled workforce, Ontario has what it takes to secure the jobs of the future as the world leader in electric vehicle manufacturing, with better jobs and bigger paycheques for our world-class workers.\"\n\n\"Canada is home to the talented workers, raw materials, clean electricity, and specialized production capabilities needed to build electric vehicles. Today's announcement \u2012 Honda's largest investment in North America \u2012 is about seizing that opportunity for Canadian workers. We are securing Canada's electric vehicle advantage by building out the entire electric vehicle supply chain ecosystem, from raw materials to battery manufacturing to auto assembly lines \u2012 ensuring workers benefit today and for decades to come.\"\n\n\"As the world shifts toward more sustainable vehicles, Canada is seizing the opportunity and positioning itself as a global leader when it comes to building the cars of the future. This historic investment by Honda is a testament to Canada's attractive and competitive business environment. With a highly skilled workforce, clean energy, an abundance of critical minerals, access to markets, and a flourishing electric vehicle ecosystem, Canada has everything that companies like Honda need to grow.\"\n\n\"Several years in the making, Honda's historic investment represents a vote of confidence in Ontario's status as a leading jurisdiction in the global production and development of electric vehicles, batteries, and battery materials. As our province continues to build a fully integrated end-to-end electric vehicle supply chain, Honda's investment will play an integral role in advancing the innovative technologies that will define the future of automotive design, while securing thousands of good-paying jobs for workers in Alliston and across the province. Thank you, Honda, for choosing Ontario.\"", "source": {"uri": "foreignaffairs.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title": "foreignaffairs.co.nz"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mil_osi_publisher@foreignaffairs.co.nz", "name": "Mil-Osi Publisher", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_battery", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Electric battery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_chain", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Supply chain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Electric vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honda", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Honda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontario", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ontario"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ontario"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_venture", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Joint venture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doug_Ford", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Doug Ford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_of_Ontario", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Premier of Ontario"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathode", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cathode"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_of_no_confidence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Motion of no confidence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mineral", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mineral"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Trudeau", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Justin Trudeau"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_growth", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Economic growth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mining", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mining"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automotive_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Automotive industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alliston", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alliston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Alliston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asahi_Kasei", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Asahi Kasei"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_class", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Middle class"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecosystem", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ecosystem"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research_and_development", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Research and development"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provinces_and_territories_of_Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Provinces and territories of Canada"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_line", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assembly line"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_energy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sustainable energy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raw_material", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Raw material"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurisdiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jurisdiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Electricity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "North America"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Motorcycles", "label": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Motorcycles", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Motorcycles", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Motorcycles", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Motorcycles/Classifieds", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Motorcycles/Classifieds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Motorcycles/Maintenance", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Motorcycles/Maintenance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 86}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9500357", "eventUri": "eng-9500357", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3254901960784313, "wgt": 166, "relevance": 1}

Tesla has just reported poor quarterly results and has seen its stock fall in recent months.\n\nOthers are calling for calm. \"Honda does not make speculative term bets,\" said Flavio Volpe, head of Canada's Automotive Parts Manufacturers' Association.\n\nBullish analysts point out that the market witnessed a post-pandemic spending spree that will come back, particularly if manufacturers close the 40-60% price gap between gas-powered cars and EVs.\n\nIn China, electric vehicles are now cheaper options on average, and producing for the mass market is the game plan for companies like GM and Honda.\n\nIf the price differential drops, the car makers are betting \"the feel of the wheel will seal the deal.\"", "source": {"uri": "gzeromedia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GZERO Media"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provinces_and_territories_of_Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Provinces and territories of Canada"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Electric vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honda", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Honda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontario", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ontario"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ontario"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alliston", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Alliston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Alliston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_of_Ontario", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Premier of Ontario"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automotive_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Automotive industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_battery", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electric battery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_line", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assembly line"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_chain", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Supply chain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsidy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Subsidy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volkswagen", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Volkswagen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla,_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tesla, Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Motors", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "General Motors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "North America"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Motorcycles", "label": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Motorcycles", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Motorcycles", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Motorcycles", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Motorcycles/Classifieds", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Motorcycles/Classifieds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Motorcycles/Maintenance", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Motorcycles/Maintenance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 75}], "image": "https://www.gzeromedia.com/media-library/workers-assemble-a-vehicle-as-honda-announces-plans-to-build-electric-vehicles-and-their-parts-in-ontario-with-financial-suppor.jpg?id=52104697&width=1245&height=700&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9500357", "eventUri": "eng-9500357", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 166, "relevance": 1}

vehicle plant in Canada", "body": "ALLISTON (Canada), April 25 -- Japanese auto giant Honda announced today the largest automotive investment in Canada's history, worth C$15 billion (RM71 billion), for a massive new EV battery and vehicle assembly plant.\n\nHonda chief executive Toshihiro Mibe told a joint news conference with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and other officials that electric vehicles (EVs) will start rolling off the assembly line in 2028.\n\nOnce fully operational, the factory will have a production capacity of 240,000 vehicles per year, and a batteries output of 36 GWh per year.\n\nHonda estimates that 1,000 new jobs will be created at the facility, which is to be built next its existing Civic and CR-V assembly plants north of Toronto that already employ 4,200 workers.\n\n\"This is a historic day with the largest auto investment in Canada's history,\" Trudeau said.\n\nHe touted Ottawa's efforts to set up \"a whole ecosystem\" around the production of electric batteries, positioning Canada as an attractive destination for electric vehicle investment, with generous tax incentives, renewable energy access and its rare mineral deposits.\n\n\"Because of the choices our government has made over the past few years, Canada now ranks first, globally in Bloomberg's ranking of lithium-ion battery supply chains,\" Trudeau said.\n\nThis effort also helped Canada last year attract the \"highest per capita foreign direct investment in the G7\" and the third most in the world after the United States and Brazil, he said.\n\nIn the federal budget last week, Trudeau's government introduced a new business tax credit, granting companies a 10 per cent rebate on construction costs for new facilities used in key segments of the electric vehicle supply chain.\n\nCanada's strategy follows that of the neighbouring United States, whose Inflation Reduction Act has provided a host of incentives for green industry.\n\nSince 2021, Honda has made huge outlays as it aggressively pursues its objective of becoming 100 per cent electric in its automobile segment by 2040.\n\nHonda's new facility in Alliston, Ontario will be the first to tap into Canada's EV supply chain investment tax credit, and joins recently announced Volkswagen and Stellantis battery plants in Canada. -- AFP", "source": {"uri": "malaymail.com", "dataType": "news",

Honda has begun evaluating the requirements to build an innovative and environmentally responsible Honda EV plant and a stand-alone Honda EV battery plant in Alliston, Ontario . The proposed Honda EV value chain will also include a cathode active material and precursor (CAM/pCAM) processing plant through a joint venture partnership with POSCO Future M Co., Ltd. and a separator plant through a joint venture partnership with Asahi Kasei Corporation, with announcements to follow in their respective Ontario communities.\n\nHonda expects that electric vehicle production will begin in 2028. Once fully operational, the EV plant will have a production capacity of 240,000 EVs per year and the EV battery plant will have a capacity of 36 GWh per year. In addition to securing the current employment level of 4,200 associates at its two existing manufacturing facilities in Ontario , Honda estimates it will add a minimum of 1,000 new associates for the EV and EV battery manufacturing facilities. The investment in the new facilities will also create significant spinoff jobs across all sites, including in the construction sector.\n\nHonda has begun the process of evaluating the scope of its investment and completing negotiations with its joint venture partners. This work is expected to be finalized during the next six months and more details will be shared at that time.\n\nTo support this project, Honda is collaborating with the governments of Canada and Ontario to drive innovation in low-emissions manufacturing by accessing performance-based initiatives available through the federal government's new Investment Tax Credits and provincial direct and indirect incentives.\n\nNorth American EV strategy\n\nStriving to realize carbon neutrality for all its products and corporate activities by 2050, Honda has set a goal to make BEVs and FCEVs represent 100% of vehicle sales by 2040. To achieve this goal, Honda will continue offering attractive products in this electrified era globally, including its largest market of North America .\n\nAs the first step in achieving this electrification goal in North America , Honda positioned its existing auto production plants in the state of Ohio in the U.S. as its EV Hub for production, including the retooling of existing plants, an investment of USD$700 million , and the construction of a joint venture EV battery plant with LG Energy Solution, with an expected investment of USD$4.4 billion .\n\nThe Ohio EV hub will serve as the foundation for future EV and EV battery production, sharing knowledge and expertise with other Honda plants in North America , including the new EV assembly and battery plants in Ontario, Canada . Honda expects EV production to begin at the Marysville Auto Plant in late 2025.\n\nAs a second step in this initiative, Honda will strive to establish a comprehensive EV value chain that includes all aspects of EV production in Canada , from the procurement of raw materials mainly for batteries, to the production of finished EVs. Honda will leverage EV production knowledge learned at the Ohio EV Hub, combined with the abundant resources and clean energy available in Canada , to establish a stable supply system for batteries, the key component of EVs, and increase cost competitiveness of its EVs as a whole.\n\nFurthermore, with an eye toward secondary use and the recycling of batteries, Honda will realize low-carbon value creation throughout the entire battery life cycle, through which Honda will establish a highly profitable business foundation and contribute to the realization of a carbon-neutral society.\n\nFor more information, photos and future updates, please visit www.hondanews.ca .\n\nComments by Toshihiro Mibe, Global CEO of Honda:\n\n\"Honda is making progress in our global initiatives toward the realization of our 2050 carbon neutrality goal. In North America, following the initiative to establish our EV production system capability in the U.S., we will now begin formal discussions toward the establishment of a comprehensive EV value chain here in Canada , with the support of the governments of Canada and Ontario .

Here's a list of the planned projects so far", "body": "Canada is betting big on electric-vehicle production as the country hopes to establish itself a major player in the global race to build EV supply chains within the next few years.\n\nThe federal government, as well as the Quebec and Ontario governments, have collectively committed tens of billions of dollars to support investments from major automakers.\n\nOn Thursday, Ottawa and Ontario confirmed the details of the latest big-money deal - with Honda, which will build a comprehensive electric-vehicle chain in the province.\n\nA note about government funding: Many of the dollar figures for production subsidies say \"up to\" - maximum totals that would only be reached if the factories began full-capacity production of batteries at the earliest possible date, because the subsidies are time-limited.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the most recent EV projects coming to Canada.\n\nOttawa and Ontario have announced a multibillion-dollar deal that will see Honda Motor Co. expand its Alliston, Ont., plant to manufacture electric vehicles and host a large EV battery plant. Both governments say the deal, unveiled Thursday by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Premier Doug Ford, is the largest ever single investment in Canada's auto sector.\n\nThe federal government is expected to give Honda around $2.5-billion through tax credits for clean technology manufacturing and electric vehicle supply chain investments. Ontario has committed to providing up to $2.5-billion directly - such as for capital costs - and indirectly, such as covering site servicing costs.\n\nOntario's Minister of Economic Development, Job Creation and Trade Vic Fedeli said in an interview before the announcement that the companies involved and governments would put in $15-billion in total for the expansion.\n\nThe structure of the governments' deal with Honda will differ significantly from the previous ones with Volkswagen and Stellantis. Unlike with those companies, it will not involve matching production subsidies being offered in the United States. Instead, it will revolve around federal investment tax credits and \"direct and indirect incentives\" from Ontario.\n\nThe deal with Honda includes a stand-alone battery-manufacturing plant, a retooled car-assembly plant, as well as facilities for both cathode materials and separator components. It is expected to see 240,000 vehicles a year manufactured at the site, preserve its existing 4,200 jobs and add another 1,000 jobs.\n\nSwedish battery maker Northvolt announced in September that it will build a new multibillion-dollar electric-vehicle battery plant just outside of Montreal. The project would be the largest private-sector investment ever made in Quebec, Quebec Economy Minister Pierre Fitzgibbon said at the time.\n\nNorthvolt chose Saint-Basile-le-Grand in the Richelieu Valley for the project, which will take over a site stretching more than 170 hectares.\n\nThe company says the plant will have 60 gigawatt hours of annual battery cell production capacity at maximum output, enough for one million EVs. Adjacent facilities for battery recycling and cathode active material making will also be set up.\n\nThe project is valued at an estimated $7-billion. Quebec is providing loans and taking equity worth $1.37-billion in Northvolt to allow the company to build the first phase of a new lithium-ion battery factory. The province will also offer to pay up to one-third, or $1.53-billion, of $4.6-billion in production incentives to the corporation.\n\nOttawa is committing up to $4.4-billion to Northvolt, including $1.34-billion to build the plant, and providing the bulk of the production incentives.\n\nConstruction for the first phase of the project started at the end of 2023, but was met by opposition from environmental groups seeking a temporary injunction to stop the work. A Quebec Superior Court judge refused to grant the injunction in January.\n\nNorthvolt expects the plant to begin operations in 2026.\n\nFord Motor Co. announced in August, 2023, that it's working with South Korea companies EcoProBM and SK On Co. Ltd. to build a $1.2-billion plant to produce EV battery materials in Becancour, Que.\n\nThe federal and Quebec governments each committed $322-million to the project, for a total of $644-million in public funding. The federal funding is a conditional contribution from the Strategic Innovation Fund, while the province granted a partially forgivable loan through government agency Investissement Qu\u00e9bec.\n\nThe Quebec plant marks Korean EcoProBM's first investment in North America. The plant will produce components made with nickel, cobalt and manganese and is expected to employ 345 workers.\n\nThe factory is expected to open in 2026, with the capacity to make components for batteries in approximately 45,000 Ford vehicles each year.\n\nStellantis NV and LG Energy Solution reached a deal with the federal and Ontario governments in July, 2023, to restart construction on their electric-vehicle battery factory in Windsor, Ont.\n\nOntario Economic Development Minister Vic Fedeli told The Globe and Mail that the deal will be worth \"up to $15-billion\" in subsidies. The Ontario government has agreed to pay one-third of the bill with Ottawa covering the rest.\n\nThe arrangement ended a standoff that escalated in May, 2023, when Stellantis and LG halted construction on their factory. They said the federal government had not kept a commitment to increase the facility's initial $1-billion subsidy to match much greater incentives offered to battery makers in the United States, under that country's Inflation Reduction Act.\n\nA report from Parliamentary Budget Officer Yves Giroux, released in September, concluded that it will take 20 years for the federal and Ontario governments to break even on a total $28.2-billion in subsidies for two specific plants - Stellantis-LG and Volkwagen.\n\nThe Stellantis-LG plant is scheduled to begin production by the end of 2024.\n\nOttawa and Ontario announced a deal with Volkswagen in April, 2023 to provide the company with up to $13.2-billion for production support after the company builds a battery plant in St. Thomas, Ont. The deal also includes $700-million upfront from the federal government to build the plant and $500-million from Ontario.\n\nThis announcement was considered the first major new foray into Canada since the 1980s by an automaker that does not already have roots here.\n\nThe federal funding was meant to match the subsidy Volkswagen would have received through U.S. President Joe Biden's Inflation Reduction Act, had it decided to build the factory in the U.S. instead. And it includes a provision that if the U.S. stops offering the subsidies, Canada will stop as well.\n\nBut Parliamentary Budget Officer Yves Giroux said in a report in June that the federal government's deal with Volkswagen will cost $16.3-billion. The PBO released an analysis that said the initial estimate did not include $2.8-billion needed to offset taxes that Volkswagen would pay on the federal production support.\n\nAnother PBO report from last September also detailed that the governments' subsidies for this plant and the Stellantis-LG plant would take 20 years to break even - not five as Ottawa previously suggested.\n\nGeneral Motors Co. announced in March, 2022, that it was partnering with South Korean battery material maker Posco Chemical Co. Ltd. on a new cathode factory in B\u00e9cancour, Que.\n\nThe plant, which GM says will be operational by 2025 and create about 200 jobs, will produce cathode active material (CAM) - a major component of EV batteries that is made up of processed nickel and lithium - that will power the Chevrolet Silverado pickup truck and GMC Hummer EV.\n\nThe Canadian and Quebec governments said they will provide financial support worth roughly half the cost of the new electric-vehicle battery-materials plant, a project now valued at more than $600-million.\n\nQuebec Premier Fran\u00e7ois Legault said the province would provide a loan to help finance the plan worth $152-million, partly forgivable if employment is maintained over a decade. Federal Innovation, Science and Industry Minister Fran\u00e7ois-Philippe Champagne aid Ottawa would contribute up to $147-million through the Strategic Innovation Fund's Net Zero Accelerator initiative.\n\nThe plant is currently under construction.", "source": {"uri": "theglobeandmail.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Globe and Mail"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Sign in You are logged in Switch accounts\n\nSpeaking in Toronto, Ford said Honda's investment in Alliston, Ont. would dwarf the massive Stellantis electric vehicle battery factory in Windsor and the even larger Volkswagen project in St. Thomas -- each of which received billions of dollars in subsidies from Queen's Park and the federal government.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nSwedish battery manufacturer Northvolt has also committed to building a battery mega-factory outside Montreal, with $4.6 billion in subsides from Ottawa and Qu\u00e9bec City.\n\n\"Over the past three years alone, we've attracted over $28 billion in auto and EV battery investments -- and folks, stay tuned,\" Ford told the First Nations Major Projects Coalition meeting Monday.\n\n\"But this week, we landed a new deal. It will be the largest deal in Canadian history. It'll be double the size of Volkswagen so stay tuned, we'll be announcing it this week,\" the premier enthused.\n\nFord noted Stellantis was spending $5 billion on a 4.2-million square foot facility in Windsor and VW another $7 billion on a 16 million square foot gigifactory in St. Thomas that will be the fourth largest building in the world.\n\n\"Ontario now is the only place in the entire world thinking this where the six largest automakers call home.\"\n\nBloomberg first reported that a deal with Honda was expected to be announced this week. The business news company wrote that, under the expected deal, the Japanese company is expected to \"build electric vehicles and their components\" in Ontario.\n\nA senior government source confirmed a deal was expected, but did not provide any details on how much it would be worth or when it would be made public.\n\nHonda's potential $18.4 billion auto assembly and EV battery factory would expand the complex 107 km north of Toronto that currently makes gasoline-powered Civics and CR-Vs.\n\nSpokespeople for Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and federal Industry Minister Fran\u00e7ois-Philippe Champagne did not immediately respond to questions from the Star on Monday.\n\nIn a statement, Honda Canada spokesperson Ken Chiu declined to confirm the company's plans, but said Honda is \"considering a number of initiatives and is in contact with governments at all levels as we move into the electrified era.\"\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nChiu added that, \"in order to achieve our 2040 electrification target of 100% electrified vehicles, we are considering various options to increase local production capacity, however we have nothing further to share at this time.\"\n\nTo Flavio Volpe, head of the Automotive Parts Manufacturers' Association, the prospect of an $18-billion deal with Honda would be \"incredible.\" He said it would be an even bigger coup after Trudeau's government signaled it wouldn't follow through with more direct subsidies it used to land EV factories from Stellantis, Volkswagen and Northvolt in Quebec.\n\nVolpe pointed to a new measure unveiled in the recent federal budget, which promised a new \"Electric Vehicle Supply Chain investment tax credit\" worth 10 per cent of the cost that companies put towards buildings used

trying to court Toyota -- another major Japanese automaker -- to set up electric vehicle manufacturing in Canada.\n\nIf the tax credit helped attract a big company like Honda, that would mark a

The Japanese automaker has started evaluating plans to build an electric car plant and an electric battery plant in Alliston, Ontario, along with two other facilities.\n\nHonda plans to build a plant making components for lithium-ion batteries, which power electric cars, through a joint venture with South Korea's Posco Future M. It also wants to make a lithium-ion battery separator plant with Asahi Kasei, a Japanese chemical company.\n\nOnce the assembly plant is active in 2028, it will make up to 240,000 vehicles annually and create more than 1,000 manufacturing jobs, according to Honda. \"Honda is making progress in our global initiatives toward the realization of our 2050 carbon neutrality goal,\" CEO Toshihiro Mibe said in a statement. \"We will strengthen our EV supply system and capability with an eye toward a future increase in EV demand in North America.\"\n\nHonda has also committed at least $700 million toward starting EV production in Ohio, with plans to start making cars in late 2025. It's also launched a joint venture battery plant with LG Energy Solution in the Buckeye State, with an expected investment of $4.4 billion.\n\nAnd Toyota -- despite its reluctance to make EVs over hybrid vehicles -- is undertaking a $1.4 billion investment to prepare its factory in Princeton, Indiana, to make a new three-row battery electric SUV. Toyota has poured more than $8 billion into the Indiana factory so far.\n\nThe latest investment will go toward providing infrastructure to build the new car and add a new battery pack assembly line supplied with lithium-ion batteries from Toyota's in-progress manufacturing plant in North Carolina. The $13.9 billion facility is set to begin production in 2025.\n\nIn February, the company said it would invest $1.3 billion into its Georgetown, Kentucky, facility to make a different new three-row battery electric SUV. Like the Indiana facility, it will also rely on batteries made in North Carolina.\n\nThe pair of Japanese automakers are looking to capitalize on interest in EVs and meet their carbon neutrality goals, which prioritizes cleaner cars that release less emissions. Several other automakers, including Hyundai Motor Co, have announced similar plans. By 2035, every other car sold around the world is set to be electric, according to the International Energy Agency.", "source": {"uri": "qz.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Quartz"}, "authors": [],

Check out their Stories!\n\nJapanese auto giant Honda will open an electric vehicle plant in eastern Canada, a Canadian government source familiar with the multibillion-dollar project told AFP on Monday.\n\nThe federal government as well as the province of Ontario, where the plant will be built, will both provide some financial incentives for the deal, according to the source, who spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nThe official announcement is due Thursday, though Ontario premier Doug Ford hinted at the deal on Monday.\n\n\"This week, we've landed a new deal. It will be the largest deal in Canadian history. It'll be double the size of Volkswagen,\" he said, referring to a battery plant announced last year, for which the German automaker pledged Can$7 billion (US$5 billion) in investment.\n\nCanada in recent years has been positioning itself as an attractive destination for electric vehicle investment, touting tax incentives, renewable energy access and its rare mineral deposits.\n\nThe Honda plant, to be built an hour outside Toronto, in Alliston, will also produce electric-vehicle batteries, joining existing Volkswagen and Stellantis battery plants.\n\nIn January, when news of the deal first bubbled up in the Japanese press, the Nikkei newspaper estimated it would be worth Can$14 billion -- numbers backed up by Canadian officials recently.\n\nIn the federal budget announced last week, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's government introduced a new business tax credit, granting companies a 10 percent rebate on construction costs for new buildings used in key segments of the electric vehicle supply chain.\n\nCanada's strategy follows that of the neighboring United States, whose Inflation Reduction Act has provided a host of incentives for green industry.\n\nHonda hopes to sell only zero-emission vehicles by 2040, with a goal of going carbon-neutral in its own operations by 2050.", "source": {"uri": "legit.ng", "dataType": "news", "title": "Legit.ng - Nigeria news."},

It will be the largest deal in Canadian history. It'll be double the size of Volkswagen,\" he said, referring to a battery plant announced last year, for which the German automaker pledged Can$7 billion (US$5 billion) in investment.\n\nCanada in recent years has been positioning itself as an attractive destination for electric vehicle investment, touting tax incentives, renewable energy access and its rare mineral deposits.\n\nThe Honda plant, to be built an hour outside Toronto, in Alliston, will also produce electric-vehicle batteries, joining existing Volkswagen and Stellantis battery plants.\n\nIn January, when news of the deal first bubbled up in the Japanese press, the Nikkei newspaper estimated it would be worth Can$14 billion -- numbers backed up by Canadian officials recently.\n\nIn the federal budget announced last week, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's government introduced a new business tax credit, granting companies a 10 percent rebate on construction costs for new buildings used in key segments of the electric vehicle supply chain.\n\nCanada's strategy follows that of the neighboring United States, whose Inflation Reduction Act has provided a host of incentives for green industry.\n\nHonda hopes to

Bruineman/BarrieToday Advertisement\n\nAn announcement on Thursday of the \"largest investment in Canadian history\" raised hopes of job security and technological advancement among Honda Canada workers in Alliston, and led to selfies with the country's top political hitters.\n\n\"I think it's great for somebody like myself. I've only been working at Honda for five years, so it's a great opportunity for my future and possibly of my kids' future,\" said Angus resident Katrina Lawson, who works in line quality in the polymer department.\n\nLawson and Mulmur Township resident Clara Seston, an engineer in the paint equipment group, managed to squeeze in a photo with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau following Thursday morning's announcement at Honda's manufacturing facility New Tecumseth, located about 40 minutes southwest of Barrie.\n\nBoth Lawson and Seston said they were excited about both the prospect of job stability and progress as the facility grows and transitions to electric vehicles.\n\nDescribed as a $15-billion investment by Honda, with support from the provincial and federal governments, the Alliston facility will grow from its current three plants to four as it retools to develop Canada's first \"comprehensive electric vehicle supply chain.\"\n\nThe announcement also includes up to $5 billion in government assistance.\n\nHonda's workforce will also grow by about 1,000 people from its current 4,200 employees.\n\n\"Today's announcement is a historic investment by a manufacturer in the Canadian auto industry. It proudly honours the highly skilled associates who have earned a global reputation for manufacturing excellence and represents Honda's recognition of the long-term attractiveness of the Canadian electric vehicle manufacturing ecosystem,\" said Jean Marc Leclerc, Honda Canada's president and chief executive officer.\n\n\"This is a very big day for the region, the province and the country,\" said Trudeau, who also gave a shout-out to the Honda workers who had assembled.\n\nPremier Doug Ford said the jobs at the Honda facility can be multiplied by seven, with the spinoff jobs, as it adds to more than 28,000 related jobs.\n\n\"Ontario has what it takes to secure the jobs of the future as the world leader in electric vehicle manufacturing, with better jobs and bigger paycheques for our world-class workers,\" Ford said.\n\nBy 2028, Honda will be operating what has been described as a world-class electric vehicle assembly plant -- the first of its kind for Honda Motor Co. Ltd.\n\nAlliston will be home to a new stand-alone battery manufacturing plant along with a cathode active material and precursor processing plant through a joint venture partnership with POSCO Future M Co. Ltd. and a separator plant through a joint venture partnership with Asahi Kasei Corporation.\n\nIn four years, it's expected to produce up to 240,000 vehicles per year.\n\n\"It's a very significant investment, the largest investment in Canadian history,\" said Doug Downey, MPP for Barrie-Springwater-Oro-Medonte and the province's attorney general.\n\n\"The spinoff investment across our communities will benefit Simcoe County,\" added Downey, who attended Thursday's announcement as part of a large contingent of municipal, provincial and federal politicians.\n\nNew Tecumseth Mayor Richard Norcross said he expects an explosive economic impact on the community of about 42,000 with the new positions and related jobs, as well as the positive effect on local businesses.\n\n\"People come from all over Simcoe County to work here. Honda's a great corporate citizen. Between our hospital, Matthews House (Hospice), our community events going on, Honda's always there to support local and always there to support our community,\" he said.\n\n\"The fact that, with everybody competing in North America that wanted our business ... they chose New Tecumseth, Alliston, that's a feather in our cap for all the residents that are here.\"\n\nNorcoss credited the community and town council's relationships with helping to build on the local business.\n\n\"It's pretty exciting,\" said Adam Hammell, who has been working at Honda for 12 years in production planning.\n\n\"With this investment, Honda is not only supporting additional jobs and growth in our region, but also helping build up and support healthy, vibrant communities,\" Simcoe County Warden Basil Clarke said in a prepared statement.\n\nHammell is part of a large workforce that draws from Barrie, as well as across Simcoe County and the rest of the region.\n\n\"You can have a 30-year career here and change careers every five years because it's so big, there's so much going on, there's so many departments -- the sky's really the limit,\" said another worker.\n\nHonda Canada was established in 1969 and followed with the construction of the Alliston plant in 1986 to its current capacity of producing 400,000 vehicles and 190,000 annually.", "source": {"uri":

The investment in Alliston, Ontario, is expected to greatly assist in Honda's goal of exclusively offering all-electric and fuel cell-powered vehicles by 2040.The timing of the investment may seem odd to industry onlookers and investors, as many automakers have announced pullbacks in their all-electric vehicle plans amid slower-than-expected adoption of EVs.Honda said the investment is \"for a future increase in EV demand in North America,\" with the battery plant capable of producing 36 gigawatt hours, or GWh, per year.The project is expected to create as least 1,000 new jobs, adding to the 4,200 employees the company currently has at its two existing manufacturing facilities in Ontario.Prime Minister of Canada Justin Trudeau said during a livestreamed press conference on Thursday that Honda's investment, 15 billion Canadian dollars, is the largest ever for the country's automotive industry. The company is expected to receive upward of CA$2.5 billion in assistance in tax credits and other incentives from the Canadian government, officials said.The investment is a major win for Canada and comes after Honda last year confirmed a $4.4 billion investment for a new U.S. battery plant in Ohio.\"In North America, following the initiative to establish our EV production system capability in the U.S., we will now begin formal discussions toward the establishment of a comprehensive EV value chain here in Canada, with the support of the governments of Canada and Ontario,\" Honda CEO Toshihiro Mibe said in a release. \"We will strengthen our EV supply system and capability with an eye toward a future increase in EV demand in North America.\"Honda said it has \"begun the process of evaluating the scope of its investment and completing negotiations with its joint venture partners.\" Its partner in the U.S. facility is LG Energy Solution.The company said it expects to finalize the plans over the next six months.Don't miss these exclusives from CNBC PROHere are Thursday's biggest analyst calls: Nvidia, Meta, Tesla, IBM, UPS, Five Below, Amazon, TJX Companies & moreHere's where

We'll be announcing that,\" Ford enthused in the legislature on Wednesday.\n\nBut NDP Leader Marit Stiles warned \"EV sales are down here in the province of Ontario.\"\n\n\"The premier isn't doing anything about it,\" said Stiles, zapping Ford for previously removing mandatory EV plugs for new homes from the building code.\n\n\"Not only is he jeopardizing the province's so-called made-in-Ontario electric vehicle program; he's risking the tens of thousands of good jobs that go with it, like the workers in Oakville who feel let down by the premier's lack of action or the delay of EV production by Ford Motor Company,\" she said.\n\nThat's a reference to Ford Canada's announcement three weeks ago that it's delaying electric vehicle production at its Oakville assembly plant until 2027, two years later than expected.\n\nIn 2020, the prime minister and premier each ponied up $295 million in taxpayers' money to help Ford Canada transition the Oakville plant to EV production.\n\nDespite that setback, both levels of government are committed to an electric future for auto manufacturing in Ontario.\n\nHonda's auto assembly and EV battery factory, which could eventually be worth as much as $18.4 billion, would expand the complex 107 kilometres north of Toronto that currently makes gas-powered Civics and CR-Vs.\n\nIt employs 4,200 workers and manufactures 400,000 vehicles annually.\n\nThe premier is fond of pointed out that the province now boasts six major automakers: Ford, General Motors, Honda, Stellantis (parent company of Chrysler, Jeep and Fiat), Toyota and VW.\n\n\"Ontario now is the only place in the entire world -- think of this -- where the six largest automakers call home,\" he said Monday.\n\nProvincial Economic Development Minister Vic Fedeli said the overall $28 billion in EV investments that Ontario has attracted in recent years would balloon to around $43 billion after the Honda deal.\n\nThis is a developing story.", "source":

This multibillion-dollar initiative will be located in Alliston, just an hour outside of Toronto, and is poised to produce not only vehicles but also electric-vehicle batteries, aligning with the operations of established Volkswagen and Stellantis battery plants.\n\nThe plant's establishment is supported by financial incentives from both the federal government and the province of Ontario, according to the anonymous source. Ontario Premier Doug Ford alluded to the project on Monday, describing it as a landmark deal set to be \"the largest deal in Canadian history\" and notably \"double the size of Volkswagen,\" which committed Can$7 billion (US$5 billion) last year for a similar facility.\n\nThe formal announcement is scheduled for Thursday. This move is part of Canada's broader effort to become a hub for electric vehicle production, leveraging its tax incentives, access to renewable energy, and rich deposits of rare minerals essential for this technology.\n\nEarlier in January, the Japanese press, including the Nikkei newspaper, speculated the deal to be worth around Can$14 billion -- a figure that Canadian officials have since corroborated. Adding to the momentum, the federal budget recently unveiled by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau introduced a new business tax credit offering a 10 per cent rebate on construction costs for new buildings pivotal to the electric vehicle supply chain, mirroring incentive strategies from the United States outlined in the Inflation Reduction Act.\n\nHonda's commitment to this plant aligns with its broader

That's how Premier Doug Ford has described a recently inked agreement between Ontario, Ottawa and auto giant Honda, officially announced Thursday.\n\nUnder the terms of the agreement, Honda will pump billions into building an electric vehicle assembly plant. For the automaker, the plant would be the first of its kind in Ontario; for the province, the third after automakers Stellantis and Volkswagen inked similar agreements last year. In touting the virtues of the agreement with Honda, the Premier said, \"everyone's going to benefit.\"\n\nBut that's not true. Not everyone. The move saddles Canadians with a product for which enthusiasm is tepid at best.\n\nDown the line, when a lack of return forces these automakers to rethink their investments, we may ask ourselves: what were the billions given to these companies actually for?\n\nAccording to the politicians' narrative, EVs are purportedly what Canadians want. Worried about the Earth's rising temperature, and eager for change, the public demands a future that is cleaner and greener. Canadians are - Ottawa keeps emphasizing - keen on going electric. \"There is clearly demand for EVs in Canada,\" proclaimed Environment Minister Steven Guilbeault late last year. Naysayers, he continued, \"should get on board.\"\n\nThat last comment was admittedly directed toward provincial lawmakers. But it might as well be directed toward voters.\n\nKevin Yin: Canada's oddly specific EV credits for Honda amounts to poor industrial policy\n\nAnnual EV sales have been rising over time but sales growth is slowing and enthusiasm is waning. A recent survey found that in 2024, 46 per cent of Canadians were interested in buying an electric vehicle, down from 56 per cent in 2023 and 68 per cent in 2022. More worryingly, not even these numbers (nor those in any poll I've seen) fully capture consumer hesitation toward EVs.\n\nTake 2023, a year when new vehicle sales in Canada topped more than 1.6 million. If you believe consumer surveys, EV sales should have totalled more than 900,000 (56 per cent of Canadians expressed interest in going electric remember?). The actual number of EVs sold in 2023? Fewer than 186,000. The same goes for 2022, when just EVs accounted for just 8 per cent of sales despite 68 per cent of Canadians reporting interest in bolt-powered autos.\n\nOf course, one party is certain to benefit from the Honda deal, and that is Honda. The Liberals' budget, which has yet to pass Parliament, offers a 10 per cent tax credit for building plants that support EVs. Honda's investment costs are estimated to equal more than $14-billion. You do the math.\n\nFor good measure, the likes of Honda are also being promised a 30 per cent manufacturing investment tax credit. And if that weren't enough, Mr. Trudeau and Mr. Ford have also (and separately) each committed $131-million to Honda to boost domestic car production. For EV manufactures in Canada, the adage seems true: when it rains, it pours.\n\nOne might argue that there is justification for all these EV plants, given that the Prime Minister has promised that new gas-powered autos will be unavailable for sale by 2035. And by 2026, just two years from now, automakers must commit to ensuring that at least 20 per cent of vehicles sold here are electric. For good measure, Ottawa has promised to fine manufacturers who don't comply.\n\nI suppose that's one way to do it. Consumers may be reticent about EVs but give them less (and eventually no) choice and - voila.\n\nBut consider what Ottawa is enforcing: it's on automakers to sell Canadians cars they don't want, can't afford and barely meet the performance expectations (think range) they have grown accustomed to.\n\nOttawa has glossed over these concerns, instead emphasizing impending price parity - the idea that EVs will soon cost the same as non EVs. Except we've been hearing this talking point for years. In 2017, analysts predicted price parity by 2025. In 2021, that forecast was revised upward to 2026. Now, the Environment Minister is talking about seeing price parity later this decade or in the early 2030s.\n\nForcing consumers to buy EVs won't be a popular move. Luckily, and as the Prime Minister likes to remind us, his job is, \"not to be popular.\"\n\nThe government's EV mandate is unlikely to last in its current form - and without forcing EVs on the population, there is no way uptake will be large enough to justify all the billions Ottawa has been throwing at the automakers.", "source": {"uri": "theglobeandmail.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Globe and Mail"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Electric vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honda", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Honda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontario", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ontario"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ontario"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottawa", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ottawa"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ottawa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellantis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stellantis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doug_Ford", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Doug Ford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_College", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Harvard College"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "History of Canada"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_Law_School", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Harvard Law School"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provinces_and_territories_of_Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Provinces and territories of Canada"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Economic policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Premier"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volkswagen", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Volkswagen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automotive_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Automotive industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Guilbeault", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Steven Guilbeault"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Industrial policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auto_rickshaw", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Auto rickshaw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_credit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tax credit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_Canada", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Parliament of Canada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_Party_of_Canada", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Liberal Party of Canada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Motor_Company", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ford Motor Company"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Motorcycles", "label": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Motorcycles", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Motorcycles", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Motorcycles", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Motorcycles/Classifieds", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Motorcycles/Classifieds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Motorcycles/Maintenance", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Motorcycles/Maintenance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 79}], "image": "https://www.theglobeandmail.com/resizer/v2/ADNUWVAA3ZKHLLMKEM26PK2S6E.JPG?auth=5093fad727a4a0c061a0763462f6e04fc0566ce83aafd6781532c14ff8769aef&width=560&quality=80", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9500357", "eventUri": "eng-9500357", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 115, "relevance": 1}

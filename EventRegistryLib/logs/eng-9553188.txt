Six other passengers were taken for medical check-ups inside the airport.\n\nA Boeing passenger plane came off the runway during takeoff from Dakar international airport early Thursday, injuring 11 people and shutting the hub for almost 12 hours, its operator said.\n\nThe Air Senegal flight was bound for the Malian capital Bamako and had 78 passengers onboard, airport management company, LAS, said in a statement.\n\nImages taken during the night and published by local media and on social networks showed the plane in an overgrown area with first aiders surrounding an injured person.\n\nSmoke and flames are also visible near the aircraft.\n\nThe Boeing 737/300 had been chartered from privately owned Transair, LAS said.\n\nThe jet \"came off the runway during its takeoff phase\" around 1:00 am (0100 GMT), it said.\n\nEleven people were injured, four of them seriously. Six other passengers were taken for medical check-ups inside the airport.\n\nThe transport ministry said in a separate statement that two pilots and four cabin crew were onboard.\n\nIt gave slightly different numbers saying there were 79 passengers and 10 injured, including a pilot.\n\nBlaise Diagne airport at Diass, 50 kilometres (30 miles) from the Senegalese capital Dakar, reopened shortly after midday, its operator later announced.\n\n\"We inform you that Blaise Diagne international airport has reopened,\" said LAS, made up of Turkish group Limak, the publicly-owned airport operator AIBD and another Turkish entity, Summa.\n\n\"Airport operations have resumed as normal.\"\n\nThe aircraft was \"immobilised\" away from the runway and an emergency plan triggered by airport authorities as soon as they were alerted, the group said.\n\n\"All the airport emergency services have been mobilised for the evacuation of passengers and their care, as per the plan,\" LAS went on.\n\n- Investigation Under Way -\n\n\"The exact circumstances of the incident remain to be determined, but an investigation is already under way to establish the reasons\" why the aircraft left the runway.\n\n\"Aviation specialists along with representatives of the airline concerned are on site to examine closely the airline log data and interview crew members,\" LAS said.\n\nThe transport ministry said the Bureau of Investigation and Analysis had opened an inquiry to determine the cause of the accident.\n\nIt comes as Air Senegal faces criticism with passengers regularly complaining about delays to domestic and international flights.\n\nUS manufacturer Boeing is also mired in problems, including safety concerns after two 737 MAX crashes within five months and another scare involving the aircraft over Alaska in January.\n\nThursday's incident comes a day after a Boeing 767 Fedex cargo plane touched down at Istanbul airport without its front landing gear which failed to open, though nobody was hurt, the US Federal Aviation administration said.\n\nState-owned Air Senegal began operating in May 2018 after emerging from the April 2016 collapse of Senegal Airlines.\n\nThe latter had itself replaced in 2009 Air Senegal International, in which Senegal and Morocco had stakes.\n\nThe launch of the carrier's latest incarnation is part of a plan to turn Dakar into a regional air hub around the international airport, inaugurated in December 2017, and revamped provincial airports.\n\nThe Blaise Diagne airport at Diass is named for the first African lawmaker elected to the French parliament in 1872 until 1934.\n\nIt replaces the Leopold-Sedar-Senghor International Airport (AILSS) in the suburbs of the capital which has been converted into a military facility.\n\nTransair, founded in 2010, is based at Blaise Diagne and serves a dozen destinations across West Africa.", "source": {"uri": "channelstv.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Six other passengers were taken for medical check-ups inside the airport.\n\n\"The plane, at the end of the runway, was not able to take off. The pilot chose to take it off the runway onto the land alongside,\" said LAS director general Askan Demir.\n\n\"Personally I think he managed the situation well. The plane was not damaged too much.\"\n\nThe transport ministry said in a separate statement that two pilots and four cabin crew were onboard.\n\nIt gave slightly different numbers saying there were 79 passengers and 10 injured, including a pilot.\n\nBlaise Diagne airport at Diass, 50 kilometres from the Senegalese capital Dakar, reopened shortly after midday.\n\n\"We inform you that Blaise Diagne international airport has reopened,\" said LAS, made up of Turkish group Limak, the publicly-owned airport operator AIBD and another Turkish entity, Summa.\n\n\"Airport operations have resumed as normal.\"\n\nThe aircraft was \"immobilised\" away from the runway and an emergency plan triggered by airport authorities as soon as they were alerted, the group said.\n\n\"All the airport emergency services have been mobilised for the evacuation of passengers and their care, as per the plan,\" LAS went on.\n\n\"The exact circumstances of the incident remain to be determined, but an investigation is already under way to establish the reasons\" why the aircraft left the runway.\n\n\"Aviation specialists along with representatives of the airline concerned are on site to examine closely the airline log data and interview crew members,\" LAS said.\n\nThe transport ministry said the Bureau of Investigation and Analysis had opened an inquiry to determine the cause of the accident.\n\nIt comes as Air Senegal faces criticism with passengers regularly complaining about delays to domestic and international flights.\n\nUS manufacturer Boeing is also mired in problems, including safety concerns after two 737 MAX crashes within five months and another scare involving an aircraft over Alaska in January.\n\nThursday's incident came a day after a Boeing 767 Fedex cargo plane touched down at Istanbul airport despite its front landing failing to open, the US Federal Aviation administration said. No one was hurt.\n\nTuesday, an Air France 787-900 flying to Seattle from Paris was diverted to Canada after a burning smell was detected in the cabin.\n\nState-owned Air Senegal began operating in May 2018 after emerging from the April 2016 collapse of Senegal Airlines.\n\nThe latter had itself replaced in 2009 Air Senegal International, in which Senegal and Morocco had stakes.\n\nThe launch of the carrier's latest incarnation is part of a plan to turn Dakar into a regional air hub around the international airport, inaugurated in December 2017, and revamped provincial airports.\n\nThe Diagne airport is named for the first African lawmaker elected to the French parliament in 1872 until 1934.\n\nIt replaces the Leopold-Sedar-Senghor International Airport (AILSS) in the suburbs of the capital which has been converted into a military facility.\n\nTransair, founded in 2010, is based at Blaise Diagne and serves a dozen destinations across West Africa.", "source": {"uri": "news24.com",

The airline itself was formed after the dissolution of Air Senegal International in 2009, a joint venture between Senegal and Morocco.\n\nThe reopening of Blaise Diagne International Airport in 2017 is part of a three-phase plan to transform Dakar into a regional air hub. The airport replaced the Leopold-Sedar-Senghor International Airport (AILSS) in the capital's suburbs, now converted into a military facility.\n\nTransair, founded in 2010 and based at Blaise Diagne International Airport, serves a dozen destinations across West Africa, including Sierra Leone's Freetown, Nouakchott, Banjul, and Conakry. According to its website, the airline carries approximately 90,000 passengers annually.\n\nThursday's accident came a day after a Boeing 767 FedEx cargo plane landed at Istanbul Airport without its front landing gear, which had failed to deploy.

Six other passengers were taken for medical check-ups inside the airport, LAS said.\n\nThe group said the airport at Diass, 50 kilometres (30 miles) from Dakar, had reopened shortly after midday.\n\n\"We inform you that Blaise Diagne International Airport has reopened. Airport operations have resumed as normal,\" LAS stated.\n\nThe aircraft was \"immobilised\" away from the runway and an emergency plan was triggered by airport authorities as soon as they were alerted, the group said.\n\n\"All the airport emergency services have been mobilised for the evacuation of passengers and their care, as per the plan,\" LAS went on.\n\nOnline images showed a large hole in the left engine and the wing covered in firefighting foam.\n\n\"The exact circumstances of the incident remain to be determined, but an investigation is already underway to establish the reasons\" why the aircraft left the runway.\n\n\"Aviation specialists along with representatives of the airline concerned are on site to examine closely the airline log data and interview crew members,\" LAS said.\n\nThe incident comes with Air Senegal having already endured months of criticism with passengers regularly complaining about delays to domestic and international flights.\n\nThe state-owned entity began operating in May 2018 after emerging from the April 2016 collapse of Senegal Airlines. The latter had itself replaced in 2009 by Air Senegal International, in which Senegal and also Morocco had stakes.\n\nThe launch of the carrier's latest incarnation is part of a three-stage plan to turn Dakar into a regional air hub around the international airport, inaugurated in December 2017, and revamped provincial airports.\n\nThe Blaise Diagne airport at Diass, which bears the name of the first African lawmaker elected to the French Parliament (1872-1934), replaces the Leopold-Sedar-Senghor International Airport (AILSS), in the suburbs of the capital, which has been converted into a military facility.\n\nTransair, founded in 2010, is based at Blaise Diagne and serves a dozen destinations across West Africa, including Sierra Leone's Freetown as well as Nouakchott, Banjul and Conakry. According to its website it carries some 90,000 passengers a year.\n\nThursday's incident came a day after a Boeing 767 Fedex cargo plane touched down at Istanbul airport without its front landing gear which failed to open, though nobody was hurt, the US Federal Aviation administration said.", "source": {"uri": "standardmedia.co.ke", "dataType": "news", "title": "Standard Digital News -

The latter had itself replaced in 2009 Air Senegal International, in which Senegal and also Morocco had stakes.\n\nThe launch of the carrier's latest incarnation is part of a three-stage plan to turn Dakar into a regional air hub around the international airport, inaugurated in December 2017, and revamped provincial airports.\n\nThe Blaise Diagne airport at Diass, which bears the name of the first African lawmaker elected to the French Parliament (1872-1934), replaces the Leopold-Sedar-Senghor International Airport (AILSS), in the suburbs of the capital, which has been converted into a military facility.\n\nTransair, founded in 2010, is based at Blaise Diagne and serves a dozen destinations across West Africa, including Sierra Leone's Freetown as well as Nouakchott, Banjul and Conakry. According to its website it carries some 90,000 passengers a year.\n\nThursday's incident came a day after a Boeing 767 Fedex cargo plane touched down at Istanbul airport without its front landing gear which failed to open, though nobody was hurt, the US Federal Aviation administration said.", "source": {"uri": "guardian.ng", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [],

Africa.\n\nThe incident comes as Boeing faces growing questions over its safety record.\n\nDave Calhoun, the company's chief executive, announced last month that he would step down at the end of the year as part of a management overhaul.\n\nLarry Kellner, who chairs Boeing's board of directors, will also leave his role.\n\nBoeing has been heavily scrutinised since one of its 737 Max 9 planes

its production.\n\nThe incident in Senegal comes a day after a Boeing 767 cargo aircraft, operated by FedEx, performed an emergency landing in Turkey after its landing gear failed.\n\nThe flight,

Flight disruptions at Dakar Airport\n\nBlaise Diagne International was temporarily closed following the incident. It is Senegal's largest and busiest airport, handling over 90% of all scheduled commercial flights. Flightradar24 shows that a few flights were diverted around the time of the incident, while other flights landed later than scheduled.\n\nPhoto: Flightradar24\n\nA Turkish Airlines Airbus A330 operating Flight TK501 from Istanbul to Dakar diverted to Banjul International Airport (BJL) in the Gambia. The flight departed Istanbul at 01:15 local time and was scheduled to arrive in Dakar at 05:35. It landed in Banjul around 05:30. An ASKY Boeing 737 MAX operating flight KP53 was also diverted to Banjul. At 11:11, A\u00e9roport Dakar Blaise Diagne said on its X page,\n\n\"We inform you of the reopening of Blaise Diagne International Airport. Airport operations have resumed normally.\"\n\nThe aircraft involved in the incident is registered as 6V-AJE. It took its first flight in October 1994 before being delivered to Romanian flag carrier TAROM. It joined TransAir's fleet in December 2023. ATDB.aero now lists it as \"destroyed.\"\n\nCheck out more African aviation news here\n\nFour serious incidents in the past week\n\nThe TransAir 737 is the fourth serious incident to make headlines in Africa over the last seven days. Another 737, operated by Serve Air Cargo, was involved in a runway excursion in Kinshasa on May 5, 2024. While no injuries were reported, the aircraft was substantially damaged, with the right-hand engine missing. Similarly, the incident resulted in the temporary closure of the airport.\n\nEarlier that day, a Fokker 50 operated by the Comoros' R'Komor came off the runway in Moh\u00e9li, the Comoros. Like the Air Senegal incident, the crew rejected takeoff and overshot the runway. The aircraft came to a stop in nearby bushes with the right main landing gear collapsed. Out of the 52 people onboard, several passengers reportedly received injuries.\n\nA fatal accident took place in Windhoek, Namibia, on May 3, 2024. A Westair Cessna 406 crashed in a residential area shortly after takeoff from Eros Airport (ERS). Three people, including two pilots and one engineer, died in the crash. They were all employees of Westair, which owns 60% of FlyNamibia.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on this story?

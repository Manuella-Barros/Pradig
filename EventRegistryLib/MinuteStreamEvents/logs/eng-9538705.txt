That represents a step-change for the FTC, which in the past usually sought asset sales before assenting to deals, legal observers say.\n\n\"It's definitely avant-garde antitrust,\" said Jeffrey Oliver, a partner at law firm Baker Botts LLP and former FTC official. \"It's way for them to appear tough on a deal that they couldn't find a route to try and block on any other grounds.\"\n\nExxon closed its acquisition of Pioneer Friday.\n\nChevron Corp., Occidental Petroleum Corp., Diamondback Energy Inc. and Chesapeake Energy Corp. are among the companies with pending transactions currently under FTC review.\n\nThe notion of the FTC scrutinizing individual executives has some companies with pending deals reviewing their regulatory-review strategies, as they are uncertain what the agency could throw at them next, according to people familiar with current deals.\n\nThe FTC hasn't sought to block an oil or gas deal outright in recent memory, preferring to reach settlements. Last year, the agency required a Quantum Energy Partners founder to give up a board seat on shale-gas driller EQT Corp. before it could proceed with an acquisition.\n\nThe FTC cited \"voluminous evidence\" that Sheffield, 71, sought to co-ordinate production levels across the U.S. shale sector and align the industry with the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, with whom he communicated extensively in private messages and dinners. The agency also cited public comments in which Sheffield advocated production discipline among American peers.\n\nIn an 850-word rebuttal of the FTC allegations, Pioneer defended its co-founder, citing his role in driving U.S. crude-production growth. His efforts to encourage discipline among drillers was aimed at improving investor returns and steeling the shale sector against OPEC's \"predatory practices,\" the company said.\n\n\"Until today, the FTC has taken non-adversarial stances against oil industry mergers,\" Jim Lucier, managing director at Capital Alpha Partners, wrote in a note to clients. \"Now that stance is different. We will be on the lookout for other consent decrees, based on dubious legal theories, to be applied to oil industry mergers.\"\n\nThe FTC's decision comes against a backdrop of hostility from Democratic lawmakers that accused oil executives of \"deception and doublespeak\" over climate change in an investigation in the House of Representatives this week. Liberal advocacy group Climate Power seized on the FTC move as evidence that Big Oil is \"price gouging consumers so that Americans pay more at the pump even after years of record profits.\"\n\nA positive note for the industry from the FTC ruling was its decision to define the oil market globally rather than a narrow, localized one that could have competition concerns.\n\n\"The good news is, they're not hamstringing these deals, not forcing divestment of assets, not doing anything that makes either party want to walk from a deal,\" said Dan Pickering, founder of Pickering Energy Partners. \"Ultimately, the deals are moving ahead pretty much as the two parties envisioned when they struck the deals.\"\n\nU.S. oil production is currently about 13.1 million barrels a day, close to record levels and 40% higher than OPEC leader Saudi Arabia. U.S. crude output more than doubled in the past 15 years, a result of the shale-oil revolution that Sheffield helped champion.\n\n\"This is the government trying to save some face -- it's irrelevant to the whole issue of antitrust,\" said Leo Mariani, managing director at Roth MKM. Through Sheffield's 50 years in the industry, \"he's never really had issues where people thought he was engaging in anti-competitive behaviors,\" Mariani said.\n\n\"So it's silly,\" he said. \"This whole thing is just politics ultimately. In an election year it helps to be tough on Big Oil.\"\n\nInformation for this article was contributed by Leah Nylen of Bloomberg News.", "source": {"uri": "arkansasonline.com", "dataType": "news",

There was one condition attached to the approval of the $60-billion deal: that Scott Sheffield, the former CEO of Pioneer, does not join the combined company's board.\n\nThe FTC alleged that Sheffield had colluded with OPEC and OPEC+ members to limit production and increase oil prices. The allegations shook the shale oil world, where several large consolidation deals are awaiting the trade watchdog's approval. Now, the consolidation drive that has marked the last year in U.S. shale may have to slow down.\n\nFirst, the allegations. According to a news release from last week, the Federal Trade Commission had informed Exxon that it would only approve the merger with Pioneer if Sheffield, who was going to become an Exxon board member as part of the deal, stayed out of it.\n\n\"Mr. Sheffield's past conduct makes it crystal clear that he should be nowhere near Exxon's boardroom. American consumers shouldn't pay unfair prices at the pump simply to pad a corporate executive's pocketbook,\" the deputy director of the FTC's Bureau of Competition, Kyle Mach, said in the release.\n\n\"Through public statements and private communications, Pioneer founder and former CEO Scott D. Sheffield has campaigned to organize anticompetitive coordinated output reductions between and among U.S. crude oil producers, and others, including the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (\"OPEC\"), and a related cartel of other oil-producing countries known as OPEC+,\" the Commission in a formal complaint.\n\nThe regulator then went on to motivate the attachment of its condition to the Exxon-Pioneer deal approval, saying that it sought \"to prevent Pioneer's Sheffield from engaging in collusive activity that would potentially raise crude oil prices, leading American consumers and businesses to pay higher prices for gasoline, diesel fuel, heating oil and jet fuel.\"\n\nNaturally, Pioneer had something to say about the allegations. In a response to the FTC allegations, the company defended its founder, saying he had always had the U.S. oil industry's best interest at heart. The response also suggested that any communication Sheffield may have conducted with OPEC and OPEC+ members had been to the same end -- to protect the U.S. shale industry.\n\n\"Mr. Sheffield and Pioneer believe that the FTC's Complaint reflects a fundamental misunderstanding of the U.S. and global oil markets and misreads the nature and intent of Mr. Sheffield's actions,\" the response said.\n\nThe actions in question were conversations with OPEC and OPEC+ officials in 2020, when pandemic lockdowns decimated global oil demand, pushing U.S. oil prices briefly below zero. At the time, Sheffield was an advocate of production cuts in the shale patch as well, in a bid to minimize the damage that the demand drop was already causing the industry, Pioneer also said.\n\nIt didn't make any difference, however. The FTC had already made up its mind and acted on it. As a result, Bloomberg and the Financial Times are reporting that shale executives are getting spooked about future mergers in case they get caught in the crosshairs of the regulator, which has not exactly been a fan of the oil industry since 2020.\n\n\"The implications go far beyond Sheffield,\" James Lucier, an analyst at Capital Alpha Partners, said in a note to clients following the news, as quoted by the Financial Times. \"The FTC has not to date taken an adversarial approach toward oil industry mergers\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009This relative hands-off policy is no more.\"\n\nIn a sense, the FTC's move against Sheffield is the other shoe dropping as far as the oil industry is concerned. The regulator has been looking for a way to interfere with the consolidation drive prompted by strong financial results and limited untapped inventory. Until recently, it has been unable to find one. But now, it seems, it has.\n\nNot everyone agrees the FTC's attack on Sheffield needs to be taken particularly seriously. \"This is the government trying to save some face -- it's irrelevant to the whole issue of antitrust,\" the managing director of investment bankers Roth MKM, Leo Mariani, told Bloomberg. \"This whole thing is just politics ultimately. In an election year it helps to be tough on Big Oil.\"\n\nPresident Biden and his fellow Democrats have repeatedly made it clear that the anti-oil lobby is a key voter demographic and they have been busy tending to its needs. Earlier this year, Biden's White House paused approval of new LNG export capacity as part of these efforts. Then, just this month, Democrats in Congress announced the completion of an investigation into Big Oil that, while it did not contain anything in the way of a revelation, sought to reinforce an image of the industry as the hydrocarbon equivalent of Big Tobacco, deserving of an identical treatment.\n\nWhether any of this will help Biden win the November vote remains to be seen, but judging by the latest in his approval ratings, there may be a possibility that most Americans have bigger problems than climate change and oil.", "source": {"uri": "oilprice.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "OilPrice.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ExxonMobil", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "ExxonMobil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shale", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Shale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Trade_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal Trade Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OPEC", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "OPEC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheffield", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sheffield"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sheffield"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_of_oil", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Price of oil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Petroleum in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Petroleum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pioneer_Natural_Resources", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pioneer Natural Resources"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shale_oil", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shale oil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_lockdowns", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "COVID-19 lockdowns"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heating_oil", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Heating oil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jet_fuel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jet fuel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Financial Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diesel_fuel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Diesel fuel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cartel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gasoline", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gasoline"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Petroleum industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrocarbon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hydrocarbon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquefied_natural_gas", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Liquefied natural gas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Oil", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Big Oil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_L.P.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bloomberg L.P."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competition_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Competition law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Health", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Health", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Energy", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Energy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://d32r1sh890xpii.cloudfront.net/article/718x300/2024-05-06_fsdixbhrht.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538705", "eventUri": "eng-9538705", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3019607843137255, "wgt": 176, "relevance": 1}

The FTC has yet to take an adversarial approach to oil industry mergers... This relative hands-off policy is no more.\n\nAny CEO considering a merger will have to fear being singled out as Sheffield was, he added.\n\nUnder the leadership of Lina Khan, appointed by US President Joe Biden, the FTC has taken an aggressive approach in its mission to protect competition and consumers. In the past two weeks alone, the group has banned non-compete agreements with its employees and filed a lawsuit to block an $8.5 billion takeover of the luxury industry, arguing that the deal threatens to deprive consumers of competition for affordable handbags.\n\nAs a condition of approving Exxons' purchase of Pioneer, the FTC took the extraordinary step of barring Sheffield from joining the supermajors' board of directors as provided for in the merger agreement. In doing so, the agency targeted a senior figure in America's shale energy revolution, which over the past two decades made Pioneer Texas' largest oil producer with operations in the vast basin Permian.\n\nThe FTC focused on Sheffield's efforts to curb production amid a dramatic fall in prices at the start of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, which left many U.S. producers on the brink of bankruptcy.\n\nSheffield led an effort urging Texas regulators to introduce supply curbs and called on members of the OPEC+ group, including Saudi Arabia and Russia, to cut production.\n\nPioneer said Sheffield, 71, who has lived through six industrial downturns, had simply expressed his concerns aimed at raising awareness of the problem and encouraging state, federal and international governments to act. Sheffield declined to be interviewed.\n\nBut the FTC, which combed through hundreds of text messages, WhatsApp messages and public statements as it scrutinized the Exxon takeover, said it had embarked on the Exxon takeover.[ed] on a series of efforts to coordinate production levels to keep production artificially low, and served to direct communications between its Permian Basin competitors and OPEC.\n\nServing on Exxons' board risked amplifying his public message and the effectiveness of his private contacts with OPEC, the agency said.\n\nScott Sheffield, former CEO of Pioneer Bloomberg\n\nEvidence cited by the agency included a dinner that Sheffield attended with other U.S. producers, hosted by the late OPEC Secretary General Mohammed Barkindo, in 2017. Such dinners have become a regular event of the industry in recent years, often organized on the sidelines of the agreement. Annual CERAWeek Energy Conference in Houston.\n\nParticipants say the gatherings have become increasingly cordial in recent years, as memories of cartel efforts to sink the U.S. shale industry by flooding the market with oil fade.\n\nCEOs in attendance include Vicki Hollub of Occidental Petroleums, Rick Muncrief of Devon Energys, Nick DellOsso of Chesapeake Energy and John Hess of Hess. Chesapeake declined to comment, while the other companies did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nIndustry executives and analysts said Sheffield was paying the price for its outspokenness and becoming a victim of the FTC's efforts to take a tough stance on the industry. One senior executive described the agency's approach as a bit over-the-top.\n\nSheffield has clearly been one of the voices of the U.S. upstream industry, and in retrospect he's obviously taking a bit of a beating, said Dan Pickering of Pickering Energy Partners, an investment and consulting group.\n\nGiven the high-profile nature of this deal, they needed something. I think you would hear a lot of screaming from a lot of people who didn't want this deal to go through if it went through without any changes.\n\nUnder Chairman Lina Khan, the FTC has taken an aggressive approach in its work to protect competition and consumers. Getty Images\n\nThe move comes six months before Americans go to the polls, as Biden administration officials worry about the electoral impact of rising prices at the pump.\n\nKevin Book, an analyst at ClearView Energy Partners, said that could indicate a new tactic by the administration to moderate such hikes: implicitly encouraging national operators seeking commission approval for transactions to increase their production.\n\nIndustry fears FTC may open broader, industry-wide investigation into collusion allegations ahead of election as it gathers massive trove of documents and private communications from companies energy companies in the midst of a merger and acquisition boom.\n\nIn addition to the $60 billion Exxon-Pioneer deal, the FTC issued a second request for information to companies in at least four other pending buyouts worth a total of more than $100 billion: Chevron and Hess; Diamondback Energy and Endeavor Energy; Occidental and CrownRock; and Chesapeake Energy and Southwestern Energy.\n\nThe FTC declined to say whether or not it would launch an industry investigation into the collusion allegations.\n\nBut some experts said that despite the action on Sheffield, the agency's approval of the Exxon-Pioneer deal, the supermajor's largest since its 1999 merger with Mobil, demonstrated that it was unlikely it blocks similar mega-mergers in the oil sector.\n\nI think the outcome is really encouraging for these upstream transactions that the agency is currently considering, said Jeffrey Oliver, a partner at the law firm Baker Botts and a former FTC attorney. This is very helpful for many of these deals that are still pending.\n\nWhat Are The Main Benefits Of Comparing Car Insurance Quotes Online", "source": {"uri": "exbulletin.com", "dataType": "news",

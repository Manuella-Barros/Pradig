{"id": 237086800, "title": "Foot Fetish: What Enthusiasts Want You To Know", "text": "Different foot fetishists may appreciate different aspects of feet. Some like clean feet; others prefer dirty ones. Some enjoy big feet; others admire tiny feet. Certain individuals appreciate a high arch, a specific kind of toe shape or other physical attributes. Foot adornments, such as certain shoes, socks, stockings, nail polish or toe rings, are also popular. It\u2019s really in the eye of the beholder. According to a 2023 survey from an online platform where you can buy and sell foot pictures, called Fun With Feet, more than half of respondents said the biggest turn-on for them was the taboo nature of foot fetishes. \u201cThe dirtiness and disgust that\u2019s associated with feet in many cultures just makes it all the more appealing,\u201d one respondent said. \u201cIt\u2019s like a forbidden fruit that I just want to savor.\u201d Others say they\u2019re titillated by the fact that feet are a part of the body that we don\u2019t get to see all that often as they\u2019re typically at least partially covered in public. There\u2019s something intimate about seeing someone\u2019s bare feet since that\u2019s usually reserved for the beach, pool or a private setting, like someone\u2019s home. Jeremy M., a 40-year-old whose last name has been omitted to protect his privacy, told HuffPost that he was a teenager when he first realized he had a foot fetish and found himself \u201cchecking out feet or toes, especially the sexy, bright-painted colored ones.\u201d \u201cThe summertime is the best because everyone is wearing open-toed shoes or sandals,\u201d he said. He said he enjoys smaller feet as well as \u201cperfectly lined toes where no toes are longer than the other.\u201d \u201cSome guys like them dirty \u2014 for me, I prefer clean feet,\u201d he said. His belief: If a woman has \u201cwell-maintained feet,\u201d then she must take care of herself in other ways, too.

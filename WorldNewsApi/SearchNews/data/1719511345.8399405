The former Manchester United star began his journey at Old Trafford as a 16-year-old from Torquay United in 1988 and saw much success during his six years there. The forward proudly bears the titles of three Premier League victories among other notable successes, reports the Mirror. The former England player was an indispensable part of Sir Alex Ferguson's legendary squad, which featured the meteoric rise of the so-called Class of '92 - David Beckham, Nicky Butt, Gary Neville, Phil Neville, Paul Scholes, and Giggs.

Also Dion Dublin I spent time with when he was at Manchester United. We were all single lads so [we] spent time together during that time.\" Sharpe also gave his opinion on Marcus Rashford's form, suggesting that disquiet caused by Paris Saint-Germain's reported interest means the England international should consider leaving his boyhood club. \"He is such a talented player, he needs to be on his game and we've seen what a great player he can be,\" he added. \"But something isn't right now and if his head has been turned, then it's best for him to leave, but if he can rediscover the previous form then he can get back to his best.\"", "summary": "Former Manchester United winger Lee Sharpe has opened up on his time at Old Trafford and the relationships he had with some of his team-mates during his six-year spell at the club", "url": "https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/keane-lee-sharpe-manchester-united-29226098", "image": "https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article26176137.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_GettyImages-2934640.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-26 17:00:00", "author": "Fasika Zelealem", "authors": ["Fasika Zelealem"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": 0.181}

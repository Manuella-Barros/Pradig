{"id": 231246196, "title": "Social Security update: July direct payment worth $943 goes out in 23 days", "text": "The Supplemental Security Income payment for July, worth up to $943 for individual filers, goes out to millions of beneficiaries in just over three weeks. The payment will go out in 23 days, on Monday, July 1, to people with a serious debilitating disability that results in a limited income, according to the Social Security Administration. While SSI payments normally arrive on the first of the month, June\u2019s payment was sent out on May 31, as June 1 fell on a Saturday. The maximum amount each filer can get depends on how they applied. The three categories for qualified applicants include individual filers, joint filers, and essential persons, who are people who live with SSI recipients to provide them with necessary care. Individual filers receive up to $943 each month, people who filed as a couple can receive up to $1,415 a month, and essential persons get up to $472 each month, according to the SSA. These amounts are an increase of 3.2% from 2023 due to inflation. To qualify for the payments, a person needs to be at least partially blind or have a \u201cphysical or mental condition(s) that seriously limits their daily activities for a period of 12 months or more, or may be expected to result in death.\u201d The SSI program was created in 1974 to provide assistance for senior citizens and people with debilitating disabilities. The program was designed to provide a base level of income that would be supplemented by state programs. SSI payments are not included in regular Social Security benefits. Enrolling in Social Security does not automatically qualify someone for SSI payments, and not every recipient will receive the maximum amount. Filers can see a personalized estimate through the SSA\u2019s calculator.", "summary": "The Supplemental Security Income payment for July, worth up to $943 for individual filers, goes out to millions of beneficiaries in just over three weeks.

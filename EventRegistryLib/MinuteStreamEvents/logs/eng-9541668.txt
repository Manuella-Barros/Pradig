They are represented in the parliament's Identity and Democracy group that includes the National Rally of France's Marine Le Pen and Germany's AfD.\n\nBut von der Leyen has hinted that she might be open to working with the anti-Putin far-right bloc, the European Conservatives and Reformists group led by Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni.\n\n- 'Won't be a landslide' -\n\nPascale Joannin, head of the Robert Schuman Foundation, a think tank, said populist radical right parties \"will gain ground, but it won't be a landslide\".\n\nMeloni is symbolically running as the lead candidate for the European Parliament for her post-fascist Brothers of Italy party. She will not take up a seat, though, as the legislature bars MEPs from also holding public office in a national government.\n\nShe has said she wants \"a majority uniting the forces on the right, to send the left into opposition\".\n\nIf the EPP did ally with the ECR, that would upset its arrangement with the Socialists and Democrats and Renew Europe.\n\n\"Looking at the polls today, there's no other stable coalition that could be entertained\" than the existing three-way mainstream formation, said Joannin.\n\nThe surveys suggest the EPP will remain the biggest grouping in the parliament, followed by the Socialists and Democrats, though both will likely lose seats.\n\nThird place is an open bet. Renew Europe -- which includes the Renaissance party of French President Emmanuel Macron -- could lose that spot to an extreme-right grouping.\n\nMore from this section Press briefing by Independent Presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. - 52924176 US: More Than 200 Arrested, Riot Police Moves Into Pro-Palestine Encampment At UCLA 4 King Charles to relinquish dozens of patronages after thorough review\n\nBut, even if that were to occur, the alignment between the EPP, Socialists and Democrats, and Renew Europe would still ensure a majority, Joannin said.\n\nMeloni, however, would \"want to get some (EU) posts, influence policies she holds dear, such as migration, and to sway debates\" by using her group's number of seats to make demands in return for support, the analyst said.\n\nTwo other experts from the Institut Jacques Delors think tank, Nathalie Brack and Awenig Marie, said in a briefing note that they believed the current three-way coalition in the parliament will dominate after the elections.\n\nBut, they said, there could be ad hoc alliances between the EPP and the ECR.\n\nGetting a majority, though, would still need support from either the Renew Europe or the Identity and Democracy (ID) groups, which is not certain, they said.\n\nAnother expert, Daniela Schwarzer, said during a debate hosted by the European Policy Centre think thank that far-right MEPs would arrive \"with an agenda that questions part of the achievement of the EU, but also would make it far more difficult to take certain decisions\".\n\n- Far-right merger unlikely -\n\nAs for a possible merger of the two extreme-right groups in the parliament, analysts believe that unlikely, given fundamental divisions.\n\nThe ECR includes parties that have been, or currently are, in government, Joannin noted.\n\n\"They are people compatible with the EU project, they aren't as anti-EU as the ID,\" she added.\n\n\"They support Ukraine -- the opposite of the ID group, which is more pro-Putin.\"\n\nOne unknown is whether the ECR might welcome the populist Fidesz party of Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, who is the EU leader closest to Putin.\n\nImmigration, a topic the far right has tapped into, is not a lead issue in the overall European electorate. It ranks number seven in a list of concerns, behind fighting poverty, unemployment, health, and defence and EU security, according to the latest polling by the EU's Eurobarometer unit.\n\nThe political balance resulting from the EU elections will help determine who gets the bloc's top jobs, heading the European Commission, the European Council and the European Parliament.\n\nalm/rmb/bc/tym", "source": {"uri": "reformer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Brattleboro Reformer"}, "authors": [{"uri": "anne_laure_mondesert@reformer.com", "name": "Anne-Laure Mondesert", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renew_Europe", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Renew Europe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_People's_Party", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "European People's Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_Alliance_of_Socialists_and_Democrats", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far-right_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Far-right politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landslide_victory", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Landslide victory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Conservatives_and_Reformists", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "European Conservatives and Reformists"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giorgia_Meloni", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Giorgia Meloni"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ursula_von_der_Leyen", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ursula von der Leyen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Parliament", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "European Parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Rally", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Rally"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_right_(Europe)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Radical right (Europe)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_and_Democracy", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Identity and Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_der_Leyen_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Von der Leyen Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elections_to_the_European_Parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Elections to the European Parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centrism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Centrism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_for_Germany", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alternative for Germany"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Think_tank", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Think tank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_Le_Pen", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marine Le Pen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left-wing_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Left-wing politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centre-right_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Centre-right politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brussels", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brussels"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brussels"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Belgium"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Schuman", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Robert Schuman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brothers_of_Italy", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brothers of Italy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_F._Kennedy", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Robert F.

We could have positions in the committees or a president or vice-president in the European Parliament,\" Garraud told Reuters, anticipating new influence as the chamber considers issues crucial to the far-right.\n\n\"What I am sure of is that we will have a majority in a certain number of votes,\" Garraud said, adding this could allow the blocs of far-right parties to water down green policies or restrictions of free trade. \"And above all, less immigration,\" he said, highlighting a crucial issue for the radical right. Polls forecast the two radical right groups Identity and Democracy (ID) and the European Conservatives and Reformists (ECR) will add 30-50 seats, to rise to 22-25% from 18% now.\n\nSupport is not limited to a traditional base of disgruntled older men. A recent German poll showed 22% of under-30s would vote for the country's far-right AfD. RN's president is 28-year-old Jordan Bardella, a telegenic poster on TikTok, the short video platform little used by the mainstream. Many of the parties are heavy users of social media, which mainstream groups warn will bombard EU voters with lies.\n\nIn the French port of Dunkirk, long a leftwing bastion, some parents worry about what messages young people are exposed to.\n\nJean-Francois Engrand, 53, said his two step-children were tempted to vote RN by messages about foreigners getting money for nothing. \"It's scary. They're being bombarded. They don't check the information they get on their phones,\" he said.\n\nHARD RIGHT SHUT-OUT\n\nCorina Stratulat, associate director of think tank the European Policy Centre, said radical, populist parties were filling a growing gap between the mainstream and distrustful voters in an \"age of perma-crisis\" from pandemic to war in Ukraine and energy price spikes.\n\nEfforts to fill the gap have backfired. French President Emmanuel Macron's party is polling at about 16%, half that of RN. Critics say his highlighting of immigration and crime has helped the right and driven away left-leaning voters.\n\nGreen policies, heralded in 2019 after school climate strikes, have also become a right-wing target.\n\n\"People are aware the green deal can bite and that the next five years will be crucial for its implementation,\" said Armida van Rij, senior research fellow at Chatham House.\n\nThe centre-right European People's Party (EPP), the Social Democrats and the centrist liberals have so far shut out the hard right, dividing up top EU jobs and forging policy consensus. They are expected to have a majority, albeit reduced, after the 2024 vote.\n\nGarraud says a shut-out will not be possible this time, while Nicola Procaccini, co-chair of the ECR group, sees Italy's government of his and Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni's Brothers of Italy, the further right Lega and centre-right Forza Italia as a model.\n\n\"I think this is the way to go,\" he said, pointing to a situation in which the hard right would have far greater say on policy and who staffs the European Commission.\n\nCHINA, RUSSIA LINKS?\n\nThe EPP, likely to remain the biggest group in parliament, has ruled out working with the AfD. Its parliamentary chief Manfred Weber said he would tell voters of its true nature as \"ambassadors of Putin and of Xi\".\n\nGarraud said allegations that his party and ID allies such as the AfD were pro-Russian or accepted money were merely efforts by rivals to demonise the right.

French President Emmanuel Macron's party is polling at about 16%, half that of RN. Critics say his highlighting of immigration and crime has helped the right and driven away left-leaning voters.\n\nGreen policies, heralded in 2019 after school climate strikes, have also become a right-wing target.\n\n\"People are aware the green deal can bite and that the next five years will be crucial for its implementation,\" said Armida van Rij, senior research fellow at Chatham House.\n\nThe centre-right European People's Party (EPP), the Social Democrats and the centrist liberals have so far shut out the hard right, dividing up top EU jobs and forging policy consensus. They are expected to have a majority, albeit reduced, after the 2024 vote.\n\nGarraud says a shut-out will not be possible this time, while Nicola Procaccini, co-chair of the ECR group, sees Italy's government of his and Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni's Brothers of Italy, the further right Lega and centre-right Forza Italia as a model.\n\n\"I think this is the way to go,\" he said, pointing to a situation in which the hard right would have far greater say on policy and who staffs the European Commission.\n\nChina, Russia links?\n\nThe EPP, likely to remain the biggest group in parliament, has ruled out working with the AfD. Its parliamentary chief Manfred Weber said he would tell voters of its true nature as \"ambassadors of Putin and of Xi\".\n\nGarraud said allegations that his party and ID allies such as the AfD were pro-Russian or accepted money were merely efforts by rivals to demonise the right.\n\nIn April, an aide of the AfD's lead candidate was arrested on suspicion of spying for China and a report that its number two received money from a website with links to the Kremlin, an allegation he denies.\n\nThe message about foreign interference is starting to resonate, with a German poll showing 75% of respondents see it as a danger.

They don't check the information they get on their phones,\" he said.\n\nHARD RIGHT SHUT-OUT\n\nCorina Stratulat, associate director of think tank the European Policy Centre, said radical, populist parties were filling a growing gap between the mainstream and distrustful voters in an \"age of perma-crisis\" from pandemic to war in Ukraine and energy price spikes.\n\nEfforts to fill the gap have backfired. French President Emmanuel Macron's party is polling at about 16%, half that of RN. Critics say his highlighting of immigration and crime has helped the right and driven away left-leaning voters.\n\nGreen policies, heralded in 2019 after school climate strikes, have also become a right-wing target.\n\n\"People are aware the green deal can bite and that the next five years will be crucial for its implementation,\" said Armida van Rij, senior research fellow at Chatham House.\n\nThe centre-right European People's Party (EPP), the Social Democrats and the centrist liberals have so far shut out the hard right, dividing up top EU jobs and forging policy consensus. They are expected to have a majority, albeit reduced, after the 2024 vote.\n\nGarraud says a shut-out will not be possible this time, while Nicola Procaccini, co-chair of the ECR group, sees Italy's government of his and Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni's Brothers of Italy, the further right Lega and centre-right Forza Italia as a model.\n\n\"I think this is the way to go,\" he said, pointing to a situation in which the hard right would have far greater say on policy and who staffs the European Commission.\n\nCHINA, RUSSIA LINKS?\n\nThe EPP, likely to remain the biggest group in parliament, has ruled out working with the AfD. Its parliamentary chief Manfred Weber said he would tell voters of its true nature as \"ambassadors of Putin and of Xi\".\n\nGarraud said allegations that his party and ID allies such as the AfD were pro-Russian or accepted money were merely efforts by rivals to demonise the right. Last month saw the arrest of an aide of the AfD's lead candidate on suspicion of spying for China and a report that its number two received money from a website with links to the Kremlin, an allegation he denies.\n\nThe message about foreign interference is starting to resonate, with a German poll showing 75% of respondents seeing it as a danger. AfD support has since slightly dipped. At the AfD's EU election campaign launch in Donaueschingen, several of the 500-odd attendees were certain the arrest was timed to hurt the party's chances. In the wealthy corner of southwest Germany, many supporters railed against an out-of-touch mainstream that had backed COVID-19 lockdowns and mask mandates.\n\n\"It was the coronavirus pandemic that radicalised me,\" said Justus, a besuited production engineer in his early 20s with a neatly trimmed beard, who arrived with equally dapper friends in a BMW convertible.\n\nVan Rij said it was important to distinguish between the AfD along with its disparate ID allies like RN and the broadly less radical ECR, likely to be steered by Italy's Meloni, whose support European Commission President Ursula von Leyen might need to secure a second term.\n\n\"The ECR could have a bigger impact,\" she said.\n\nStratulat said the EPP would play a central role. It might team up with the hard right on a few issues, such as migration, or simply shift rightwards itself, such as over green measures.\n\nThe Greens say the future of green policies and European security will be vital election issues.\n\n\"Do you want Russian and Chinese influence and weakening Europe?... For them a strong Europe is the biggest danger. So they want to weaken Europe. And let's be honest, the far right will weaken Europe,\" Greens co-leader Bas Eickhout said.\n\n(Reporting by Philip Blenkinsop; additional reporting by Michel Rose in Dunkirk, Thomas Escritt in Donaueschingen; Editing by Alexandra Hudson)", "source": {"uri": "finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

We could have positions in the committees or a president or vice-president in the European Parliament,\" Garraud told Reuters, anticipating new influence as the chamber considers issues crucial to the far-right.\n\n\"What I am sure of is that we will have a majority in a certain number of votes,\" Garraud said, adding this could allow the blocs of far-right parties to water down green policies or restrictions of free trade. \"And above all, less immigration,\" he said, highlighting a crucial issue for the radical right.\n\nPolls forecast the two radical right groups Identity and Democracy (ID) and the European Conservatives and Reformists (ECR) will add 30-50 seats, to rise to 22-25% from 18% now.\n\nSupport is not limited to a traditional base of disgruntled older men. A recent German poll showed 22% of under-30s would vote for the country's far-right AfD. RN's president is 28-year-old Jordan Bardella, a telegenic poster on TikTok, the short video platform little used by the mainstream.\n\nMany of the parties are heavy users of social media, which mainstream groups warn will bombard EU voters with lies.\n\nIn the French port of Dunkirk, long a leftwing bastion, some parents worry about what messages young people are exposed to.\n\nJean-Francois Engrand, 53, said his two step-children were tempted to vote RN by messages about foreigners getting money for nothing. \"It's scary.

REUTERS\n\nSurveys predict Europe's far right will surge in EU elections next month, giving it more influence in Brussels politics even if mainstream players will still have greater weight.\n\nSome 370 million voters are being called to cast ballots in the European Union's 27 countries on June 6-9 to select the 720 lawmakers who will sit in the next European Parliament.\n\nWhile voter-intention polls point to inroads by radical-right parties, the mainstream in the parliament, made up of three groups: the centre-right EPP, the left-leaning Socialists and Democrats, and the centrist Renew Europe, are still expected to end up ahead.\n\nThose three groups are used to compromising among each other to get the majority needed for laws to pass.\n\nThe question, though, is how far the EPP, the European People's Party of current European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen, will open its door to the extreme right.\n\nPascale Joannin, head of the Robert Schuman Foundation, a think tank, said populist radical right parties \"will gain ground, but it won't be a landslide\".\n\nMeloni is symbolically running as the lead candidate for the European Parliament for her post-fascist Brothers of Italy party. She will not however take up a seat, as the legislature bars MEPs from also holding public office in a national government.\n\nShe has said she wants \"a majority uniting the forces on the right, to send the left into opposition\".\n\nFrom his office in a distant annexe, French right-wing lawmaker Jean-Paul Garraud has his sights set on a spot much closer to the decision-making heart of the European Parliament.\n\nThe chairman of France's Rassemblement National (RN) lawmakers expects nationalist and Eurosceptic parties to surge in the June 6-9 EU assembly election, giving them a first taste of influence in Brussels and Strasbourg, if other right and centre-right parties work with them.\n\nPolls predict radical right parties will gain across the EU, including France, Germany and Italy where many seats are at stake, as voters frustrated by a cost of living and energy crisis, illegal migration, and rattled by a changing geo-political landscape seek alternatives beyond mainstream parties.\n\n\"We will be in a different position and will not be blocked .... We could have positions in the committees or a president or vice-president in the European Parliament,\" Garraud told Reuters, anticipating new influence as the chamber considers issues crucial to the far-right.\n\n\"What I am sure of is that we will have a majority in a certain number of votes,\" Garraud said, adding this could allow the blocs of far-right parties to water down green policies or restrictions of free trade. \"And above all, less immigration,\" he said, highlighting a crucial issue for the radical right.\n\nPolls forecast the two radical right groups Identity and Democracy (ID) and the European Conservatives and Reformists (ECR) will add 30-50 seats, to rise to 22-25 percent from 18 percent now.\n\nSupport is not limited to a traditional base of disgruntled older men. A recent German poll showed 22 percent of under-30s would vote for the country's far-right AfD. RN's president is 28-year-old Jordan Bardella, a telegenic poster on TikTok, the short video platform little used by the mainstream. Many of the parties are heavy users of social media, which mainstream groups warn will bombard EU voters with lies.\n\nIn the French port of Dunkirk, long a left wing bastion, some parents worry about what messages young people are exposed to.\n\nJean-Francois Engrand, 53, said his two step-children were tempted to vote RN by messages about foreigners getting money for nothing. \"It's scary. They're being bombarded. They don't check the information they get on their phones,\" he said.\n\nCorina Stratulat, associate director of think tank the European Policy Centre, said radical, populist parties were filling a growing gap between the mainstream and distrustful voters in an \"age of perma-crisis\" from pandemic to war in Ukraine and energy price spikes.\n\nEfforts to fill the gap have backfired. French President Emmanuel Macron's party is polling at about 16 percent, half that of RN. Critics say his highlighting of immigration and crime has helped the right and driven away left-leaning voters.\n\nGreen policies, heralded in 2019 after school climate strikes, have also become a right-wing target.\n\n\"People are aware the green deal can bite and that the next five years will be crucial for its implementation,\" said Armida van Rij, senior research fellow at Chatham House.",

They are represented in the parliament's Identity and Democracy group that includes the National Rally of France's Marine Le Pen and Germany's AfD.\n\nBut von der Leyen has hinted that she might be open to working with the anti-Putin far-right bloc, the European Conservatives and Reformists group led by Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni.\n\n- 'Won't be a landslide' -\n\nPascale Joannin, head of the Robert Schuman Foundation, a think tank, said populist radical right parties \"will gain ground, but it won't be a landslide\".\n\nMeloni is symbolically running as the lead candidate for the European Parliament for her post-fascist Brothers of Italy party.

Renew Europe -- which includes the Renaissance party of French President Emmanuel Macron -- could lose that spot to an extreme-right grouping.\n\nBut, even if that were to occur, the alignment between the EPP, Socialists and Democrats, and Renew Europe would still ensure a majority, Joannin said.\n\nMeloni, however, would \"want to get some (EU) posts, influence policies she holds dear, such as migration, and to sway debates\" by using her group's number of seats to make demands in return for support, the analyst said.\n\nTwo other experts from the Institut Jacques Delors think tank, Nathalie Brack and Awenig Marie, said in a briefing note that they believed the current three-way coalition in the parliament will dominate after the elections.\n\nBut, they said, there could be ad hoc alliances between the EPP and the ECR.\n\nGetting a majority, though, would still need support from either the Renew Europe or the Identity and Democracy (ID) groups, which is not certain, they said.\n\nAnother expert, Daniela Schwarzer, said during a debate hosted by the European Policy Centre think thank that far-right MEPs would arrive \"with an agenda that questions part of the achievement of the EU, but also would make it far more difficult to take certain decisions\".\n\n- Far-right merger unlikely -\n\nAs for a possible merger of the two extreme-right groups in the parliament, analysts believe that unlikely, given fundamental divisions.\n\nThe ECR includes parties that have been, or currently are, in government, Joannin noted.\n\n\"They are people compatible with the EU project, they aren't as anti-EU as the ID,\" she added.\n\n\"They support Ukraine -- the opposite of the ID group, which is more pro-Putin.\"\n\nOne unknown is whether the ECR might welcome the populist Fidesz party of Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, who is the EU leader closest to Putin.\n\nImmigration, a topic the far right has tapped into, is not a lead issue in the overall European electorate. It ranks number seven in a list of concerns, behind fighting poverty, unemployment, health, and defence and EU security, according to the latest polling by the EU's Eurobarometer unit.\n\nThe political balance resulting from the EU elections will help determine who gets the bloc's top jobs, heading the European Commission, the European Council and the European

They are represented in the parliament's Identity and Democracy group that includes the National Rally of France's Marine Le Pen and Germany's AfD.\n\nBut von der Leyen has hinted that she might be open to working with the anti-Putin far-right bloc, the European Conservatives and Reformists group led by Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni.\n\n- 'Won't be a landslide' -\n\nPascale Joannin, head of the Robert Schuman Foundation, a think tank, said populist radical right parties \"will gain ground, but it won't be a landslide\".\n\nMeloni is symbolically running as the lead candidate for the European Parliament for her post-fascist Brothers of Italy party. She will not take up a seat, though, as the legislature bars MEPs from also holding public office in a national government.\n\nShe has said she wants \"a majority uniting the forces on the right, to send the left into opposition\".\n\nIf the EPP did ally with the ECR, that would upset its arrangement with the Socialists and Democrats and Renew Europe.\n\n\"Looking at the polls today, there's no other stable coalition that could be entertained\" than the existing three-way mainstream formation, said Joannin.\n\nThird place is an open bet. Renew Europe -- which includes the Renaissance party of French President Emmanuel Macron -- could lose that spot to an extreme-right grouping.\n\nBut, even if that were to occur, the alignment between the EPP, Socialists and Democrats, and Renew Europe would still ensure a majority, Joannin said.\n\nMeloni, however, would \"want to get some (EU) posts, influence policies she holds dear, such as migration, and to sway debates\" by using her group's number of seats to make demands in return for support, the analyst said.\n\nTwo other experts from the Institut Jacques Delors think tank, Nathalie Brack and Awenig Marie, said in a briefing note that they believed the current three-way coalition in the parliament will dominate after the elections.\n\nBut, they said, there could be ad hoc alliances between the EPP and the ECR.\n\nGetting a majority, though, would still need support from either the Renew Europe or the Identity and Democracy (ID) groups, which is not certain, they said.\n\nAnother expert, Daniela Schwarzer, said during a debate hosted by the European Policy Centre think thank that far-right MEPs would arrive \"with an agenda that questions part of the achievement of the EU, but also would make it far more difficult to take certain decisions\".\n\n- Far-right merger unlikely -\n\nAs for a possible merger of the two extreme-right groups in the parliament, analysts believe that unlikely, given fundamental divisions.\n\nThe ECR includes parties that have been, or currently are, in government, Joannin noted.\n\n\"They are people compatible with the EU project, they aren't as anti-EU as the ID,\" she added.\n\n\"They support Ukraine -- the opposite of the ID group, which is more pro-Putin.\"\n\nOne unknown is whether the ECR might welcome the populist Fidesz party of Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, who is the EU leader closest to Putin.\n\nImmigration, a topic the far right has tapped into, is not a lead issue in the overall European electorate. It ranks number seven in a list of concerns, behind fighting poverty, unemployment, health, and defence and EU security, according to the latest polling by the EU's Eurobarometer unit.", "source":

As ECR Co-Chairman Nicola Procaccini told Euronews, \"Meloni refers to a spectrum of positions which sees both the ECR and the EPP as the two main axes when she talks about the creation of a majority that brings together centre-right forces.\"\n\n\"Then, some delegations from ID in the right-wing camp,\" adds Procaccini, \"along with others from Renew Europe ... will make up the total number that is needed to reach the majority to vote in favour of some measures.\"\n\nAccording to Procaccini, it is crucial to understand that the idea of \"majority\" within the new 720 seats-strong European Parliament is not fixed and that finding common ground with other political forces remains a possibility.\n\n\"Majorities or minorities form themselves based on the single vote. I do believe that the balance within the next European Parliament will shift to the right,\" Procaccini said, adding that the EPP and a large part of Renew Europe are already voting alongside ECR, PiS or Viktor Orban's Fidesz.\n\n\"It's already happening today,\" Procaccini continued, \"not because there's a deal in place, but based on the issues we are voting on.\"\n\nAnd as for sending the left into opposition, \"it's about giving the EPP the possibility to break the bond it has built with the socialists and the greens,\" Brothers of Italy MP Sara Kelany told Euronews.", "source": {"uri": "euronews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Euronews English"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elections_to_the_European_Parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Elections to the European Parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pescara", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pescara"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pescara"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Conservatives_and_Reformists", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "European Conservatives and Reformists"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brothers_of_Italy", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brothers of Italy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euronews", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Euronews"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Italy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of Italy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicola_Procaccini", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nicola Procaccini"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working_class", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Working class"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centre-right_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Centre-right politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renew_Europe", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Renew Europe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Green politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fidesz", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fidesz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_People's_Party", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "European People's Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viktor_Orb\u00e1n", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Viktor Orb\u00e1n"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_and_Justice", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Law and Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right-wing_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Right-wing politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Socialism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Parliament", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "European Parliament"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 78}], "image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/08/41/36/58/1200x675_cmsv2_4dd3a270-9a8f-51fd-b232-5b8caad6e6ec-8413658.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541668", "eventUri": "eng-9541668", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 181, "relevance": 1}

We could have positions in the committees or a president or vice-president in the European Parliament,\" Garraud told Reuters, anticipating new influence as the chamber considers issues crucial to the far-right.\n\n\"What I am sure of is that we will have a majority in a certain number of votes,\" Garraud said, adding this could allow the blocs of far-right parties to water down green policies or restrictions of free trade. \"And above all, less immigration,\" he said, highlighting a crucial issue for the radical right.\n\nPolls forecast the two radical right groups Identity and Democracy (ID) and the European Conservatives and Reformists (ECR) will add 30-50 seats, to rise to 22-25% from 18% now.\n\nSupport is not limited to a traditional base of disgruntled older men. A recent German poll showed 22% of under-30s would vote for the country's far-right AfD. RN's president is 28-year-old Jordan Bardella, a telegenic poster on TikTok, the short video platform little used by the mainstream.\n\nMany of the parties are heavy users of social media, which mainstream groups warn will bombard EU voters with lies.\n\nIn the French port of Dunkirk, long a leftwing bastion, some parents worry about what messages young people are exposed to.\n\nJean-Francois Engrand, 53, said his two step-children were tempted to vote RN by messages about foreigners getting money for nothing. \"It's scary. They're being bombarded. They don't check the information they get on their phones,\" he said.\n\nHARD RIGHT SHUT-OUT\n\nCorina Stratulat, associate director of think tank the European Policy Centre, said radical, populist parties were filling a growing gap between the mainstream and distrustful voters in an \"age of perma-crisis\" from pandemic to war in Ukraine and energy price spikes.\n\nEfforts to fill the gap have backfired. French President Emmanuel Macron's party is polling at about 16%, half that of RN. Critics say his highlighting of immigration and crime has helped the right and driven away left-leaning voters.\n\nGreen policies, heralded in 2019 after school climate strikes, have also become a right-wing target.\n\n\"People are aware the green deal can bite and that the next five years will be crucial for its implementation,\" said Armida van Rij, senior research fellow at Chatham House.\n\nThe centre-right European People's Party (EPP), the Social Democrats and the centrist liberals have so far shut out the hard right, dividing up top EU jobs and forging policy consensus. They are expected to have a majority, albeit reduced, after the 2024 vote.\n\nGarraud says a shut-out will not be possible this time, while Nicola Procaccini, co-chair of the ECR group, sees Italy's government of his and Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni's Brothers of Italy, the further right Lega and centre-right Forza Italia as a model.\n\n\"I think this is the way to go,\" he said, pointing to a situation in which the hard right would have far greater say on policy and who staffs the European Commission.\n\nCHINA, RUSSIA LINKS?\n\nThe EPP, likely to remain the biggest group in parliament, has ruled out working with the AfD. Its parliamentary chief Manfred Weber said he would tell voters of its true nature as \"ambassadors of Putin and of Xi\".\n\nGarraud said allegations that his party and ID allies such as the AfD were pro-Russian or accepted money were merely efforts by rivals to demonise the right.\n\nLast month saw the arrest of an aide of the AfD's lead candidate on suspicion of spying for China and a report that its number two received money from a website with links to the Kremlin, an allegation he denies.\n\nThe message about foreign interference is starting to resonate, with a German poll showing 75% of respondents seeing it as a danger. AfD support has since slightly dipped.\n\nAt the AfD's EU election campaign launch in Donaueschingen, several of the 500-odd attendees were certain the arrest was timed to hurt the party's chances. In the wealthy corner of southwest Germany, many supporters railed against an out-of-touch mainstream that had backed COVID-19 lockdowns and mask mandates.\n\n\"It was the coronavirus pandemic that radicalised me,\" said Justus, a besuited production engineer in his early 20s with a neatly trimmed beard, who arrived with equally dapper friends in a BMW convertible.\n\nVan Rij said it was important to distinguish between the AfD along with its disparate ID allies like RN and the broadly less radical ECR, likely to be steered by Italy's Meloni, whose support European Commission President Ursula von Leyen might need to secure a second term.\n\n\"The ECR could have a bigger impact,\" she said.\n\nStratulat said the EPP would play a central role. It might team up with the hard right on a few issues, such as migration, or simply shift rightwards itself, such as over green measures.\n\nThe Greens say the future of green policies and European security will be vital election issues.\n\n\"Do you want Russian and Chinese influence and weakening Europe?... For them a strong Europe is the biggest danger. So they want to weaken Europe. And let's be honest, the far right will weaken Europe,\" Greens co-leader Bas Eickhout said.\n\n(Reporting by Philip Blenkinsop; additional reporting by Michel Rose in Dunkirk, Thomas Escritt in

Those three groups are used to compromising among each other to get the majority needed for laws to pass.\n\nThe question, though, is how far the EPP -- the European People's Party of current European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen -- will open its door to the extreme right. Von der Leyen, eyeing a second mandate after the elections, has ruled out deals with far-right parties sympathetic towards Russian President Vladimir Putin. They are represented in the parliament's Identity and Democracy group that includes the National Rally of France's Marine Le Pen and Germany's AfD.\n\nBut von der Leyen has hinted that she might be open to working with the anti-Putin far-right bloc, the European Conservatives and Reformists group led by Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni.\n\nPascale Joannin, head of the Robert Schuman Foundation, a think tank, said populist radical right parties \"will gain ground, but it won't be a landslide\".\n\nMeloni is symbolically running as the lead candidate for the European Parliament for her post-fascist Brothers of Italy Party. She will not take up a seat, though, as the legislature bars MEPs from also holding public office in a national government.\n\nShe has said she wants \"a majority uniting the forces on the right, to send the left into opposition\".\n\nIf the EPP did ally with the ECR, that would upset its arrangement with the Socialists and Democrats and Renew Europe.\n\n\"Looking at the polls today, there's no other stable coalition that could be entertained\" than the existing three-way mainstream formation, said Joannin.\n\nThe surveys suggest the EPP will remain the biggest grouping in the parliament, followed by the Socialists and Democrats, though both will likely lose seats.\n\nThird place is an open bet. Renew Europe -- which includes the Renaissance party of French President Emmanuel Macron -- could lose that spot to an extreme-right grouping.\n\nBut, even if that were to occur, the alignment between the EPP, Socialists and Democrats, and Renew Europe would still ensure a majority, Joannin said.\n\nMeloni, however, would \"want to get some [EU] posts, influence policies she holds dear, such as migration, and to sway debates\" by using her group's number of seats to make demands in return for support, the analyst said. Two other experts from the Institut Jacques Delors think tank, Nathalie Brack and Awenig Marie, said in a briefing note that they believed the current three-way coalition in the parliament will dominate after the elections.\n\nBut, they said, there could be ad hoc alliances between the EPP and the ECR.\n\nGetting a majority, though, would still need support from either the Renew Europe or the Identity and Democracy (ID) groups, which is not certain, they said.\n\nAnother expert, Daniela Schwarzer, said during a debate hosted by the European Policy Centre think thank that far-right MEPs would arrive \"with an agenda that questions part of the achievement of the EU, but also would make it far more difficult to take certain decisions\".\n\nAs for a possible merger of the two extreme-right groups in the parliament, analysts believe that unlikely, given fundamental divisions.\n\nThe ECR includes parties that have been, or currently are, in government, Joannin noted.\n\n\"They are people compatible with the EU project, they aren't as anti-EU as the ID,\" she added.\n\n\"They support Ukraine -- the opposite of the ID group, which is more pro-Putin.\"",

The alignment between the centre and hard right parties on the contentious issue of climate shows that a post-election deal is a real possibility.\n\nDuring the Maastricht debate between the lead candidates of the various European political groups on 29 April, Commission President Ursula von der Leyen refused to rule out the possibility of a post-election coalition with the hard-right European Conservatives and Reformists Party (ECR).\n\nSocialist lead candidate Nicolas Schmit argued forcefully against von der Leyen's European People's Party (EPP) doing a deal with the ECR, who he claimed \"do not respect the fundamental rights our Commission has fought for.\"\n\nVon der Leyen's own centre-right group remains divided on this approach. The group's vice-president Siegfried Mure\u0219an and the German CDU party favour an alliance with the socialists and liberals.\n\nWhile opposition to a post-election deal remains, the latest policy publications from both the centre and hard right groups show significant convergence on the high-profile issue of climate.\n\n'7Ds for Sustainability', a strategy paper released by the EPP's think tank, pushes for a reorientation of the Green Deal towards economic growth. For the Wilfried Martens Centre, the various environmental policies put in place during the mandate risk leading to an \"investment deficit\" in Europe, as well as harming European industries and businesses.\n\n\"Unfortunately, parts of the EU's climate policy equation are broken and lead to undesirable outcomes\" commented Dimitar Lilkov, one of the text's editors, to Euractiv.\n\nFor their part, the ECR claims that the Green Deal has failed to become a growth strategy. The manifesto states that ECR will protect citizens, farmers and businesses from the negative impacts of \"the current over-ideological green climate policy\" and expresses a wish to review \"the more problematic objectives of the Green Deal.\"\n\nFor EPP and ECR, the EU single market is essential to achieve carbon reductions.\n\nThe EPP's strategy paper states that \"the single market is Europe's key asset to drive down costs for the transformation, but it needs to be strengthened to deploy strategic net zero technologies for direct and indirect electrification\".\n\nBoth groups also agree that the next European mandate should stop over-regulation, focus on creating a single market for innovation, and support cleantech SMEs.\n\nECR commits in its manifesto to \"empower small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) by cutting down on unnecessary red tape, calling for a temporary halt on new EU rules for small businesses, instead directing resources towards implementing and enforcing existing legislation.\"\n\nThe EPP's strategy paper points the finger at the EU's continuing dependence on oil and gas imports, which they say leave Europe vulnerable in terms of energy security.\n\nOne of the solutions proposed by the centre-right is to use renewable energy to achieve energy independence. This means \"enhancing the security of critical raw materials in the EU.\"\n\nThe ECR echoes these views and, advocates for strengthening EU autonomy \"by paying particular attention to logistics infrastructures, new technologies, and energy and raw materials supply.\"\n\nVon der Leyen's continued openness to the hard right ECR group reflects their polling strength. The hard right group is forecast to capture 86 seats in the June elections.\n\nECR's expected strong performance is thanks in part to the popularity of Fratelli d'Italia in Italy. The party of Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni is leading with 27% of the popular vote.\n\nWhether von der Leyen could successfully court the ECR without alienating lawmakers from the left remains to be seen. The Socialists & Democrats Group (S&D) is currently on track to secure 140 seats.\n\nWhile von der Leyen may remain open to cooperation with right-wing parties, there are still limits. Far-right group Identity and Democracy (ID) considers that the European emission reduction targets are \"totally unrealistic\" and that \"the mandatory transition to renewable energy sources is unachievable within the given timeframe\".", "source": {"uri": "euractiv.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "EurActiv.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Rather, she wanted to \"ask Italians whether they are happy about the work we are doing in Italy and in Europe,\" she told supporters in the eastern coastal town of Pescara.\n\nBut the fact that she can even stand as a candidate comes \"from a peculiar characteristic of the Italian electoral law, which foresees three different situations: incompatibility, ineligibility to run, and inability to assume office,\" says Alberto Alemanno, a professor of EU Law at the HEC Paris Business School and at the College of Europe in Bruges.\n\n\"In other systems, if you are incompatible, you cannot simply run as an MEP unless you resign from your previous role,\" he told The Parliament.\n\nPutting a household name on the ballot to mobilise voters isn't a new tactic in Italy. The late Silvio Berlusconi, the businessman-turned-politician who dominated Italian politics in the 1990s and 2000s, led his Forza Italia party in two consecutive EU elections, then on both occasions gave up the seat to another candidate on the party list.\n\nOnly one in five Italian voters views this tactic favourably, according to a recent survey by Quorum and YouTrend for the SkyTg24 channel, with three in five taking a negative view. It also sends a negative message to EU partners, \"as we are making the European election even more national that it already is,\" Alemanno says.\n\nBut it's likely to be effective nonetheless, he says, since a party leader's name is much more recognisable than the \"80 if not 90 per cent of [Italian] MEPs who are barely known.\"\n\nPerhaps as a result, several other party leaders have done the same as Meloni. Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani, Meloni's coalition partner and head of Forza Italia, will lead his party in four out of the five constituencies. A former president of the European Parliament, he has shown no interest in returning there. Forza Italia is part of the centre-right European People's Party (EPP) group.\n\nMeloni's other coalition partner, Matteo Salvini, has decided not to run, though this may reflect fear of a poor result: his League party is polling at just 8 per cent, compared to the record 34 per cent it took in the 2019 European Parliament election.\n\nThe thing I am the most proud of today is when people stop me on the street and simply call me Giorgia.\n\nFrom the opposition benches, Elly Schlein will lead the Democratic Party list in two of Italy's constituencies. She is not contesting the other three, possibly so as not to undermine other female candidates on her list: under Italian electoral law, voters in EU elections must vote for candidates of both genders, so if their first pick is a woman, their second preference must be a man.\n\nLike Meloni, Schlein said her candidacy was intended to \"contribute to the collective team effort\" and she doesn't plan to return to the European Parliament, where she served as an MEP from 2014 to 2019. The Democratic Party sits with the Socialists and Democrats (S&D) group.\n\nCarlo Calenda from the Action party and Matteo Renzi from Italia Viva, both of which sit with the centrist Renew Europe group, are also standing as candidates. Of all these party leaders, only Renzi has committed to take up his European Parliament seat if elected. A former prime minister from 2014 to 2016, he currently holds a seat in the Italian Senate, which he would have to give up.\n\nAt her rally in Pescara, Meloni also told her supporters that their votes would reassert the \"strategic and fundamental\" importance of the ECR group, of which she is the president, in European politics.\n\nBolstering the ECR, which sits to the right of the EPP in the European Parliament and currently holds 68 of its 705 seats, would help to \"reproduce at the EU level a governing majority of the centre-right like the one we have in Italy,\" she said.\n\nAt the same time, Meloni leaned into the Italian trend of personalised politics. She invited the crowd to simply write \"my Christian name, Giorgia\" on the ballot papers - reflecting a provision in Italian electoral law for candidates to use aliases alongside their registered names.\n\n\"The thing I am the most proud of today is when people stop me on the street and simply call me Giorgia,\" she said.", "source": {"uri": "theparliamentmagazine.eu", "dataType": "news",

Polls predict radical right parties will gain across the EU, including France, Germany and Italy where many seats are at stake, as voters frustrated by a cost of living and energy crisis, illegal migration, and rattled by a changing geo-political landscape seek alternatives beyond mainstream parties.\n\n\"We will be in a different position and will not be blocked.... We could have positions in the committees or a president or vice-president in the European Parliament,\" Garraud told Reuters, anticipating new influence as the chamber considers issues crucial to the far-right. \"What I am sure of is that we will have a majority in a certain number of votes,\" Garraud said, adding this could allow the blocs of far-right parties to water down green policies or restrictions of free trade. \"And above all, less immigration,\" he said, highlighting a crucial issue for the radical right. Polls forecast the two radical right groups Identity and Democracy (ID) and the European Conservatives and Reformists (ECR) will add 30-50 seats, to rise to 22-25% from 18% now.\n\nSupport is not limited to a traditional base of disgruntled older men. A recent German poll showed 22% of under-30s would vote for the country's far-right AfD. RN's president is 28-year-old Jordan Bardella, a telegenic poster on TikTok, the short video platform little used by the mainstream. Many of the parties are heavy users of social media, which mainstream groups warn will bombard EU voters with lies. In the French port of Dunkirk, long a leftwing bastion, some parents worry about what messages young people are exposed to.\n\nJean-Francois Engrand, 53, said his two step-children were tempted to vote RN by messages about foreigners getting money for nothing. \"It's scary. They're being bombarded. They don't check the information they get on their phones,\" he said. HARD RIGHT SHUT-OUT\n\nCorina Stratulat, associate director of think tank the European Policy Centre, said radical, populist parties were filling a growing gap between the mainstream and distrustful voters in an \"age of perma-crisis\" from pandemic to war in Ukraine and energy price spikes. Efforts to fill the gap have backfired. French President Emmanuel Macron's party is polling at about 16%, half that of RN. Critics say his highlighting of immigration and crime has helped the right and driven away left-leaning voters.\n\nGreen policies, heralded in 2019 after school climate strikes, have also become a right-wing target. \"People are aware the green deal can bite and that the next five years will be crucial for its implementation,\" said Armida van Rij, senior research fellow at Chatham House.\n\nThe centre-right European People's Party (EPP), the Social Democrats and the centrist liberals have so far shut out the hard right, dividing up top EU jobs and forging policy consensus. They are expected to have a majority, albeit reduced, after the 2024 vote. Garraud says a shut-out will not be possible this time, while Nicola Procaccini, co-chair of the ECR group, sees Italy's government of his and Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni's Brothers of Italy, the further right Lega and centre-right Forza Italia as a model.\n\n\"I think this is the way to go,\" he said, pointing to a situation in which the hard right would have far greater say on policy and who staffs the European Commission. CHINA, RUSSIA LINKS?\n\nThe EPP, likely to remain the biggest group in parliament, has ruled out working with the AfD. Its parliamentary chief Manfred Weber said he would tell voters of its true nature as \"ambassadors of Putin and of Xi\". Garraud said allegations that his party and ID allies such as the AfD were pro-Russian or accepted money were merely efforts by rivals to demonise the right. Last month saw the arrest of an aide of the AfD's lead candidate on suspicion of spying for China and a report that its number two received money from a website with links to the Kremlin, an allegation he denies.\n\nThe message about foreign interference is starting to resonate, with a German poll showing 75% of respondents seeing it as a danger. AfD support has since slightly dipped. At the AfD's EU election campaign launch in Donaueschingen, several of the 500-odd attendees were certain the arrest was timed to hurt the party's chances. In the wealthy corner of southwest Germany, many supporters railed against an out-of-touch mainstream that had backed COVID-19 lockdowns and mask mandates. \"It was the coronavirus pandemic that radicalised me,\" said Justus, a besuited production engineer in his early 20s with a neatly trimmed beard, who arrived with equally dapper friends in a BMW convertible.\n\nVan Rij said it was important to distinguish between the AfD along with its disparate ID allies like RN and the broadly less radical ECR, likely to be steered by Italy's Meloni, whose support European Commission President Ursula von Leyen might need to secure a second term. \"The ECR could have a bigger impact,\" she said.\n\nStratulat said the EPP would play a central role. It might team up with the hard right on a few issues, such as migration, or simply shift rightwards itself, such as over green measures. The Greens say the future of green policies and European security will be vital election issues.\n\n\"Do you want Russian and Chinese influence and weakening Europe?... For them a strong Europe is the biggest danger. So they want to weaken Europe. And let's be honest, the far right will weaken Europe,\" Greens co-leader Bas Eickhout said.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)",

seats in new European Parliament", "body": "Several of Sweden's centre and centre-right parties from the pro-EU ruling coalition are on course to lose their seats in the European Parliament ahead of June's European elections, a new poll shows.\n\nAccording to a Verian poll published on Sunday, the European elections are proving more complicated than expected for members of the governing centre-right coalition of Liberals (Renew Europe) and Christian Democrats (EPP), as well as the opposition Centre Party (Renew Europe).\n\nThe Liberals, who present themselves as the most pro-European party, have only 3.7% support in the first voter barometer for the 2024 EU elections - a figure below the 4% threshold to enter the EU parliament, according to the new poll.\n\n\"It will take a good election campaign for the Liberals to get an MEP,\" Per S\u00f6derpalm, opinion manager at Verian, told the Swedish press on Sunday.\n\nThe Liberals currently have only one MEP, Karin Karlsbro, who found herself at the centre of the 2022 turmoil when her party signed a government agreement with the far-right Sweden Democrats (ECR) in the wake of the national elections.\n\nIn protest, a French Renew Europe MEP moved to the left and joined the S&D group.\n\nRenew Europe later voiced its concerns, while the Swedish Liberal Party, a member of the liberal European ALDE party, was suspended from all activities within Renew Europe.\n\nHowever, Liberals are not the only ones in danger of losing their seats in the European Parliament: their coalition allies, the Christian Democrats (EPP) and the opposition Centre Party (Renew Europe) are also in trouble, polling 4.2% and 4.5% respectively - just over half their result in the 2019 EU elections.\n\nAt a time when far-right parties in Europe are gaining more ground in the polls ahead of the European elections, the Sweden Democrats, currently at 17%, is polling lower than at the last national elections in 2022, to the benefit of parties that are either in the minority in parliament or not represented at all.\n\nThese include, for example, the Swedish Green Party and the Left Party, which have strong support with 9.5% and 8.8%, respectively.\n\nSeveral parties with no members in the Swedish parliament are on a roll with 4.2%, including the rising pro-Swexit party of Christian Democrat MEP Sara Skyttedal.", "source": {"uri":

something also desired by outgoing European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.\n\nHowever, before entering the big European game, Meloni needs to overcome two obstacles in her own country.\n\nOne is her rival Matteo Salvini, an influential partner in the European Parliament of Marine Le Pen from France's far right.\n\nThe second problem is the strengthening of the left.\n\nIf the Democratic Party, part of the Socialists and Democrats group, can find common ground with the Five Star Movement, led by former PM Giuseppe Conte, the left and centre-left forces could create a strong structure in Italy's fractious political landscape.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giorgia_Meloni", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Giorgia Meloni"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euronews", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Euronews"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Parliament", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "European Parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brothers_of_Italy", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Brothers of Italy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right-wing_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Right-wing politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Populism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Populism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far-right_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Far-right politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Star_Movement", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Five Star Movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forza_Italia_(2013)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Forza Italia (2013)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centre-left_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Centre-left politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lega_Nord", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lega Nord"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voter_turnout", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Voter turnout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centre-right_coalition_(Italy)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Centre-right coalition (Italy)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giuseppe_Conte", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Giuseppe Conte"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Conservatives_and_Reformists", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "European Conservatives and Reformists"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matteo_Salvini", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Matteo Salvini"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_People's_Party", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "European People's Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ursula_von_der_Leyen", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ursula von der Leyen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_Alliance_of_Socialists_and_Democrats", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_Le_Pen", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marine Le Pen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_European_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "President of the European Commission"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Party_Supplies", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Party Supplies", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Socialism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Socialism", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Parties", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Parties", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Party_Planning", "label": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Party Planning", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Christian_Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Christian Democracy", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/euronews_uk_articles_973/a28e8597214e26f8f41978a6fee916d4", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541668", "eventUri": "eng-9541668", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-08", "dateEnd": "2024-06-09", "textStart": 154, "textEnd": 166}], "sentiment": 0.2784313725490195, "wgt": 141, "relevance": 1}

Terry Reintke, the German MEP who is now the party's lead candidate in the coming elections, was walking around the room without shoes, putting on nail polish. It was \"chill\", Peter-Hansen said.\n\nDown in the polls, the Greens are predicted to lose a significant number of the seats they won at the last European elections. \"I still hope that we can make this election one for nature and the environment,\" Peter-Hansen said. Centre-right and conservative politicians will be looking to roll back recent environmental reforms and legislation in the next parliament. \"I'm afraid that we're going to go backwards,\" she said.\n\nAt a campaign rally in Brussels in recent days, activists, politicians and party staff mingled in a trendy events centre. Speaking to journalists beforehand, Reintke said there was a \"clear danger\" that there could be a push back on climate policy, if there was no \"strong green voice\" in the next parliament.\n\n[ EU enlargement anniversary overshadowed by concerns about Russia ]\n\nThe 36-year-old German, who has been an MEP since 2014, said she had been talking to farmers and \"petting a lot of calves\" on the campaign trail. \"We want farmers to be able to live off what they are producing but at the same time also make it possible for us to meet climate and biodiversity goals,\" she said.\n\n\"I come from a very industrial area in Germany... I don't only want to convince the people who are taking decisions in companies, in terms of like the CEOs, I want to convince the workers. I want the workforce to see Greens as a credible option for them,\" she said.\n\nIf there was not a clear mandate from voters for climate policies, the achievements of the outgoing parliament could be reversed, she said. In the last year, major environmental reforms have come under repeated attack, as the political system tacked to the right. Several elements of European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen's landmark green deal have been shelved or watered down, in the face of opposition from farmers and industry.\n\nThe other half of the Greens' leadership ticket in the election, Bas Eickhout, a Dutch MEP, said the future of the green deal was \"very much at stake\" when people voted in June. Eickhout, who was seen as one of the better performers during the first joint debate of the campaign in Maastricht, said the far right had tried to make climate policies part of a \"culture war\". Europe kicked off the \"race\" to transition towards a green economy, but China and the United States had followed afterwards, he said. Any attempt to hit \"pause\" on green reforms now would not help the EU win that race, he said.\n\n[ UK government's climate action plan is unlawful, high court rules ]\n\nOn the back of a wave of support, the Greens won a record number of seats in 2019, up from about 50 MEPs to north of 70. Some of that number are not standing again, like Belgian MEP Philippe Lamberts, a colourful and well-respected figure in the parliament, who is known to hand out homemade jam to colleagues.\n\nGerman Greens Ska Keller and Reinhard Butikofer, Heidi Hautala from Finland and Danish MEP Margrete Auken are also not running again. Others, it seems, are certain to lose their seats. Current polls in the party's heartland of Germany show it is in fourth place, behind the centre-right Christian Democrats, far-right Alternative for Germany and centre-left Social Democratic Party.\n\nThe expectation heading into the coming elections is gains for the far right will significantly shrink the current governing majority in the European Parliament, made up of the centre-right European People's Party (EPP), centrist Renew and centre-left Socialists and Democrats (S&D).\n\nThe hard-right European Conservatives and Reformists (ECR) and far-right Identity and Democracy (ID) groups look set to return with a bigger share of seats than the Greens. That may mean a much reduced Green group on the left and the ECR on the right could each be vying to be king makers in the next parliament.\n\n[ Mosquito-borne diseases spreading in Europe due to climate change, says expert ]\n\nThe Greens would be willing to support the existing governing parties to keep the ECR \"out of power\" in parliament, Reintke said. \"We already see in the ECR there are a lot of parties that are not only anti-European, but they're also very, very openly anti-green deal, very openly attacking fundamental rights, the rule of law in their respective member states,\" she told The Irish Times. It would be very \"detrimental\" if the ECR were brought into the fold of the governing majority, she said.", "source": {"uri": "irishtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Irish Times"},

They were also the first international elections in history.\n\nThis was done in accordance with the 1957 Treaty of Rome, which established the European Communities and specified that the European Parliament must be elected by universal suffrage using a common voting system.\n\nThe European Parliamentary Assembly first met in 1958 while the European Parliament, under this name, dates back to 1962. Until 1979, member states appointed members to the European Parliament from their national parliaments.\n\nThe 1979 campaigns varied. The former Social Democrat German Chancellor Willy Brandt took an international campaign to France, Italy, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands to boost the Socialist group. And it was the social democrats who won the largest number of MEPs (113, leaving behind the Christian democrats with 107).\n\nThis was the beginning of a centre-left domination that lasted 20 years.\n\nFrance's Simone Veil, a Holocaust survivor and women's rights activist and politician best known for the 1975 law that legalised abortion, was elected as the first president of the elected Parliament and the first female president since it was established in 1952.\n\nThe 1984 European elections were the first to include new member Greece. The vote once again put the social democrats ahead with 130 MEPs, well ahead of the Christian Democrats, who obtained 110.\n\nThe 1989 European elections included new members Spain and Portugal. The social democrats advantage grew further to 180 MEPs compared to the Christian democrats, with 121.\n\nThe five years until the next European election in 1994 saw enormous political upheavals across the continent. These changes included the end of communism in Europe, German reunification, the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the Velvet Divorce in Czechoslovakia, and the breakup of Yugoslavia.\n\n1994 saw another strong showing of the social democrats, who won 198 MEPs, followed by the Christian democrats with 157.\n\nThe 1999 European elections were the first where Austria, Finland, and Sweden voted alongside the older member states, having joined in 1995 and voted separately.\n\nThis election marked an upturn, with the Christian democrats winning over the social democrats by 233 MEPs to 180 and establishing a lasting supremacy that still stands to this day.\n\nThe 2004 European elections were the first after the 'Big Bang' enlargement with Poland, Hungary, Czechia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, and Cyprus.\n\nThe number of MEPs was increased to 732 MEPs from 626 in 1999. The balance of power in the Parliament remained unchanged despite the 10 new member states. The EPP was the largest party with 268 MEPs, followed by the Party of European Socialists with 200 MEPs).\n\nIn 2009, a total of 736 MEPs, including from new members Bulgaria and Romania, were elected to represent some 500 million Europeans, making these the biggest trans-national elections in history.\n\nThe centre-right, now officially known as EPP, obtained 265 MEP seats, while the centre-left, known as S&D, got 184. The far-right ECR group was constituted.\n\nThe 2014 European election was the first in which the European political parties fielded candidates for president of the Commission.\n\nThe candidates, sometimes referred to by the German term Spitzenkandidaten, were Jean-Claude Juncker for the EPP, Martin Schulz for PES, Guy Verhofstadt for the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe Party (ALDE), Ska Keller and Jos\u00e9 Bov\u00e9 jointly for the European Green Party, and Alexis Tsipras for the Party of the European Left.\n\nThe EPP won 221 seats, followed by S&D with 185, and Juncker became Commission president (EU leaders endorsed Juncker by a simple majority, with David Cameron and Viktor Orban voting against him).\n\nThe Spitzenkandidaten system, however, failed to work in 2019, when the EPP, with its lead candidate Manfred Weber, won again with 187 seats against 147 for the S&D.\n\nDespite this, at Emmanuel Macron's behest, EU leaders decided to nominate German defence minister Ursula von der Leyen as the new Commission president. The centre-left and centre-right parties suffered significant losses, while pro-EU centrist, liberal and environmentalist parties and anti-EU right-wing populist parties made substantial gains.\n\nIn February 2018, the European Parliament voted to decrease the number of MEPs from 751 to 705 if the United Kingdom were to withdraw from the EU on 29 March 2019. However, the UK withdrew only on 31 January 2020, and it participated in the European elections.\n\nIt's important to note that the Parliament approved von der Leyen as Commission president with a wafer-thin majority of 383 votes (374 votes needed) on 16 July 2019.\n\nIt was a secret vote, and many commentators believe that she may not have passed without the UK votes.\n\nFor the 2024 European election, political parties nominated their lead candidates: von der Leyen for the EPP, Nicolas Schmit for S&D, Marie-Agnes Stack-Zimmerman and Sandro Gozi for ALDE, Bas Eickhout and Terry Reintke for the European Green party, and Walter Baier for the Party of the European Left.\n\nIt remains to be seen how these candidates will fare in electoral debates and motivate voters. And it will be a daunting task for EU leaders to name a candidate who could garner sufficient support in the European Parliament to become Commission president.\n\nFrom the historical perspective, this election is expected to be the most decisive, given the expected rise of far-right and anti-EU parties.\n\nAgainst the background of two wars raging at the EU's gates, compounded by a hybrid war of disinformation that benefits anti-EU forces, only one thing is certain: Abstaining should not be an option.\n\nThe European Commission announced on Monday its decision to close Article 7 against Poland, arguing commitments from the new Donald Tusk government have now addressed previously identified risks to the country's rule of law.\n\nA group of EU member states, led by Czechia and Denmark, are preparing a letter to the European Commission calling for migrants trying to reach the EU to be transferred to selected third countries before reaching the bloc's shores - a procedure experts say is likely to be difficult to enforce under current EU migration law.\n\nNorth Macedonia appears set to be on a collision course with its EU neighbours Greece and Bulgaria with double-header elections

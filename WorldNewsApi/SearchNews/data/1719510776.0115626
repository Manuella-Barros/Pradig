Zampa was due to play for Rajasthan Royals in IPL 2024, but pulled out of the competition due to fatigue reasons. After last playing international cricket in February, Zampa will be seen in action for Australia in the upcoming men\u2019s T20 World Cup in the West Indies and the USA from June 1. \u201cI\u2019ve really come to love playing for Australia. I always loved it, but playing under Dan Vettori, Andrew McDonald and Pat and Mitch as captains, it is just so enjoyable. I make good money playing for Australia and I would love to prioritise playing for Australia and being with my family.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t get enough out of franchise cricket. It\u2019s great for certain aspects of your life, and it can be really enjoyable, but it\u2019s not like being in the Aussie dressing room, not for me anyway. I don\u2019t get the same buzz out of it,\u201d said Zampa to \u2018The Sydney Morning Herald\u2019. The leg-spinner revealed he had thoughts about being a globe-trotting T20 leagues player, but is now content with not being part of that bandwagon. \u201cThere\u2019s always a lot of chat about \u2018can you play franchise cricket all year round\u2019 and it was something I had thought about \u2013 at what age do I get through to try to then play a bit of franchise cricket.\u201d \u201cBut after 2023 and winning the World Cup and all that, and having a young family now as well, I\u2019ve realised I want to play cricket for as long as I can, and instead of trying to play for nine or 10 months of the year, it\u2019s play for six or seven,\u201d he added. Australia will play its 2024 men\u2019s T20 World Cup games in Trinidad and then Barbados where Zampa will reunite with left-arm spin all-rounder Ashton Agar, who was in the squad during the side\u2019s triumphant campaign in the 2021 edition in the UAE (but played just one game). Agar also missed Australia\u2019s 2023 men\u2019s ODI World Cup title-winning run in India due to a calf injury. \u201cI feel like there\u2019s a little bit of unfinished business. Ash missed out on the last World Cup, he didn\u2019t play during the World Cup we won in Dubai, and I really think this is his World Cup to put his stamp on.\u201d \u201cI think the wickets are going to suit him, and I think he can play a major role. We feed off each other, we make each other train better, we think about the game a lot more when we\u2019re around each other. So it\u2019s great to have him back,\u201d added Zampa. He signed off by saying leg-spinner Tanveer Sangha is a big future prospect for Australia. Sangha was in contention to be a travelling reserve for Australia until he suffered a hip flexor injury during a training camp in Brisbane. \u201cHe\u2019s had a lot of niggles and injuries in the last couple of years that he\u2019s found it hard to get any continuous cricket in, but he\u2019s years ahead of where I was at his age. Even now, I think \u2018I wish I could do that\u2019 and \u2018I wish I had that part of his bowling\u2019. He\u2019s really smart and certainly going to have a long career for Australia.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m pretty glad that I\u2019m 10 years older than him, not five because I feel like there\u2019d be a time where I\u2019d be in the classifieds (looking for a new job). I\u2019m 32 now and the way things are going, hopefully I get a bit more time playing for Australia \u2013 but I won\u2019t be 38 and trying to hold on because I know Tanveer is going to be pretty special,\u201d concluded Zampa. \u2013IANS nr", "summary": "<p>Sydney, May 26 (IANS) Australia\u2019s leg-spinner Adam Zampa said he would like to prioritise playing international cricket as he doesn\u2019t get the same level of buzz when featuring in various&#8230; <a class=\"more-link\" href=\"https://indianews.com.au/dont-get-the-same-buzz-zampa-keen-to-prioritise-internationals-over-t20-leagues/\">Continue reading <span class=\"screen-reader-text\">&#8216;Don&#8217;t get the same buzz&#8217;: Zampa keen to prioritise internationals over T20 leagues</span></a></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://indianews.com.au/dont-get-the-same-buzz-zampa-keen-to-prioritise-internationals-over-t20-leagues/\">\u2018Don\u2019t get the same buzz\u2019: Zampa keen to prioritise internationals over T20 leagues</a> first appeared on <a href=\"https://indianews.com.au\">Australia India News</a>.</p>", "url": "https://indianews.com.au/dont-get-the-same-buzz-zampa-keen-to-prioritise-internationals-over-t20-leagues/", "image": "https://iansportalimages.s3.amazonaws.com/thumbnails/202403213135026.jpeg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-26 12:34:42", "author": "India News Newsdesk", "authors": ["India News Newsdesk"], "language": "en", "source_country": "AU", "sentiment": 0.042}

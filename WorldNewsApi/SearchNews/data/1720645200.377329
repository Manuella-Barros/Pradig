He threatened to field candidates belonging to all castes and religions and vowed to defeat a few candidates who he named. ''Politics is not my way and I am not interested in it. My only demand is to help Maratha community get a quota. Till then, I will continue my fast. The government should immediately implement the law regarding 'sage-soyre' and should distribute caste certificates as per the demand. If our demand is not accepted, we will field candidates belonging to all caste and religions and will name the candidates we intend to defeat,'' Jarange told reporters in Antarwali-Saraati. ''We were beaten during our protest last year and then cases were filed against us,'' he said. Referring to the Fadnavis' statement that the Opposition narrative was doing the rounds in Marathawada during Lok Sabha elections, Jarange-Patil said, \"He should remember that I belong to no party. This is not about Maha Vikas Aghadi or Mahayuti. The MVA has done us no favour.\" Jarange-Patil said when Fadnavis took the lead in giving quota to Marathas, the community supported the BJP. ''BJP won 106 Assembly seats as Marathas supported them due to the promised quota. But now, they have given us 10 per cent quota and we are still facing several hurdles,'' he said. Warning Fadnavis, Jarange-Patil said, \"OBC and Marathas are one. If the government does not ensure quoate for us, then we will ensure the defeat of some of the ruling parties candidates.\" Vijay Tarak, a close associate of Jarange-Patil, said, \"Just two to three people had opposed Jarange-Patil's fast, not the entire village as is being speculated. Today, the activist has begun his fast again.\"", "summary": "", "url": "https://indianexpress.com/article/pune/jarange-begins-fast-on-intimidating-note-will-field-candidates-in-assembly-polls-9380532/", "image": "https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/06/jaranfe.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 17:25:34", "author": null, "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "in", "sentiment": -0.363}

{"id": 231242518, "title": "Eras Tour survival guide: What you need to know if you\u2019re going to see Taylor Swift in Edinburgh", "text": "Taylor Swift\u2019s first night of the Eras Tour in Edinburgh is now over \u2013 and what an experience it was. Having been among the lucky fans able to attend, it was a show unlike any other on many levels from her incredible staging and production, to the sort of environment she fosters with her fans. Swifties are a special bunch, as Taylor herself can attest to when she took out her earpieces to soak in the audience\u2019s reaction to champagne problems. \u201cI love you so much, Edinburgh, thank you.\u201d The Eras Tour deserves every ounce of praise it has gathered in the year since it began touring, but with her first Edinburgh show now over I have all the tips you need for surviving \u2013 and thriving \u2013 during nights two and three. It may seem like common sense, but Swifties take their dedication to Taylor\u2019s Eras and their specific styles very seriously. I spotted many high heels and sandals as well as countless cowboy boots and while I commend those with the strength and courage to wear them, it also concerns me. I wore my well-broken in Dr Martens and my feet were still sore by the end of it from a mix of the queueing, tiptoeing to glimpse the stage and then power walking to the train station after it. Granted, I was standing. But I also saw a lost pair of shoes in the crowd \u2013 don\u2019t let your sore feet spoil the experience. After a slightly difficult period attempting to find where I was supposed to be going, there were queues to reach the queues to get in \u2013 which by the time I made it in were mostly quiet. But on top of that the merchandise stall queue was busy almost the entire time I was there, the toilet queues were so long I resolved not to drink the entire time and the food queues almost had me missing Paramore\u2019s entire set. I went to grab some food at around 5pm and queued up to order. I asked how long the food would take when I finally reached the till and was told around \u201c20 minutes, 30 max\u201d. This didn\u2019t end up being true. I ordered my food before Paramore\u2019s set started and by the time it was actually in my hand, they had finished their last song. So be prepared to queue for everything, and if you\u2019re going to get food make it one of the first things you do. At concerts it\u2019s a fine line between staying hydrated and enjoying yourself. There\u2019s nothing worse than needing the loo when you\u2019re trying to enjoy Taylor Swift belting Shake It Off. But if you need to use the toilet, do your research on the set list and try to be strategic when you go. If you\u2019re really lucky, you might even be able to do what my sister did and chance the merch stand when it\u2019s almost empty. In the standing section I was sheltered from a lot of the colder weather and spent more than half of the concert with my jacket off \u2013 however, it did reach a point where I had to put that on as well as the cardigan I had taken in my smaller-than-a-sheet-of-A4 tote bag. But those up in the stands may not fare so well, and that\u2019s without considering what will happen after you leave the venue. If you can take something to keep you warm I\u2019d advise that you do so \u2013 we all know what the Scottish weather is like. I\u2019ve had plenty of experience getting to and from gigs using public transport, but this was something else altogether. I got on the train at Polmont and had to walk along at least three carriages before I could squeeze myself on. This was around 1pm. It was jam packed with Swifties and while I made a \u201cswift\u201d exit from the platform, I emerged from the station to crowds and carts selling feather boas and cowboy hats. But leaving Murrayfield was something else altogether. The crowds were so densely packed at points that I couldn\u2019t see cones or bollards that were lining the streets and had a couple of near-miss trips. We were heading to Haymarket from the stadium and when we were close enough to the station the roads were split off depending on if you were getting the tram or train. Water was being handed out but by the time we were actually allowed into the station, we were being crammed into barriers and guided around like cattle. The trains were super busy, and from what I\u2019ve heard so were the trams, so if you have a specific service to catch consider leaving just before the show ends. I\u2019ve seen from some people online that leaving before Karma allowed them to get on the tram pretty much immediately. Not to be trite, but if you\u2019re going to see Taylor Swift in Edinburgh enjoy yourself as much as possible. I learned I\u2019d be going pretty much 24 hours before the first show and all the last minute stress was nothing compared to being there. As much as my feet ached, I was indeed among those in the crowd chanting more. Hopefully you all have a wonderful time.", "summary": "<p>After an incredible night seeing Taylor Swift at Murrayfield, here\u2019s what I learned from the experience. </p>", "url": "https://www.scotsman.com/whats-on/eras-tour-edinburgh-taylor-swift-top-tips-4658353", "image": "https://www.scotsman.com/webimg/b25lY21zOjBmMjQ0ZjNkLWNhNjgtNDhiMi1hNmQ5LTZkYTQ1NDI1NjE3OTo5NmQ3ZTE0Mi1hYzkzLTRjYzMtOTM2NS1jMTBkYmU4MTRmMDE=.jpg?width=1200&enable=upscale", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 13:01:22", "author": "Lauren Jack", "authors": ["Lauren Jack"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": 0.029}

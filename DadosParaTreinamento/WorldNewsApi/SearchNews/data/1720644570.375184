Chris Clarkson, who was the MP for Heywood and Middleton, will be standing in the Conservative-held constituency of Stratford-on-Avon. At the last general election in 2019, Mr Clarkson was one of five Tories to gain a seat from Labour in Greater Manchester. Two of them have now joined Labour and only one is seeking re-election in the same seat as a Conservative candidate - James Daly in Bury North. Mr Clarkson announced last year that he would be standing down due to constituency boundary changes dividing the seat into two. Previously, Heywood and Middleton had always been represented by Labour in Parliament since the constituency was created in 1983.

Don't, Says Geoff Keighley", "body": "Summer Game Fest is around the corner, but don't expect a showcase full of world premiere announcements and major reveals. Host Geoff Keighley has come out to do some \"expectation setting\" for the annual game showcase, and it looks like this June, viewers should strap in for announcements mostly about games we already know about.\n\nAfter decades of E3, and now Summer Game Fest, viewers are pretty accustomed to those major, \"one more thing!\" style announcements and massive reveals, but Keighley is keen to make sure fans don't go in to this year's gamer Christmas expecting the same. During a Q&A on the official Game Awards Twitch channel, the host spoke about what the showcase will include, as well as what it won't.\n\n\"There will be, definitely, new announcements,\" Keighley said of Summer Game Fest, \"but the show is largely focused on, I think, existing games that have new updates for fans.\" What this means practically is that we're likely to see new content for games that have already been released, as well as trailers and updates for already-announced titles that haven't launched just yet. \"This is not a show that has a lot of like, 'coming in 2026' or '2027' or teasers for games that are years and years out,\" Keighley said.\n\nDespite this, Summer Game Fest will \"definitely\" include some new announcements - although fans shouldn't expect anything blockbuster-level big to drop. Keighley also confirmed that we won't be seeing anything on Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater, Kingdom Hearts 4, The Wolf Among Us 2, or Ken Levine's Judas. However, we will get a look at Monster Hunter Wilds, as well as Atlus' Metaphor: ReFantazio.\n\nThe Summer Game Fest official Steam page provides some additional clues about games we'll be seeing during the kick-off to June's showcase-packed weekend, and while it's not clear whether all of the titles featured will get a major look-in or just a brief spotlight, we can expect to see more from Palworld, Mecha Break, The Finals, and Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2, among others.\n\nIf you're more in the market for those major, groundbreaking surprise reveals that have coloured previous Summer Game Fest and E3 presentations though, they're not entirely a thing of the past - Keighley says The Game Awards in December is the place to go for these. The reason for this seems to be due to every developer and their dog trying to get in their own showcase during June to reveal their projects direct to fans, whereas The Game Awards is pretty standalone in the gaming event calendar. As a result of this, Keighley says The Game Awards \"has a lot of usually big surprises,\" as opposed to Summer Game Fest, which is \"largely focused on announced stuff.\"\n\nWhile we're not getting any major global premieres from the sounds of it, there's still plenty to be announced over Summer Game Fest (and both the associated and unassociated showcases taking place the same weekend) and we're likely to see some pretty cool new stuff, even if it isn't mega blockbuster announcements. If you're keen to check out everything going on this weekend and when you can watch live in Australia (if you too are committed to ruining your sleep cycle even more), you can check out the Summer Game Fest schedule and Australian watch times here.\n\nWhat are you hoping to see announced this weekend?

I'm not just sharing my opinion -- though it's also that -- this is coming straight from host Geoff Keighley himself. Ahead of this week's games showcase, Keighley hosted a live Q&A session on Twitch to answer questions about the show and tried to set audience expectations a little lower in the process.\n\nIn the hour-long Twitch stream, the former journalist turned event host took questions from fans about Summer Game Fest, covering everything from the show's history to the minute details of this year's presentation. Before diving into questions from chat, Keighley laid out a more general overview of the show, noting that it isn't going to be a year full of groundbreaking reveals. Keighley noted that it will be a \"lighter\" year for announcements. When asked how high he'd rate his excitement for the event on a scale from one to ten, measuring gamer-friendly hype, he said an eight out of ten. It's a far cry from most similar showcases, which try their best to build up anticipation beforehand, rather than deflating it.\n\nSummer Game Fest and The Game Awards have been widely criticized (including by Inverse) for failing to substantively address the crisis of layoffs and studio closures gutting the games industry in the past few years. And while he didn't spend more than a few seconds on the subject he did acknowledge that the precarious position of the industry is at least partially to blame for a paucity of releases this year.\n\n\"It's been a challenging year for the industry with everything going on, the layoffs, and studio closures,\" Keighley said. \"So far this year, it's been a little bit quieter for big game releases.\"\n\nWhile the state of the industry is obviously devastating for many developers, Keighley did find a silver lining in that a lack of blockbuster releases could make some room for indie games.\n\n\"We really tried to program some unexpected things from smaller teams into the show alongside big blockbuster games and franchises,\" he said. \"It's a great time where small games can really get significant success.\"\n\n\"It's really important for us to have independent games be a part of this show,\" Keighley added later, noting that several games set to be presented at Summer Game Fest will be made by solo developers.\n\nDigging into questions from Twitch chat, Keighley pointed to some specific games that viewers will see at the show -- and some they definitely won't. Along with many, many questions just asking how many games would be presented (which Keighley understandably didn't have an exact number for), he confirmed that the recently announced Batman: Arkham Shadow VR game will be shown, but shot down hopes of seeing Grand Theft Auto 6 or Judas. And undoubtedly, the most disappointing reveal was that there will categorically be no Muppets at Summer Game Fest -- though they may still remain for The Game Awards later this year.\n\nKeighley also confirmed that players will be able to get their hands on some of what's shown at Summer Game Fest shortly after the showcase. While he hesitated to say that any games would be released as they were revealed, he did say that within a few weeks, some announced games or updates will be available to play.\n\nMore concrete confirmation of what to expect from Summer Game Fest came from a teaser trailer Keighley played at the beginning of the stream. It showed the likes of Monster Hunter Wilds, Dragon's Dogma 2, Astro Bot, and Elden Ring. A Steam page for Summer Game Fest features more games that will evidently make an appearance, including Mecha Break and Palworld.\n\nWhile Keighley says \"it's really important for us to have independent games be a part of this show,\" most of what's already been confirmed falls squarely in blockbuster category, aside from a few games like Neva (from Gris developer Nomada Studio), which will show off gameplay during the event. If you're looking for upcoming indie games, you'd be better off paying attention to Day of the Devs, which airs directly after Summer Game Fest. Games confirmed by Steam for that showcase include While Waiting, a game primarily about standing in lines, Zoochosis, a horror game set in a zoo full of evil animals, and other equally inscrutable indies.\n\nIt's easy to be cynical about Summer Game Fest as a shallow marketing showcase for AAA publishers. I do it all the time, in fact! But I'd frankly rather have expectations set a bit lower than have Keighley try to convince us that this year's crop of trailers is going to change gaming forever -- not that that's going to stop some viewers from convincing themselves that's the case anyway. And if you're really looking for an exciting group of games you've probably never heard of that offer something genuinely new, tune in to Day of the Devs after the main show. That's where the real action is.", "source": {"uri": "inverse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Inverse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_Game_Fest", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Summer Game Fest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitch_(service)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Twitch (service)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keighley", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Keighley"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Keighley"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Game_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Game Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoff_Keighley", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Geoff Keighley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indie_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indie game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse_(website)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inverse (website)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockbuster_(entertainment)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Blockbuster (entertainment)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batman_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Batman (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_reality", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Virtual reality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gris", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horror_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Horror game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elden_Ring", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Elden Ring"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steam_(service)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Steam (service)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_Fine", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Double Fine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AAA_(video_game_industry)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "AAA (video game industry)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Theft_Auto", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Grand Theft Auto"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monster_Hunter", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Monster Hunter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon's_Dogma", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dragon's Dogma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Muppets", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Muppets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mecha", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mecha"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Independent film"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 45}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads", "wgt": 43}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Computer_Platforms", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Computer Platforms", "wgt": 43}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 45}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Resources", "label": "dmoz/Games/Resources", "wgt": 41}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/image/2024/6/4/2d48470b/keighley.jpg?w=1200&h=630&fit=crop&crop=faces&fm=jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9621781", "eventUri": "eng-9621781", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.08235294117647063, "wgt": 208, "relevance": 1}

It's been more than six months since the first GTA VI trailer was released in December 2023, so some people believed it might be time for the next trailer or any other information. Apparently that's not going to happen, though, and GTA fans will have to wait a while longer.\n\nKeighley also said there won't be Kingdom Hearts 4 news or any reveals for Ken Levine's new game, Judas. Beyond Good & Evil 2 also won't show up, nor will there be a big \"one more thing\" announcement to cap off the event.\n\nIn terms of what will be on display during Summer Game Fest, Keighley said there will be announcements regarding updates to existing games, including Palworld and Kingdom Come: Deliverance II. New trailers for Monster Hunter Wilds and Batman: Arkham VR will be on display as well. As for brand-new announcements, Keighley said Blumhouse Games will have something to reveal, while the showcase will debut the first footage of the Among Us animated series.\n\nSummer Game Fest 2024 takes place place on Friday, June 7 at 2 PM PT / 5 PM ET. The show will now take the spot formerly held by E3, the long-running video game trade show once seen as the premier event in gaming, which was permanently canceled last year.\n\nFollowing Summer Game Fest will be the Xbox Games Showcase event on June 9, with a Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 reveal event to follow immediately after.

One minute later, the owner of that voice stepped onstage in an absinthe-green suit with wide peak lapels: Nicolas Cage.\n\n\"I'm so happy to be invited to your very, very cool club,\" Cage said to a roar of laughter and applause. He wasn't talking to members in Soho House West Hollywood's screening room, but to a raucous crowd of video game professionals at the fourth-annual Summer Game Fest in the YouTube Theater.\n\n\"When I make movies, one of my favorite genres is horror,\" Cage continued. He was on stage to promote his cameo in a survival horror game called Dead by Daylight that had already sold more than twice as many copies as the megahit Elden Ring. \"I play this heightened, exaggerated version of a film actor named Nic Cage,\" he said, before coughing and apologizing for his seasonal allergies. More than 27 million people watched this moment via Summer Game Fest's online stream -- at least two million more viewers than ESPN drew during the College Football Playoff National Championship between Michigan and Washington seven months later.\n\nFor the video game industry, Summer Game Fest has quickly become a combination of San Diego Comic-Con and the (now defunct) Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3): the single most important place for gamers to watch new trailers, and for studios to show off their wares. With $180 billion in video game revenue last year according to Newzoo -- more than the global box office and music sales combined -- Summer Game Fest is arguably one of the two most important pop culture events of the year now, alongside its sister event in December, The Game Awards, which has started drawing more viewers than the Academy Awards.\n\nBut unlike Comic-Con or E3, Summer Game Fest and The Game Awards are owned, operated, and hosted by one person: Geoff Keighley, a 45-year-old Canadian journalist and Muppet enthusiast with a penchant for tailored dinner jackets.\n\nKeighley began his career blogging about video games before covering them as a freelance reporter for Kotaku, GameSpot, and other trade publications. But much like Paul Rudd, Keighley doesn't seem to be aging, and has maintained the same youthful voice, presentation style, and haircut since hosting his first video game show on Spike TV two decades ago. Beyond that, we don't know much about him or his company. \"Geoff's a black hole of information,\" one industry insider told me. I emailed Summer Game Fest to ask Keighley questions for this story, but didn't receive a response.\n\nToday, while most people in the industry believe Keighley's twin events are a force for good, others have raised concerns about Summer Game Fest and The Game Awards' high entry fees, opaqueness, celebritization, and Keighley's silence on issues that have impacted game workers, like the mass layoffs that have decimated studios in 2023 and 2024.\n\nWith this year's Summer Game Fest right around the corner on Friday, June 7 at 5 p.m. ET, I asked more than a dozen video game professionals for their unfiltered opinions on Summer Game Fest, including what they'd like to see changed.\n\nDating back to the mid-'90s, E3 had been America's unrivaled mega-conference for video gamers and professionals. But in 2020, when the pandemic forced E3 to shut down along with nearly every other in-person event on earth, Keighley streamed the first iteration of Summer Game Fest from a spare bedroom in his Pacific Palisades home. \"Someone needed to step up,\" says Greg Miller, a former IGN editor turned CEO of Kinda Funny, a pop culture video and podcast network. \"That first year of Summer Game Fest brought in a whole bunch of eyeballs and exposed people to games they might not otherwise have given the time of day.\"\n\nOver the last four years, especially in the wake of E3's permadeath in 2023, Summer Game Fest's influence has grown exponentially -- even though Geoff Keighley remains the only name listed (as Chief Executive Officer, Secretary, Chief Financial Officer, and sole Director) on his company's most recent LLC filings with the California Secretary of State. I also emailed Summer Game Fest to ask how many people work there in addition to Keighley, but didn't receive a response in time for publication.\n\n\"E3 was usually dominated by Nintendo, PlayStation, and Microsoft, but Summer Game Fest and [its in-person media event] Play Days have opened the floor for so many more creatives and developers to participate,\" says Jasmine James, a senior PR account manager at \u00dcberStrategist, which represents studios as large as Bungie (Destiny 2) and as small as Serious Bros. (Imagine Earth). Participating studios in this year's Summer Game Fest include heavyweights like Bandai Namco (Elden Ring), Epic Games (Fortnite), Sega, and Ubisoft, who are willing to pay a premium for the gaming equivalent of a Super Bowl commercial.\n\n\"These shows are really ****ing expensive,\" one insider says, referring to both Summer Game Fest and The Game Awards. According to pricing details shared with me by multiple marketing professionals who requested anonymity, running a trailer during Summer Game Fest's main show this year cost $250,000 for 1 minute, $350,000 for 1.5 minutes, $450,000 for 2 minutes, and $550,000 for 2.5 minutes. They also say last year's edition of The Game Awards featured the same pricing tiers.\n\nIf you add up all of the 1-to-2.5-minute trailers aired during last year's Summer Game Fest, those price levels could translate into a $9.65 million haul for the main show alone. Of course, last year's prices may have been different, and I don't know how to account for shorter, 30-second trailers, nor the longer segments where Keighley invites a developer onstage.\n\nFor many smaller and independent studios, these sums are astronomical -- sometimes far more than their entire marketing budget for an individual game. \"The current pricing tiers make Summer Game Fest an unattainable goal for most indie developers and publishers,\" a PR professional who represents indie games told me. But several marketing and PR folks at larger studios say these trailer premieres are worth the spend. \"As far as general brand awareness, the impact is pretty huge,\" one of them says. \"The caveat here is that it depends on the placement and trailer length. Longer slots perform better and seem to drive more coverage, whereas short trailers don't capture quite the same attention.\"\n\nAnother marketing professional I spoke with pointed to the fact that this year, Summer Game Fest is also selling tickets for fans to attend the main showcase in the YouTube Theater, saying, \"That's another stream of revenue for Geoff, so... could he then lower the cost of entry for smaller clients to be featured in the main show?\" Earlier this week, first-party tickets were still available for $41 at Ticketmaster. But even if Summer Game Fest sold out the theater's entire 6,000-seat capacity at that price, it would only net around $246,000 -- less than it makes from a single 1-minute trailer -- and the true number will likely be far lower thanks to seats reserved for invitees.\n\nHowever, Summer Game Fest is more than just Geoff Keighley's livestream. \"I appreciate Summer Game Fest a lot more outside of the main presentation,\" says Ash Parrish, a video game reporter at The Verge who attended the Play Days media event in 2022 and is heading back to Summer Game Fest this year. \"The most memorable games I've played -- the kinds of games that remind me why I love my job -- are the ones that don't often get the huge spotlight of the big stage and are part of the smaller presentations like Day of the Devs,\" she says, referring to Summer Game Fest's indie-only aftershow.\n\nSpeaking of Play Days, it's a three-day, \"invite-only media and influencer event\" where studios can purchase a \"full hands-on pod\" for $150,000 or a \"meeting cabana\" for $50,000 this year. \"I fell in love with games I would have never considered, like A Little to the Left, Time Flies, Escape Academy, and Schism, just by walking around [and] getting hands-on with demos and talking to the developers,\" Parrish says.\n\nAttending this in-person event is free for invited members of the media, but some of them wish Summer Game Fest was a little more transparent with access. \"A lot of upcoming journalists and creators ask me how they can get invited,\" says Danny Pe\u00f1a, founder and cohost of the Gamertag Radio podcast who's attended Summer Game Fest in the past. \"When I first started out, I went straight to the official E3 website and applied for a media badge, but I've never seen anything like that for Summer Game Fest,\" he says.\n\nMost of the insiders I spoke with also wish Summer Game Fest's main show would devote more time to indie games, especially when it comes to the longer segments where Keighley interviews developers. \"I'd like to see more of a level playing field so that more indies and even mid-sized developers get a chance to go onstage,\" one of them says. Of all the games featured during Keighley's main show in 2023, 46 percent could reasonably be classified as indies -- roughly the same percentage as 2022, but way up from 2021, when only a handful of indies were present.\n\n\"I think Geoff does a good job shining a light on indies,\" says Miller. \"Could he do more? Of course he could, but at what point does the vision for the show become mine instead of his?\" Miller has co-hosted the eighth-annual D.I.C.E. Awards this year, which are presented by the Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences every February. Alongside Keighley's The Game Awards, D.I.C.E. is a contender to be \"the Academy Awards for video games,\" but it's much less commercial than Keighley's event.\n\nCase in point: In February, Miller made headlines for directly confronting Embracer Group executives with a joke during the D.I.C.E. Awards after they laid off more than 1,400 game workers last year. Miller and co-host Stella Chung also addressed the industry's layoffs in their opening monologue, asking executives to \"do better caring for our workers.\"\n\nOn the other side of the spectrum, Keighley's silence on this issue during The Game Awards two months earlier drew a lot of criticism, including a sharply worded editorial from Parrish headlined \"Geoff Keighley let video game developers down.\" Some of the people I spoke with wondered if Keighley will address the layoffs at Summer Game Fest this year, especially since studio downsizing has only gotten worse in 2024.\n\n\"With great power comes great responsibility,\" a game worker told me. \"Whether [Keighley] wanted it or not, he's now the de facto voice of gaming, and he's benefitting from it financially. I respect that he's under a lot of pressure, and that no matter what he does or says, half of Twitter will be yelling at him. But I think he could do a lot more to be a force for good in the industry.\"\n\nAnother professional in the gaming industry says, \"Geoff doesn't necessarily have to voice his own opinion. He doesn't have to endorse any particular views [on serious issues], but he could let more developers go up on stage and raise the issues that matter to them.\"\n\nIn a very recent example of a wasted opportunity to do just that, dozens of members in Keighley's Future Class program signed an open letter asking Keighley \"for a statement to be read out in our name during The Game Awards Ceremony\" last December -- a statement that called for a long-term ceasefire in Gaza alongside support for Palestinian human rights. But according to reporting by WIRED's Megan Farokhmanesh, no one at The Game Awards even responded to the Future Class members who sent the letter -- despite the fact that Future Class participants were selected by Keighley's event organizers as individuals \"whose voices elevate, diversify, and further our artform.\"\n\nMiller isn't sure how a discussion of the gaming industry's issues, much less international humanitarian ones, could fit into a Geoff Keighley production. \"I wouldn't be caught dead up there not doing that, but my brand for 17 years has been saying what I feel, and sometimes being wrong, sometimes being right.\" But Miller also says Keighley takes feedback seriously, and is constantly seeking input from peers and fans. \"I've never met a guy who is more in the comments than Geoff. He reads everything. When I make an offhand comment on one of my shows about [his events], he'll remember it and ask me questions about it later. He's trying to make the best show that serves as many people as possible.\"\n\nThe video game industry has reached a historically dramatic crossroads in 2024, as ballooning sales, bloated executive compensation, and pop culture crossovers like HBO's The Last of Us and Amazon Prime Video's Fallout coincide with mass layoffs, low pay, and poor workplace conditions for game workers -- many of whom are forming unions for the first time.\n\nGiven that context, will Geoff Keighley give a nod to the thousands of workers who've lost their jobs this year at Summer Game Fest 2024? Will we see more indie games featured than ever before? Will he give developers the time and space to speak about the challenges facing the industry, or the world at large, if and when they wish to do so?\n\nIf Miller is right, all we know for sure is that Keighley will read the comments after the credits roll -- and that there's a nonzero chance Nicolas Cage will show up again with postnasal drip.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news",

But in 2020, when the pandemic forced E3 to shut down along with nearly every other in-person event on earth, Keighley streamed the first iteration of Summer Game Fest from a spare bedroom in his Pacific Palisades home. \"Someone needed to step up,\" says Greg Miller, a former IGN editor turned CEO of Kinda Funny, a pop culture video and podcast network. \"That first year of Summer Game Fest brought in a whole bunch of eyeballs and exposed people to games they might not otherwise have given the time of day.\"\n\nOver the last four years, especially in the wake of E3's permadeath in 2023, Summer Game Fest's influence has grown exponentially -- even though Geoff Keighley remains the only name listed (as Chief Executive Officer, Secretary, Chief Financial Officer, and sole Director) on his company's most recent LLC filings with the California Secretary of State. I also emailed Summer Game Fest to ask how many people work there in addition to Keighley, but didn't receive a response in time for publication.\n\n\"E3 was usually dominated by Nintendo, PlayStation, and Microsoft, but Summer Game Fest and [its in-person media event] Play Days have opened the floor for so many more creatives and developers to participate,\" says Jasmine James, a senior PR account manager at \u00dcberStrategist, which represents studios as large as Bungie (Destiny 2) and as small as Serious Bros. (Imagine Earth). Participating studios in this year's Summer Game Fest include heavyweights like Bandai Namco (Elden Ring), Epic Games (Fortnite), Sega, and Ubisoft, who are willing to pay a premium for the gaming equivalent of a Super Bowl commercial.\n\n\"These shows are really ****ing expensive,\" one insider says, referring to both Summer Game Fest and The Game Awards. According to pricing details shared with me by multiple marketing professionals who requested anonymity, running a trailer during Summer Game Fest's main show this year cost $250,000 for 1 minute, $350,000 for 1.5 minutes, $450,000 for 2 minutes, and $550,000 for 2.5 minutes. They also say last year's edition of The Game Awards featured the same pricing tiers.\n\nIf you add up all of the 1-to-2.5-minute trailers aired during last year's Summer Game Fest, those price levels could translate into a $9.65 million haul for the main show alone. Of course, last year's prices may have been different, and I don't know how to account for shorter, 30-second trailers, nor the longer segments where Keighley invites a developer onstage.\n\nFor many smaller and independent studios, these sums are astronomical -- sometimes far more than their entire marketing budget for an individual game. \"The current pricing tiers make Summer Game Fest an unattainable goal for most indie developers and publishers,\" a PR professional who represents indie games told me. But several marketing and PR folks at larger studios say these trailer premieres are worth the spend. \"As far as general brand awareness, the impact is pretty huge,\" one of them says. \"The caveat here is that it depends on the placement and trailer length. Longer slots perform better and seem to drive more coverage, whereas short trailers don't capture quite the same attention.\"\n\nAnother marketing professional I spoke with pointed to the fact that this year, Summer Game Fest is also selling tickets for fans to attend the main showcase in the YouTube Theater, saying, \"That's another stream of revenue for Geoff, so... could he then lower the cost of entry for smaller clients to be featured in the main show?\" Earlier this week, first-party tickets were still available for $41 at Ticketmaster. But even if Summer Game Fest sold out the theater's entire 6,000-seat capacity at that price, it would only net around $246,000 -- less than it makes from a single 1-minute trailer -- and the true number will likely be far lower thanks to seats reserved for invitees.\n\nHowever, Summer Game Fest is more than just Geoff Keighley's livestream. \"I appreciate Summer Game Fest a lot more outside of the main presentation,\" says Ash Parrish, a video game reporter at The Verge who attended the Play Days media event in 2022 and is heading back to Summer Game Fest this year. \"The most memorable games I've played -- the kinds of games that remind me why I love my job -- are the ones that don't often get the huge spotlight of the big stage and are part of the smaller presentations like Day of the Devs,\" she says, referring to Summer Game Fest's indie-only aftershow.\n\nSpeaking of Play Days, it's a three-day, \"invite-only media and influencer event\" where studios can purchase a \"full hands-on pod\" for $150,000 or a \"meeting cabana\" for $50,000 this year. \"I fell in love with games I would have never considered, like A Little to the Left, Time Flies, Escape Academy, and Schism, just by walking around [and] getting hands-on with demos and talking to the developers,\" Parrish says.\n\nAttending this in-person event is free for invited members of the media, but some of them wish Summer Game Fest was a little more transparent with access. \"A lot of upcoming journalists and creators ask me how they can get invited,\" says Danny Pe\u00f1a, founder and cohost of the Gamertag Radio podcast who's attended Summer Game Fest in the past. \"When I first started out, I went straight to the official E3 website and applied for a media badge, but I've never seen anything like that for Summer Game Fest,\" he says.\n\nMost of the insiders I spoke with also wish Summer Game Fest's main show would devote more time to indie games, especially when it comes to the longer segments where Keighley interviews developers. \"I'd like to see more of a level playing field so that more indies and even mid-sized developers get a chance to go onstage,\" one of them says. Of all the games featured during Keighley's main show in 2023, 46 percent could reasonably be classified as indies -- roughly the same percentage as 2022, but way up from 2021, when only a handful of indies were present.\n\n\"I think Geoff does a good job shining a light on indies,\" says Miller. \"Could he do more? Of course he could, but at what point does the vision for the show become mine instead of his?\" Miller has co-hosted the eighth-annual D.I.C.E. Awards this year, which are presented by the Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences every February. Alongside Keighley's The Game Awards, D.I.C.E. is a contender to be \"the Academy Awards for video games,\" but it's much less commercial than Keighley's event.\n\nCase in point: In February, Miller made headlines for directly confronting Embracer Group executives with a joke during the D.I.C.E. Awards after they laid off more than 1,400 game workers last year. Miller and co-host Stella Chung also addressed the industry's layoffs in their opening monologue, asking executives to \"do better caring for our workers.\"\n\nOn the other side of the spectrum, Keighley's silence on this issue during The Game Awards two months earlier drew a lot of criticism, including a sharply worded editorial from Parrish headlined \"Geoff Keighley let video game developers down.\" Some of the people I spoke with wondered if Keighley will address the layoffs at Summer Game Fest this year, especially since studio downsizing has only gotten worse in 2024.\n\n\"With great power comes great responsibility,\" a game worker told me. \"Whether [Keighley] wanted it or not, he's now the de facto voice of gaming, and he's benefitting from it financially. I respect that he's under a lot of pressure, and that no matter what he does or says, half of Twitter will be yelling at him. But I think he could do a lot more to be a force for good in the industry.\"\n\nAnother professional in the gaming industry says, \"Geoff doesn't necessarily have to voice his own opinion. He doesn't have to endorse any particular views [on serious issues], but he could let more developers go up on stage and raise the issues that matter to them.\"\n\nIn a very recent example of a wasted opportunity to do just that, dozens of members in Keighley's Future Class program signed an open letter asking Keighley \"for a statement to be read out in our name during The Game Awards Ceremony\" last December -- a statement that called for a long-term ceasefire in Gaza alongside support for Palestinian human rights. But according to reporting by WIRED's Megan Farokhmanesh, no one at The Game Awards even responded to the Future Class members who sent the letter -- despite the fact that Future Class participants were selected by Keighley's event organizers as individuals \"whose voices elevate, diversify, and further our artform.\"\n\nMiller isn't sure how a discussion of the gaming industry's issues, much less international humanitarian ones, could fit into a Geoff Keighley production. \"I wouldn't be caught dead up there not doing that, but my brand for 17 years has been saying what I feel, and sometimes being wrong, sometimes being right.\" But Miller also says Keighley takes feedback seriously, and is constantly seeking input from peers and fans. \"I've never met a guy who is more in the comments than Geoff. He reads everything. When I make an offhand comment on one of my shows about [his events], he'll remember it and ask me questions about it later. He's trying to make the best show that serves as many people as possible.\"\n\nThe video game industry has reached a historically dramatic crossroads in 2024, as ballooning sales, bloated executive compensation, and pop culture crossovers like HBO's The Last of Us and Amazon Prime Video's Fallout coincide with mass layoffs, low pay, and poor workplace conditions for game workers -- many of whom are forming unions for the first time.\n\nGiven that context, will Geoff Keighley give a nod to the thousands of workers who've lost their jobs this year at Summer Game Fest 2024? Will we see more indie games featured than ever before? Will he give developers the time and space to speak about the challenges facing the industry, or the world at large, if and when they wish to do so?\n\nIf Miller is right, all we know for sure is that Keighley will read the comments after the credits roll -- and that there's a nonzero chance Nicolas Cage will show up again with postnasal drip.", "source": {"uri": "esquire.com", "dataType": "news",

One of the major lynchpins holding it all together is Summer Game Fest, a showcase put together by Geoff Keighley with the aim of uniting the game industry around a summertime shebang of video game news. But as he does every year before this and other hosted events like Gamescom Opening Night Live and The Game Awards, Keighley is trying to temper wild fan expectations by clarifying some of the things we absolutely will not see at Summer Game Fest on Friday.\n\nIn a live question and answer session hosted on Twitch over the weekend, Keighley answered some burning questions from fans about the upcoming showcase, including a long list not just of what we should expect to see on Friday, but also what we shouldn't.\n\nAs far as what will be there, Keighley confirmed we'll see plenty of updates to existing games, such as Palworld and Kingdom Come 2: Deliverance. We'll also see trailers for already-announced games, including Supermarket Simulator, Monster Hunter Wilds, Metaphor: Refantazio, Batman: Arkham VR, and Dragon Ball Sparking! ZERO. He also confirmed we'll be getting something from Blumhouse Games, and a new trailer for the Among Us animated series.\n\nBut in an interest of keeping surprises to himself, it's no surprise that the list of what won't be there is a bit longer:\n\nSorry, but anyone who was expecting another GTA trailer so soon after the last one needs to bring the expectations waaaaay down.\n\nKeighley said that a lot of people have been asking him about this for some reason, but that those expecting such a thing are \"setting themselves up for failure.\"\n\nNo new news on this, but Keighley says it won't be at SGF. Last we heard, it was delayed, and a collaboration with Deck Nine to work on a pre-production script for the game was cancelled. The game is still in production at Telltale, as of earlier this year.\n\nThis question came out of nowhere, but no, Keighley won't be showing one.\n\nUnlikely from the jump given Keighley's criticisms of Konami.\n\nWe saw Ken Levine's next game revealed at The Game Awards in 2022, but Keighley doesn't have an update at this year's show. If you're hungry to see more of Judas, though, we did run an extensive gameplay overview on IGN this past March.\n\nKeighley claims he doesn't know any more than we do about where this game, announced way way way back in 2017, went. Even if it were going to be announced during this time, Ubisoft has their own show they're almost certainly want it in.\n\nHelp Wanted 2 came out last year, and non-VR ports are still planned for later in June, so that's probably the main attraction in that universe for now.\n\nKeighley actually didn't directly say this, but when it came up on stream, he chuckled and said, \"I think it's gonna be a while.\" So that doesn't sound exactly promising. Don't get your hopes up.\n\nKeighley didn't specifically say Nintendo wouldn't have anything in this showcase, but he did chat briefly about Nintendo's ongoing absence from Summer Game Fest despite historically being interested in The Game Awards, and his tone definitely points to another Nintendo no-show. Nintendo usually has some sort of digital showcase of its own in June, so while we shouldn't expect anything at SGF, there's probably plenty to come later this month. And SGF will almost certainly have third-party games that will be available on the Switch...or whatever its successor ends up being.\n\nThough not explicitly games, Keighley confirmed a few other elements SGF would not be using. There won't be any musical acts (save that for The Game Awards), and the notorious Josef Fares won't be showing up to make any spicy, clippable remarks. We also won't get a \"one more thing,\" an industry tradition of sorts where showcases conclude with a \"and now, we have one more thing to show\" remark from a host followed by a massive, exciting announcement to wrap things up. Keighley doesn't care for this trend.\n\nSo that's what we know, leaving four days left to wildly speculate about what we don't know.

As such, he warned those watching not to expect a \"one more thing\" reveal - typically a mic-drop trailer left for the end of the Summer Game Fest showcase to end the event with a bang.\n\nThe Summer Game Fest live show is set to take place later this week on June 7. Starting at 2PM ET / 5PM PT from the YouTube live theatre, Keighley stated it would run for around two hours in total, and would still be packed full of trailers and other surprises. If you're a fan of keeping up with the latest in the video game industry, it's still worth a watch even if bombshell reveals aren't to be expected.\n\nSo let's dig into this a bit. Why is it a quieter year for games when it comes to the Summer Game Fest? There are several potential factors. The first is that many of the big publishers have dedicated livestreams where the companies can showcase their upcoming games without the aid of third party events. For example, the PlayStation State of Play that took place only a few days ago, or the Nintendo Directs. It's worth noting that this is one of the reasons E3 started to lack import in its later years.\n\nAnother factor can be linked to that quieter year that Keighley referenced. Quieter is one word for it, but it's worth noting that the games industry has been laden with layoffs, cancellations, acquisitions and general chaos over the past year or so. This will have surely affected release schedules for smaller studios as well as big blockbuster releases, and leading to a relatively drier Summer Game Fest this year as a result.\n\nOr another factor could just be timing! Some years are quiet, and we've had so many fantastic video games releases over the past few months. It is entirely possible that a factor for this quiet year is simply that we're in a bit of a gully - the quiet period in between two riveting seasons for video game releases - and Keighley's Summer Game Fest is unfortunately caught in the middle. However you can't really put too much weight on this without acknoledging the waves of layoffs and cancellations. They're linked! Less people in the games industry making AAA games means... less AAA games.\n\nAs a final note, you can never entirely disregard the fake-out factor. Meaning that, Keighley obviously knows that his statement that there's no surprise final announcement will pick up traction in articles like this one. Knowing this he could have an ace up his sleeve. It's not a very likely possibility, his Q&A seemed very earnest from what I could see, but it's certainly possible. Something for the dreamers out there to cling on to, if nothing else.\n\nWhether one or a combination of all of these are to blame is up to your own interpretation, but nonetheless you should expect a feast of new trailers and reveals coming in the next few days.

The show's host, Geoff Keighley, is getting out ahead of this year's iteration of the annual June showcase to set expectations for fans about what exactly will be at the show. As the widely accepted replacement for the now-dead E3 (R.I.P.), fans expect big announcements during SGF. And while there will be lots of announcements about games, the games in question will predominantly be updates on titles we already know about -- not new announcements.\n\nTalking during a Q&A on the official Game Awards Twitch channel (he organizes and hosts the end-of-year celebration in addition to SGF), Keighley gave a sneak peek at what the summer showcase will entail and, perhaps more interesting, what it won't. \"There will be, definitely, new announcements,\" Keighley assured, \"but the show is largely focused on, I think, existing games that have new updates for fans.\" Existing games can mean titles that are already out but are releasing new updates or expansions, as well as games that have been announced but aren't out yet. So that means we could get anything from a last look at Elden Ring's Shadow of the Erdtree DLC to an update on Atlus' Metaphor: ReFantazio (if I get what I want).\n\nKeighley took managing expectations one step further, revealing specific games that will definitely not be at SGF. That list includes Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater (the remake of MGS 3), Kingdom Hearts 4, The Wolf Among Us 2, and Ken Levine's Judas. \"There definitely are things that are being announced,\" Keighley assures fans, \"but this is not a show that has a lot of like 'coming in 2026' or '2027', or teasers for games that are years and years out.\" In some ways this is refreshing, as it means the titles we do see during SGF will be things that will likely be in our hands in the next two years or so. The list of games Keighley confirmed we will see included Monster Hunter Wilds and Metaphor: ReFantazio (I will get what I want!)\n\nDuring the Q&A, Keighley compared SGF to The Game Awards to give viewers an idea of how the two shows play off each other: The Game Awards are usually full of big surprises and reveals, while Summer Game Fest leans towards updates. That cycle of reveal and update helps make both shows relevant. It's a nice balance and makes sense considering every company under the sun is trying to hold their own showcase in the summer so they can reveal projects on their own, but when it comes to the end of the year Keighley, is the man to go to with announcements.\n\nThis year's Summer Game Fest will kick off with a showcase on Friday, June 7 at 5 p.m. ET. It will be live-streamed on YouTube and Twitch other platforms.", "source": {"uri": "kotaku.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Kotaku"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keighley", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Keighley"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Keighley"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_Game_Fest", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Summer Game Fest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E3", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "E3"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoff_Keighley", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Geoff Keighley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wolf_Among_Us_2", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Wolf Among Us 2"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitch_(service)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Twitch (service)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal_Gear_Solid_3:_Snake_Eater", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_Hearts", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kingdom Hearts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlus", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Atlus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_remake", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Video game remake"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downloadable_content", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Downloadable content"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Livestreaming", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Livestreaming"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Game_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Game Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monster_Hunter", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Monster Hunter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entertainment_Tonight", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Entertainment Tonight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Computer_Platforms", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Computer Platforms", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 59}], "image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fill,h_675,pg_1,q_80,w_1200/445938526dbc47a4bc629e6266d823be.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9621781", "eventUri": "eng-9621781", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-07", "textStart": 2684, "textEnd": 2690}], "sentiment": 0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 180, "relevance": 1}

Alan Wake 2 developer Remedy Entertainment will also be present, likely with something new for its Alan Wake sequel. Viewers can also expect upcoming games Slitterhead, Dune: Awakening, Dragon Ball: Sparking!

announcements this year, and the majority of games have been revealed previously.\n\nThe games featured will also be released over the next few years and will not be future releases for 2026/2027.\n\nKeighley also revealed that much-anticipated releases such as Kingdom Hearts 4, The Wolf Among Us 2, GTA 6, and Judas will not be featured in Summer Game Fest 2024.\n\nSome upcoming games were confirmed for the showcase such as Batman: Arkham Shadow VR, Monster Hunter Wilds, Astro Bot, and Delta Force: Hawk Ops, but the majority of games to be featured are ones that have already been released.\n\nDragon's Dogma 2, Elden Ring, and Palworld will also be featured, but these are likely DLC announcements as the games have already been released.\n\nKeighley claims that the reason why the showcase will be much smaller is because of the huge number of layoffs over the past few years.\n\nThe biggest of these recent layoffs occurred when Xbox shut down four studios including Arkane Austin, developer of Redfall and Tango Gameworks, the studio behind the critically acclaimed Hi-Fi Rush.\n\nSummer Game Fest will instead focus on smaller games by independent studios, as these big studios suffer layoffs.\n\nDay of the Devs has been covering independent games for a number of years, and will hold its showcase directly after Summer Game Fest.\n\nIf you want to watch showcases

However, he did say that the organizers put \"a lot of thought\" into the order of the reveals and trailers, from the first game to the last game.\n\nHe then cited a humorous example, saying that those who expect Gabe Newell to walk out at the end and announce Half-Life 3 will be disappointed. \"It'd be cool, but it's not happening on this show,\" he said.\n\nSummer Game Fest 2024 will take place on Friday, June 7 at 2 PM PT / 5 PM ET. The show will now take the spot formerly held by E3, the long-running video game trade show once seen as the premier event in gaming, which was permanently canceled last year.

It was one of the hallmarks of the gaming industry for decades, and it featured the \"Big 3\" of gaming, often doing showcases and presentations within a singular setting to help set the tone for the video game year to come. Sadly, that's gone now, and in its place is Summer Game Fest, hosted by Geoff Keighley. This year's event will start on June 7th, and many are curious about what will be shown this time around.\n\nTo that end, Geoff Keighley did an interview about the show and made some interesting comments that Insider Stealth picked up. For example, he noted that there wouldn't be a \"one more thing\" game to help end stuff. As Stealth noted in a later tweet, Keighley said that this was a \"quieter year for big game releases.\" He further stated that he expects a few game surprises, but most of the stuff they'll show is for games that have already been announced. Then, there's the Nintendo factor.\n\nBoth last year and this year, Nintendo hasn't been a part of the Summer Game Fest, and Geoff Keighley hopes that changes. Not so curiously, Nintendo rarely does anything for The Game Awards that Keighley also hosts, outside of sending representatives that will accept the awards for the games they make, that is.\n\nThe easiest reason why The Big N doesn't do shows like these is that they have their own shows that they know people are eagerly awaiting news on. In fact, we KNOW that there's going to be a Nintendo Direct this month, as that came from President Shuntaro Furukawa himself. We're just waiting on a confirmed date and time for the show.\n\nKeighley also lamented that it's hard to \"plan around\" all the other shows and presentations that tend to happen over the summer months, thus making it difficult to get all the big game announcements to make the show worthy of people's time. On that note, Keighly said that the show was likely to be about two hours, which is half the time of The Game Awards. We should be grateful for that, for the record.\n\nWe'll have to wait and see how well the Summer Game Fest does and how it holds up in the years to come, but it seems that Geoff has his work cut out for him.", "source": {"uri": "gameranx.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Gameranx"}, "authors": [{"uri": "todd_black@gameranx.com", "name": "Todd Black", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E3", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "E3"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoff_Keighley", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Geoff Keighley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Nintendo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_Game_Fest", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Summer Game Fest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stealth_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stealth game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Video game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keighley", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Keighley"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Keighley"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Game_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Game Awards"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 34}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads", "wgt": 33}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Computer_Platforms", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Computer Platforms", "wgt": 33}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 34}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Resources", "label": "dmoz/Games/Resources", "wgt": 33}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 58}], "image": "https://gameranx.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Summer-Game-Fest-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9621781", "eventUri": "eng-9621781", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-07", "textStart": 524, "textEnd": 532}], "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 171, "relevance": 1}

This show is very much, it's largely focused on announced stuff. There are absolutely new game announcements throughout the show, but just to level set, it's not all brand new stuff. It tends to be things that are coming out later this year.\n\n\"And there are things that we'll announce that will come out later this year that haven't been announced yet, but this is not a show that has a lot of like, you know, coming in 2026 or 2027, or teasers for games that are years and years out.

We are here to dream, imagine what we may be playing in the future, and let's be honest, to be sold a strong dose of smoke. It's part of the game and we accept it. That's why it's also the most anticipated event, the most bombastic of all. Geoff Keighley's Summer Game Fest. Although this year, it seems, it might not be all that it usually is.\n\nLike every year, Keighley has made rounds to answer players' questions before the event. This year, though, he's dampening people's excitement, because something he wanted to emphasize is that we should moderate our expectations about what we'll see this year. Something which, coming from someone who likes to sell everything he does like it's a revolution, is a bit concerning.\n\nTo begin, he has confirmed several things that we should not expect to see. There will be no new trailer for Grand Theft Auto 6, and nothing about Kindgom Hearts 4, The Wolf Among Us 2, or Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater. This does not mean that they can't appear at some other time, in another conference, but they won't appear at the Summer Game Fest. On the other hand, he has confirmed several things we will see. Palworld will be there talking about its upcoming major update, Atlus will take the stage to talk about Metaphor: ReFantazio, and Capcom will reveal more of Monster Hunter Wilds.\n\nRegarding what we should expect, he's made clear that the show of big announcements is the Game Awards, and we shouldn't expect big announcements here. Games will be announced, but they'll mostly be games that'll be released before the end of the year. Wanting to focus on game announcements that will come out this year or next, we shouldn't expect big news about what might appear in 2026 or 2027.\n\nThis does not mean, of course, that there won't be any announcements of this kind. Or that they won't happen in any of the numerous presentations that will take place in the coming days. That is why, even though Keighley has tried to check expectations, there is life beyond the Summer Game Fest. So even if he doesn't bring us that hype we've come to crave, surely someone else will know how to do it.", "source": {"uri": "en.softonic.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Softonic"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_Game_Fest", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Summer Game Fest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E3", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "E3"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoff_Keighley", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Geoff Keighley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Theft_Auto", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Grand Theft Auto"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal_Gear_Solid_3:_Snake_Eater", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wolf_Among_Us", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Wolf Among Us"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keighley", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Keighley"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Keighley"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlus", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Atlus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monster_Hunter", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Monster Hunter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capcom", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Capcom"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Computer_Platforms", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Computer Platforms", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 63}], "image": "https://articles-img.sftcdn.net/t_article_cover_xl/auto-mapping-folder/sites/3/2024/06/geoff-summer-game-fest-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9621781", "eventUri": "eng-9621781", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3333333333333333, "wgt": 162, "relevance": 1}

SGF livestreams in years past have brought big reveals like 2021's Elden Ring gameplay, and we should expect more of that kind of thing this year, according to Keighley: That is, trailers and announcements related to games we already know about, rather than earth-shattering reveals of unannounced games.\n\nKeighley recently hopped onto a Twitch Q&A session for some \"expectation setting\" for this year's presentation. According to Keighley, while the 2-hour showcase will have plenty of trailers to show, it'll mostly consist of \"existing games that have new updates for fans\" -- new content for released games, or trailers for games that have already been announced.\n\n\"This is not a show that has a lot of like, 'coming in 2026' or '2027' or teasers for games that are years and years out,\" Keighley said.\n\nWe do already know some of what we'll see at SGF on Friday -- I am, as always, looking forward to more Monster Hunter Wilds previews -- and Keighley said that \"there will be, definitely, new announcements,\" even if they're not blockbuster reveals. Maybe if the stars align, we'll be lucky enough for a back-to-back Nic Cage appearance. Anything can happen if you dare to dream.\n\nKeighley was pretty candid in saying that if you're looking for the huge surprise announcements, you're more likely to find those at the other tentpole of the Keighleyverse: The Game Awards at the end of the year, when -- unlike in the summer -- the major publishers don't always have their own events for big reveals. As a result, Keighley said the Game Awards \"has a lot of usually big surprises,\" while SGF is \"largely focused on announced stuff.\"\n\nLuckily, if you're worried that you'll be left hungry for game previews, there are plenty of other showcases running throughout the week. Check out our SGF 2024 schedule for the full preview event lineup, including our own PC Gaming Show, airing at 1pm PDT on Sunday, June 9.", "source": {"uri": "pcgamer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "pcgamer"}, "authors": [{"uri": "lincoln_carpenter@pcgamer.com", "name": "Lincoln Carpenter", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trailer_(promotion)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Trailer (promotion)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keighley", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Keighley"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Keighley"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_Game_Fest", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Summer Game Fest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Livestreaming", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Livestreaming"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E3", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "E3"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitch_(service)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Twitch (service)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elden_Ring", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Elden Ring"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoff_Keighley", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Geoff Keighley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gameplay", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gameplay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monster_Hunter", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Monster Hunter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Game_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Game Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Personal computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockbuster_(entertainment)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Blockbuster (entertainment)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 31}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Computer_Platforms", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Computer Platforms", "wgt": 30}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 31}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Resources", "label": "dmoz/Games/Resources", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 83}], "image": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UGxnN2gxaKx2dwhvtDjHPS-1200-80.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9621781", "eventUri": "eng-9621781", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-09", "textStart": 2009, "textEnd": 2015}], "sentiment": 0.223529411764706, "wgt": 159, "relevance": 1}

Even more so if you're in a region where the showcase will be running late into the night!\n\nWhen it comes to who and what might be making an appearance in this year's show, back on Thursday 16th May Geoff Keighley announced via his X (formally Twitter) account that over 55 partners would be making an appearance. This list includes the likes of Sega, Niantic, Bandai Namco, Annapurna Interactive, Capcom and Xbox. Due to this we wouldn't be surprised if we get another look at upcoming titles like the Shadow of the Erdtree DLC for Elden Ring.\n\nOn Friday 31st May Keighley announced that Ryozo Tsujimoto from Capcom would be making an appearance to discuss Monster Hunter Wilds again via his X account. This was followed by a trailer for the showcase on Sunday 2nd June.\n\nIn this trailer we can catch glimpses of footage from Dragon's Dogma 2, Star Wars Outlaws, Palworld and even a snippet of Alan Wake 2 among many others. It's important to note that this trailer is designed to highlight both past and upcoming games, so a title's inclusion doesn't confirm it will be at Summer Game Fest.\n\nVia the official Summer Game Fest X account, we also know the show will include a look at the next instalment in a 2K franchise, Batman: Arkham Shadow, Metaphor: ReFantazio, the Among Us animated series, Dragon Ball: Sparkling! ZERO, The First Descendant, a Honkai: Star Rail update and Dune Awakening.\n\nThough thanks to Summer Game Fest Q&A on Twitch, we know from Keighley himself that this year's show is focused more on updates for existing games rather than new releases. He also stated that there would be at least 10 developers making an appearance during the showcase. There will not be a new GTA 6 trailer.

He said it's a \"lighter\" year, not a quiet year, so there should still be some new projects to get everyone excited. He reckons the show will be around two hours long.\n\nSome people have taken to social media to suggest that the reason this is a \"lighter\" year for new game announcements is due to all the layoffs and studio closures the industry has faced in the last few years.\n\nIn 2024 alone there have been over 8,800 people laid off from the video game industry. When you remove that much talent and shutter so many studios, it's no wonder we're seeing fewer games now.\n\nSummer Game Fest is running from Thursday June 6 to Monday June 10.", "source": {"uri": "nme.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NME Music News, Reviews, Videos, Galleries, Tickets and Blogs | NME.COM"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoff_Keighley", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Geoff Keighley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_Game_Fest", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Summer Game Fest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitch_(service)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Twitch (service)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keighley", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Keighley"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Keighley"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E3", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "E3"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downloadable_content", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Downloadable content"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trailer_(promotion)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Trailer (promotion)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Video game industry"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 34}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads", "wgt": 33}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Computer_Platforms", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Computer Platforms", "wgt": 33}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 35}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Resources", "label": "dmoz/Games/Resources", "wgt": 33}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 47}], "image": "https://www.nme.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Geoff-Keighley-E3-2000X1270.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9621781", "eventUri": "eng-9621781", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-06", "textStart": 1445, "textEnd": 1451}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-10", "textStart": 1462, "textEnd": 1469}], "sentiment": -0.02745098039215688, "wgt": 154, "relevance": 1}

It's not yet available through the desktop app, at least so far as I could find by searching through the store, but it features a handful of upcoming games and a few game sales.\n\nFor the most part, the page will host the live stream of Summer Game Fest, along with Day of the Devs and Devolver Direct, following immediately after SGF 2024. Following the page, you'll see a handful of titles, such as The First Descendant, Palworld, Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2, Once Human, Monster Hunter Wilds, Zoochosis, and more. Many of these titles are currently listed as 'Coming Soon.'\n\nHowever, you can purchase a few on sale right now, like Party Animals, which features a 20% discount at the time of writing. I'm sure we'll see additional discounted titles, such as Palworld, during the showcase.\n\nWhat Games Will We See at Summer Game Fest?\n\nWe know about a handful of upcoming titles being shown off at Summer Game Fest. For instance, Slitterhead will receive its world-premier gameplay trailer!\n\nWe've also heard rumors about Alan Wake 2 Night Springs DLC, Black Myth: Wukong, Monster Hunter Wilds, Helldivers 2, Dragon Ball: Sparkling!

This show is very much, it's largely focused on announced stuff. There are absolutely new game announcements throughout the show, but just to level set, it's not all brand new stuff. It tends to be things that are coming out later this year.\n\n\"And there are things that we'll announce that will come out later this year that haven't been announced yet, but this is not a show that has a lot of like, you know, coming in 2026 or 2027, or teasers for games that are years and years out. I'm trying to think, every time is different, but that's generally what I would say just in terms of expectation setting.\"\n\nOn the subject of how many games will be on show, he said: \"It's always hard when we get into numbers because then people start to guess about how many announcements there are, how many games.\n\n\"It's hard to say. There's a lot of games. In this show there are kind of shorter moments on a bunch of games, there's not like one game we show for 15 minutes or something like that. It's really a sampling of a bunch of different games across the industry, so that probably means more games as opposed to fewer, but it's a really eclectic mix of games across the whole industry.\"", "source": {"uri": "videogameschronicle.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "VGC"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tom_ivan@videogameschronicle.com", "name": "Tom Ivan", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_Game_Fest", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Summer Game Fest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoff_Keighley", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Geoff Keighley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitch_(service)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Twitch (service)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entertainment_Tonight", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Entertainment Tonight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockbuster_(entertainment)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Blockbuster (entertainment)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keighley", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Keighley"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Keighley"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sampling (music)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coming_out", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coming out"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 41}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads", "wgt": 39}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Computer_Platforms", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Computer Platforms", "wgt": 39}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Gaming", "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Gaming", "wgt": 40}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 41}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 56}], "image": "https://www.videogameschronicle.com/files/2024/06/summer-game-fest-live-2023.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9621781", "eventUri": "eng-9621781", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-07", "textStart": 360, "textEnd": 366}], "sentiment": 0.223529411764706, "wgt": 148, "relevance": 1}

Your spirit will continue to live on in all the gaming events you have inspired since your untimely death. The biggest of which is Summer Game Fest, Geoff Keighley's lovechild kicking off this weekend, which got its first taste of fame when FromSoftware threw them a bone in the form of Elden Ring's first gameplay trailer in 2021.\n\nBut the Summer Game Fest is so much more than the event with an Elden Ring trailer. It's a massive collective of the industry's big hitters -- broken down into a whole bunch of smaller events hosted by the likes of Keighley, Xbox and... GamesRadar? The main event usually involves Keighley's labrador-like face on the big stage before the spotlight is shone on other events like Day of the Devs, the Future Games Show and Xbox's own Showcase (followed by a Black Ops VI direct).\n\nIn the past, you were likely to find the biggest announcements of the event wherever Geoff Keighley was standing. This year, Xbox is looking to shake up the hierarchy and steal the show. Still, as the opener for the entire weekend, Keighley's event will surely have some surprises lined up. It'll be streamed in all the usual places -- on the official The Game Awards YouTube and Twitch channels -- but the stream we've embedded above will work just fine on the night.\n\nAs for what we can expect from Geoff Keighley on the night, he hinted through a recent Q&A on Twitch that the night's focus would be on already-existing games rather than brand-new announcements. Keighley also implied that Hollow Knight: Silksong wouldn't be making an appearance.\n\n\"I think it's going to be, generally, a little bit quieter this summer in terms of crazy new announcements and shocking surprises and things like that,\" he said, before noting, \"there will definitely be new announcements.\"\n\nAccording to DigitalTrends, some of the bigger announcements include a new trailer for Dragon Ball: Sparkling! Zero, a look at the Among Us series, Palworld updates (PS5 please!) and reveals from Remedy Entertainment and Two Star Games. In a tweet, Summer Games Fest pointed out that \"2K plans to reveal the next iteration in one of 2K's biggest and most beloved franchises,\" which, according to Xputer, is said to be Borderlands 4.\n\nThe Summer Game Fest is scheduled to kick off on 7 June at 11 PM SAST.\n\nIf indie titles and lesser-known developers are more your speed, then GamesRadar's Future Games Show is where you should direct your eyes on Saturday, 8 June. It's pulled in some big names to bring those new games to life, with Roger Clark (Arthur Morgan, Red Dead Redemption) and Britt Baron (Tifa, Final Fantasy VII Rebirth) heading things up.\n\nGamesRadar is touting this month's show as \"our biggest digital games event of the year,\" trumping the publication's event it held in March -- which saw new trailers and updates for \"over 50 exciting games across PS5, Xbox Series X, Nintendo Switch and PC,\" including trailers for Sand Land and Dragon's Dogma 2.\n\nThe Future Games Show is scheduled to kick off on 8 June at 9 PM SAST.\n\nStep aside, Keighley. The Xbox Showcase has reportedly stepped up to the plate with a two-hour-long show (not including the Black Ops 6 showcase directly afterwards), with around 30 or so games on display -- some of which aren't even on anyone's radar. That's coming from well-known reporter and leaker Jeff Grubb (via ResetEra).\n\n\"I'm not gonna spoil anything but the numbers I'm hearing are two hours and about thirty games, and at least a handful of those games are games we haven't heard of before,\" he said. \"I think there will be around five games that we haven't heard about before and that's from across all their verticals.\"\n\nWith a new Call of Duty firmly out of the way, it paves the way for titles from Bethesda and Activision Blizzard to fill up the two-hour-long show. One of those, according to Grubb could be another entry in the Dragon Age series, which has long been rumoured to be named Dreadwolf (though his later comments hinted that Dreadwolf may not be the title revealed).\n\nThen there were those rumours of a new Doom game, The Dark Ages, that'll breach all consoles, PS5 included.\n\nThe Xbox Showcase is scheduled to kick off on 9 June at 7 PM SAST.",

That also means that it is subject to the same series of leaks, rumors, and popular predictions that precede such events.\n\nTruth be told, those going into this even expecting a monumental showcase of the biggest upcoming games will likely walk away from SGF at least slightly disappointed. Still, here are some of the more notable rumblings about the event you should know about.\n\nTo get the bad news out of the way, Summer Game Fest organizer Geoff Keighley has already made it clear that you shouldn't expect too many major new announcements at SGF. There will be some reveals, but the show will largely focus on \"existing games that have new updates for fans.\" As it turns out, an industry currently defined by mass layoffs, ballooning production costs, and a growing obsession with the \"infinite game\" doesn't have many new releases to show at this time. Nobody could have seen this coming.\n\nRegardless, you shouldn't expect to see games like GTA 6, Kingdom Hearts 4, or the Metal Gear Solid 3 Remake during the showcase. For that matter, you shouldn't expect to see the major reveals of games that we only suspect are coming eventually. The rest of our predictions, leaks, and rumors will be based on those lowered expectations. The exception is the upcoming Xbox Showcase, which seems to be more of its own thing in terms of Keighley's statements.", "source": {"uri": "denofgeek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Den of Geek"}, "authors": [{"uri": "matthew_byrd@denofgeek.com", "name": "Matthew Byrd", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_Game_Fest", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Summer Game Fest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoff_Keighley", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Geoff Keighley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal_Gear_Solid_(1998_video_game)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Metal Gear Solid (1998 video game)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Theft_Auto", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Grand Theft Auto"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Xbox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keighley", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Keighley"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Keighley"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Computer_Platforms", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Computer Platforms", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Resources", "label": "dmoz/Games/Resources", "wgt": 27}], "image": "https://www.denofgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Gears-of-war.jpg?fit=1920%2C1080", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9621781", "eventUri": "eng-9621781", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 143, "relevance": 1}

The host also stated that the event would run for a whole two hours. Below is some of what was said in the Twitch live seem according to VGC.\n\n\"One of the things you'll see with the show this week is we really tried to programme some unexpected things, from smaller teams and independent studios, into the show as well, alongside some big blockbuster games and franchises that you will see in the show as well,\" Keighley said.\n\n\"I think it's going to be, generally, a little bit quieter this summer in terms of crazy new announcements and shocking surprises and things like that.\"\n\n\"There will definitely be new announcements, but the show is largely focused on, I think, existing games that have new updates for fans, just in terms of level setting,\" he added.\n\n\"[The] Game Awards has a lot of usually big surprises and big, new reveals. This show is very much, it's largely focused on announced stuff. There are absolutely new game announcements throughout the show, but just to level set, it's not all brand new stuff. It tends to be things that are coming out later this year.\n\n\"And there are things that we'll announce that will come out later this year that haven't been announced yet, but this is not a show that has a lot of like, you know, coming in 2026 or 2027, or teasers for games that are years and years out.

However, Geoff Keighley, who organizes the show has given a little bit of info about what won't be there at the show, according to Gamespot.\n\nSomething that Keighley already confirmed was that there will be no content for Grand Theft Auto 6 at the show, meaning no new trailer at the Summer Games Fest. It makes sense why some might have questioned if one would be shown at the showcase though, considering it has been 6 months since the first trailer was revealed and the game will be releasing just next year and we've only gotten one trailer for it.\n\nUnfortunately, players will have to wait even longer for new GTA 6 content to drop though since we won't be seeing any this coming weekend with all the big announcements and showcases that are coming. However, maybe later in the year we will see more about the game since it is set to release in Fall 2025, so that seems like more of a reasonable timeline overall.\n\nAll of the previous GTA installments can be played across different consoles like Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.", "source": {"uri": "gameranx.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Gameranx"}, "authors": [{"uri": "faith_lane@gameranx.com", "name": "Faith Lane", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoff_Keighley", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Geoff Keighley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Theft_Auto", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Grand Theft Auto"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_Series_X_and_Series_S", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Xbox Series X and Series S"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_5", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "PlayStation 5"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_Switch", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nintendo Switch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Personal computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_console", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Video game console"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Computer_Platforms", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Computer Platforms", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys_and_Games/Games", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys and Games/Games", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 54}], "image": "https://gameranx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GTA-6-trailer.png.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9621781", "eventUri": "eng-9621781", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-07", "textStart": 79, "textEnd": 85}], "sentiment": 0.03529411764705892, "wgt": 138, "relevance": 1}

According to a story published this morning, several marketing professionals have revealed that Summer Game Fest trailer spots cost a whopping $250,000 for a single minute of footage.\n\nThis news comes from an article published this morning by Adam Morgan at Esquire. The piece dives into much of the conversation surrounding Summer Game fest and its headman, Geoff Keighley, including topics like his bizarre silence on the state of the video game industry. The most interesting part of the article, however, is about how expensive it is to get your trailer into the Summer Game Fest presentation lineup.\n\nAccording to \"multiple marketing professionals,\" in order to get into SGF's main showcase, it costs $250,000 for a single minute slot, $350,000 for one and a half minutes, $450,000 for two minutes, and a heaping $550,000 for two and a half minutes. Doing some quick math on last year's Summer Game Fest showcase, that means that with these prices, all of last year's trailers amounted to a staggering $9.65 million budget.\n\nNow, compared to ad costs for other premium events like the Super Bowl, which very quickly reach the millions, these prices might not seem that high. But for an indie developer, the barrier to entry for a show that could put tens of thousands of eyes on your product is obscenely high. This holds especially true when considering that it costs nothing to put a trailer up on YouTube or another social media site (though, admittedly, without the guaranteed audience numbers).\n\nSeveral industry professionals also weighed in on Geoff's choices for the show in the same article. One PR professional who chose to remain anonymous stated the following:\n\n\"The current pricing tiers make Summer Game Fest an unattainable goal for most indie developers and publishers. As far as general brand awareness, the impact is pretty huge. The caveat here is that it depends on the placement and trailer length. Longer slots perform better and seem to drive more coverage, whereas short trailers don't capture quite the same attention.\"\n\nGreg Miller, CEO and founder of Kinda Funny and long-time video game journalist, also weighed in on Geoff's typical program lineup. He stated that, while Geoff does a good job shining a light on indies, he could be doing more. He did concede that at a certain point, criticizing Geoff's vision for the show might become an imposition of his own vision instead of genuine critique.\n\nAdmittedly, it's hard to know where to come down on this one. On one hand, indies have been the lifeblood of the gaming industry in the last few months, let alone the last few years. Recent incredible releases like Another Crab's Treasure, Hades 2, Balatro, and Animal Well have proven that there's still plenty of magic to be found in original, off-the-beaten-path ideas.\n\nOn the other hand, however, gamers are hungry, and, oftentimes, ruthless. All it takes is sixty seconds reading the chat of any of Keighley's live events to see that their standards can be unbelievably high. If Geoff's not showing off the next Grand Theft Auto, an extremely vocal subset of viewers won't hesitate to call his shows \"overhyped,\" \"disappointing,\" or \"lame\" (all real comments we found in the live chat recap during a trailer for Final Fantasy VII Rebirth from last year's showcase). While it's important to champion indie developers and titles, the audience can be rabid for the biggest, most expensive titles, and settle for absolutely nothing less.\n\nAt the end of the day, we hope that Keighley's been listening to feedback and is prepared to make a great show this year.

Things have already begun but the next big swing of the season comes from Summer Game Fest. Unlike the long-running, exclusive-focused streams from platform holders, Summer Game Fest features announcements from a wide range of developers and publishers of varying sizes. The list of attending companies has already been revealed and so we've used it as the basis for some predictions. What can you expect to see at Summer Game Fest 2024? Read on for our best educated guesses.\n\nThe Big Three\n\nSony may have only recently held its own summer State of Play broadcast, and the Xbox Game Showcase arrives in just a few days, but both platform holders are confirmed to be part of Summer Game Fest. Despite this it's unlikely that we'll see any bombshells. The most significant headlines are usually reserved for their own first-party shows.\n\nAt 2023's Summer Game Fest we were treated to a substantial Spider-Man 2 trailer. This year's show, then, could be where Spider-Man 2 DLC makes its debut. An expansion has yet to be officially confirmed but the original game went big with an additional three-part campaign, and the nods towards Carnage in the base game certainly seems a logical pathway towards DLC. Beyond that, there's potential for follow-ups on last week's State of Play, such as a little more from Astro Bot or Concord. That's as much as we'd realistically expect, but there's always a chance that the much-rumoured LEGO Horizon Adventures could turn up. Just don't waste your time manifesting that Bloodborne PS5 remaster. We'll eat a saw cleaver if that happens...\n\nAs for Xbox, the sensible bet is on updates and partnerships. Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3's newest season has already launched, but there's always room for another IP crossover. Similarly, SGF 2023 featured new Xboxes with Porsche branding, and it's this kind of thing we expect to see.\n\nNintendo is, as ever, a no-show, and so you'll need to hold out on an official Nintendo Direct later in the summer. But Steam is confirmed to be part of the show. The fact that it's Steam rather than Valve has us thinking this won't be a game, so not the recently leaked Deadlock. Perhaps a new Steam Deck update or accessory?\n\nAAA Major Players\n\nSo if we're not expecting much from the first-party platform holders, what about the mega publishers and veteran AAA developers? 2K plans to reveal \"the next iteration in one of its biggest and most beloved franchises\". While I imagine a new BioShock is at the top of that list for most of us, with a new Borderlands movie fast approaching there's logic in a new entry in the long-running looter-shooter franchise. But when it comes to \"biggest and most beloved\", the answer could be Civilization, 2K's 4X strategy behemoth that's been running since 1991.\n\nWe know Atlus' Katsura Hashino and Shigenori Soejima will be part of the show for Metaphor: ReFantazio, which also has its own presentation happening shortly after Summer Game Fest. Prepare yourself for new information on the latest from the director of Persona 5.\n\nIt seems like Capcom's big focus for the coming months will be Monster Hunter Wilds, and after our first look at State of Play we know that SGF will provide an new trailer and monster reveal. Of course, we'll also be hoping for some news on what's next for Resident Evil, be that RE9 or the rumoured Code Veronica and Zero remakes, but right now that feels unlikely. More realistic is DLC for recent games, such as season 2 of Street Fighter 6 or an expansion for the brilliant Dragon's Dogma 2.\n\nIt's a year made up of numbers above 1993, which means Electronic Arts will be publishing a few annualised sports games soon. There's a reasonable chance of EA Sports FC 25, then. But the sports game we're really hoping to see is the long-awaited reboot of Skate, and EA seems to be teasing as much with this unusual retro website that launched earlier this week.\n\nWe also expect some non-sports EA games, perhaps starting with a new Battlefield. We know that EA's Motive Studio is hard at work on an Iron Man game, so maybe Tony Stark will drop by? But we think it's safe to say that our biggest hopes are pinned on Dragon Age: Dreadwolf. A full reveal of BioWare's next RPG has been promised for summer 2024, and hopefully it's at least approaching a return to form.\n\nLeague of Legends developer Riot Games will be at the show, and with Arcane season 2 coming later this year there's a very good chance we'll get a trailer for the spectacular Netflix series. But it also feels the right time for Riot to go big on 2XKO, the League of Legends fighting game that's been in development for several years now. Could a beta launch be coming soon?\n\nWith its own show coming just a few days later, it seems likely that Ubisoft won't go big for SGF. While we may get trailers that tease bigger reveals for Star Wars Outlaws and Assassin's Creed Shadows at Ubisoft Forward, it's more likely that we'll see something from the company's smaller games. BattleCore: Arena will have just gone into early access, so perhaps a promotional launch trailer? Meanwhile XDefiant is currently in pre-season, so maybe we'll get news on what to expect from the shooter's first main season.\n\n\"But what about Beyond Good and Evil 2?\" we hear you cry. And to that we say: it's good to keep dreaming.\n\nWB Games is confirmed to be attending, and we know that it's bringing Batman: Arkham Shadow with it. Announced last month, it's a Meta Quest 3 VR exclusive addition to the Arkham games canon. Beyond that, it seems sensible to expect a new character or update for the recently relaunched MultiVersus. There's also chance of a look at season 2 of Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League, which rumours suggest will introduce Mr. Freeze to the roster. Looking further ahead, we may also finally get news on Monolith's Wonder Woman game, which was announced back in 2021.\n\nWe recently learned that Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 is in development, and with publisher Deep Silver confirmed to be at Summer Game Fest we're betting on a new trailer for the historical RPG. There's also a chance we'll see more from Metro Awakening, the VR post-apocalypse shooter that's scheduled for later this year.\n\nA cryptic message from the Alan Wake 2 Twitter/X account indicates something from Remedy will be announced as part of the show. We can't wait to see what kind of twisted DLC adventures await for Alan and Saga.\n\nWith the Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree DLC so close you can taste it, it seems logical to assume Bandai Namco's presence at SGF means a new trailer full of disgusting bosses. The more likely reality is that it'll be something connected to Bandai's online project, Blue Protocol, built in collaboration with Amazon Games, who is also part of the show. It's worth holding out some hope for Little Nightmares 3, though. It may have been recently delayed, but it was first revealed at gamescom's Opening Night Live. And so there's a chance that, with both shows being organised by Geoff Keighley, the relationship may deliver a new look at the spooky co-op platformer. As for something that will definitely be there, look no further than Dragon Ball: Sparking! Zero.\n\nMid-Size Developers\n\nFocus Entertainment and Saber Interactive have Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 coming out this September, so a gory look at some fresh Tyranid splattering seems likely. Then there's the equally violent-looking John Carpenter's Toxic Commando, also from Saber. Revealed this time last year, maybe it's time for another look at the '80s-inspired undead shooter.\n\nDespite Take Two's best efforts, the beleaguered Private Division marches on with two games currently in development. Moon Studios' No Rest for the Wicked has hit early access, and so maybe there will be an update on new features coming to the ARPG. Then there's the Lord of the Rings cosy game, Tales of the Shire. Due to launch this year, we wouldn't say no to a brief little visit to Hobbiton in the form of a new trailer.\n\nLess quaint a setting is the planet of Arrakis and its perpetual war for the possession of spice. A story cinematic trailer has been promised for Funcom's Dune: Awakening, the MMO set in Frank Herbert's classic sci-fi world.\n\nArc Games might bring us a new look at the long-awaited Hyper Light Breaker from Heart Machine, as well as perhaps a look at something new for Remnant 2, of which two of the promised three DLC packs have been released so far. Level Infinite will also be in attendance, perhaps giving us some mobile time-travelling in the shape of Assassin's Creed Jade, or an update on what new things to expect from fantasy survival game, Nightingale.\n\nThen there's Torn Banner Studios. Could a Chivalry 3 reveal be marching in, or something completely new from the developer? Pocketpair will present some \"long awaited features\" for breakout hit Palworld, SNK has Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves to show off, and S-Game might show us more of Phantom Blade Zero - the stylish sword-based steampunk-infused martial arts game revealed last year.\n\nA couple of years ago, some ex-Blizzard folks revealed their new RTS Stormgate at Summer Game Fest. History looks to repeat itself in 2024 because Uncapped Games, headed up by former StarCraft developer David Kim, is set to unveil its new game at the show. The project is promised to be a \"paradigm shift for the RTS genre.\"\n\nDeveloper Team Jade has confirmed that a new trailer for Delta Force Hawk Ops will drop during the show, so you can expect the rattling assault rifles of modern warfare to light up, too.\n\nIndies, Art House, and Smaller Projects\n\nDevolver has its own show, for which we can logically expect the majority of its reveals to be saved for, but that seemingly won't stop it from showing us something new at SGF. A recent tease points in the direction of another new game from Heart Machine - the developer of the Hyper Light series. Outside of that, we can perhaps expect new looks at other upcoming Devolver projects such as the action-packed Anger Foot, charming The Plucky Squire, and ludicrous Baby Steps.\n\nAnnapurna Interactive is as consistent an indie publisher as there is, having given us the likes of Cocoon, Stray, and Thirsty Suitors in recent years, and the critically acclaimed puzzler Lorelei and the Laser Eyes already in 2024. But with Bounty Star, Flock, Ghost Bike, Blade Runner 2033: Labyrinth, and Silent Hill: Townfall all coming up, we wouldn't be surprised to see more than one trailer from Annapurna at this year's show.\n\nBlumhouse is gearing up to reveal its first game. Common sense would lead us to think it's a horror game, but will it be based on one of their many film franchises? Jason Blum stated that the publisher is more interested in original projects at this stage, so maybe don't expect an Insidious, Paranormal Activity, or The Purge game just yet. Either way, it will likely be one of the scarier trailers of the show.\n\nSpeaking of horror, we know that Bokeh Game Studio is partnered with the show, so surely that means a new look at Slitterhead, the new disturbing-looking creation from Keiichiro Toyama, the man behind Silent Hill, Siren, and Gravity Rush.\n\nAlso slated to appear is Thunderful, who could well give us a look at gameplay of the recently announced SteamWorld Heist 2. We can expect Innersloth to give us an update on the Among Us animated TV show, and Jyamma Games may well show off a new trailer for upcoming Italian-styled soulslike, Enotria: The Last Song.\n\nMultiplayer and Free-to-Play\n\nAlready confirmed for the show is the official launch date reveal for The First Descendant, Nexon's free-to-play looter shooter that can be played solo or in co-op.\n\nNetEase has a couple of games that may make an appearance. Hero shooter Marvel Rivals could get a new trailer or character reveal ahead of its closed beta in July. Where Winds Meet, meanwhile, could give us another glimpse of gameplay following a brief showing at last week's PlayStation State of Play.\n\nHoYoverse is gearing up for the launch of the stylish action RPG Zenless Zone Zero on July 4, so a fresh look to build up the hype seems logical. We also wouldn't be shocked to see some Genshin Impact and Honkai: Star Rail seasonal updates.\n\nEpic and Embark are both listed as partners, so sneak peeks at what is coming up for both Fortnite and The Finals respectively might make an appearance. Amazon Games is also furthering its push into the online gaming space and has both Throne and Liberty (co-created with NCSoft, another confirmed SGF attendant) and Blue Protocol (the joint project with Namco Bandai we mentioned earlier) in development. New trailers for both wouldn't be a surprise.\n\nPotential Surprises\n\nNow, we aren't going to list every big upcoming game that could show us something new on Friday, but here are a few we think might just surprise us.\n\nWe'd really love Judas to make an appearance. Initially revealed at the Game Awards 2022, Geoff Keighley recently sat down with IGN's Ryan McCaffrey and Judas director Ken Levine for an extended chat about how Ghost Story Games' new roguelike-ish, BioShock-y shooter works. A new look at gameplay certainly wouldn't go amiss.\n\nHollow Knight fans have been suffering for a long time now and would surely love nothing more than to see that Team Cherry logo pop up at the beginning of a Hollow Knight: Silksong release date trailer. Will it happen? We may as well make this prediction for the 39th showcase in a row.\n\nIO Interactive's James Bond game Project 007 was announced back in 2020. We certainly wouldn't say no to spying a look at that in action.\n\nCould Skydance Interactive give us another look at Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra? The Amy Hennig Captain America and Black Panther action-adventure looked stunning the last time we saw it, with a trailer showing off the power of Unreal Engine 5. We could watch that all day, so a little more would be very welcome.\n\nIs it time for the wild-looking DokeV to make a return? From Korean developers Pearl Abyss, the colorful open-world action-adventure was last seen at gamescom Opening Night Live back in 2021 but has been silent ever since.\n\nAnd, finally, it wouldn't be a Geoff Keighley show without some Hideo Kojima speculation. While it may be too soon for another epic Death Stranding 2 trailer, could we get some more info on the Jordan Peele-related project OD? Whatever the case, it's surely far too early for a look at Physint. Hideo might not even be there. There's a first for everything.\n\nMatt Purslow is IGN's Senior Features Editor.

Things have already begun but the next big swing of the season comes from Summer Game Fest. Unlike the long-running, exclusive-focused streams from platform holders, Summer Game Fest features announcements from a wide range of developers and publishers of varying sizes. The list of attending companies has already been revealed and so we've used it as the basis for some predictions. What can you expect to see at Summer Game Fest 2024? Read on for our best educated guesses.\n\nSony may have only recently held its own summer State of Play broadcast, and the Xbox Game Showcase arrives in just a few days, but both platform holders are confirmed to be part of Summer Game Fest. Despite this it's unlikely that we'll see any bombshells. The most significant headlines are usually reserved for their own first-party shows.\n\nAt 2023's Summer Game Fest we were treated to a substantial Spider-Man 2 trailer. This year's show, then, could be where Spider-Man 2 DLC makes its debut. An expansion has yet to be officially confirmed but the original game went big with an additional three-part campaign, and the nods towards Carnage in the base game certainly seems a logical pathway towards DLC. Beyond that, there's potential for follow-ups on last week's State of Play, such as a little more from Astro Bot or Concord. That's as much as we'd realistically expect, but there's always a chance that the much-rumoured LEGO Horizon Adventures could turn up. Just don't waste your time manifesting that Bloodborne PS5 remaster. We'll eat a saw cleaver if that happens...\n\nAs for Xbox, the sensible bet is on updates and partnerships. Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3's newest season has already launched, but there's always room for another IP crossover. Similarly, SGF 2023 featured new Xboxes with Porsche branding, and it's this kind of thing we expect to see.\n\nNintendo is, as ever, a no-show, and so you'll need to hold out on an official Nintendo Direct later in the summer. But Steam is confirmed to be part of the show. The fact that it's Steam rather than Valve has us thinking this won't be a game, so not the recently leaked Deadlock. Perhaps a new Steam Deck update or accessory?\n\nSo if we're not expecting much from the first-party platform holders, what about the mega publishers and veteran AAA developers? 2K plans to reveal \"the next iteration in one of its biggest and most beloved franchises\". While I imagine a new BioShock is at the top of that list for most of us, with a new Borderlands movie fast approaching there's logic in a new entry in the long-running looter-shooter franchise. But when it comes to \"biggest and most beloved\", the answer could be Civilization, 2K's 4X strategy behemoth that's been running since 1991.\n\nWe know Atlus' Katsura Hashino and Shigenori Soejima will be part of the show for Metaphor: ReFantazio, which also has its own presentation happening shortly after Summer Game Fest. Prepare yourself for new information on the latest from the director of Persona 5.\n\nIt seems like Capcom's big focus for the coming months will be Monster Hunter Wilds, and after our first look at State of Play we know that SGF will provide an new trailer and monster reveal. Of course, we'll also be hoping for some news on what's next for Resident Evil, be that RE9 or the rumoured Code Veronica and Zero remakes, but right now that feels unlikely. More realistic is DLC for recent games, such as season 2 of Street Fighter 6 or an expansion for the brilliant Dragon's Dogma 2.\n\nIt's a year made up of numbers above 1993, which means Electronic Arts will be publishing a few annualised sports games soon. There's a reasonable chance of EA Sports FC 25, then. But the sports game we're really hoping to see is the long-awaited reboot of Skate, and EA seems to be teasing as much with this unusual retro website that launched earlier this week.\n\nWe also expect some non-sports EA games, perhaps starting with a new Battlefield. We know that EA's Motive Studio is hard at work on an Iron Man game, so maybe Tony Stark will drop by? But we think it's safe to say that our biggest hopes are pinned on Dragon Age: Dreadwolf. A full reveal of BioWare's next RPG has been promised for summer 2024, and hopefully it's at least approaching a return to form.\n\nLeague of Legends developer Riot Games will be at the show, and with Arcane season 2 coming later this year there's a very good chance we'll get a trailer for the spectacular Netflix series. But it also feels the right time for Riot to go big on 2XKO, the League of Legends fighting game that's been in development for several years now. Could a beta launch be coming soon?\n\nWith its own show coming just a few days later, it seems likely that Ubisoft won't go big for SGF. While we may get trailers that tease bigger reveals for Star Wars Outlaws and Assassin's Creed Shadows at Ubisoft Forward, it's more likely that we'll see something from the company's smaller games. BattleCore: Arena will have just gone into early access, so perhaps a promotional launch trailer? Meanwhile XDefiant is currently in pre-season, so maybe we'll get news on what to expect from the shooter's first main season.\n\n\"But what about Beyond Good and Evil 2?\" we hear you cry. And to that we say: it's good to keep dreaming.\n\nWB Games is confirmed to be attending, and we know that it's bringing Batman: Arkham Shadow with it. Announced last month, it's a Meta Quest 3 VR exclusive addition to the Arkham games canon. Beyond that, it seems sensible to expect a new character or update for the recently relaunched MultiVersus. There's also chance of a look at season 2 of Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League, which rumours suggest will introduce Mr. Freeze to the roster. Looking further ahead, we may also finally get news on Monolith's Wonder Woman game, which was announced back in 2021.\n\nWe recently learned that Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 is in development, and with publisher Deep Silver confirmed to be at Summer Game Fest we're betting on a new trailer for the historical RPG. There's also a chance we'll see more from Metro Awakening, the VR post-apocalypse shooter that's scheduled for later this year.\n\nA cryptic message from the Alan Wake 2 Twitter/X account indicates something from Remedy will be announced as part of the show. We can't wait to see what kind of twisted DLC adventures await for Alan and Saga.\n\nWith the Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree DLC so close you can taste it, it seems logical to assume Bandai Namco's presence at SGF means a new trailer full of disgusting bosses. The more likely reality is that it'll be something connected to Bandai's online project, Blue Protocol, built in collaboration with Amazon Games, who is also part of the show. It's worth holding out some hope for Little Nightmares 3, though. It may have been recently delayed, but it was first revealed at gamescom's Opening Night Live. And so there's a chance that, with both shows being organised by Geoff Keighley, the relationship may deliver a new look at the spooky co-op platformer. As for something that will definitely be there, look no further than Dragon Ball: Sparking! Zero.\n\nFocus Entertainment and Saber Interactive have Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 coming out this September, so a gory look at some fresh Tyranid splattering seems likely. Then there's the equally violent-looking John Carpenter's Toxic Commando, also from Saber. Revealed this time last year, maybe it's time for another look at the '80s-inspired undead shooter.\n\nDespite Take Two's best efforts, the beleaguered Private Division marches on with two games currently in development. Moon Studios' No Rest for the Wicked has hit early access, and so maybe there will be an update on new features coming to the ARPG. Then there's the Lord of the Rings cosy game, Tales of the Shire. Due to launch this year, we wouldn't say no to a brief little visit to Hobbiton in the form of a new trailer.\n\nLess quaint a setting is the planet of Arrakis and its perpetual war for the possession of spice. A story cinematic trailer has been promised for Funcom's Dune: Awakening, the MMO set in Frank Herbert's classic sci-fi world.\n\nArc Games might bring us a new look at the long-awaited Hyper Light Breaker from Heart Machine, as well as perhaps a look at something new for Remnant 2, of which two of the promised three DLC packs have been released so far. Level Infinite will also be in attendance, perhaps giving us some mobile time-travelling in the shape of Assassin's Creed Jade, or an update on what new things to expect from fantasy survival game, Nightingale.\n\nThen there's Torn Banner Studios. Could a Chivalry 3 reveal be marching in, or something completely new from the developer? Pocketpair will present some \"long awaited features\" for breakout hit Palworld, SNK has Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves to show off, and S-Game might show us more of Phantom Blade Zero - the stylish sword-based steampunk-infused martial arts game revealed last year.\n\nA couple of years ago, some ex-Blizzard folks revealed their new RTS Stormgate at Summer Game Fest. History looks to repeat itself in 2024 because Uncapped Games, headed up by former StarCraft developer David Kim, is set to unveil its new game at the show. The project is promised to be a \"paradigm shift for the RTS genre.\"\n\nDeveloper Team Jade has confirmed that a new trailer for Delta Force Hawk Ops will drop during the show, so you can expect the rattling assault rifles of modern warfare to light up, too.\n\nDevolver has its own show, for which we can logically expect the majority of its reveals to be saved for, but that seemingly won't stop it from showing us something new at SGF. A recent tease points in the direction of another new game from Heart Machine - the developer of the Hyper Light series. Outside of that, we can perhaps expect new looks at other upcoming Devolver projects such as the action-packed Anger Foot, charming The Plucky Squire, and ludicrous Baby Steps.\n\nAnnapurna Interactive is as consistent an indie publisher as there is, having given us the likes of Cocoon, Stray, and Thirsty Suitors in recent years, and the critically acclaimed puzzler Lorelei and the Laser Eyes already in 2024. But with Bounty Star, Flock, Ghost Bike, Blade Runner 2033: Labyrinth, and Silent Hill: Townfall all coming up, we wouldn't be surprised to see more than one trailer from Annapurna at this year's show.\n\nBlumhouse is gearing up to reveal its first game. Common sense would lead us to think it's a horror game, but will it be based on one of their many film franchises? Jason Blum stated that the publisher is more interested in original projects at this stage, so maybe don't expect an Insidious, Paranormal Activity, or The Purge game just yet. Either way, it will likely be one of the scarier trailers of the show.\n\nSpeaking of horror, we know that Bokeh Game Studio is partnered with the show, so surely that means a new look at Slitterhead, the new disturbing-looking creation from Keiichiro Toyama, the man behind Silent Hill, Siren, and Gravity Rush.\n\nAlso slated to appear is Thunderful, who could well give us a look at gameplay of the recently announced SteamWorld Heist 2. We can expect Innersloth to give us an update on the Among Us animated TV show, and Jyamma Games may well show off a new trailer for upcoming Italian-styled soulslike, Enotria: The Last Song.\n\nAlready confirmed for the show is the official launch date reveal for The First Descendant, Nexon's free-to-play looter shooter that can be played solo or in co-op.\n\nNetEase has a couple of games that may make an appearance. Hero shooter Marvel Rivals could get a new trailer or character reveal ahead of its closed beta in July. Where Winds Meet, meanwhile, could give us another glimpse of gameplay following a brief showing at last week's PlayStation State of Play.\n\nHoYoverse is gearing up for the launch of the stylish action RPG Zenless Zone Zero on July 4, so a fresh look to build up the hype seems logical. We also wouldn't be shocked to see some Genshin Impact and Honkai: Star Rail seasonal updates.\n\nEpic and Embark are both listed as partners, so sneak peeks at what is coming up for both Fortnite and The Finals respectively might make an appearance. Amazon Games is also furthering its push into the online gaming space and has both Throne and Liberty (co-created with NCSoft, another confirmed SGF attendant) and Blue Protocol (the joint project with Namco Bandai we mentioned earlier) in development. New trailers for both wouldn't be a surprise.\n\nNow, we aren't going to list every big upcoming game that could show us something new on Friday, but here are a few we think might just surprise us.\n\nWe'd really love Judas to make an appearance. Initially revealed at the Game Awards 2022, Geoff Keighley recently sat down with IGN's Ryan McCaffrey and Judas director Ken Levine for an extended chat about how Ghost Story Games' new roguelike-ish, BioShock-y shooter works. A new look at gameplay certainly wouldn't go amiss.\n\nHollow Knight fans have been suffering for a long time now and would surely love nothing more than to see that Team Cherry logo pop up at the beginning of a Hollow Knight: Silksong release date trailer. Will it happen? We may as well make this prediction for the 39th showcase in a row.\n\nIO Interactive's James Bond game Project 007 was announced back in 2020. We certainly wouldn't say no to spying a look at that in action.\n\nCould Skydance Interactive give us another look at Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra? The Amy Hennig Captain America and Black Panther action-adventure looked stunning the last time we saw it, with a trailer showing off the power of Unreal Engine 5. We could watch that all day, so a little more would be very welcome.\n\nIs it time for the wild-looking DokeV to make a return? From Korean developers Pearl Abyss, the colorful open-world action-adventure was last seen at gamescom Opening Night Live back in 2021 but has been silent ever since.\n\nAnd, finally, it wouldn't be a Geoff Keighley show without some Hideo Kojima speculation. While it may be too soon for another epic Death Stranding 2 trailer, could we get some more info on the Jordan Peele-related project OD? Whatever the case, it's surely far too early for a look at Physint. Hideo might not even be there. There's a first for everything.", "source": {"uri": "ign.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "IGN"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_Game_Fest", "type": "wiki",

It's also not the case that every publisher and developer who has a game shown in the main Summer Game Fest presentation pays for their spot.\n\nKotaku also reported that certain publishers are granted \"earned editorial placements\" and simply don't have to pay for their slots. The report pointed out Sony, Microsoft and Nintendo as publishers who would fall into that category, though it's not a stretch to believe a few other big name studios have been granted that status.\n\nKojima Productions, for one, is a studio that springs to mind as one that might be not have to pay for its time. FromSoftware are certainly candidates for one of the studios given a free pass on putting a trailer in the show.\n\nSpeaking of the recently added in-person component, along with that comes a cost to reserving a booth at the show, or even just getting in. A \"private meeting cabana\" that'll get six people into Summer Game Fest, grant them parking for the event, seating and table service will cost $50,000 for the entire weekend, or $20,000 per day if you don't stay the full 3.\n\nIndividual developers looking to get in with a partner badge will need to shell out $500, and that only gives you access to the event on June 10.\n\nThe developers who spoke to Esquire for the report all call out the show for being expensive, making appearing in the show \"unattainable\" for smaller indie developers and publishers.\n\nThose who do have the money to do it though seem to believe it's worth the price of admission when it comes to how monumental it can be for a game's popularity and sales.\n\nKeighley did not return a request to comment from Esquire on the piece, and has yet to say anything publicly himself. It is curious though how players will begin to look at these shows, now that they have more of an understanding of the cost.", "source": {"uri": "psu.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "PlayStation Universe"}, "authors": [{"uri": "david_carcasole@psu.com", "name": "David Carcasole", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_Game_Fest", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Summer Game Fest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trailer_(promotion)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Trailer (promotion)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoff_Keighley", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Geoff Keighley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esquire_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Esquire (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FromSoftware", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FromSoftware"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kojima_Productions", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kojima Productions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kotaku", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kotaku"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nintendo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keighley", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Keighley"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Keighley"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indie_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indie game"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Computer_Platforms", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Computer Platforms", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Game_Design", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Game Design", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://www.psu.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Summer-Game-Fest-Costs-Publishers-250K-Minimum-e1717695917857.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9621781", "eventUri": "eng-9621781", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-10", "textStart": 1707, "textEnd": 1714}], "sentiment": 0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 124, "relevance": 1}

And a new report, corroborated by Kotaku, reveals the high price it costs publishers and devs to show their games at the event.\n\nOn June 7, Summer Game Fest 2024 kicks off with a large streaming showcase featuring new trailers for upcoming games. The yearly showcase has become more important for the video game industry after the slow death of E3, the previous big summer event where new games would get teased and revealed. Millions of people will be tuning in on Friday to see what's coming next. And if you want to be a part of all this, you just need to spend a few hundred thousand dollars.\n\nAs first reported by Esquire on June 6, the costs for getting your game's trailer into Summer Game Fest's main show this year start at $250,000 for 1 minute, $350,000 for 1.5 minutes, $450,000 for 2 minutes, and $550,000 for 2.5 minutes. Kotaku was able to verify these and other numbers via a non-public document obtained via a source connected to the event.\n\n\"These shows are really fucking expensive,\" one insider told Esquire.\n\nIn the document obtained by Kotaku, the money spent on a trailer airing during SGF's kickoff event also includes a set number of social media posts from the official SGF account. 1-minute trailers get a single post, 1.5-minute teasers get two posts, and 2 minutes or more get you three.\n\nElsewhere in the SGF 2024 document obtained by Kotaku are prices for booths at Summer Game Fest. For a biz dev partner badge, granting access to the show on June 10 only, you'll have to be approved and pay $500.\n\nA private meeting cabana -- which includes seats for up to six people, table service, free parking, and six SGF badges -- will cost you $50,000 for all three days or $20,000 per day.\n\nFinally, you can purchase a \"Full Hands-On Pod\" which includes four\n\nlarge HDTVs, seating, credenzas with locked storage, signage, six SGF badges, and free parking. However, SGF also lets publishers and developers spend more on custom venues or spaces which can include features like bars, outdoor seating, tented parking, and sponsored lounges.\n\n\"The current pricing tiers make Summer Game Fest an unattainable goal for most indie developers and publishers,\" a PR agent who represents indie games told Esquire.\n\nHowever, others who spoke to the outlet did suggest that the high prices are worth it.\n\n\"As far as general brand awareness, the impact is pretty huge. The caveat here is that it depends on the placement and trailer length. Longer slots perform better and seem to drive more coverage, whereas short trailers don't capture quite the same attention,\" another PR professional told the outlet.\n\nAs Summer Game Fest and Keighley's winter E3 -- The Game Awards -- continue to grow and become some of the biggest video game industry events in the world, it's becoming more and more important for publishers behind increasingly expensive video games to be a part of the shows.

A teaser trailer for the game was shown, revealing its art direction and some of its creature design (although, crucially, no gameplay was demonstrated).\n\nThe game was actually teased earlier than that year's Game Awards, though. It's possible to see some concept art for what would eventually become Slitterhead in a video announcing the foundation of Bokeh Game Studio from back in late 2020.\n\nAfter the Game Awards reveal, Bokeh began to tease more information about Slitterhead.\n\nThe company has released a series of dev diaries showing off the development process for the game, including one in which we get to see some user testing phase footage (and a very brief snippet of rather early-in-development-looking gameplay).\n\nIn addition to these videos, Bokeh has also released several Q&A sessions with horror luminaries and industry legends, including chats with horror manga icon Junji Ito, Danganronpa creator Kazutaka Kodaka, and Dragon's Dogma head honcho Hideaki Itsuno.\n\nIt's not clear exactly how far along the development pipeline Slitterhead actually is, but the fact that Bokeh is showing gameplay this Friday is encouraging, at least.\n\nWe still don't have a release date or even a release window for Slitterhead, but perhaps we'll learn more about when we can expect the game to land later this week.

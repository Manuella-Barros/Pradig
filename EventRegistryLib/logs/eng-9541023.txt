However, they have managed to do so without a clinical striker in their squad.\n\nGabriel Jesus has missed 16 matches through injury, but even when fit he's not a reliable goal-scorer having scored just 4 goals in 24 league appearances.\n\nKai Havertz has replaced Jesus as Arsenal's main striker during the second half of the season and the former Chelsea forward has 13 goals in all competitions so far. However, the Gunners are still looking to sign a new frontman this summer with Zirkzee a prime target.\n\nArsenal ready to spend big on Zirkzee\n\nArsenal, in the last few years, have not shied away from making significant investments in the transfer window and are ready to spend another \u00a351 million on Zirkzee this summer, as per GMS.\n\nThe ex-Bayern Munich striker has struck 12 times in the Italian top-flight this season but Arsenal have also been impressed by his work ethic and link-up play.\n\nThe Dutchman is paid \u00a319,000 per week at Bologna but he can expect a significant increase if he completes a move to Arsenal this summer. The Gunners should also have no problem meeting his reported \u00a351m asking price.\n\nArsenal have arguably lacked a clinical striker in the last two seasons so Arteta will hope Zirkzee if the man to help fire them to trophies if they manage to lure him to the Emirates Stadium this summer.\n\nZirkzee's arrival would put pressure on Jesus and we could see the Brazilian leaving Arsenal if a suitable offer arrived for his services.\n\nRelated TopicsArsenalJoshua ZirkzeeTransfer Rumours Home \" Arsenal \" Arsenal Transfer News \" Arsenal front-runners to sign Joshua Zirkzee from Bologna", "source": {"uri": "football-talk.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Football Talk | Premier League News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joshua_Zirkzee", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joshua Zirkzee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsenal_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Arsenal F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikel_Arteta", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mikel Arteta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "England national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serie_A", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Serie A"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A.C._Milan", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "A.C.

Mikel Arteta is keen to bring another top-class centre forward to his squad.\n\nReports from Italy last week suggested that the Gunners were in discussions with Zirkzee's agent, Kia Joorabchian, about a potential move. It's believed that Arsenal are prepared to offer a five-year contract and an annual salary of \u00a35million, on top of the \u00a351.6m they would pay to Bologna for Zirkzee's services.\n\nHowever, the Gunners are set to face hefty competition to sign Zirkzee this summer. Inter, already crowned Serie A champions, have their sights set on the talented Dutch striker.\n\nJavier Zanetti, Inter's vice-president and former right-back, has dropped hints that the Italian club are planning a move for Zirkzee. Speaking to Radio TV Serie A about a possible transfer, the Argentine described Zirkzee as \"a great champion\".\n\nZanetti said: \"We are talking about a young, talented, intelligent, physically very strong player. Someone like that would be useful to any great team aiming for important goals. Let's see... If the opportunity arises we can think about it. With Zirkzee, Lautaro [Martinez] and [Marcus] Thuram we would have a young and strong attack.

Dario Canovi, Motta's agent, lauded the ex-midfielder for his role in enhancing Zirkzee's game.\n\nSpeaking to MilanNews, he said: \"He has undoubtedly improved him, but I wouldn't even need to say it because the numbers before this year speak for themselves but above all the fact that the player himself recognised it.\n\n\"After [Marko] Arnautovic left, Thiago invested him with a great responsibility and made him grow faster. And when you play all the time, you gain experience.\"\n\nWith rumours swirling about a potential move to either AC Milan or Inter Milan, Canovi added: \"He is certainly ready for a great team. And he still has room for improvement. Price? The price is set by the market, so if there are clubs willing to pay a lot, then it's worth it.\n\n\"Otherwise his value will be that of the highest bidder.

The youngster has done quite well in his debut season, but he needs more support in the attack.\n\nIt will be interesting to see if Manchester United can secure an agreement with Bologna in the coming weeks.\n\nArsenal are hoping to bring in a quality attacker as well, and the 22-year-old could be an upgrade on Gabriel Jesus who has been quite underwhelming this season. Manchester United certainly have the financial resources to compete with Arsenal, but the Gunners will be able to provide him with Champions League football next season. That could be a defining factor when it comes to attracting quality players.\n\nZirkzee will want to compete at the highest level and he might fancy a switch to a Champions League club next season.\n\nIt has been a disappointing season for Manchester United so far and they could easily miss out on European football altogether. It remains to be seen whether they can plug the gaps in their squad during the summer transfer window and bounce back strongly. A club of their stature should be competing in the Champions League regularly and fighting for trophies.", "source": {"uri": "caughtoffside.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CaughtOffside"}, "authors": [{"uri": "saikat_chatterjee@caughtoffside.com", "name": "Saikat Chatterjee", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joshua_Zirkzee", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joshua Zirkzee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Manchester United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bologna", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bologna"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bologna"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsenal_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Arsenal F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Denmark national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabriel_Jesus", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gabriel Jesus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "UEFA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer_window", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Transfer window"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Champions League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/UEFA", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/UEFA", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Skittles", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Skittles", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://icdn.caughtoffside.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/mikel-arteta-arsenal-erik-ten-hag-manchester-united.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541023", "eventUri": "eng-9541023", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3960784313725489, "wgt": 171, "relevance": 1}

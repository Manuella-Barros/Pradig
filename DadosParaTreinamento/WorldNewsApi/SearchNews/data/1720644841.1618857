{"id": 231298166, "title": "Summer books 2024: It\u2019s summertime and the reading\u2019s easy. Or epic. Choose your own adventure.", "text": "One strategy for summer reading \u2014 and yes, there are strategies \u2014 is to begin a project. Dabble in short punchy books, but devote the season to an epic. You get three months. I read \u201cThe Lord of the Rings\u201d this way, one installment a summer, for years. Now I\u2019m picking through Robert Caro\u2019s (still unfinished) Lyndon Johnson biography this way. Another strategy: Give yourself a quasi-degree in something very specific. Read the complete short stories of the late Alice Munro. The crime novels of Stephen King. Or underrated Penguin Classics: This summer offers a couple of fresh contenders \u2014 Harry Crews\u2019 \u201cThe Knockout Artist\u201d (about a boxer with a talent for knocking himself out), and \u201cA Last Supper of Queer Apostles,\u201d unclassifiable writing about being gay under a dictatorship, by Chilean legend Pedro Lemebel. You\u2019ll clip right along. Same goes for an excellent new edition of a monster: The Folio Society\u2019s wonderful \u201cJonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell,\u201d Susanna Clarke\u2019s contemporary classic about magicians in 19th century England. As a single adventure, it was an 800-plus page cinderblock in 2004. Folio divides all of that into a much brisker trilogy, as it should have been, ideal for devouring in adult-size chunks that you can pass along to a precocious child or spouse, while continuing yourself. As for the rest of you who just want a new mystery or history for the backyard, this summer is overstocked, even more so than the coming fall season. Yes, I read all of these; now get started. No-guilt beach reads: One of the great American mystery series continues with \u201cFarewell, Amethystine,\u201d Walter Mosley\u2019s 16th novel about Los Angeles detective Easy Rawlins. This one finds him in 1970, tracking an ex-husband, navigating gender upheaval. \u201cThe Sicilian Inheritance,\u201d by airport favorite Jo Piazza, nails a clever twist on a contemporary cliche: Newly single American woman moves to Italy, discovers herself. The twist \u2014 she\u2019s pulled into ugly family business \u2014 plays like a Palermo breeze. You got the top pulled down and radio on, baby: \u201cTraveling: On the Path of Joni Mitchell\u201d (June 11) is the best kind of summer bio. It\u2019s too critical and wandering to read like hero worship. NPR\u2019s Ann Powers, among the smartest of music critics, captures the restlessness of a Mitchell album, walking through her catalog with eyes and ears open for both unease and transcendence. \u201cHip-Hop is History\u201d (June 11) nails a similar feeling: It\u2019s less like a timeline than a long hang with the Roots\u2019 Questlove, who digs through the classics, offering reminiscence and discernment. Family time: \u2018Tis the season for other people\u2019s problems. \u201cSame as It Ever Was\u201d (June 18), by Oak Park native Claire Lombardo (\u201cThe Most Fun We Ever Had\u201d), and \u201cLong Island Compromise\u201d (July 9) by Taffy Brodesser-Akner (\u201cFleishman Is in Trouble\u201d), check a lot of boxes \u2014 relatable but never dull, reliably bonkers family, funny. But they\u2019re also breezy satires of privilege without sacrificing gravitas. Lombardo hems with modesty to the way minor breaks in routine spiral into epic crisis. Brodesser-Akner, who twists her knife with more relish, begins with actual crisis (a mysterious kidnapping and release), then leaps to the surprising ways it stamps fear into each member of the wealthy family. For austerity: \u201cThis Strange Eventful History,\u201d Claire Messud\u2019s somewhat autobiographical saga about several generations of a French family, severed from each other during World War II, and the way time and distance become inevitable. Tales of future past: \u201cWhat the Wild Sea Can Be: The Future of the World\u2019s Ocean\u201d (July 16), by Helen Scales, a marine biologist who doesn\u2019t write like one. Here is a clear-eyed survey of what ails ocean life, shaped by Scales\u2019s own experience and a bracing look at what\u2019s being done. For something completely different: \u201cThe Book of Elsewhere\u201d (July 23) is not quite science fiction, or fantasy, but as hard to pin down as you might expect a book authored by British surrealist China Mi\u00e9ville and Keanu Reeves. It\u2019s also fun, a novel-length continuation of Reeves\u2019s hot comic book, \u201cBRZRKR,\u201d a kind of Conan the Barbarian tale with black helicopters. Rebel yells: \u201cNat Turner, Black Prophet: A Visionary History\u201d (Aug. 13) begins with what you (might) know: In 1831, an enslaved preacher named Nat Turner led an uprising that was inevitably quashed, yet promised more to come. The late historian Anthony E. Kaye, with Gregory P. Downs, retells this in a fascinating new way, centering Turner\u2019s conviction that he was a vessel of God. \u201cNight Flyer: Harriet Tubman and the Faith Dreams of a Free People\u201d (June 18), by National Book Award-winner Tiya Miles, takes a similar approach to a more familiar American hero: It focuses on Tubman as a spiritual leader and self-taught ecologist. It\u2019s the lyrical biography we\u2019ll need before Tubman \u2014 already more myth than person \u2014 begins gracing the $20 bill, starting in 2030. Cruel summer: Personally, it\u2019s not summer unless I stretch out with a new Stephen King, and if that sounds familiar: \u201cYou Like It Darker,\u201d his latest collection of stories, is among his smartest, yet tipping toward crime tales and the slightly paranormal. The centerpiece, \u201cDanny Coughlin\u2019s Bad Dream,\u201d is a stealth, 140-page mystery novel tucked beside a \u201cCujo\u201d postscript and the gorgeous \u201cAnswer Man,\u201d a late-career classic. For best results: Follow with Harlan Ellison\u2019s \u201cGreatest Hits,\u201d a new compilation of vintage tales that shaped sci-fi and horror, inspiring King and Neil Gaiman (who writes the forward). Sentient AI, dystopias, alien copulation, evil twins \u2026 Two absorbing sports books that aren\u2019t actually about sports: Joseph O\u2019Neill\u2019s \u201cGodwin\u201d \u2014 like his celebrated 2008 novel \u201cNetherland\u201d \u2014 defies quick description. It reads like a fable, opening with the corporate chill of a Pittsburgh office then travels to suburbs of London and soccer fields of Africa. It follows the story of a soccer agent who talks his estranged brother into finding a soccer phenom. \u201cCharlie Hustle: The Rise and Fall of Pete Rose, and the Last Glory Days of Baseball,\u201d by former Chicago journalist Keith O\u2019Brien, would make a nice double-header: It\u2019s not biography but taxonomy, a pungent epic about hubris and, in the figure of the disgraced Cincinnati Red, moral vacancy. It\u2019s not the heat; it\u2019s the brimstone: \u201cCraft: Stories I Wrote for the Devil\u201d (June 18), by Chicago-based Ananda Lima has an eye-catching premise \u2014 you\u2019re reading a collection of stories by the author following a one-night stand with Satan \u2014 so clever, it\u2019s a relief to report that\u2019s merely the hook for a substantive first book of major confidence, and belly laughs. Speak of the devil: Randall Sullivan\u2019s \u201cThe Devil\u2019s Best Trick: How the Face of Evil Disappeared\u201d and Ed Simon\u2019s \u201cDevil\u2019s Contract: The History of the Faustian Bargain\u201d (July 9) are ideal histories for the warmest weeks, cultural spelunkings into our centuries-old need to portray unencumbered immorality, from Nathaniel Hawthorne to the \u201880s Satanic Panic. One lit life: \u201cNorman Maclean: A Life of Letters and Rivers\u201d is part author bio, part literary memoir, told by Rebecca McCarthy, a former student of Maclean who kept a lifelong friendship with the Hyde Park legend, a beloved professor at University of Chicago who \u2014 famously, very late in life \u2014 wrote \u201cA River Runs Through It.\u201d Just a dream and the wind to carry me: It\u2019s hard to relay how exhilarating, and unsettling, being a speck on the ocean is, with no other specks in sight, horizon to horizon. \u201cSailing Alone: A Surprising History of Isolation and Survival at Sea,\u201d by maritime historian Richard J. King, gathers dizzying case studies of what drives people to do this, improvising steering systems for sleeping, talking to dolphins out of lonliness. Consider the complicated hero at the heart of Hampton Sides\u2019 excellent best-seller, \u201cThe Wide Wide Sea: Imperial Ambition, First Contact and the Fateful Final Voyage of Captain James Cook.\u201d Cook represented the best of global exploration. Until he represented the worst. As forward-thinking as he was with native cultures, he died on a beach in Hawaii, stoned by its people. Sides\u2019s compulsively readable 16th-century history is about the gulf between decency and a boss\u2019s orders. Summer ennui: If you have read Rachel Cusk \u2014 and if you haven\u2019t, there\u2019s your summer reading list \u2014 you\u2019re safe to assume her latest novel about creative life, \u201cParade\u201d (June 18), starts with a darkly funny come-on (an artist paints a portrait of his wife, makes it ugly and it sells), only to end up very far afield. \u201cFire Exit,\u201d the lacerating debut novel by Morgan Talty, whose story set \u201cNight of the Living Rez\u201d was a 2022 critical smash, delves again into the families in a Native American community, for a tale of a man haunted by descendants present and just out of reach. Speaking of haunting: \u201cWe Burn Daylight\u201d (July 30), by the underrated novelist Bret Anthony Johnston (\u201cRemember Me Like This\u201d) delivers another thriller less visceral than traumatic: The story of a cult in Waco, Texas, about to be taken by law enforcement, and the drama that unfolds inside and out. (Any similarities to Branch Davidians are purely intentional.) Rethinking summer programming: \u201cSomething authentic, buried beneath something fake.\u201d That\u2019s how New Yorker TV writer Emily Nussbaum perfectly explains the allure of both \u201cThe Bachelor\u201d and \u201cCandid Camera\u201d in \u201cCue the Sun! The Invention of Reality TV\u201d (June 25). She works magic, walking on that wavering line between fandom and disgust but never scolding. \u201cThe Future Was Now: Madmen, Mavericks, and the Epic Sci-Fi Summer of 1982\u201d (July 30), by \u201cCaddyshack\u201d historian Chris Nashawaty, begins with the maxim \u201cFilm critics get it wrong all the time,\u201d then proves it. This is Gen-X catnip, a backstage rewind through a momentous movie summer that delivered us \u201cBlade Runner,\u201d \u201cThe Thing,\u201d \u201cE.T.,\u201d \u201cThe Road Warrior\u201d and far more. Summertime sadness: \u201cChallenger: A True Story of Heroism and Disaster on the Edge of Space,\u201d by Adam Higginbotham \u2014 whose remarkable \u201cMidnight in Chernobyl\u201d established him as the go-to narrator of tragedies \u2014 reads like a backward mystery, starting with the Space Shuttle explosion in 1986, then unwinding through institutional arrogance and the queasy assumption of \u201cacceptable risk\u201d that dooms even the best intentions. Eliza Griswold\u2019s equally immersive \u201cCircle of Hope: A Reckoning with Love, Power and Justice in an American Church\u201d (Aug. 6) documents the conflicts and frayed idealism that pulled a Philadelphia church apart over 30 years, but Griswold \u2014 whose \u201cAmity and Prosperity\u201d won the nonfiction Pulitzer in 2019 \u2014 grounds much of the story in old-fashioned fly-on-the-wall reporting, tagging along until she\u2019s invisible. Summer Art Fare: At some point this summer, you may duck into the cool marble halls of a museum. \u201cFootnotes from the Most Fascinating Museums,\u201d by New Yorker cartoonist Bob Eckstein, is a lovely wish list of American options, dreamily illustrated, full of histories of the classics (the Art Institute of Chicago), but also battleship museums, Kentucky\u2019s Noah\u2019s Ark, the Rothko Chapel in Texas \u2026 \u201cThe Work of Art: How Something Comes From Nothing,\u201d by former New York magazine editor Adam Moss, should get you through the rest of summer. Here is a brick of insight into that creative purgatory called the process, featuring notebook scribbles, sketches and chats with Sofia Coppola, Gay Talese, Suzan-Lori Parks and many more artists in far-flung fields. \u201cDinosaurs at the Dinner Party\u201d (Aug. 6) could be an engrossing anecdote from those books, the story of why history museums are now occupied by creatures none of us have seen. It follows the accidental discoveries that led to piecing together the first dinosaur skeletons, and what that meant for naturalists and clergy alike. Election-year reading that isn\u2019t a chore: What ails us, Frank Bruni writes in \u201cThe Age of Grievance,\u201d isn\u2019t grievance \u2014 this is a nation, of course, founded on the stuff. But rather, \u201ca manner of individualism often indistinguishable from narcissism,\u201d fostering \u201ca violent rupture of our national psyche.\u201d It\u2019s an illuminating rant about humility, and one that echoes throughout \u201cThe Playbook: A Story of Theater, Democracy and the Making of a Culture War,\u201d by James Shapiro. Here, the history is the birth and death of the New Deal\u2019s Federal Theatre Project, and the question of whether a country so fractious can sustain a national theater. Each chapter, often centered on loathsome political hearings, is part rousing, part enraging. Dipping into the deep end: One of the year\u2019s best books is \u201cI Just Keep Talking: A Life in Essays\u201d by Nell Irvin Painter, a digressive, accessible summer course on visual aesthetics (Black Power art), Southern history, Black figures both well-known (Sojourner Truth) and obscure (Alma Thomas), but primarily, the art of writing a pointed essay. \u201cThe Art of Dying: Writings 2019-2022\u201d collects the final 46 stories by late New Yorker critic Peter Schjeldahl, from his 2019 essay about learning he had advanced lung cancer to his final piece on German photographer Wolfgang Tillmans. It\u2019s another art course in a book (with a bonus introduction by Schjeldahl pal Steve Martin). For a decidedly more fun essay: \u201cAny Person Is the Only Self\u201d (June 11), by Elisa Gabbert, which collects her thoughts on Sylvia Plath, Motley Crue, \u201cPoint Break,\u201d Proust \u2026 I know what you read this summer: Gabino Iglesias, whose \u201cThe Devil Takes You Home\u201d was one of the best books of 2022, summons similar darkness for \u201cHouse of Bone and Rain\u201d (Aug. 6), returning the author to his native Puerto Rico for more gangs, bad weather and traditions that slowly draw in creepy crawlies. Iglesias is where Paul Tremblay (\u201cCabin at the End of the World\u201d) was a few years ago. \u201cHorror Movie\u201d (June 11), Tremblay\u2019s latest, is a new jewel, the story of a cursed film, alternating between the screenplay and \u201cthe unreality of the entertainment ecosystem\u201d that worships it. (Read before the inevitable horror movie of \u201cHorror Movie.\u201d) Summer sleepers: \u201cThe Swans of Harlem\u201d tells a vibrant, lovingly researched group biography of the 152nd Street Black Ballet Legacy Council, the five Black ballerinas who, at the peak of the civil rights movement, brought new urgency to a segregated art form. \u201cWhen Women Ran Fifth Avenue\u201d is another unheralded history, a fascinating excavation of the midcentury women \u2014 including two Chicagoans, Dorothy Shaver and Geraldine Stutz \u2014 whose designs and ideas reinvented American department stores and consumer fashion. In each of these books, a set of women is assembling a world they want. Bringing that history into today: In \u201cRebel Girl: My Life as a Feminist Punk,\u201d Kathleen Hanna of Le Tigre and Bikini Kil writes about the grassroots Riot Grrrl movement and her fidelity to a low-fi, DIY independent music scene with bluntness, stumbling through the \u201890s, loaded with exclusionary politics and hope. cborrelli@chicagotribune.com", "summary": "From beach reads and sports books to histories and culture war, our 44 titles for the next three months.

In an Instagram post, she wrote: \u201cSadly, I\u2019m not going to be on my breakfast show this weekend as I\u2019ve had to have an unexpected medical procedure. \u201cAll is well and I hope after some rest I\u2019ll be back in the hot seat next weekend.\u201d In the caption, she added: \u201cI\u2019ll be back soon\u201d and thanked Good Morning Britain presenter Hawkins for \u201cstepping in last minute\u201d.

You come first Telly is just telly. Sending huge love and respect xxx\u201d Piper\u2019s hour-long weekend breakfast show features celebrity guests and topical discussions. In the opening of Saturday\u2019s show, Hawkins said: \u201cKatie can\u2019t be here this morning but she has entrusted me to look after the show and to make sure you all at home still have your Saturday fix of fun and positivity.\u201d The show featured guests including Gladiators star Livi Sheldon, known as Diamond on the show, and comedian Sophie Duker. After surviving an acid attack at the age of 24, former model Piper has been open about her journey dealing with the subsequent complications and made a Channel 4 documentary in 2009 called Katie: My Beautiful Face. She was left partially blind, with severe scarring to her face, chest, neck, arm and hands, after sulphuric acid was thrown in her face. She founded the Katie Piper Foundation a few months after the documentary aired to support burns victims and has undergone more than 250 operations over the past decade. The mother of two also hosted a podcast, Katie Piper\u2019s Extraordinary People, in which she chatted with inspirational people who have turned adversity into positivity, and is also a panellist on ITV\u2019s Loose Women. In 2021, she was made an OBE in the Queen\u2019s New Year Honours list for her services to charity and victims of burns and other disfigurement injuries.", "summary": "<p>Katie Piper has been forced to pull out of her morning show this weekend due to an \u201cunexpected medical procedure\u201d.</p>", "url": "https://www.independent.ie/style/celebrity/celebrity-news/katie-piper-forced-to-pull-out-of-itv-show-for-unexpected-medical-procedure/a1306009343.html", "image": "https://focus.independent.ie/thumbor/MWsqrbKGx5_s9_bXEdnD7O_XJa8=/0x447:1819x1659/550x550/prod-mh-ireland/d0d0b635-713f-4b3f-b809-3ee22cc93d69/1b0d0aab-e3c2-4172-be3b-956fc03bc1d0/2.76016075.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 12:35:05", "author": "Naomi Clarke, Pa Senior Entertainment Reporter", "authors": ["Naomi Clarke, Pa Senior Entertainment Reporter"], "language": "en", "source_country": "ie", "sentiment": -0.1}

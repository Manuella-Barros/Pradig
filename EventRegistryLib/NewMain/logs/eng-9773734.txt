She has been working at PEOPLE since 2023. Her work has previously appeared on Variety, The New York Post, and The Wrap.\n\nOrioles catcher James McCann was hit in the face by a fastball during the Monday, July 29, game between Baltimore Orioles and Toronto Blue Jays.\n\nDuring the first inning, Blue Jays rookie Yariel Rodriguez pitched a 95 miles per hour fastball directly at the Orioles backup catcher's head. The fastball knocked off McCann's helmet and clipped his face. McCann, 34, immediately dropped to the ground and clenched his nose. He was examined at the plate by head athletic trainer Brian Ebel.\n\nMcCann was still bleeding as he headed to first base but was sent to the dugout by team manager Brandon Hyde for further treatment. While McCann was being treated, Toronto manager John Schneider removed Rodriguez from the game.\n\nDue to the accident, a brief delay occurred, allowing McCann to receive treatment and Toronto pitcher Brandon Eisert to warm up. However, once the game was ready to resume, McCann stopped bleeding and returned to the field as a runner at first base.\n\nLater in the game, McCann received a standing ovation once he went to bat with two outs in the third inning.\n\nThe PEOPLE Puzzler crossword is here! How quickly can you solve it? Play now!\n\nTeam manager Hyde confirmed that McCann did not have head trauma or an eye injury, per ESPN. Although Hyde said, he is \"suspecting [McCann] has a broken nose.\"\n\n\"All signs right now are he dodged a major bullet,\" he said.\n\n\"That was a scary scene. It just shows you how tough that guy is,\" Hyde added. \"He was obviously dazed and the blood wasn't stopping.\"\n\nFollowing the game, in which the Orioles were victorious with an 11-5 win over Toronto, McCann spoke to The Baltimore Banner, and candidly said the whole event \"stinks.\"\n\n\"I take a lot of pride in being tough,\" he said. \"And I do everything I can to stay on the field, and that's what I was able to do today.\"\n\nThe MLB veteran said the experience \"at first it was more scary than anything.\" He continued, \"It's like taking a pretty good punch with a good right hook I guess.

The fastball knocked off McCann's helmet and clipped his face. McCann, 34, immediately dropped to the ground and clenched his nose. He was examined at the plate by head athletic trainer Brian Ebel.\n\nMcCann was still bleeding as he headed to first base but was sent to the dugout by team manager Brandon Hyde for further treatment. While McCann was being treated, Toronto manager John Schneider removed Rodriguez from the game.\n\nDue to the accident, a brief delay occurred, allowing McCann to receive treatment and Toronto pitcher Brandon Eisert to warm up. However, once the game was ready to resume, McCann stopped bleeding and returned to the field as a runner at first base.\n\nLater in the game, McCann received a standing ovation once he went to bat with two outs in the third inning.\n\nRelated: New York Yankees Star Hit in the Face by 91 Miles Per Hour Fastball -- and Scores a Run\n\nThe PEOPLE Puzzler crossword is here!

It struck his nose and the bill of his helmet, spinning him facedown in the dirt at Camden Yards, and Orioles head athletic trainer Brian Abel raced out to administer aid, pressing a towel to his face.\n\nThe wayward fastball ended Rodriguez's Monday after a grim 43-pitch outing in which he recorded two outs, walked four and struck McCann with a pitch. Yet McCann seemed determined to avoid a worst-case scenario.\n\nStarting catcher Adley Rutschman was out of the Game 1 lineup and expected to catch Game 2. McCann leaving the game and leaving Rutschman with 17 innings to catch was a suboptimal option, unless the Orioles activated a catcher between games of the doubleheader.\n\nSo after McCann got up, touched first base and drove in the Orioles' fourth run with the hit-by-pitch, the Blue Jays summoned reliever Brandon Eisert.

The Blue Jays were able to get out of the inning down 4-0.\n\nDespite taking the hit to the face, McCann was right back up to the plate on his next at bat in the third. Although he grounded out there, he would later record a single in the fifth inning and scored a run after a homer from Anthony Santander.\n\nOverall, McCann is 1-for-3 at the plate on the day with the one RBI he recorded off the hit by pitch. The Orioles are currently holding an 11-4 advantage entering the ninth inning and can secure a win with three more outs.\n\nIf they do, they'll improve their record to 63-43, good for first place in the AL East.

Everyone watching feared serious injury for the 11-year veteran as he lay face-down in the dirt while trainers attended to him. Blood could be seen pouring from his nose as he attempted to get up.\n\nAmazingly, McCann wouldn't leave the game despite the continued bleeding from his nose which stained his jersey and required gauze stuffed up his nostrils. Broadcasters and fans in the stands rightfully assumed that McCann would leave the game from there. Walking to first base and touching it was surely a show of defiance or maybe a rules formality.\n\nBut no. McCann went back into the clubhouse to change into a clean jersey and insisted on staying in the game. Presumably, trainers checked him for further injury or concussion symptoms. However, he kept playing at the most grueling position in baseball.\n\nThat ended a miserable day for Rodr\u00edguez. (OK, it likely wasn't as painful as McCann's.) The rookie walked the first three batters he faced to load the bases and gave up two runs on a single and groundout. Two more batters reached base on a catcher's interference call and a walk before Rodr\u00edguez hit McCann.\n\nTwenty-three of Rodr\u00edguez's 43 pitches missed the strike zone. He lasted 2/3 of an inning, allowing four runs (three earned) on one hit and four walks. In 10 starts, the 27-year-old has a 4.31 ERA with 43 strikeouts, 23 walks and 31 hits allowed in 39 2/3 innings.\n\nBy the way, McCann was awarded an RBI for getting hit by a pitch, driving in Ryan Mountcastle to give Baltimore a 4-0 lead. He went on to hit a bloop single in the fifth inning and came around to score on a home run by Anthony Santander.\n\nFollowing the game, O's manager Brandon Hyde called the incident \"a scary scene\" that showed how tough McCann is. Yet he took heavy criticism for not taking McCann out, even if tests indicate that no serious injury was sustained.\n\n\"He is incredibly, incredibly tough,\" said Hyde. \"Catches eight more innings after that. He doesn't have a head or eye trauma or injury. We're suspecting it's a broken nose. He's going to get a CT scan tomorrow. All signs right now are we dodged a major bullet.\"\n\nPitcher Zach Eflin, just acquired from the Tampa Bay Rays, got the win despite giving up 10 hits and three runs with seven strikeouts in six innings.\n\nMonday afternoon's game was the first of a doubleheader. McCann was not in the lineup for Game 2 with Adley Rutschman behind the plate at catcher.", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_McCann_(baseball)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "James McCann (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francisco_Rodr\u00edguez_(Venezuelan_pitcher)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Francisco Rodr\u00edguez (Venezuelan pitcher)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Batting average (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore_Orioles", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Baltimore Orioles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fastball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fastball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto_Blue_Jays", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Toronto Blue Jays"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Catcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interference_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Interference (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concussion", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Concussion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Out_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Out (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_zone", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Strike zone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_baseman", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "First baseman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_on_balls", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Base on balls"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_batted_in", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Run batted in"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Mountcastle", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ryan Mountcastle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adley_Rutschman", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Adley Rutschman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandon_Hyde", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brandon Hyde"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zach_Eflin", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Zach Eflin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Santander", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Santander"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doubleheader_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Doubleheader (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hit_by_pitch", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hit by pitch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampa_Bay_Rays", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tampa Bay Rays"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manager (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitcher", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pitcher"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Baltimore"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Baltimore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Instruction", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Instruction", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/WsF.bq.4QGo8jLdWCXrwfg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2024-07/f505da30-4e01-11ef-bbff-3d495e6f9ad7", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9773734", "eventUri": "eng-9773734", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.04313725490196085, "wgt": 193, "relevance": 1}

In the bottom of the first inning, McCann took a 94.6 mph fastball to the face from Toronto Blue Jays righty Yariel Rodr\u00edguez and was immediately bloodied, yet he remained in the game and caught all nine innings.\n\n\"He is incredibly, incredibly tough,\" O's manager Brandon Hyde said after the game (via MASN Sports). \"Catches eight more innings after that. He doesn't have a head or eye trauma or injury. We're suspecting it's a broken nose. He's going to get a CT scan tomorrow. All signs right now are we dodged a major bullet.\"\n\nTrainer Brian Ebel was eventually able to stop the bleeding after a lengthy delay. McCann changed his blood-soaked jersey, then took his base to loud cheers from what was a sparse crowd at Camden Yards for the first game of a doubleheader (BAL 11, TOR 5). His eye was swollen later in the game.\n\nHere is the hit-by-pitch:\n\nThe Orioles have two catchers on the roster -- McCann and franchise cornerstone Adley Rutschman -- and McCann leaving the first game in the first inning would have forced Rutschman to catch almost two full games. Either that, or the O's would have had to call up a third catcher, which might have been impossible on such short notice.\n\nMcCann's toughness was appreciated by Orioles righty Tyler Wells, who is currently rehabbing from season-ending elbow surgery.\n\nThis is the second time in a month an Orioles player was hit in the head with a pitch. On July 12, outfielder Heston Kjerstad was hit in the head by a pitch from New York Yankees closer Clay Holmes. Kjerstad was placed on the concussion list and missed eight days.\n\nMcCann, 34, went 1 for 3 with the hit-by-pitch in Monday's game. He's hitting .218/.273/.324 as Ruthschman's veteran backup. McCann is in the final year of the four-year, $40.6 million contract he signed with the New York Mets in December 2020. The Mets are paying the majority of his salary.\n\nThe win in the first game of Monday's doubleheader improved the O's to 63-43.

The 34-year-old catcher was up to bat with the bases loaded when he was hit.\n\nIn the video, Rodriguez can be seen throwing the ball, which curves towards McCann's face, knocking off his helmet and sending him immediately down to the ground as pained \"oh's\" can be heard from the crowd.\n\nThe camera then pans to McCann face down on the ground with his hands covering his face.

McCann's injury gave the team the lead with a score of 4-0 in the first inning.

Baseball Player Takes 95MPH Fastball To The Face", "body": "A baseball player took a 95MPH fastball to the face! To make the story even more crazy, he ended up staying in the game!\n\nCan you imagine getting hit in the face by a 95MPH fastball? It would be excruciating! Baseball is supposed to be one of the less violent sports, but you wouldn't know that after seeing this video.\n\nBaseball Player Hit By 95MPH Fastball In The Face\n\nIt happened to James McCann, who plays catcher for the Baltimore Orioles. During an at-bat against the Toronto Blue Jays at Camden Yards, McCann took a fastball to the face from pitcher Yariel Rodriguez. A ball got away from Rodriguez and hit McCann in the face! Even a helmet can save you when the ball comes flying directly at your face. See the video shared by Rob Friedman on X (formerly Twitter) below.\n\nThankfully, McCann was able to get back on his feet, addressed the injury with some gauze to control the bleeding, and got back in the game. He didn't miss a second of action! How does that happen after getting a fastball to the face? Baseball players are tougher than they get credit for. Baltimore would go on to win the first game of the double header against the Blue Jays 11-5.\n\nStill not sure how bad the injury is and what the details are but he seems to be doing okay! Looks like a heavyweight fighter after taking the fastball to the face. That would have to be one of the most painful things ever. Plus, it's coming at you so fast you pretty much have no time to react, prepare, or get out of the way. See what he had to say about the incident after the game below.\n\nJames McCann Hit By Fastball In The Face\n\nIt's great to see him get right back up after that. You can suffer some serious injuries taking a fastball to the face. It can easily break your nose and could easily damage eyeballs or give you a concussion. As a catcher, he might be most prepared for it of any position. They seem to take a beating every game. It's their job to sit (er, crouch?) there and receive pitches that can reach speeds more than 100 miles per hour. It takes a tough individual to do that! That seems to fit McCann's description.\n\nMcCann has had a solid MLB career. In addition to the Baltimore Orioles, he's played for the Detroit Tigers, Chicago White Sox, and New York Mets.

To the surprise of most, he stayed in the game.\n\nMcCann likened the experience to getting punched in the face, when talking with reporters postgame on July 29.\n\n\"I think, at first, it's more scary than anything,\" McCann said, according to Roch Kubatko of MASN Sports. \"It's like taking a pretty good punch, a pretty good right hook, I guess. Now, it's just the swelling that's kind of set in and hard to see a little bit.\"\n\nThe 11-year-veteran remained in the game once he got the bleeding to stop.\n\nAnd in the bottom of the fifth inning he sent a single to right field. Anthony Santander followed him up with a 2-run shot to give the Orioles a 10-3 lead.\n\nOn batting with a swollen eye, McCann credited divine intervention.\n\n\"It was kind of one of those things where I felt like if I could get the blood to stop flowing, then I could stay in the game, and that's what we were able to do, for the most part,\" McCann continued. \"...God was helping me for sure. It's really tough to see and thankful I was able to come through with a knock and be able to stay in there.\"\n\nBaltimore won the first game 11-5 before entering a delay for game two. It will take much stranger things happening in the second half of the doubleheader to remove McCann's stamp on the series in the history books.\n\nIn an interview after the win, skipper Brandon Hyde told reporters that McCann avoided a serious injury.\n\n\"That was a scary scene and just shows you how tough that guy is,\" Hyde told reporters on July 29. \"To get hit like that, to have the blood not stop, coming out of his nose and his mouth, it seemed like he was fine. Just obviously dazed and the blood wasn't stopping. Just a really, really scary scene. He is incredibly, incredibly tough. He catches eight more innings after that. I'll give you a little update. He doesn't have head or eye trauma or injury.\"\n\nBut went on to say there's fear it's a broken nose.\n\nThat's certainly not a concussion or potentially worse injury to the head. But a broken bone isn't insignificant either.\n\nBaltimore struck a trade for Tampa Bay Rays starter Zach Eflin ahead of the July 30 trade deadline. He made his Orioles' debut in the first game of the doubleheader.\n\nHe pitched six innings against the Blue Jays, allowing a season-high 10 hits but also tying his season-high of 7 strikeouts.\n\nToronto scored 3 runs with Eflin on the mound. 71 of his 98 pitches were called strikes. He also became a big fan of McCann's, as he told reporters after the game.\n\n\"I don't think I've ever seen anything like that on a baseball field,\" Eflin said, according to Roch Kubatko of MASN Sports. \"I just became his probably No. 1 fan. To be able to go through that and stay in the game and show the grit and determination and competitiveness that he has, it's inspiring. That was awesome.\"\n\nHis new manager, Brandon Hyde, applauded his effort after the win.\n\n\"For him to pound the strike zone the way he did, give up the homer but a lot of singles,\" Hyde told reporters postgame. \"He's always going to be a ground ball away from a double play, and we've seen that a lot with him. Just a total pro effort knowing that we have a doubleheader, knowing that if he could give us six innings, that would be huge, and he went out and did that.\"\n\nBarring any other deals before the deadline, Eflin is set to play as the Orioles' third starter behind Corbin Burnes and Grayson Rodriguez. That's a postseason worthy one, two, three punch.", "source": {"uri": "heavy.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Heavy"}, "authors": [{"uri": "collin_loring@heavy.com", "name": "Collin Loring", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_McCann_(baseball)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "James McCann (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore_Orioles", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Baltimore Orioles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MASN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "MASN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Batting average (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandon_Hyde", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brandon Hyde"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Santander", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Santander"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_fielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Right fielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fastball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fastball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto_Blue_Jays", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Toronto Blue Jays"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Catcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Baltimore"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Baltimore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zach_Eflin", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Zach Eflin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doubleheader_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Doubleheader (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corbin_Burnes", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Corbin Burnes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_postseason", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball postseason"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_play", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Double play"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampa_Bay_Rays", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tampa Bay Rays"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manager (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concussion", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Concussion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batted_ball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Batted ball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_zone", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Strike zone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Adventure", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Adventure", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://heavy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-2164275232-e1722304572861.jpg?quality=65&strip=all&w=780", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9773734", "eventUri": "eng-9773734", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-29", "textStart": 306, "textEnd": 313, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-30", "textStart": 2259, "textEnd": 2266}], "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "wgt": 155, "relevance": 1}

Toronto's starter walked four, hit a batter, and allowed four runs in a horrific first inning he failed to complete. First baseman Justin Turner was pulled in the second because he'd been traded to Seattle. Five Jays pitchers allowed eleven runs on a whopping 187 pitches (not ideal in a doubleheader), and Jays hitters struck out seven times against O's newcomer Zach Eflin in six innings.\n\nAt three hours, 10 minutes, it was a long game, but it was all Orioles.\n\nWhy don't we start with that crazy first inning? The Orioles, after their recent slump, are trying to be more patient and selective at the plate, and Toronto's rookie starter Yariel Rodr\u00edguez helped them in this effort by completely losing control of the zone. He loaded the bases with walks to Colton Cowser, Anthony Santander and Gunnar Henderson before cleanup hitter Ryan Mountcastle knocked in a run with a single to center. Jordan Westburg cued a groundout the other way to make it 2-0, and after Cedric Mullins reached on catcher's interference, Ram\u00f3n Ur\u00edas delivered a pro at-bat to walk in the third run.\n\nThen, a shocking moment. As if the Toronto starter's day couldn't get any worse, Yariel Rodr\u00edguez pegged James McCann in the face with his 43rd pitch of the inning, a fastball. The catcher dropped to the turf, blood streaming from his nose. A 10-minute delay followed as a hushed Oriole Park watched trainer Brian Ebel try to plug McCann's nose and stop the bleeding. After some time, McCann, his jersey spattered with blood, started walking to first. Announcers Kevin Brown and Ben McDonald went, \"Oh my god, is this dude going to stay in the game?\"\n\nMcCann touched the first-base bag, then walked into the dugout, but it turns out he wasn't going anywhere. Instead Baltimore spruced him up with a clean jersey, two new nose plugs, and back out he went with his busted nose and eye swelling up. \"This is some Rocky stuff,\" said McDonald. \"James McCann should be in the NHL,\" agreed Brown. McCann would go on to catch a full nine innings. The legend of James McCann is growing. On Twitter, O's pitcher Tyler Wells wrote:\n\nOh yeah, right. The score was 4-0 and we were just through one inning.\n\nBaltimore kept pressing, with a run or more in the third, fourth, fifth and eight innings.\n\nIn the third, they'd make it 5-0 on a beautiful Jordan Westburg double and an Ur\u00edas groundout. In the fourth, Cowser, Henderson, and Mountcastle singled to load the bases, and Ryan O'Hearn made it 6-0 with a sac fly. Jordan Westburg hit another double, scoring Henderson. Behind him, Mountcastle got the send all the way from first, but the throw beat him, so the Orioles had to settle for \"just\" a 7-0 lead.\n\nNow let's talk a bit about Zach Eflin, acquired by Baltimore from the Tampa Bay Rays a few days ago. What did we learn about the Orioles' new righthander today? Well, he likes golf, guitar and fishing, has great command of the zone, and his pitches have a ton of movement.\n\nThe right hander's stats have dropped off from a 2023 when he finished sixth in the Cy Young voting, especially a 7.1 K/9 rate that's down a full two strikeouts from last year. But today, it didn't look like it, because Eflin whiffed seven in six innings, showing what seems to be swing-and-miss stuff, especially a cutter and sweeper with major horizontal arc. At one point, Eflin caught Toronto rookie Spencer Horowitz staring at a sinker that seemed to tuck inside on the left-handed batter, then back into the zone. Highly deceptive stuff.\n\nEflin really made just one mistake, in the fifth inning, when he allowed two singles, then hung a curveball-kind-of-thing to rookie Addison Barger, who made it 7-3 with his first career home run.\n\nBut there never was much suspense today. Just as soon as Toronto had closed the gap, the Orioles reopened it, courtesy of a Cedric Mullins double, a single by folk hero James McCann, a Cowser sac fly, and finally, Santander's 30th home run of the year. It was a no-doubter.\n\nSo, however, was Vlad Guerrero Jr.'s seventh-inning oppo-way home run off Keegan Akin, to make it 10-4. But once again, the O's made up the difference in the bottom half, when Ryan Mountcastle, Killer of Blue Jays, hit his own oppo-taco, a really impressive blast just inside of the right foul pole. Guerrero struck once more with a single off Burch Smith, who'd been pretty [fire emoji] to that point, showing a 97-mph fastball and a tricky cutter. That made it 11-5, but Smith shut the door and ended the game.\n\nThe heroics of James McCann, who caught nine innings with plugs in his nose and his left eye swelling shut, will get deservedly all the attention here, but there are a few more worthy Orioles performances to note. Tony Taters hitting his 30th tater counts. Cedric Mullins might be back, too, with a double, walk, run, and two great catches that he made look easy. Jordan Westburg hit three doubles in that quiet way he does. Newcomer Christian Pache got his first hit. Colton Cowser looks like a nice idea in the leadoff spot, going 1-for-2 with a walk and an RBI, plus two great catches in the third, which brought much mooing, including from one former Oriole.\n\nThe Orioles haven't always looked like a first-place team over a rough last two weeks. But with this afternoon's performance, steadied by a new starter and a veteran catcher, you start to feel like they're well on their way.\n\nNow, time for Game 2! Cade Povich makes his eighth start against longman Bowden Francis. Good luck, rook.", "source": {"uri": "camdenchat.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Camden Chat"}, "authors": [{"uri": "andrea_sk@camdenchat.com", "name": "Andrea Sk", "type": "author", "isAgency":

A 95 mph fastball thrown by pitcher Yariel Rodr\u00edguez unexpectedly hit McCann in the face, causing bleeding from his nose and mouth.\n\nDespite the gory injury, McCann returned to the game after using gauze to stop the bleeding. What's truly admirable is that he continued to play for eight more innings. Such determination demonstrates remarkable toughness and dedication to the sport.\n\nNaturally, MLB fans were impressed by McCann's resilience and took to X, to praise his courage. One fan compared the Orioles catcher's resilience to the NHL players' ruggedness while another chimed in saying how James is \"toughness personified.\"\n\nA third fan complimented McCann's toughness and did not hesitate to admit that in such a scenario, he would have left the field immediately.\n\nA fourth fan lauded McCann as a leader and how his never-say-die attitude is vital for the team.\n\nA separate fan commented, \"He's a Razorback! DVH really toughens them up \" in reference to McCann's alma mater, the University of Arkansas, and coach Dave Van Horn's reputation for fostering resilience in his players.\n\nHaving said that, the Blue Jays and the Orioles recently faced off in a doubleheader. The teams split the games, with the Blue Jays winning 8-4 and the Orioles taking the first game.\n\nLooking ahead to the Baltimore Orioles' ongoing season prospects, there is optimism for a playoff campaign. However, bolstering their pitching rotation will be crucial for their goal of clinching a World Series title.\n\nAs the trade deadline approaches, the Orioles are in a critical situation. Despite welcoming Zach Eflin to their pitching rotation, there is still a pressing need for pitching support.\n\nThe situation is complicated by their reluctance to part with top prospect Jackson Holliday, which could impact the Orioles' chances of winning the World Series.\n\nTarik Skubal, the standout pitcher for the Detroit Tigers and a strong contender for the AL Cy Young award, is seen as a potential target. However, acquiring Skubal would likely require including Holliday in the trade, who remains highly regarded despite recent performance setbacks.\n\nAdditionally, the Orioles' long-term planning strategy and careful spending habits further complicate matters. While acquiring Skubal could enhance their prospects of success, it comes with the risk of jeopardizing long-term stability. Therefore, this trade deadline will test Baltimore's readiness to go all-in for a championship or stick to its long-term strategy.", "source": {"uri": "thesportsrush.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The SportsRush"}, "authors": [{"uri": "oindrila_chowdhury@thesportsrush.com", "name": "Oindrila Chowdhury", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_McCann_(baseball)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "James McCann (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore_Orioles", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Baltimore Orioles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto_Blue_Jays", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Toronto Blue Jays"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Catcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francisco_Rodr\u00edguez_(Venezuelan_pitcher)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Francisco Rodr\u00edguez (Venezuelan pitcher)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fastball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fastball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitcher", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pitcher"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Van_Horn", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dave Van Horn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doubleheader_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Doubleheader (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Arkansas", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "University of Arkansas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hockey_League", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Hockey League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Series", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World Series"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starting_pitcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Starting pitcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarik_Skubal", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tarik Skubal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zach_Eflin", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Zach Eflin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit_Tigers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Detroit Tigers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cy_Young_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cy Young Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Baltimore"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Baltimore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Instruction", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Instruction", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://cdn-wp.thesportsrush.com/2024/07/c34e4243-vs-2024-07-30t162502.494.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9773734", "eventUri": "eng-9773734", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3098039215686275, "wgt": 136, "relevance": 1}

We have had really, really positive comments from parents and those that don't necessarily need the free lunches. They are helping us by contributing the funds that enable us to do this.\"\n\nIt's been three months since the caf\u00e9 opened, and Mr McCann said he was surprised and delighted with how the initiative has been received.\n\n\"When we moved in, it was just an empty shell of a retail unit with nothing in there,\" he said. \"We created a coffee shop in 30 days spending just \u00a3300, a massive challenge in itself.\n\n\"The coffee shop has essentially been filled by the community for the community and everything we do is about supporting people locally.\"\n\nMr McCann says he had been struggling with his mental health, even when he had a following of around two million people on social media channels, but realising the purpose of life is having a life of purpose changed his view.\n\n\"We had that spray painted on the wall in the coffee shop,\" he said.\n\n\"When I was younger, me and my family relied on food banks and we struggled quite badly from a financial perspective.\n\n\"What I want to try and do is help people going through the same as what me and my family did. That is why we wanted to do free lunches.\"\n\nThe caf\u00e9 isn't just for families.\n\n\"There are many regulars that are elderly and they just come in for a chat,\" Mr McCann said. \"It has a positive impact on their life and their mental wellbeing.\n\n\"We also have a jobs board in our coffee shop where people can, if they are looking for work, write the sort of role they are looking for. Anyone who is hiring locally can get in touch with a member of the team and we can try and help them get into work.\n\n\"It's been successful, we've had a couple of placements from that which has been great.\"\n\nOther projects Mr McCann hopes to bring to the caf\u00e9 is a visit from a debt advisor and safety advice from a member of the fire service.\n\nHe added: \"Whether you want a coffee or some food, or if you want to support the community, you are welcome to pop in and pay it forward or, if you are struggling to make ends meet, we will do whatever we can to help.\"", "source": {"uri": "newburytoday.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newbury Today"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffeehouse", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Coffeehouse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TikTok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_School_Lunch_Act", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National School Lunch Act"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School_meal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "School meal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost_of_living", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cost of living"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethos", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ethos"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Town", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Town"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newbury,_Berkshire", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Newbury, Berkshire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Newbury, Berkshire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_(projectile)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shell (projectile)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tea_Party_movement", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tea Party movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coffee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pop music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire_department", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fire department"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Food bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mental health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.newburytoday.co.uk/_media/img/HTQ059UWY1RV3EENNTLJ.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9773734", "eventUri": "eng-9773734", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2705882352941176, "wgt": 110, "relevance": 1}

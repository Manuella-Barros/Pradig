This is a right and wrong issue,\" Walsh said, faulting Trump's campaign rhetoric and initial reluctance to call out the groups. \"Don't hand hatred a megaphone and pretend you can't hear it.\"\n\nBaker also said Trump should have come out and said what everybody else was thinking and believing shortly after the Charlottesville incident \"which is white supremacists have no business and no place in American political dialogue.

There is no link whatsoever with the group.\"\n\nKessler did not respond to the Globe's request for comment.\n\nGavin McInnes, one of the scheduled speakers for Saturday's rally, said his group -- known as Proud Boys -- opposes \"the kind of people who were in Charlottesville, and the Proud Boys made damn sure we had nothing to do with it,'' he told the Globe in an e-mail.\n\n\"The rally on Saturday in Boston couldn't be farther from the rally we just saw,'' McInnes said. \"We are socially liberal, fiscal conservatives who think America has a lot to be proud of. . . . We are pro-gay, multicultural, pro-Israel, pro-family and anti-Nazi. The alt left will try to twist this into being about bigotry but that's a lie.\"\n\nOther speakers either did not respond to a Globe inquiry or declined to comment.\n\nThe rally and counter-rally have raised concerns with organizers of the New England Cosplay Community, which is planning its sixth annual picnic Saturday at the Common's Parkman Bandstand. The group, whose members dress up in costumes depicting their favorite comic book or TV characters, has a permit to hold its event at the Parkman Bandstand Saturday from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. -- at the same time and place where the Free Speech rally is scheduled to be held, according to the event's page on Facebook.\n\nAshley Linkevich, a board member, said she is concerned that the rallies might \"frighten our attendees.\"\n\nThe Free Speech group, which held a rally on the Common in May, began planning a second rally shortly thereafter, Louis said. He said the group had initially eyed this past Saturday, but moved the date because of the rally in Charlottesville, he added.\n\nHe and Sender -- both white males in their 20s -- said the group is all about freedom of expression. Louis said the group values the right to extreme views, which, he added, are healthy for social advancement. Both disavow the use of violence to hurt or intimidate people.\n\nSender said the rally will probably attract people from both sides of the political spectrum, noting tensions have been building up over time.\n\n\"The purpose of it's just to do free speech,'' he said. \"That's all it's ever been.\"\n\nMeghan E.

As the violence erupted in Charlottesville Saturday, former Hillary Clinton spokesman and now CNN political contributor Brian E. Fallon warned Boston residents that the Charlottesville rally organizer, Jason Kessler, has an event coming to the city.\n\nThe Boston Free Speech group however blamed Fallon for spreading rumors and stressed they are not associated with Kessler's group.\n\n\"We are not in any way associated with the organizers of the Charlottesville rally,\" the group wrote on Facebook. \"This was a lie and blatant attempt at defamation by Brian Fallon on twitter. There has been threats made against our lives already and we will be contacting Boston PD.\"\n\nA rally organizer, who only released his first name of Steven to NECN, told the television station the group is not involved in white supremacy. The group cares about free speech, Steven said.\n\nBoston Police Officer Rachel McGuire said the department is working on security plan in anticipation of the Aug. 19 rally.\n\n\"Incidents like those that occurred in Virginia will not be tolerated,\" she said. \"We are here to make sure everyone demonstrates safely and responsibility.\"\n\nThe police spokesman urged people to be respectful and safe. The Boston Herald reports people gathered on the Common Saturday night to speak out against in Charlottesville. The newspaper reports people are prepared to return on Aug. 19 to protest against the Free Speech rally.\n\nBoston Mayor Marty Walsh condemned the violence in Charlottesville.\n\n\"There's no place for the hate that they're spewing,\" Walsh said at an event Saturday. \"It's my understanding that they're scheduled to come to Boston. I know we probably can't stop it because of free speech, but they're spewing hate. We don't need that right now in our country.\"\n\nBoston officials will meet to discuss the upcoming rally in the city, the mayor said.\n\nThe Boston Free Speech group posted on Facebook that \"Anyone who starts violence will be swiftly arrested just like last time. We do not condone it in any way shape or form.\"\n\nMassachusetts State Police said authorities are monitoring the situation in Virginia. As of Saturday night, no connection to any suspects in Massachusetts was found.\n\n\"We condemn the bigotry -- and those who preach it -- that sparked today's violence,\" State Police said Saturday. \"Our prayers tonight are with the victims of this violence fueled by hate, as well as with the police officers and other emergency personnel who responded with professionalism and bravery to today's events.\"\n\nThe State Police Division of Homeland Security and barracks responsbible for patrolling in Boston have been in contact with Boston Police regarding the possible rally.\n\n\"Our Fusion Center -- part of our Homeland Security Division that is our criminal intelligence center -- will continue to monitor intelligence from all sources, including social media, about the planned rally and the size, history, and intentions of the groups participating,\" State Police spokesman David Procopio said. \"The Fusion Center also will be in contact with federal law enforcement agencies to receive their intelligence as well.\"\n\nAuthorities from the Fusion Center will work with Boston Police at the Boston Regional Intelligence Center to compile assessments on any potential credible public safety threats from the event. It is similar to what authorities do for any expected large gathering.\n\nTroopers patrolling Boston will be ready to deploy resources if needed, Procopio said.\n\nWhite nationalists descended on Charlottesville Saturday to rally against plans to remove a Confederate statue. City officials agreed to remove the statue of Robert E. Lee from Emancipation Park.\n\nKessler, a blogger, had organized the \"pro-white\" rally.\n\nBrawls erupted in the streets and three people were arrested, according to Virginia State Police. A state of emergency was declared.\n\nOne woman, 32-year-old Heather Heyer, was killed when a car slammed into a group of counter-protesters.

Charlie Baker also spoke out at the press conference, reiterating that \"there is no place here for that type of hatred, period, that we saw in Virginia,\" he said, adding that \"What happened in Charlottesville, simply put, was an act of terrorism.\"\n\nThe Boston rally, organized by a group called Boston Free Speech, is set for Aug. 19 from 12 to 5 p.m. The group said on their Facebook page that they are \"not in any way associated with the organizers of the Charlottesville rally.\"\n\nIn another post, the group mentioned that Baked Alaska, the online persona of a man known for organizing the \"Deploraball\" and tweeting anti-Semitic comments, has been confirmed as an attendee. (Baked Alaska was reportedly at the Charlottesville \"Unite The Right\" rally and was sprayed in the eyes with an unknown substance there. Supporters claim he may have been attacked with a chemical agent and could face permanent eye damage.)\n\nMayor Marty Walsh also confirmed that the Boston rally is being planned by a different group than the one responsible for the white nationalist rally in Virginia. Still, he encouraged them not to come to Boston so soon after the Charlottesville incident as \"the emotions and the wounds and the pain is very fresh from what happened in Virginia.\"\n\n\"We are a city that believes in free speech,\" he added, \"but we will not tolerate incentives to violence.\"\n\nWalsh said he learned of the Charlottesville incident and a possible upcoming rally in Boston as he bounced between community events throughout the weekend, one of which included thanking veterans for their service in East Boston.\n\n\"Those veterans didn't have to be asked twice to condemn swastikas and all that they stand for, but our president had to be shamed into doing the same thing two days later,\" Walsh said, referring to President Trump's initial silence about the incident.\n\nState and local police are currently gathering information about the group. The State Police Division of Homeland Security have been been in touch with the Boston Police Department about the upcoming rally.

In a response to one commenter who asked, \"Do you want people [carrying] Nazi signs at your rally?\" the group said, \"No we don't.

The letter said, \"Violence could easily spread city-wide.\"\n\nThe Boston Herald reported that the rally organizers have not pulled permits for their event, and that Walsh does not want them in Boston.\n\nInformation about who is behind Saturday's event - billed as The Second Boston Free Speech Rally - is in some dispute. Brian Fallon, a former spokesman for Hillary Clinton, said the group that rallied in Charlottesville is planning the noon event on Boston Common. On Facebook, the group Boston Free Speech denied association with the Unite The Right group involved in the Virginia rally that led to violent confrontations.\n\n\"We are not in any way associated with the organizers of the Charlottesville rally,\" the group posted to Facebook. The post continued, \"There has been threats made against our lives already and we will be contacting Boston PD.\"\n\nVirginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe told National Public Radio Monday the Unite the Right ralliers were \"disgusting human beings\" and said they \"felt emboldened\" when they arrived armed in Charlottesville. Some were wearing helmets and body armor, he said, and others had semi-automatic rifles.\n\n\"You should have heard the language in what these people said on the streets, yelling at the African American community, yelling at members of the Jewish faith,\" McAuliffe said. \"I've been doing this a long time - 40 years - I never in my life have seen such vicious, mean-spirited hatred. And that's why I said, 'Get the heck out of here.' I don't know who these people are.\"\n\nIn Charlottesville, groups reportedly clashed over plans for the city to remove a statue of Robert Lee, the Confederate general who surrendered to the United States Army in Appomattox, Virginia, ending the Civil War.\n\nIn addition to the brawling in Charlottesville, an Ohio man allegedly slammed his car into people and another car, killing Heather Heyer, who had been protesting the white nationalists rallying in the city, and injuring many others. McAuliffe called the suspect a \"car terrorist.\"\n\nThere appears to be some connection between the Charlottesville group and the planned protest in Boston. The Boston group wrote on Facebook, \"Hope anyone who was in Charlottesville today made it out safe. We have confirmed Baked Alaska will be attending our rally next week.\"\n\nBaked Alaska is an alt-right provocateur named Tim Gionet, who reported on Twitter that he was pepper-sprayed in Charlottesville.\n\n\"You can kick & scream all you want - but you won't stop our free speech, you won't stop our ideas. We are winning. #Charlottesville,\" Gionet wrote on Twitter.\n\nNewton Mayor Setti Warren, a Democrat who is running for governor next year, advised people not to react to Saturday's violence by pushing \"people back into their partisan corners.\"\n\n\"My grandfather fought the Nazis in the Battle of the Bulge. I will fight to stop the spread of their evil ideology today if I have to, but I will not allow the anger I feel about the evil actions of a despicable few to drive me to hate my fellow Americans with whom I have political disagreements,\" Warren said in a statement. \"This is a serious challenge for our nation, but it is not about Democrats versus Republicans. It is about good versus evil, love versus hate, the best of America versus Nazis.\"\n\nMcAuliffe, speaking with NPR's David Greene, said public officials need to speak up against white supremacists.\n\n\"Elected officials need to come out number one and condemn - call it for what it is, these were white supremacists, they were neo-Nazi. They came into our beautiful state, our beautiful city with their hate and their bigotry and I told them to get out. You know, they're not wanted here. But let's be honest Dave, they're not wanted anywhere in America,\" McAuliffe said.\n\nGov. Charlie Baker tweeted Saturday evening, \"E Pluribus Unum - out of many, one. This is who we've been & who we must be. Hatred & bigotry have no place here.\"\n\n\"Public safety is the top priority of the Baker-Polito Administration and state officials are in touch with Boston law enforcement to monitor the situation and ensure everyone's safety,\" a spokesman for Gov. Charlie Baker said in a statement. \"Governor Baker is saddened and disturbed by the tragic events in Charlottesville, and believes hatred, bigotry and violence as well as those who promote it have no place in our Commonwealth or country.\"", "id": "9137847", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-14", "title": "Anti-racism groups turn to Boston ahead of 'free speech' rally", "image":

He urged any groups considering such a rally to abandon their plans -- or push back the rally to another time, saying the wounds from Virginia are too fresh.\n\n\"We also have a message for the hate groups, especially any who are planning to come to our city this weekend: Boston does not welcome you here. Boston does not want you here. Boston rejects your message,\" Walsh said at a press conference on Boston City Hall Plaza.\n\nRepublican Gov. Charlie Baker called the attack on those protesting the white supremacist rally in Virginia an \"act of terrorism\" and said the state won't \"tolerate the kind of hatred and bigotry.\"\n\nHe said he called Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe, a Democrat, on Monday to express his solidarity with McAuliffe and the people of Virginia.\n\n\"It's disturbing and sickening to turn on the news and to see that there are people in this country who believe that the color of their skin or their place of birth makes them superior to their neighbors,\" Baker said.\n\nRallies against white supremacy, neo-Nazism, the Ku Klux Klan and President Trump were held Saturday and Sunday in Portland.\n\nOrganizers of Saturday's planned protest have dubbed it a \"Boston Free Speech Rally\" and have said they are not associated with the organizers of the Charlottesville rally.\n\nThe rally is scheduled from noon to 5 p.m. on Boston Common.\n\nActivists are planning a counter rally and march on Saturday to protest the event.\n\nBoston Police Commissioner William Evans said local and state agencies are working to guarantee the safety of all on Saturday. He said they expect large crowds, but are hoping to keep the groups apart.\n\n\"We will not tolerate any acts of violence,\" he said. \"We're hoping for a safe day.\"\n\nWalsh and Baker also criticized President Trump's failure on Saturday to denounce the groups in Virginia by name and instead blame the violence on \"many sides.\" On Monday, after intense criticism, Trump condemned Ku Klux Klan members, neo-Nazis and white supremacists.\n\nWalsh said Trump should have spoken out more forcefully immediately.\n\n\"This was never a many-sides issue. This is a right and wrong issue,\" Walsh said, faulting Trump's campaign rhetoric and initial reluctance to call out the groups. \"Don't hand hatred a megaphone and pretend you can't hear it.\"\n\nBaker also said Trump should have come out and said what everybody else was thinking and believing shortly after the Charlottesville incident \"which is white supremacists have no business and no place in American political dialogue. Period. End of discussion. Case closed.\"\n\nShare\n\nSend questions/comments to the editors.\n\nWant the news vital to Maine? Our daily headlines email is delivered each morning.

Two Virginia State Troopers assigned to monitor the demonstrations were also killed when their helicopter crashed. The investigation into the cause of the crash is ongoing.\n\nOrganizers of the Boston rally say they have no association with those behind the events in Charlottesville. But that hasn't stopped Walsh, other elected officials, and local activists from pledging to prevent white nationalism from descending on the streets of Boston.\n\n\"We are a city that believes in free speech, but we will not tolerate incitements to violence,\" Mayor Marty Walsh said during a press conference Monday, adding that \"hate groups\" are not welcome in Boston.\n\nHere's what we know so far about the event.\n\nThe Saturday afternoon rally is being organized by a group called New Free Speech Movement, which is behind the Facebook page Boston Free Speech.\n\nSpeakers at the rally are set to include Shiva Ayyadurai, a Republican Senate candidate and tech entrepreneur and Kyle Chapman, a self described \"American nationalist\" and niche social media celebrity.\n\nGavin McInnes, a former Vice Media cofounder and founder of the Proud Boys, a so-called alt-right group, was originally listed among the planned speakers. Following Monday's press conference by Boston officials, McInnes said on Twitter he would not be attending the event.\n\nThe New Free Speech Movement maintains that they have nothing to do with white nationalism or the Charlottesville rally.\n\n\"This was a lie and blatant attempt at defamation by Brian Fallon,\" the group said in a statement Saturday, referring to a tweet by the former Hillary Clinton spokesman, which linked the group to Jason Kessler, an organizer of the Charlottesville rally who is described as a white nationalist blogger by the Southern Poverty Law Center.\n\n\"\"We have nothing to do with him,'' an organizer of the Boston rally, who would only give his first name, Louis, told The Boston Globe on Monday.\n\n\"The rally in Charlottesville was organized specifically by white nationalists,\" he said. \"There is no link whatsoever with the group.\"\n\nIn an email to the Globe, McInnes said his group opposes the \"the kind of people who were in Charlottesville\" and made sure \"we had nothing to do with it.\" Both McInnes and Louis loosely described their group's views as libertarian.\n\nJohn Medlar, an organizer of the rally, told the Boston Herald that Boston Free Speech organizers are telling attendees to bring protective gear on Saturday.\n\n\"We've been advising people not to bring offensive weapons like firearms, knives, heavy objects, and have been instructing them to bring items like helmets or heavy goggles or sports pads, to have them handy in case they get attacked,\" he told the newspaper.\n\nThe affiliation appears revolve around the Proud Boys' links to Charlottesville. Kessler reportedly was a member of the Proud Boys and rallied with the group as recently as June.\n\nHowever, McInnes describes Kessler's involvement with the group as limited.\n\n\"He came to a few meetings and said he wasn't alt-right. When they saw he was, they booted him,\" McInnes tweeted Monday.\n\nHowever, Kessler isn't the only connection between the two rallies.\n\nIn June, the Proud Boys said members of the group should attend the Charlottesville rally if they wanted.\n\n\"If a chapter or an individual Proud Boy feels compelled to go, we encourage him to do so,\" the group said in a statement. \"Chapter autonomy is a big part of the group as well as personal liberty.\"\n\nAugustus Invictus -- who headlined the Charlottesville rally and is credited for writing an early draft of a white nationalist manifesto recently published by supremacist Richard Spencer -- had been scheduled to speak at the Boston rally. But Louis told Boston.com that he had since been uninvited.\n\n\"We actually have told Augustus not to come in light of Charlottesville,\" he said in a Facebook message Monday. Louis said no one else scheduled to speak at the Boston rally was at the rally in Charlottesville, to his knowledge.\n\nAnother previously-advertised headliner, Cassandra Fairbanks, also tweeted Monday she would not attend the rally.\n\nI'm not going to speak at the Boston free speech rally. The threats keep escalating and people are unhinged rn.\n\n-- Cassandra Fairbanks (@CassandraRules) August 14, 2017\n\nThe New Free Speech Movement also organized a rally on the Common in May. As Esquire reported at the time, many of the demonstrators expressed similar far-right or white nationalist sentiment as seen in Charlottesville. Two people -- one demonstrator and one counter-protester -- were arrested during the May rally after they got into a physical confrontation, according to the Globe.\n\nWalsh and other local officials said the sentiment expressed in Charlottesville will not be tolerated in Boston and suggested they'd work to prevent the scheduled rally from occurring.\n\n\"Boston does not welcome you here,\" he said Monday. \"Boston does not want you here. Boston rejects your message.\"\n\nLater in the press conference, the mayor added that we're going to do everything we can so that [the demonstration] does not happen Saturday.\"\n\nNevertheless, officials later said that they were hoping to gain organizers' cooperation in the run-up. Walsh and Boston Police Commissioner William Evans said organizers had not yet filed for a permit, but that they were hoping to reach out to work with the group to set parameters for the rally, such as route and stage restrictions.\n\n\"We're often, as police officers, thrust in the middle of protecting groups we don't necessarily agree with and I think that may be the case on Saturday,\" said Evans.\n\nEvans said that he expects counter-protesters to vastly outnumber those participating in the \"free speech\" rally and that police are planning to use barriers to keep the groups separated.\n\nGov. Charlie Baker said during the press conference Monday that those who engage in violence \"of any kind\" will be held responsible. According to Baker, both state and local police will be working with community organizers to monitor the rallies Saturday and \"make sure everyone plays by the rules.\"\n\nThe Boston Free Speech group quashed rumors on Facebook Monday that the rally was cancelled and claimed the city approved a permit, alleging that police and city hall are \"ignoring\" their calls.\n\nThe mayor's office, however, says that while the group did start a permit application through the city's public event office, that office doesn't have authority to grant permits for events in city parks. The group would have had to obtain a permit from the city's Department of Parks and Recreation, but no application was submitted to that department, according to the mayor's office.\n\nAt least two separate counter-protests have already garnered significant interest.\n\nSeveral thousand people have indicated on Facebook that they plan to attend a \"Fight Supremacy\" counter-protest and march that will stretch nearly two miles, from Roxbury to the Common.\n\n\"Counter-protests send a message to white supremacists that their hateful rhetoric, physical violence, and fear mongering will not go uncontested,\" organizers wrote on Facebook.\n\nIn a statement Monday to Boston.com, Monica Cannon, one of the organizers of the counter-protest, said the group does not condone violence -- \"especially violence perpetrated and supported by the State and white supremacy.\"\n\n\"We also promote non-violent protests and local organizers are asking people to come out to be non-violent,\" Cannon said. \"Community safety is a priority of the Movement for Black Lives and we are committed to helping to create a world in which life, particularly Black life, is protected.\"\n\nAnother counter-protest, \"Stand for Solidarity,\" is scheduled for Saturday afternoon at the State House, across the street from the free speech rally. The protest is being organized by the Coalition to Organize and Mobilize Boston Against Trump and Answer Coalition Boston, an anti-racism group.\n\n\"We must remain united in struggle and bring the left together to fight against hate and the rise of white nationalism,\" organizers wrote. As of Monday afternoon, the event had 1,700 expected attendees.\n\nBoston Antifa, a local anti-fascist group, wrote on Facebook early Monday morning that members should prepare for \"some\" of the same people who were present in Charlottesville, specifically citing a local Proud Boys member who was photographed at the rally.\n\nThe group, known for battling white power groups, is promoting their own \"confront fascism\" rally on the Common Saturday.\n\n\"Like back during the first Free Speech Rally, they will be nothing we can't handle if we stand together as a community and confront their hateful rhetoric,\" Boston Antifa wrote. \"Unfortunately, this Saturday has shown that we must prepare for anything.\"", "id": "9307432", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-15", "title": "What we

I don't want them here, we don't need them here.\"\n\nNews of the scheduled rally has counter demonstrators calling for a show of solidarity against racism. Many gathered across Massachusetts Sunday night to condemn the violence in Virginia and the message of white supremacists.\n\n\"We're here to say our country is inclusive,\" said Elaine Lyte, who organized a rally on Boston Common Sunday. \"We value all the members of our society. We will not allow them to be intimidated by white supremacy.\"\n\nFor the couple of hundred protesters who gathered Sunday, President Trump was almost as much a target as the white supremacists, whom the president was faulted for condoning at best.\n\n\"In his statement yesterday, he referred to violence by both sides,\" said Ellen Friedman, who attended a rally on the Common. \"As if both sides had been violent. None of that is true.\"\n\nThe Massachusetts Council of Churches and other religious leaders in the state are meeting Monday to discuss how to respond to plans for next weekend's rally.\n\nLaura Everett, the council's executive director, says the recent violence should make religious leaders go through a \"self examination\" of their roles in society.\n\n\"What are the ways that our Christian institutions have excluded and marginalized?\" she said. \"What are the ways we are just in relationships with people who look like us?\"\n\nWalsh is expected to meet with police Monday to start planning for Saturday's rally and any possible counter demonstrations.", "id": "9069122", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-14", "title": "Following Violence In Charlottesville, Concern Mounts Around Conservative Rally Planned For Boston", "image": "http://d279m997dpfwgl.cloudfront.net/wp/2017/08/AP_17225792975367.jpg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-14", "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Charlottesville"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 4, "id": "200134", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlottesville,_Virginia", "label": {"eng": "Charlottesville"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 5, "id": "209299", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Massachusetts"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 3, "id": "242094", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts", "label": {"eng": "Massachusetts"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Virginia"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 4, "id": "242096", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia", "label": {"eng": "Virginia"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Law"}, "id": "302557", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law"}, {"label": {"eng": "Facebook"}, "id": "302866", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook"}, {"label": {"eng": "Racism"}, "id": "302940", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism"}, {"label": {"eng": "Violence"}, "id": "302966", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violence"}, {"label": {"eng": "Religion"}, "id": "303332", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion"}, {"label": {"eng": "Executive (government)"}, "id": "303670", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_(government)"}, {"label": {"eng": "President of the United States"}, "id": "304262", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States"}, {"label": {"eng": "Society"}, "id": "304273", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society"}, {"label": {"eng": "Christian"}, "id": "304283", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian"}, {"label": {"eng": "White supremacy"}, "id": "305969", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_supremacy"}, {"label": {"eng": "Demonstration (protest)"}, "id": "312931", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demonstration_(protest)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Marty Walsh (politician)"}, "id": "352168", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marty_Walsh_(politician)"}, {"label": {"eng": "List of mayors of Boston"}, "id": "390493", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_mayors_of_Boston"}, {"label": {"eng": "White nationalism"}, "id": "394340", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_nationalism"}, {"label": {"eng": "Boston Common"}, "id": "470390", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Common"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 121, "label": "dmoz/Society/People/Women", "uri": "dmoz/Society/People/Women"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 232, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Violence and Abuse", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Violence_and_Abuse"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 393, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto Racing", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto_Racing"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1154, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Motorcycles/Events", "uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Motorcycles/Events"}], "time": "11:54:00"}

That's why we're here today. That's why this weekend myself and the governor spent nearly about 10 or 15 different phone calls talking about how do we reject hate in the commonwealth and the city of Boston.\"\n\nWalsh, Gov. Charlie Baker, public safety officials, state lawmakers, clergy members and others met in City Hall Monday to discuss logistics and safety concerns for the potential rally. Afterward, Walsh told reporters that the event organizers have not requested permits and that city police are still working to determine \"who this group is, what they're all about.\"\n\n\"There's no marching yet. There's been no application pulled. All we know is what we're seeing on social media,\" Walsh said.\n\nA flyer posted to Facebook by the group Boston Free Speech describes Saturday's rally as a gathering of the \"New Free Speech Movement\" to \"reassert their right to the most basic necessity of civil society\" and encourages \"Libertarians, conservatives, traditionalists, classic liberals\" and supporters of President Donald Trump to attend.\n\nThe group, Walsh said, is different from an organization with a similar name that has worked with police and obtained permits when they held free speech events on the Common in the past.\n\nComing on the heels of the violence in Charlottesville, plans for the Boston rally have gained national attention. But the event details remain foggy to local officials five days out. Walsh suggested that the media has been more successful in connecting with the rally leaders than city officials have.\n\n\"Maybe what I'd ask you to do is give the contact information you have for the organizers to the police department, so they could track down who's actually organizing this,\" Walsh said when a reporter asked him about claims made by an organizer.\n\nBoston Police Commissioner William Evans said his department has tried to contact the organizers behind the rally, but have not been successful. If the group does request a city permit, Evans said, the police department will work with them to ensure the event is safe and properly staffed with police, even if the department or its officers disagree with the group's message.\n\n\"We're often, as police officers, thrust in the middle of protecting groups that we don't necessarily agree with and I think that very much can be the case on Saturday when this particular group wants to come to the Boston Common,\" he said.\n\nThe commissioner also noted that the possible threats the police must take into account when preparing for a large event have evolved, now to include the possibility of a person using a car as a weapon.\n\n\"It's different now with all the demonstrations. Not only do we have to worry about keeping the groups at bay, but we have to worry about what happened in Charlottesville with someone driving into the crowd,\" Evans said. \"So we'll secure the Common very well and we'll secure some of the routes into the Common very well.\"\n\nEvans said BPD will have a \"sufficient number\" of police on duty Saturday, but declined to say how many officers could be assigned to work the rally. Boston police and the State Police, Evans said, will have \"public order platoons\" standing by on buses that can be called in if necessary.\n\nBoston will also have undercover officers \"working the crowd anticipating any anarchist type groups who might try to bring the march to a different level,\" Evans said.\n\nHe said he expects very large crowds around the Common on Saturday and said he is confident his department can handle the crowds.\n\n\"We've handled major demonstrations in this city -- whether it be Patriots celebrations, parades, Occupy Boston, Black Lives Matter,\" Evans said. \"I am confident that people who do come down and are going to march are going to be safe.\"\n\nAsked at what point Boston police officers would intervene between the ralliers and the groups expected to stage counter-demonstrations, Walsh said, \"I think right off the bat. Our intention is not to let the two groups together.\"\n\nEvans confirmed that officers will attempt to keep groups with opposing views apart so as to minimize the chance of a violent clash.\n\n\"We'll separate them, clearly. We'll have barriers, we'll have our pedal bikes, we'll have plenty of assets to keep them at bay,\" he said.\n\nThe commissioner said that \"if things get ugly\" police officers would remove ralliers from the situation and \"get them out of there as quickly as we can.\"\n\n\"We're not going to tolerate anyone getting hurt or any acts of violence,\" the commissioner said. \"If we see that start to happen, the rally's going to end real quick.\"\n\nThe clashes in Charlottesville grew out of plans for a protest of the city's decision to remove a statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee. Heather Heyer, a 34-year-old Virginia woman, was killed and 19 people were injured when a car allegedly driven by an Ohio man slammed into a group of people protesting white nationalist groups. Two Virginia state troopers were also killed when the helicopter they were using to monitor the rally crashed.\n\nBaker said he spoke with Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe to express \"our concerns and our outrage and our solidarity.\"\n\n\"I want to be clear, what happened in Virginia was a tragedy and an act of terror, a tragedy perpetrated by white supremacists that disturbed, as it should, Americans everywhere,\" Baker said. \"As governor of the commonwealth of Massachusetts, I want to be clear that there is no place here for that type of hatred -- period -- that we saw in Virginia.\"\n\nAsked during the press conference if he would commit to attending a counter-protest Saturday, Baker said he would have to check his calendar and noted he preferred to describe it as a \"unity rally.\"\n\n\"If I can come, I will come,\" he said.\n\nA coalition of Boston area community groups -- including Violence In Boston, the Black Lives Matter Network, Black Lives Matter Cambridge and Black Lives Matter Boston -- is planning a counter-march on Saturday to \"send a message to white supremacists that their hateful rhetoric, physical violence, and fear mongering will not go uncontested.\"\n\nThe group is planning to march about two miles from the Reggie Lewis Track and Athletic Center in Roxbury at 10 a.m. to Boston Common to \"demand justice and stand in defiance of white supremacy.\"\n\nHouse Assistant Majority Leader Byron Rushing, who represents parts of Boston's South End and Back Bay, said there needs to be a response to the rally, but said it must be measured.\n\n\"It's a very, very difficult time when the right wing, especially the violent right wing, gets so much publicity and does such dastardly things. So we have to have a reaction to that, but we have to be calm about that reaction. We don't want to act like they do,\" Rushing said. \"People are ready to do that. There are lots of people talking about what kinds of responses there should be, but on the other hand, we want to be ready for them not showing up.\"\n\nRushing added, \"We don't know if they're coming or not. It won't be a problem if we have a big, fun, pro-diversity, pro-love, pro-what-democracy-should-be demonstration without them.\"\n\nEarlier in the day, U.S. Sen. Edward Markey said he had \"great confidence\" in Mayor Walsh and the Boston Police Department to keep the peace this weekend, but said it will be incumbent on U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions to take strong actions to prosecute hate crimes after what he described as a \"too late\" response from the White House to the violence in Charlottesville.\n\n\"Obviously, there are First Amendment rights of speech, but they cannot be used in a way that heightens the likelihood of violence, heightens the likelihood that people will be harmed,\" Markey said.\n\nThe junior senator said President Donald Trump's condemnation of racism and white supremacist groups Monday came \"too late\" as he blamed the administration for creating \"a culture where bigotry is once again permissible.\"\n\n\"The strength of our unity as a nation is our acceptance of diversity as a nation. That is who we are. That is what's in contest. And that is what the city of Boston will ensure is protected every single day,\" Markey said.", "id": "9181489", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-14", "title": "Mayor Walsh urges 'free speech' ralliers

The letter said, \"Violence could easily spread city-wide.\"\n\nThe Boston Herald reported that the rally organizers have not pulled permits for their event, and that Walsh does not want them in Boston.\n\nInformation about who is behind Saturday's event - billed as The Second Boston Free Speech Rally - is in some dispute. Brian Fallon, a former spokesman for Hillary Clinton, said the group that rallied in Charlottesville is planning the noon event on Boston Common. On Facebook, the group Boston Free Speech denied association with the Unite The Right group involved in the Virginia rally that led to violent confrontations.\n\n\"We are not in any way associated with the organizers of the Charlottesville rally,\" the group posted to Facebook. The post continued, \"There has been threats made against our lives already and we will be contacting Boston PD.\"\n\nVirginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe told National Public Radio Monday the Unite the Right ralliers were \"disgusting human beings\" and said they \"felt emboldened\" when they arrived armed in Charlottesville. Some were wearing helmets and body armor, he said, and others had semi-automatic rifles.\n\n\"You should have heard the language in what these people said on the streets, yelling at the African American community, yelling at members of the Jewish faith,\" McAuliffe said. \"I've been doing this a long time - 40 years - I never in my life have seen such vicious, mean-spirited hatred. And that's why I said, 'Get the heck out of here.' I don't know who these people are.\"\n\nIn Charlottesville, groups reportedly clashed over plans for the city to remove a statue of Robert Lee, the Confederate general who surrendered to the United States Army in Appomattox, Virginia, ending the Civil War.\n\nIn addition to the brawling in Charlottesville, an Ohio man allegedly slammed his car into people and another car, killing Heather Heyer, who had been protesting the white nationalists rallying in the city, and injuring many others. McAuliffe called the suspect a \"car terrorist.\"\n\nThere appears to be some connection between the Charlottesville group and the planned protest in Boston. The Boston group wrote on Facebook, \"Hope anyone who was in Charlottesville today made it out safe. We have confirmed Baked Alaska will be attending our rally next week.\"\n\nBaked Alaska is an alt-right provocateur named Tim Gionet, who reported on Twitter that he was pepper-sprayed in Charlottesville.\n\n\"You can kick & scream all you want - but you won't stop our free speech, you won't stop our ideas. We are winning. #Charlottesville,\" Gionet wrote on Twitter.\n\nNewton Mayor Setti Warren, a Democrat who is running for governor next year, advised people not to react to Saturday's violence by pushing \"people back into their partisan corners.\"\n\n\"My grandfather fought the Nazis in the Battle of the Bulge. I will fight to stop the spread of their evil ideology today if I have to, but I will not allow the anger I feel about the evil actions of a despicable few to drive me to hate my fellow Americans with whom I have political disagreements,\" Warren said in a statement. \"This is a serious challenge for our nation, but it is not about Democrats versus Republicans. It is about good versus evil, love versus hate, the best of America versus Nazis.\"\n\nMcAuliffe, speaking with NPR's David Greene, said public officials need to speak up against white supremacists.\n\n\"Elected officials need to come out number one and condemn - call it for what it is, these were white supremacists, they were neo-Nazi. They came into our beautiful state, our beautiful city with their hate and their bigotry and I told them to get out. You know, they're not wanted here. But let's be honest Dave, they're not wanted anywhere in America,\" McAuliffe said.\n\nGov. Charlie Baker tweeted Saturday evening, \"E Pluribus Unum - out of many, one. This is who we've been & who we must be. Hatred & bigotry have no place here.\"\n\n\"Public safety is the top priority of the Baker-Polito Administration and state officials are in touch with Boston law enforcement to monitor the situation and ensure everyone's safety,\" a spokesman for Gov. Charlie Baker said in a statement. \"Governor Baker is saddened and disturbed by the tragic events in Charlottesville, and believes hatred, bigotry and violence as well as those who promote it have no place in our Commonwealth or country.\"", "id": "9119161", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-14", "title": "Anti-rascism groups turn to Boston ahead of 'free speech\" rally", "image":

Walsh is exploring legal and tactical options for shutting down or containing Saturday's planned conservative rally on Boston Common after the violence in Virginia -- which included some of the same speakers listed for Boston's event.\n\nWalsh's office said no one representing the Boston Free Speech Rally had pulled permits as of yesterday for the event, though flyers are already circulating for a five-hour protest that kicks off at noon Saturday.\n\n\"I don't want them here, we don't need them here, there's no reason to be here,\" Walsh said yesterday.\n\nNational Security Adviser H.R. McMaster has called the killing of Heather Heyer, 32, along with the injuries to 19 others when James Alex Fields Jr., 20, of Ohio allegedly plowed a car into counterprotesters, a case of \"terrorism,\" a term echoed by Walsh. Fields was fascinated with Nazism and admired Adolf Hitler, a former teacher told The Associated Press.\n\n\"There's no question about it,\" Walsh said about calling the incident terrorism.\n\nWalsh said he has already discussed the looming rally with police Commissioner William B. \u00adEvans and intends to meet with police brass today, while his office is looking into any possible legal grounds for blocking the rally entirely. State police are also conferring with Boston police, spokesman David Procopio said.\n\nBaker administration press secretary Billy Pitman said, \"State officials are in touch with Boston law enforcement to monitor the situation and ensure everyone's safety. Governor Baker is saddened and disturbed by the tragic events in Charlottesville, and believes hatred, bigotry and violence, as well as those who promote it, have no place in our commonwealth or country.\"\n\nIf need be, Walsh said, he'll join the counterprotest himself.\n\n\"I'm not afraid of that. There's no question I'm not afraid of that at all,\" Walsh said. \"What we need is leadership to step up here and denounce the hate and violence of these white supremacists. We don't need to go backward, we need to go forward. Freedom of speech isn't about racist remarks and division ... I don't want that type of hate to come to our city. We've worked too hard to move beyond all of that.\"\n\nBut Brandon Navom, a Lowell software engineer with a \"constitutional conservative background\" who is one of the listed speakers, insisted the rally is not about hate.\n\n\"This is not a Nazi group; this is not a racist group. This is a group of people who simply believe that free speech is a fundamental bedrock principle of our society. When people can't express their frustrations in words, that's precisely when they turn to violence, sticks, bats, bricks and bombs.\"\n\nNavom declined to identify who is behind the rally, but said contrary to news reports, white nationalist Jason Kessler, who organized Saturday's Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, is not involved.\n\nBoston Free Speech turned to Facebook Saturday to distance itself from Kessler, posting, \"We are not in any way associated with the organizers of the Charlottesville rally.\" The group identifies its ideology with the statement: \"We stand for free speech in all forms from all sides of the political spectrum. In Boston and New England.\"\n\nAt least two so-called alt-right personalities who were listed as speakers for the Charlottesville rally are advertised for Saturday's event in Boston. Augustus Sol Invictus, a libertarian and former U.S. Senate candidate from Florida, and Tim \"Baked Alaska\" Gionet, who worked with former Breitbart News senior editor Milo Yiannopoulous.\n\nAs many as 1,000 people are expected to rally on the Common, with left-leaning counterprotestors promising a major response.\n\n\"We're hoping to be able to peacefully assemble on the Boston Common and be able to express our views and opinions,\" said Navom, a Republican who noted he does not support President Trump. \"I've spoken with the organizers and they've assured me that everyone attending has been told there is to be no initiation of violence in any way, shape or form from our side. We're trying to be very cognizant of that tragedy. It was a horrible event and we don't want anything like that to happen again.\"\n\nNoted pro-Trump activist Cassandra Fairbanks, also a featured speaker, tweeted yesterday, \"See ya soon, Boston. Was really going to cancel going, but I don't cave to threats from antifa terrorists.\"\n\nState Rep. Goeff Diehl (R-Whitman), a U.S. Senate candidate who was co-chairman of Trump's Massachusetts campaign, said, \"It's always people's rights to assemble and speak if they want to,\" Diehl said, \"but I would hope, and I expect, that Boston police and state police will be very well-prepared to handle any potential issues that might arise.\"", "id": "9002566", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-14",

As governor of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts I want to be clear that there is no place here for that type of hatred, period, that we saw in Virginia.\"\n\nThe rally is planned for Saturday at Boston Common and hosted by Boston Free Speech, according to the Facebook page for the event.\n\nOfficials said plans are in place to handle the demonstration on Saturday to make sure the event is safe for all who attend.\n\n\"The state police along with the Boston police and other state, local and federal officials will work closely with community organizing groups and others to monitor the situation and take the necessary precautions to make sure that everyone plays by the rules and that we have a safe weekend in Massachusetts,\" Baker said.\n\nOfficials said the group has not yet filed for a permit, and the city will decide what to do if the group does file for a permit.\n\n\"We will not tolerate any acts of violence, any misbehavior or any vandalism whatsoever. We are going to have a uniformed presence out there and we're going to make sure the event goes off as smoothly as possible,\" said Police Commissioner William Evans.\n\nCity officials said they have tried to reach organizers of the rally, but had not been able to connect with anyone as on Monday evening.\n\nTM & \u00a9 2017 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

None of that is true.\"\n\nThe Massachusetts Council of Churches and other religious leaders in the state are meeting Monday to discuss how to respond to plans for Saturday's rally.\n\nLaura Everett, the council's executive director, says the recent violence should make religious leaders go through a \"self examination\" of their roles in society.\n\n\"What are the ways that our Christian

I don't think you're going to see as many people as you might have thought coming in.\"\n\nThe city of Boston on Wednesday granted a permit to the controversial rally, allowing demonstrators to gather on the Boston Common from noon to 2 p.m. on Saturday.\n\nThe rally has caused controversy due to its proximity to a white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, that ended in violence last weekend. There are concerns that similar groups will come to Boston. At least two of the scheduled speakers, who are tied to far-right movements, have dropped out of the Boston rally. The group claims to be distinct from the Charlottesville protesters.\n\nWalsh said he tried to get the group to postpone their rally, but the group declined. Walsh urged the protesters to remain peaceful and not to spout hate.\n\n\"I ask everyone who comes to Boston Common on Saturday, you can have your free speech all day long but let's not speak about hate, let's not speak about bigotry, racism,\" Walsh said.\n\nWalsh added, \"When you come into Boston, respect this city, because we respect your right to come in and speak.

David Parsons/WikiCommons\n\nThe future of a Free Speech Rally in Boston is on the ropes as city officials, including Irish American Mayor Marty Walsh, speak out against hate\n\nBoston Mayor Marty Walsh has issued a stern warning that hate groups aren't welcome in his city.\n\nA \"Free Speech Rally\" is planned for Saturday, although permits have yet to be issued by City Hall. The group claims that they submitted an application on July 13 and it was city approved but now seem unsure as to whether they have a permit or not.\n\nThe group, Boston Free Speech, denies any connection to white supremacy and is not the same as the one that organized the Charlottesville demonstration that led to the death of a woman and 19 others being treated for injuries.\n\n\"We are not in any way associated with the organizers of the Charlottesville rally,\" the group wrote on their Facebook page.\n\n\"This was a lie and blatant attempt at defamation by [former press secretary to Hillary Clinton] Brian Fallon on twitter [sic]. There have been threats made against our lives already and we will be contacting Boston PD.\"\n\nRead more: Confederate flag flew proudly at a major Irish sporting event\n\nNevertheless, Walsh is not pulling his punches.\n\n\"We don't need this type of hate,\" he insisted.\n\n\"So my message is clear to this group. We don't want you in Boston. We don't want you on Boston Common. We don't want you spewing the hate that we saw yesterday, and the loss of life.\"\n\nSpeaking prior to the President's more robust comments on Monday, Walsh said he'd rather Trump hadn't been so \"open-ended\" in his remarks but welcomed Attorney General Jeff Sessions' decision to open a civil rights investigation into the rally.\n\n\"Let's hope they're consistent. I think it would be great for the President to come out today with a clearer statement, particularly about the white supremacist neo-Nazi groups,\" Walsh stated.\n\npic.twitter.com/urKrAH1yYZ -- Mayor Marty Walsh (@marty_walsh)\n\nAugust 14, 2017\n\n\"I think he needs to separate himself a little bit from them because I think there are a lot of people putting the two together.\"\n\nA number of groups are in the process of organizing counter demonstrations while rumors ran amok yesterday that the rally had been canceled.

I feel it is our solemn obligation to do so.\"\n\nSen. William Brownsberger, the only other senator present, said that he joined Tarr in \"deploring the racist, white supremacist rally.\"\n\nBrownsberger \"notes that we only moments ago made a pledge to liberty and justice for all ... and we deplore any white supremacist or similar movement which is designed to subvert those fundamental American values.\"\n\nThe House's session Monday morning began

City officials said then that no permit had been applied for. By Tuesday, rally organizers had clarified that the rally was still happening, and city officials said a group had applied for a permit.\n\nThere is also scheduled to be a counter-rally, which Walsh said he hopes will be \"about creating a peaceful rally and remembrance for what happened in Virginia.\"\n\nGov.

From Mass Live:\n\nOrganizers of the rally are part of a group called \"Boston Free Speech.\" Newton native John Medlar, 23, said the event aims to advocate for free speech, and should not be compared to the \"Unite the Right\" rally that took place in Virginia.\n\n\"I would say this contrasts to Charlottesville. We're trying to get people to stop fighting and start listening,\" Medlar said. \"The fringes on the left and right do not respect free speech.\"...\n\nA large counter-protest, which Mayor Walsh has said should be referred to as a peaceful rally, is expected to take place at the same time as the Free Speech event. Thousands of people have shown interest in the \"Fight Supremacy! Boston Counter-Protest & Resistance Rally\" on Facebook.\n\nAs Jazz pointed out yesterday, there has been some confusion leading up to this rally, starting with whether or not it would happen at all. As recently as Monday the organizers themselves were saying the rally was canceled because their permit had been pulled. The city responded that no one had ever applied for a permit. Now that the permit question has been resolved it seems the rally is going forward.\n\nSo is this going to be a repeat of what we saw last Saturday in Charlottesville? According to organizers, racism and bigotry are not welcome at the event:\n\nWhile we maintain that every individual is entitled to their freedom of speech and defend that basic human right, we will not be offering our platform to racism or bigotry. We denounce the politics of supremacy and violence. We denounce the actions, activities, and tactics of the so-called Antifa movement. We denounce the normalization of political violence...\n\nWe are a coalition of libertarians, progressives, conservatives, and independents and we welcome all individuals and organizations from any political affiliations that are willing to peaceably engage in open dialogue about the threats to, and importance of, free speech and civil liberties.\n\nNevertheless, Boston Mayor Marty Walsh said Monday he would do whatever he could to keep the group out of the city. Today the Mayor had a different message. From CBS Boston:\n\n\"In our city, we've been dealing with anticipation of what's going to happen on Saturday,\" Walsh said. \"I ask everyone who comes to Boston Common on Saturday, you can have your free speech all day long, but let's not speak about hate. Let's not speak about bigotry, racism.\"\n\n\"We are a better people than what we're seeing on TV,\" Walsh said. \"And I'm asking people, when you come into Boston, respect this city, because we respect your right to come in and speak. If we're gonna respect your right to come in, we expect you to respect our city, our people, the people that live here. Don't pass hate, don't pass judgement on people, and that's what we're asking for.\n\nBrandon Navom, one of the scheduled speakers spoke to CBS Boston yesterday saying he was \"completely concerned\" the rally could get out of hand. Navom says he and other organizers have been receiving death threats:\n\n\"The environment has just become so hostile and so toxic that I am completely concerned for the city of Boston,\" Navom said.\n\nHe says this because he and other scheduled speakers have been receiving death threats and called \"neo-Nazis\" in the wake of the tragic events in Charlottesville, Virginia.\n\nI think a lot is riding on what happens at this event. If it can take place peacefully, without being hijacked by the violent fringe on either side, it might do some good. It might show that it's possible to have public disagreement without violence.

Walsh said he would encourage the \"free-speech\" rally organizers to postpone their event at a time of high emotion in the wake of Charlottesville,.\n\n\"We would probably ask them not to come to our city at all\" this weekend, Walsh said.\n\nGet Fast Forward in your inbox: Forget yesterday's news.

We will do every single thing in our power to keep hate out of our city.\"\n\nPolice Commissioner William B. Evans said if some kind of demonstration does happen, his officers will keep that rally apart from what he expected to be a larger group of counterprotesters at a \"unity rally.\"\n\n\"We've handled major demonstrations, and I don't find this any different,\" he said. \"It's pretty sad that we have to waste so many resources on such a group . . . with such hatred coming to Massachusetts.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"We're not going to tolerate anybody getting hurt,\" he said, citing his department's experience with such major crowd events as sports team victory rallies and parades and the Occupy Boston protest.\n\n\"It's just a matter of keeping [the two rallies] separated, and we've done that,\" he said. \"That's our plan, and if things get ugly, we'll pull them out and get them out of the area as quickly as we can.\"\n\nHe said officials are trying to learn more about the rally plan and he warned, \"If they don't tell us what they're doing, they're basically going to be out there in a very angry crowd.\"\n\nGovernor Charlie Baker, who joined Walsh and Evans and other officials at a news conference, said he would attend the unity rally, if his schedule permitted.\n\n\"If I can come, I will come,\" he said.\n\n\"What happened in Virgina was a tragedy and an act of terror,\" he said. \"I want to be clear that there is no place here for that type of hatred.\"\n\nTanisha Sullivan, president of the Boston NAACP, also spoke, saying, \"It is clear we stand against hatred, we stand against racism, we stand against the terrorism that we all witnessed this weekend.\"\n\nWalsh had said earlier Monday, \"We don't know who this group is -- [or] if it's the same group\" who rallied violently in Charlottesville. \"There is noise on social media. People are all over the place. . . . [We] have all this confusion; we want to get everything under control.\"\n\nThe city's heightened urgency comes after violence erupted Saturday when white supremacists, neo-Nazis, and racists clashed with counterprotesters in Charlottesville, sending the city in a spiral and causing ripples throughout the country about the rise of extremist groups. When the rage in Charlottesville subsided, two state troopers heading to the protests were killed and a pedestrian was mowed down allegedly by a young, white Ohio man who had a fondness for Nazi history.\n\nAfter the horrific events, fear took root on Twitter and Facebook that the rally in Boston was being organized -- or would attract -- some of the same people police accuse of inciting violence in Charlottesville. Some civil rights activists and national Democratic operatives pointed to fliers on social media with the names of some confirmed guest speakers who have ties to white nationalist and supremacist organizations.\n\nOn Monday, two scheduled speakers said they would no longer address the rally. Cassandra Fairbanks tweeted \"threats keep escalating\" and she would no longer speak on Saturday, and Gavin McInnes announced he would not attend the rally either.\n\nAlexander Sender, a 23-year-old Cambridge resident and one of the rally's organizers, said he obtained a permit July 12 to hold the Boston Free Speech rally on Saturday. The city's website showed that a permit has been issued in his name, but officials said Sender has not yet received final approval from the city.\n\nSender said he spoke with an official in the Boston Police Department on Saturday and was assured that his group was OK to proceed.\n\n\"Until I get a note saying your permit is no longer valid'' the rally will continue, Sender said on Sunday, noting the uproar over the event on social media. \"This is completely out of our hands.\"\n\nThe police department does not issue or approve permits.\n\nWalsh said at the afternoon news conference no permit had been applied for.\n\nThe group planning Saturday's rally is called the New Free Speech Movement, made up mostly of white men in their 20s, said a member who asked to only be identified by his middle name, Louis. He cited numerous threats to members of his group.\n\nHe described the group as \"Libertarian and traditional conservative leaning,\" whose members believe in the right to free speech and that extremists views are key to a healthy society. The group denounces all forms of violence, he said.\n\nBoth Sender and Louis said they are not associated with Jason Kessler, who the Southern Poverty Law Center says is a white nationalist blogger and who organized the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville.\n\nRelated\n\nMeghan E.

Obviously we'll just decide to do the whole thing again, this time in Boston. Possibly. And it's an obvious choice because Beantown is one of the cities which just hosted a rally on Sunday night protesting the original marchers in Virginia who set everything in motion down there. So the more right wing free speech marchers already have a built-in base of people with counter-protest signs freshly printed up waiting for them to arrive.\n\nThe police, who as of yesterday were still unsure whether or not the march was even happening, made their position clear. The free speech folks weren't going to have any friends on their side from law enforcement. (CBS Boston)\n\nCity leaders and Boston Police held a press conference at 3 p.m. Monday to share what they know about the reported rally and its organizers.\n\nThe main focus is to keep any possible rally peaceful while giving everyone their rights to free speech, he said.\n\n\"We also have a message to the hate groups, especially any that plan to come to our city this weekend. Boston does not welcome you here. Boston does not want you here. Boston rejects your message. We reject racism, we reject white supremacy, we reject anti-Semitism, we reject the KKK, we reject ne0-Nazis, we reject domestic terrorism, and reject hatred. We will do every single thing in our power to keep hate out of our city.\"\n\nThe Mayor of Boston, Marty Walsh, got in on the action pretty quickly. (Also CBS Boston)\n\n\"We don't need this type of hate,\" said Walsh. \"So my message is clear to this group. We don't want you in Boston. We don't want you on Boston Common. We don't want you spewing the hate that we saw yesterday, and the loss of life.\"\n\nThere appears to be some serious confusion over this event. Shortly after it was announced, the rally organizers tweeted that the rally was cancelled. They claim that they have a permit in hand, approved by the city, but that nobody at the police department or the Mayor's office is returning their calls. The Mayor is claiming that nobody applied for a permit. Obviously someone was confused.\n\nBut in short order, by nine o'clock Monday night, the organizers put out another statement saying that the rally was back on, though at least one of the speakers had cancelled, fearing that police were going to allow it to turn into a riot.\n\nI'm really of mixed emotions on this one. I can't pin down exactly who all is behind the group \"Boston Free Speech\" which is organizing the effort, but they're going to need to be cautious at a minimum. On the one hand, there's got to be some trepidation about a repeat of Charlottesville so close on the heels of that riot. But at the same time, if you simply cancel your event - agree with their message or not - you've basically said that people can have their right to assemble and speak their minds cancelled out by mob mentality. If enough people don't like what you're saying you can be silenced.\n\nAnd therein lies the problem. That's exactly the opposite of how this is supposed to work. We don't have a First Amendment to protect popular speech because nobody is trying to shut them up. It's there to protect controversial or even, yes, hateful speech. (I'm not saying that's what's planned in Boston since the agenda hasn't been formally announced yet.) If you don't protect their speech, then the government could be shutting down yours next.\n\nThe City of Boston is faced with either a great danger or a tremendous opportunity. Their Mayor needs to apologize for saying, \"We don't want you here\" and all the rest. He's supposed to be protecting the rights and safety of everyone in the city, not just the people he agrees with. And he needs to make sure that the police are ready to shut down physical violence the moment it erupts... even if the ones throwing the first punches are the so-called \"anti-hate\" counter-protesters.

In a Facebook post, however, the organizers of the \"Free Speech Rally\" said they are in no way associated with the organizers of the Charlottesville rally.\n\nAs of Monday morning, Mayor Marty Walsh's office told WCVB that the group did not have a permit for their rally. Walsh's office also scheduled a 3 p.m. press conference where the mayor, Gov. Charlie Baker, Boston Police Commissioner William Evans and other officials will discuss the upcoming rally.\n\nThe group is advertising several speakers, including some who are associated with far-right organizations, including: Joe Biggs of Rouge Right Media; Augustus Sol Invictus, a former Libertarian candidate for the Senate in Florida; and Kyle \"Based Stickman\" Chapman, who became famous for his homemade riot gear worn during the clashes between protest groups at the University of California, Berkeley. Another speaker on the list is Shiva Ayyadurai, who has declared his candidacy as a Republican challenger for Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren.\n\nWhile the group's Facebook page describes itself as supportive of \"all sides of the political spectrum,\" city officials have railed against the group's perceived agenda.\n\nCity Councilor At-Large Ayanna Pressley issued a statement Monday saying, in part, \"Whether hate reveals itself in the form of a whisper or a shout, or in protest or policy, we will counter protest your actions with the collective conviction and vigilance necessary to see racial, social and economic justice realized in our City.\"\n\n\"We don't want you in Boston. We don't want to you in Boston Common,\" Mayor Marty Walsh said on Saturday, during the Dominican Parade in Jamaica Plain.\n\nIf the event occurs, Boston police have said they would protect the rights of expression for both the rally attendees and counter-protesters.\n\n\"If there are any acts of violence, you are going to be arrested immediately,\" Gross said. \"We're well known for using our voices of logic and not the ignorance of destruction.\"\n\nThe organizers wrote that they would be contacting Boston police in advance of their scheduled event.", "id": "9133525", "details": {},

But they admit they're unsure just what to expect, partly because city officials have been unable to contact organizers of a controversial rally planned for Saturday.\n\n\"All we know is what we're seeing on social media,\" Boston Mayor Marty Walsh said at a Monday press conference during which he and Gov. Charlie Baker denounced the message of hate groups.\n\nThe rally, organized by a group called Boston Free Speech, got the attention of local officials because it promoted speakers who were also in Charlottesville last weekend.\n\n\"As the police said, as Commissioner [William] Evans said, they're working trying to find out who this group is, what they're all about,\" Walsh added. \"And we're certainly going to encourage them not to march in our city.\"\n\nAs Boston officials look for information about the organizers, they're asking reporters what leads they have. WBUR's Bruce Gellerman has been looking into the planned rally and speakers, and joined WBUR's Morning Edition to discuss what he's found.\n\nBob Oakes: So an unusual step, asking reporters what information they have.\n\nBruce Gellerman: Very strange. I've never heard that from any official ever.\n\nAlright, so tell us what you found.\n\nWell it's been frustrating to say the least. I kind of feel like I've been walking on a wet sponge as I've been trying to report this story -- everything about it feels squishy. You know, I live by an old journalism adage that says: \"If your mother says she loves you, you check it out.\" But every step I've taken trying to track down the facts of this one, even the simple stuff, has been really tough.\n\nHow so?\n\nWell, you just heard Steve Brown's story about Boston Mayor Walsh saying the organizers of the Free Speech Rally hadn't filed for a permit. But in The Boston Globe they reported the name of a 23-year-old guy from Cambridge who said he had applied. I tried to check it out, I tried to check him. I called him several times, got no answer. I called the Parks Department, which issues these kinds of permits and wound up getting a call from the mayor's office. They said they'd get back to me but the never did.\n\nSo we don't know about the permit regarding the rally on Boston Common.\n\nRight, something that simple. But it gets even a lot stranger. A flier promoting the rally appears on what purports to be the Boston Free Speech Facebook page. It lists several people as speakers and yesterday on Radio Boston, host Meghna Chakrabarti spoke with one of the people, Shiva Ayyadurai.\n\nHe's one of the Republicans running for the U.S. Senate seat held by Elizabeth Warren.\n\nThat's right. He's got four degrees from from MIT, including an Ph.D., and he's from India. He said he sent Warren a DNA kit, challenging whether she's a Native American Indian. Anyway, Meghna spoke with him:\n\nMeghna Chakrabarti: Just so I can get some clarity here, who specifically invited you to speak this weekend on Boston Common?\n\nShiva Ayyadurai: I think one of the organizers from there called my assistant. You know, I get a lot of calls as a public figure, and I was just very happy to attend a free speech event.\n\nSo he says he didn't even know who invited him. It was tough to find an answer even to a simple question like that.\n\nSo we don't even know who's planning the rally?\n\nI don't, and couldn't find out. But let me give you another example. The rally Facebook page responded to my message asking for information and they sent me a press release condemning the Charlottesville, Virginia, violence. They flatly deny any association with groups that organized that event and they say they're going to hold a moment of silence this Saturday. But another person on their Facebook flier listed as a speaker was Augustus Invictus.\n\nInvictus, who ran in the Republican primary against Florida U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio last year?\n\nThat's right. You might remember he got about a thousand votes and during the campaign he said he once killed and drank goats blood in a pagan ritual. He runs the website The Revolutionary Conservative. He denies he's a racist, but says he opposes \"feminism, deviancy and the futile denial of biological reality.\" He says \"leftism is an ideology of death and must be defeated.\" So I called him up and asked him who invited him to the Boston Free Speech Rally.\n\nAugustus Invictus: I know who invited me. I couldn't tell you however who is organizing the event. I was invited by someone who was in contact with the organizers and I can't give his name because he's a private citizen, but he just made the connection.\n\nIt's bizarre Bob. He couldn't or wouldn't say. And then he told me he had been disinvited.\n\nAugustus Invictus: I found out from yet a fourth person that my appearance was cancelled because of the threats of violence by the left. The right doesn't threaten rallies to shut them down. The right never threatens violence. The right only responds with violence when attacked.\n\nAnd then he told me he just might show up anyhow in Boston and speak this Saturday because of the statements Mayor Walsh made during yesterday's news conference.\n\nSo that's not everyone?\n\nNo. There's a guy named Joe Biggs. He was also noted as a speaker on the free speech facebook page. Biggs is a decorated combat war veteran. He was a reporter for Infowars, that's the Alex Jones, kind of far right, conspiracy theorist online blog. And I spoke with Biggs and he couldn't tell me who invited him to the rally.\n\nJoe Biggs: One of the Twitter accounts called Proud Boys USA or something. I saw the flier and I go man, I was like I'd love to go speak at that. I was like I've always wanted to go to Boston, I've never been there before. So they're like well **** man we'll add you onto the thing as a speaker.\n\nBiggs disavowed any support for racists, telling me that his wife was from Guyana. But on his Twitter feed last Saturday he said: \"There's nothing wrong with white people being proud of being white.\" He says he's just all about free speech.\n\nHe mentioned the Proud Boys USA when he spoke with you?\n\nYeah, that's right. That's a group that calls themselves \"Western chauvinists.\" They're led by a guy named Gavin McInnes. I tried to reach him, couldn't. He was named as a speaker at the Boston free speech rally website. He co-founded Vice Magazine and he has a reputation for vulgar, sexist rants. I think he'd make Lenny Bruce blush. But McInnes now says he's not coming to Boston. He accused city officials of trying to incite a riot to discredit right wing activists who planned to rally in Boston.\n\nSo kind of strange and frustrating story that you are going to keep on top of this week Bruce?\n\nYou bet.", "id": "9299200", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-15", "title": "As Boston Prepares For Demonstrations, Here's What We Know About 'Free Speech' Rally Organizers",

Organizations throughout Boston have endorsed the event, like Boston Democratic Socialists of America and Massachusetts Interfaith Worker Justice, according to the Facebook event. The description says, \"Why do we need solidarity? Because we must remain united in struggle and bring the left together to fight against hate and the rise of white nationalism.\"\n\nLauren Feiner can be reached at lauren.feiner@globe.com.

But it would not be the city's first experience with such groups. Boston has been the site of tense clashes of ideology in recent decades, often resulting in arrests and injuries.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHere's a look back at some of the tense, often violent confrontations.\n\nAmid unrest following the landmark 1974 ruling ordering the desegregation of the city's schools, an anti-integration group attempted to break into South Boston High School, according to Globe reports.\n\nGet Fast Forward in your inbox: Forget yesterday's news.

Sign up for more newsletters here\n\nSchool security guards called for police assistance when approximately 200 people tried to enter the school around 9:15 p.m. Another 300 or so people joined the skirmish from a nearby restaurant where David Duke, a then-leader of the Ku Klux Klan, was speaking in favor of school segregation. A 22-year-old man was arrested by the time the crowd dispersed around 10:45 p.m.\n\nA month later, as the city was roiled by discussions about busing and integration, the National Socialist White People's Party organized a rally on City Hall Plaza. Approximately 150 people gathered on Oct. 26, 1974, some of them wearing brown shirts, swastika armbands, and helmets.\n\nThe rally lasted only about 15 minutes before the commander of the organization, 39-year-old Matt Koehl, was arrested for disorderly conduct because protesters were blocking sidewalks and traffic.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe largest meeting of white supremacists and counter-protesters in Boston, according to Globe archives, took place on Oct. 16, 1982. Two dozen robed members of the KKK arrived on City Hall Plaza where they were met by more than 1,000 protestors, throwing rocks, eggs, vegetables, and bottles.\n\nThe Klansmen were immediately escorted out of the area by police for their safety, but violence between officers and protestors continued. Thirteen protesters and six police officers were injured, and two protestors were arrested.\n\nBoston hosted a tense rally as recently as May, when a conservative free speech group gathered on the Common, spurring a counter-protest by a group of hundreds that included anti-fascists. Police separated supporters of the Boston Free Speech and Boston Antifa groups, each hurling shouted insults at one another.\n\nTwo people, neither from Massachusetts, were arrested. The May 13 rally, described online as a meeting where \"Libertarians, conservatives, traditionalists, classical liberals, or anyone else who supports Trump or just hates leftists are encouraged to attend,\" appears similar to the one planned for this week on the Common.\n\nSara Salinas can be reached at sara.salinas@globe.com.

Make no mistake, this was a despicable act of domestic terrorism. My heart goes out to the victims and their families.\n\n\"While unfortunately this kind of hate is not new in our country, our values and founding principles require us to do better. When we say there is no place for hate here, we do so knowing that we have to take action to remove the foothold that white nationalists and white supremacists currently have.\n\n\"We also have to recognize that these hate groups are not limited in their membership to any one city, state, or region. Boston has offered opportunity and security to people of many different backgrounds. We strive to do better, and to be more inclusive, every day. But we are not perfect, and we are not immune. The event planned for Saturday August 19th demonstrates that. We are facing a pivotal moment when we must decide who speaks for our City. We may not be able to deny hate groups the ability to speak, but we can drown them out with voices that are stronger and more numerous. We can overwhelm their hatred with our own collective love.\n\n\"Ignoring these groups has allowed them to fester and flourish in the dark. The dangerous rhetoric of President Donald Trump's campaign and administration has made them feel secure spewing their hatred out in the open. They are preparing to stand in one of Boston's most sacred places, on land that has belonged to the public collectively for over 350 years, and to tarnish it with views that disgust us. Therefore we must prepare ourselves to show them -- peacefully, lovingly -- that their views are not \"common\"; that they have no place on the Boston Common; that this City welcomes immigrants, people of color, people of different religions, ethnic identities, sexual orientations, and gender identities.\n\n\"The Boston I love is the Boston that used the Common to protest tyranny in the 1700s, protest slavery in the 1800s, rally for civil rights in the 1900s, and rally at the Women's March just this year.

I know that one of the larger events is being actually led by the Violence In Boston Organization by Monica Cannon and with support from the Black Lives Matter Cambridge and the Black Lives Matter Boston.

Are you concerned about those kinds of groups sort of injecting themselves into a volatile situation?\n\nA: Yes. I am. I think that we have to be vigilant and we cannot take for granted that people are going to adhere to a call not to attempt to come into the city armed ... unfortunately we are starting to transition from speech to violence when it comes to some of these extremist views, and as we turn this corner unfortunately we have to be mindful that there are people whose intention is to cause harm ... the reality is that a public safety plan is needed for Saturday, but we've also been talking a need for a very strong public safety plan just generally speaking just as it relates to the city of Boston ... the reality is that we have had an uptick in violence in the city of Boston this summer and the number of murders that we witness, the amount of violence that we've seen absent other people coming into our community is something that we have to deal with internally.", "id": "9466282", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-16", "title": "Boston NAACP head frets for public's safety ", "image": "http://www.bostonherald.com/sites/default/files/styles/full/public/media/2017/03/08/030817sullivanap02.jpg?itok=0x-DzMof", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-16", "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 5, "id": "209299", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Racism"}, "id": "302940", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism"}, {"label": {"eng": "Violence"}, "id": "302966", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violence"}, {"label": {"eng": "Freedom of speech"}, "id": "305776", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_speech"}, {"label": {"eng": "White supremacy"}, "id": "305969", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_supremacy"}, {"label": {"eng": "Demonstration (protest)"}, "id": "312931", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demonstration_(protest)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Boston Herald"}, "id": "316414", "score": 4, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Herald"}, {"location": null, "score": 2, "id": "344594", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Police_Department", "label": {"eng": "Boston Police Department"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "The Rundown"}, "id": "516314", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Rundown"}, {"label": {"eng": "Black Lives Matter"}, "id": "1269040", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Lives_Matter"}, {"label": {"eng": "Public safety organizations"}, "id": "1269666", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_safety_organizations"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 121, "label": "dmoz/Society/People/Women", "uri": "dmoz/Society/People/Women"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 232, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Violence and Abuse", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Violence_and_Abuse"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 661, "label": "dmoz/Science/Social Sciences/Urban and Regional Planning", "uri": "dmoz/Science/Social_Sciences/Urban_and_Regional_Planning"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 705, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Race-Ethnic-Religious Relations", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Race-Ethnic-Religious_Relations"}], "time": "11:28:00"}

Though both back certain policies, ideas, and companies that arguably buttress economic and racial disparity, I think that almost everyone of sane imagination can agree that neither is a white supremacist, and as such Charlie and Marty were expected to stand in front of microphones on Monday and lambaste President Donald Trump and his racist supporters, including those who swarmed on Charlottesville last weekend, as well as those who allegedly plan to bring some loathsome message or another to the Hub on Saturday.\n\nThere were very few surprises at the press availability. A large scrum of reporters from a range of outlets circled 'round, as Baker, Walsh, and law enforcement officials spoke with a gaggle of clergy and government workers behind them. All of the above condemned intolerance and bigotry, and unlike the president of the United States, said the sort of human things that you're supposed to say in such a situation. Theatrics were kept to a minimum, as were many details, since even Boston Police Department Commissioner William Evans claimed to not yet know exactly who is planning the contested demonstration.\n\nPrior to the dog and pony show of solidarity with Charlottesville, I ran into some activists who I have covered in the past. A few came down to City Hall not only for the speeches, but to find out if the state and municipal leaders on hand planned to show up at the counter-protests. As one experienced organizer put it, \"We're telling them to stand up to the white supremacists with us. Their high profile, and the media that their involvement will attract, would do a lot to make everyone there a lot safer.\"\n\nIt's probable that most of the electeds who were cheesing for the cameras on Monday will show up to repel hate on Saturday. Walsh implied that he'll be present, while Boston City Councilor-at-Large Ayanna Pressley released a statement saying, \"We will counter protest your actions with the collective conviction and vigilance necessary to see racial, social and economic justice realized.\" In his turn, Baker acknowledged that \"there are a lot of people in communities of color who think they are not being heard by [the Trump] administration,\" said those voices \"need to do something,\" and suggested that anti-hate organizers use the term \"unity rally,\" rather than \"counter-protest.\" As for whether he will be there on the front lines along with them, the governor balked, \"I actually don't know what's on my calendar Saturday, but if I can come, I will come.\"", "id": "9176219", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-14", "title": "BAKER CALLS FOR 'UNITY RALLY' INSTEAD OF 'COUNTER-PROTEST'", "image": "https://digboston.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/2017-08-14-15.35.00-e1502751322202.jpg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-14", "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Charlottesville"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 4, "id": "200134", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlottesville,_Virginia", "label": {"eng": "Charlottesville"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 4, "id": "209299", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Racism"}, "id": "302940", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism"}, {"label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}, "id": "302942", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump"}, {"label": {"eng": "President of the United States"}, "id": "304262", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States"}, {"label": {"eng": "White supremacy"}, "id": "305969", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_supremacy"}, {"label": {"eng": "Buttress"}, "id": "340238", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buttress"}, {"location": null, "score": 2, "id": "344594", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Police_Department", "label": {"eng": "Boston Police Department"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Marty Walsh (politician)"}, "id": "352168", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marty_Walsh_(politician)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Ayanna Pressley"}, "id": "357447", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayanna_Pressley"}, {"label": {"eng": "List of mayors of Boston"}, "id": "390493", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_mayors_of_Boston"}, {"label": {"eng": "Boston City Hall Plaza"}, "id": "470917", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_Hall_Plaza_(Boston)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Dog and pony show"}, "id": "758124", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog_and_pony_show"}, {"label": {"eng": "Charlie Baker"}, "id": "1273374", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Baker"}], "location": null, "categories": [], "time": "23:04:00"}

On Saturday, a gathering of white nationalists and neo-Nazis turned violent, when a man drove his car into a group of counter protesters - sparking an outbreak of violence that left 3 dead, and dozens injured.\n\nFor Bostonians, this violence hits close to home, ahead of a \"Free Speech Rally\" set to take place in Boston Common this Saturday. This event, put on by a group of conservative-nationalists not unlike the \"Unite the Right\" group that organized the Charlottesville rally, has led to concern that violence might break out here in Massachusetts.\n\nBoston Mayor Marty Walsh responded to the events of the past week, and spoke out against the alt-right activists headed for Boston. He rightfully condemned their hateful ideology, and offered a clear message to these bigots: \"We don't want you in Boston\". Yet he went one step further, and crossed the line from denouncing bigotry to flirting with a potential assault on the First Amendment. In the same statement, Walsh promised to do everything in his power to ensure that \"the march or this demonstration does not happen in our city\".\n\nIn Charlottesville, some left-wing counter protestors didn't show up armed with posters or pamphlets - but with semi-automatic weapons. Already, calls have begun for the Boston \"Free Speech Rally\" to be shutdown. Mayor Walsh's office has echoed these calls, exploring any possible legal grounds they could use to shut down the rally. But when we resort to silencing those whose espouse such hateful, intellectually bankrupt ideology, we plead intellectual cowardice and turn our backs on the Constitution.\n\nMake no mistake - violent agitators should be immediately arrested, and punished to the fullest extent of the law. Still, white supremacists have First Amendment rights that must not be trampled, regardless of how disgusting their ideology might be. \"Hate speech\" is still free speech, and almost none of their rhetoric could meet the incredibly high legal bar to be considered a call to violence. In the landmark case Brandenburg v. Ohio, the Supreme Court ruled that for speech to fall under this First Amendment exception, it must intentionally, immediately, and effectively bring about violence. Who could argue that a few hundred neo-Nazis in Boston Common advocating for a new civil war, or in favor of ethnic cleansing, could immediately or effectively bring that about?\n\nThe First Amendment is the foundation of our identity as Americans. No matter how despicable the ideology of those who seek to divide us, we can't betray free speech as an American ideal. When we seek to silence hateful ideology, we imply that we aren't capable of defeating it honestly.\n\nThe stars of this upcoming \"Free Speech Rally\" aren't exactly the best and brightest of the conservative moment. Speakers include Joe Biggs, formerly of InfoWars and a notorious pusher of the \"pizza-gate\" Hillary Clinton hoax. Also set to speak is Jeremy Herrell, an unabashed Trump supporter who dubs himself \"the Hip Hop Patriot\". If we can't defeat a man who made a name for himself singing \"Build the Wall\", what does that say about the strength of our own arguments?\n\nThe alt-right portrays themselves as persecuted, and claws their way to a semblance of legitimacy by scapegoating the \"fake news media\". If we suppress their voices, we only add fuel to this fire. Taking on hate in the free marketplace of ideas is the only way to extinguish this ideology.\n\nCitizens of Boston: condemn these alt-right bigots, push back against their ideas, and overpower their messages of hate with tolerance. But this tolerance must allow for speech we find hateful and offensive, or we will have become fascists just like the neo-Nazis we decry.\n\nBradley Polumbo is a student at the University of

Get what you need today in this early-morning email. Sign Up Thank you for signing up! Sign up for more newsletters here\n\nThe crowd was made up mostly of white guys in their 20s holding American flags. Some belonged to various \"alt-right'' groups that ranged from white supremacists to militias. One guy was dressed up as a frog, the mascot of the \"alt-right'' movement. A young woman wearing a hard hat held a so-called Kek flag that some in the \"alt-right'' movement think is swell. A lot of the guys wore military garb.\n\nThere were plenty of Trump signs and hats. \"Hillary For Prison\" T-shirts were also de rigueur. A young guy held a \"Bill Clinton is a Rapist\" sign that he made himself with magic marker. To his credit, all the words were spelled right.\n\nAs is standard whenever a group of \"alt-right'' whiners show up to complain about how hard it is to be a white guy in America, anti-fascist counter demonstrators appeared and officers from the Boston Police Department were dispatched to keep the groups separated. The so-called antifa demonstrators held the high ground, at least literally, on a hill looking down on the \"alt-right'' crowd.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere was a lot of shouting, some very bad language, and way, way too many megaphones. But unless you were walking through the Common that day, you wouldn't have known it was going on.\n\nAt one point police led a couple of people away in handcuffs, including a guy wearing one of those red Make America Great Again baseball hats. Two arrests were reported: a 19-year-old woman from California and a 28-year-old man from New York.\n\nAll in all, a fairly innocuous day on which many parents' basements were deserted.\n\nNow many of the same people who gathered at the Parkman Bandstand three months ago are coming back to the Common and everyone's paying attention. In the wake of what happened in Virginia over the weekend, Saturday's planned rally is being treated as a potential powder keg.\n\nBut right now, there's little evidence to suggest the rally -- if it even happens -- is going to have anything approaching the volatility of Charlottesville, where neo-Nazis and the Ku Klux Klan were openly involved.\n\nPolice Commissioner Bill Evans said the people organizing this Saturday's rally are different from those who organized the one in May. The group's Facebook page claims they are the same, but Evans says the police are still trying to figure out who's really organizing it. Evans said his intelligence detectives are scouring social media to get a handle on what to expect.\n\nIt is certainly admirable to see Mayor Martin Walsh, Governor Charlie Baker, and a host of elected officials and faith leaders mobilize so quickly in response to the planned rally. All of this attention is leading some of those who had planned to speak at Saturday's rally on the Common to have second thoughts.\n\nJust as admirable is the speed with which so many vigils have been organized in response to what happened in Charlottesville.\n\nAnd Walsh might be right that it's too soon after Charlottesville for such a rally, but I'm leery of inclinations to ban it. Boston Common is a bastion of free speech.\n\nThe answer to offensive speech is more speech, and there are already far more people committed to taking part in counter-demonstrations against whatever and whoever shows up for Saturday's rally on the Common. It is those voices that will linger long after the guy in the frog suit hops away.\n\nKevin Cullen is a Globe columnist.

Biggs was among those promoting the Pizzagate conspiracy theory that claimed a pedophile ring with links to Hillary Clinton was operating out of a Washington, D.C., pizzeria.\n\nIn an interview, Biggs insisted the rally in Boston is designed to promote free speech -- not hate or violence. \"These events are not violent in nature at all but people will defend themselves if provoked and that's what happened in Charlottesville,\" he said.\n\nHe disavowed any support for racists, saying, \"My wife is Guyanese. I have a mixed baby. I'm the furthest thing from a [expletive] Nazi.\"\n\nBut in a video posted on his Twitter feed on Saturday, he talked positively about the Charlottesville rally. \"There's nothing wrong with white

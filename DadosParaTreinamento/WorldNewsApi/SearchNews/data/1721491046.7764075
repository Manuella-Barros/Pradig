DeGrom threw 15 pitches, none of them breaking balls. \u201cI\u2019m not sure of the timeline, but feeling really good,\u201d deGrom said. \u201cTouched the mound for the first time today, so that went really well. So one day at a time. I got two more times this week. And then just keep moving forward from there.\u201d DeGrom threw in the bullpen before the Rangers opened a homestand against the New York Mets, his former team, and two days before his 36th birthday. Texas signed deGrom to a $185 million, five-year deal as a free agent before the 2023 season. The Mets are in effect paying most of Scherzer\u2019s salary after trading the three-time Cy Young Award winner to Texas at the deadline last summer. Scherzer, who hasn\u2019t pitched for the reigning champion Rangers since last year\u2019s World Series, threw 4 2/3 innings in a rehab start for Triple-A Round Rock on Saturday night. Texas manager Bruce Bochy said before Monday\u2019s game that he expected Scherzer\u2019s next start to be in the big leagues, but he didn\u2019t say when. \u201cI\u2019m ready to get back out there. ... I\u2019m just trying to rejoin the rotation wherever they want to reinsert me,\u201d Scherzer said. \u201cYeah, he came out of that well,\u201d Bochy said. \u201cIt\u2019s good to have him back. I know he\u2019s excited.\u201d Texas has an day off Thursday after the Mets series, and Kansas City visits for three games this weekend. This week is the second time Texas has played the Mets since acquiring both Cy Young winners. When the Rangers went to New York last August, that series fell between starts for Scherzer and deGrom was recovering from surgery. Scherzer, who had back surgery in December, has made three rehab starts. The first was April 24, but the next was pushed back to June 9 because of right thumb soreness that team doctors later identified as a nerve issue extending to his right triceps. Texas made the Scherzer deal last summer after the pitcher agreed to opt in on the final year of his contract for this season at $43.3 million. New York is paying $30.83 million of that to Texas in twice-monthly installments. \u201cI enjoy living here,\u201d Scherzer said. \u201cAnd we got a ring, so it\u2019s been great.\u201d Scherzer, who turns 40 on July 27, said he hopes to pitch past this season. He knows that could depend on whether he has any more nerve issues. \u201cI didn\u2019t come into this year thinking this is my last year,\u201d he said. \u201cDefinitely want to pitch next year. We\u2019ll see.\u201d DeGrom spent his first nine major league seasons with the Mets but threw only 156 1/3 innings over 26 starts his last two years in New York. He missed the final three months of 2021 with right forearm tightness and a sprained elbow, then didn\u2019t make his first big league start in 2022 until Aug. 2 after being shut down late in spring training because of a stress reaction in his right scapula. Texas won all six games started by deGrom (2-0, 2.67 ERA) last season before he got hurt. He last pitched in a game on April 28, 2023, against the New York Yankees when he exited early because of injury concerns for the second time in three starts. The four-time All-Star had surgery on June 12 last year. \u201cI definitely want to be out there. That\u2019s the hardest thing, you want to be out there competing,\u201d said deGrom, who had Tommy John surgery while still in the low minors after the Mets drafted him in 2010. \u201cI\u2019ve been through this before, so I knew kind what to expect. I knew it was a long road. So the main thing was just try to be smart, not do too much. And we\u2019ve been sticking to the program. Everything\u2019s felt good along the way, so try to keep it that way.\u201d ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb", "summary": "<a href=\"https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vYXBuZXdzLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL3JhbmdlcnMtZGVncm9tLXNjaGVyemVyLTM3YjkzYWYxN2NlYTYxYzZkNTUzZTIxMGE5OGM3MjUw0gEA?oc=5\" target=\"_blank\">Rangers' deGrom on mound for first time since surgery and Scherzer close to Texas season debut</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color=\"#6f6f6f\">The Associated Press</font>", "url": "https://apnews.com/article/rangers-degrom-scherzer-37b93af17cea61c6d553e210a98c7250", "image": "https://dims.apnews.com/dims4/default/96e40f4/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1688+0+281/resize/1440x810!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.apnews.com%2F95%2F7f%2Fe13abd645a731d2d28e588796b42%2Ff2a46e23d3d94f46a2c2d68b0e08b281", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-18 00:26:01", "author": "Stephen Hawkins", "authors": ["Stephen Hawkins"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.039}

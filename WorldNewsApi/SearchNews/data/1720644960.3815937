{"id": 231308754, "title": "She helped create the Mindhunter method made famous by Netflix. Now Ann Burgess has inspired a new show", "text": "Ann Wolbert Burgess knew she was entering uncharted territory as she descended into the bowels of the FBI\u2019s Quantico headquarters in the late 1970s. First, she was a civilian, not an agent \u2013 a psychiatric nurse specializing in rape victimology at a time when women were still widely blamed for their own sexual assaults. Secondly, Burgess was female, a rarity within the G-men-filled halls of the Virginia complex, where former athletes and ex-military alphas were the norm. And finally, she was consulting in a nascent field of criminal study that endeavored to reach the furthest depths of serial offenders\u2019 minds \u2013 an effort by a small group of hyper-focused agents from subterranean offices that often drew skepticism. But Burgess quickly earned the men\u2019s respect, not only navigating unexplored psychiatric avenues but pioneering building blocks that would forever change the way the federal government catches criminals. Now, almost 50 years after the married mother first consulted with the FBI, an upcoming Hulu docuseries from a nearly all-women team \u2013 including sister producers Dakota and Elle Fanning \u2013 offers a fascinating glimpse into Burgess\u2019 life, work and legendary contributions to crime fighting. \u201cI was glad to see the only males that we had on the whole [project] were the ones that had to carry the cameras,\u201d Burgess, 87, good-naturedly tells The Independent just days before the Tribeca premiere of Mastermind: To Think Like A Killer. The docuseries is partly inspired by a 2021 book the nursing professor co-wrote with Boston College colleague Steven Constantine. He\u2019d urged her to compile her incredible stories after the release of Netflix\u2019s 2017 series Mindhunter \u2013 in which actor Anna Torv plays Dr Wendy Carr, loosely modeled on Burgess. The psychiatric nurse could never have predicted her repeated portrayals on screen when she began her work with rape victims as a grad student in the late 1950s. It was in this arena that Burgess first showed her aptitude for renegade research; while treating women institutionalized after sexual assaults, she came to the then-revolutionary conclusion that it was imperative to understand an attack from both the perspective of the victim and the offender in order to better comprehend the events. Before then, she writes, it was common \u201cto dismiss sexual violence as indecent, a fringe part of society, or a \u2018women\u2019s issue\u2019 that shouldn\u2019t be discussed \u2013 as if men weren\u2019t even involved.\u201d Burgess and a sociologist colleague published two major papers in 1973 and 1974 which indicated \u201cthat sexual violence was more about power and control than the act of sex itself,\u201d she writes in her book with Constantine, A Killer By Design: Murderers, Mindhunters, And My Quest To Decipher The Criminal Mind. While that view of sexual violence is now long established, in the mid-1970s it marked a \u201cnovel understanding of the victim\u2019s experience,\u201d the book notes, which had \u201cripple effects.\u201d The FBI, meanwhile, was noticing a sharp increase in violent sexual crimes across the US \u2013 but no one in the Bureau really had or was qualified to give training. One new Behavioral Science Unit Agent learned about Burgess\u2019 work from a female officer who moonlighted as an ER nurse; after reading one of her papers, the agent called up Burgess and invited her to lecture at Quantico about sexual crimes. Some agents initially smirked \u2013 until she \u201cdimmed the overhead lights and turned on a projector, then clicked through a series of photographs showing blood-stained underwear, bedrooms upturned by violence, and close-ups of women\u2019s faces covered in bruises and marks of abuse,\u201d she writes. \u201cSome agents took notes, but most just stared at the severity of the crimes. None of them smirked after that.\u201d Burgess\u2019 keen insights into the minds of victims and offenders soon led to another invitation: to give her perspective on the work of agents Robert Ressler and John Douglas, who\u2019d begun what they called a \u201ccriminal personality study\u201d and conducted recorded interviews with infamous offenders such as \u201cCo-ed Killer\u201d Edmund Kemper and Chicago nurse-killer RIchard Speck. Burgess worked with the agents to formalize their approach and fine-tune methodology for data collection and analysis in a study of 36 serial killers, and in doing so became an integral part of the team \u2013 traveling across the country to assist with investigations and packing a go-bag. While scenes like that sound straight out of shows like Criminal Minds (which used Douglas as a model for profiler characters) \u2013 and words like \u201cgrooming,\u201d \u201csignature,\u201d and \u201cunsub\u201d are now established parts of the vernacular \u2013 Burgess and the agents she toiled alongside were building it all from the ground up. They literally wrote the book \u2013 publishing 1992\u2019s Crime Classification Manual: A Standard System for Investigating and Classifying Violent Crimes. Burgess also transitioned her efforts to the courtroom, providing expert testimony in some of the biggest cases in memory \u2013 including the Bill Cosby trial. She has watched for decades as the field she pioneered exploded around her. \u201cForensics was something that you always had to wait til graduate school to get to,\u201d she says. \u201cNow it\u2019s in high school.\u201d That general cultural awareness around forensics, criminology and victimology aspects has been a key goal over the decades, she says \u2013 and a motivating factor through grueling, emotionally taxing work. Civilians now often know the signs to look for (a youth\u2019s torture or killing of pets, for example) that could indicate future dangerous behaviors, paving the way for early intervention and help \u2013 whereas Burgess and her team, decades ago, were the ones figuring out what those signs were and educating authorities about how to identify them. \u201cThat has to be Number One,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen people observe or witness or know of an acting-out [youth], especially an adolescent male, we\u2019ve got to do something to handle that and to get some help with it.\u201d Her 2021 book \u201ctried to bring out the early warning signs so that people would see that.\u201d \u201cMy whole background is to get the word out,\u201d she tells The Independent. \u201cThe word wasn\u2019t out back in the 70s \u2026 and giving people language to be able to talk about things, that\u2019s my motivation.\u201d At the same time, Burgess says a major concern for her is widespread knowledge being absorbed by offenders \u2014 who revealed in interviews that they were reading true crime reports and watching TV shows. \u201cCriminals have become more sophisticated,\u201d she says. \u201cI think we have to be very careful that they don\u2019t pick up the lingo and they don\u2019t use it in any way to manipulate, because they are such major manipulators \u2013 and their skill in lying and putting it over on people is so much a part of them and getting away with a crime.\u201d Burgess noted that usually only 60 per cent of homicide cases are solved annually, leaving a whopping 40 per cent unsolved. \u201cAnd that\u2019s every year \u2013 so you do the math,\u201d she says. She credits her nursing background with helping her to stomach the often gruesome and heartbreaking work. \u201cI was trained that way, not to take the cases home with me or to worry about them,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd I write; when you write something, you\u2019ve concretized it.\u201d At the beginning of A Killer By Design, Burgess notes she \u201cmade a point of remaining faithful to the reality of events as they occurred \u2013 so as not to undermine the true nature of the crimes or the trauma they inflicted.\u201d She tells The Independent that victims often remain in touch with her. \u201cOut of the blue, I\u2019ll get an email,\u201d she says, Some were survivors of childhood trauma, she says, and contact her out of curiosity, unable to fully remember so they ask Burgess to fill in the blanks \u2013 \u201cthere are challenges, that\u2019s for sure.\u201d There\u2019s an urgency to her voice when Burgess warns about the issues that still need addressing. \u201cThere\u2019s a horrible problem of nursing home rapes of women, you know how vulnerable they are, especially if they have dementia,\u201d she says. \u201cThe other is prison inmates.\u201d Despite the major inroads that have been made in criminal psychology and crime-solving, she says she\u2019s disheartened by the lack of similar progress when it comes to the prosecution of sexual assaults. \u201cIt was very helpful to work with the FBI, because they had been educated; they had great training in the area,\u201d she says. \u201cBut if you go down to local police departments, not necessarily.\u201d Developments such as rape shield laws \u2013 in which a victim\u2019s sexual history can be inadmissable \u2013 and MeToo have helped, she says. Victims get better nursing and psychological treatment than they used to. But survivors are often still too afraid to come forward (\u201cand you can\u2019t blame them,\u201d she says) and convictions are hard to achieve. \u201cWe have not made as much progress as we should in trying to battle the myths out there,\u201d she tells The Independent. \u201cReally, it is still very difficult to get cases through the system.\u201d For almost three years, Burgess has been collaborating with other pioneers and experts for an elite Super Sleuths group which meets virtually once a month to consult on unsolved crimes. Members include an old Quantico contact, a DNA expert from Maryland, an entomologist and even one of the lawyers for Adnan Syed, whose case formed the basis for the podcast Serial. Members of the group were joining Burgess at the Friday premiere of Mastermind in New York; she was driving down from Boston, laughing that she planned to wear an outfit from the trailer \u201cso everybody will know it\u2019s me.\u201d She hopes viewers will take away from the docuseries the importance of forensic nursing and nurses, in general \u2013 and notes how quickly the evolution of crime itself may continue. \u201cWho knows where we\u2019ll be in the next decade?\u201d she tells The Independent, noting growing issues with cybersecurity and social media \u201cThere\u2019s been so much crime and reaction; will there be a difference in victim response? We don\u2019t know that. Or will there be new and different kinds of crimes that we\u2019ll have to look into? As Burgess looks to the future of forensics and profiling, she acknowledges her own somewhat unexpected trailblazing path. \u201cMy plan was to be a concert pianist,\u201d she says. \u201cMy mother didn\u2019t think that I\u2019d be able to make a living.\u201d", "summary": "<p>As sexual violence spiked across 1970s America, the FBI called in an outsider \u2013 a professor from Boston who just happened to be a woman.

Anchor Dana Bash said, \u201cI do want to ask about closing arguments in the criminal trial in New York. They are set for Tuesday. The jury could deliver a verdict later this week on 34 felony charges. I know you\u2019ve criticized the prosecutors and the judge, but this case will ultimately be decided by 12 ordinary citizens. Do you have faith that the jury is going to deliver a fair verdict?\u201d Scott said, \u201cWell, there\u2019s no crimes so I assume that they will actually find him innocent. The only person guilty in that courtroom as DA Bragg, guilty of corrupting the justice system, guilty of not doing his job, and guilty of trying to frame an innocent man. It\u2019s really the two tear justice system that has so many Americans concerned about fairness in our country.\u201d Bash said, \u201cBut just to be clear, you have faith in the jury system. and in particular again, these 12 ordinary Americans who are going to ultimately decide?\u201d Scott said, \u201cI know that 96% is the number I\u2019ve heard of the number of Democrats in that area of Manhattan. So I hope that they come to the right decision. I assume that he will be found innocent.\u201d Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN", "summary": "<p>Senator Tim Scott (R-SC) said Sunday on CNN's \"State of the Union\" that Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg was guilty of trying to frame former President Donald Trump.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.breitbart.com/clips/2024/05/26/tim-scott-alvin-bragg-is-guilty-of-trying-to-frame-trump/\">Tim Scott: Alvin Bragg Is Guilty of &#8216;Trying to Frame&#8217; Trump</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.breitbart.com\">Breitbart</a>.</p>", "url": "https://www.breitbart.com/clips/2024/05/26/tim-scott-alvin-bragg-is-guilty-of-trying-to-frame-trump/", "image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2024/01/Tim-Scott-and-Donald-Trump-640x335.jpeg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-26 15:25:39", "author": "Pam Key", "authors": ["Pam Key"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": -0.034}

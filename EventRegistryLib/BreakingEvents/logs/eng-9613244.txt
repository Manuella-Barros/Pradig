In the opening session of the Assembly, WHO Director-General Dr Tedros Ghebreyesus highlighted that \"tobacco use is declining in 150 countries, and there are now 19 million fewer smokers globally than there were two years ago.\"\n\nThis day provides us the opportunity to continue highlighting the dangers associated with tobacco use and exposure to tobacco smoke.\n\nToday, we reflect on our progress in tobacco control while recognizing the challenges in our efforts to stop the tactics employed by the tobacco industry to frustrate tobacco control efforts.\n\nThis year's theme, \"Protecting children from tobacco industry interference\" is aimed at mobilizing international efforts to shield young people from harmful tobacco and nicotine products and the deceptive strategies often used by the tobacco industry to market their products.\n\nBy this theme, young people across the world have a platform to call out for the tobacco industry to stop targeting them with products that are harmful to their health.\n\nGlobally, more than 37 million young people aged between 13 and 15 years are using tobacco. In the African Region, tobacco use among young people aged 13 to 15 years is at 11.1% for boys and 7.2% for girls, which is about 7 million tobacco users.\n\nAn estimated 1.3 million people die from second-hand smoke every year. These deaths are entirely preventable. People exposed to second-hand tobacco smoke are at risk of dying from heart disease, stroke, respiratory diseases, type 2 diabetes, and cancers.\n\nAs part of efforts to protect people, especially young people, from tobacco industry interference, we support our Member States in the African Region to sustain a consistent momentum in tobacco control by pushing for robust tobacco regulations, stringent controls on marketing strategies for new and emerging tobacco and nicotine products which are often designed to attract young people.\n\nDue to our efforts, 45 countries in the African region have ratified the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, WHO FCTC, and 22 have ratified the protocol to eliminate illicit trade in tobacco products. Twenty-two countries have adopted new tobacco control laws that have enabled them to implement the provisions of the tobacco control framework effectively. These national legislations have resulted in accelerated implementation of the WHO FCTC in more than 35 countries and contributed significantly to the downward trends in the prevalence of tobacco use in the region.\n\nIn addition, the prevalence of tobacco use among adults in the region has declined from 14.9% in 2010 to 9.5% in 2023. The 2023 WHO Global Report on Trends has shown that 22 countries in the African region are on track to achieve a 30% reduction by the year 2025 relative to 2010 rates1. In an innovative measure to counter increasing tobacco leaf production, WHO and other UN agencies and governments have supported over 5000 tobacco farmers in Kenya and Zambia to switch to alternative crops.\n\nWe know that young people in the region are exposed to tobacco products through extensive social media and streaming platform campaigns, as well as the use of social media influencers to promote tobacco products to the youth covertly. This poses a significant threat to their health and well-being.\n\nWe also know that the tobacco industry isn't just in the business of producing, marketing, and selling tobacco products. It also spends considerable time and funds promoting misleading science, lobbying, and performing so-called corporate social responsibility activities. These tactics are meant to attract young people and to influence policies to favor its commercial interests over public health.\n\nAs tobacco use continues to decline among adults, the tobacco industry has diversified its arsenal to attack and subvert any strong tobacco control efforts and has been trying to grow its portfolio, adding new markets for tobacco and nicotine products. The industry uses marketing strategies for new products specially designed to appeal to youth, such as e-cigarettes, flavoured products, smokeless tobacco, snus, and pouches that are aggressively promoted through social media.\n\nThis shows that more efforts are still needed to stop the tobacco industry's relentless efforts to market its products to young people.\n\nAs WHO, we continue working closely with governments to address the barriers to effective response and speed up the momentum to protect Africa's young people from tobacco use.\n\nI urge our Member States in the African Region to step up their efforts to protect young people from tobacco industry interference by:\n\nAs an organization, we encourage countries to accelerate their implementation of the WHO FCTC with stringent measures on marketing new and emerging tobacco and nicotine products, particularly designed to appeal to youth. These include shisha, e-cigarettes (flavored products), nicotine pouches, and others that are aggressively promoted through social media platforms.\n\nCountries should implement and enforce a 100% ban on public smoking and the use of electronic cigarettes (vaping), apply excise tax and price measures to reduce tobacco consumption and implement effective measures to communicate health risks through graphic health warnings to populations, including children and youth.\n\nI encourage all our partners, including other UN agencies, civil society organizations, non-governmental organizations, academia, and communities, to raise awareness about the risks of tobacco use and to support strong measures that shield the African youth from the harm of tobacco products -- and deceptive advertising practices of the tobacco industry.\n\nLearn more:\n\nWHO 2023: WHO global report on trends in prevalence of tobacco use 2000-2025 Fifth Edition.\n\nWHO 2023: WHO global report on trends in prevalence

By raising awareness, strengthening policies, and supporting cessation efforts, we can move closer to a tobacco-free world\n\nEvery year on May 31, the world comes together to observe World No Tobacco Day. This day, created by the Member States of the World Health Organisation (WHO) in 1987, aims to draw global attention to the tobacco epidemic and the preventable deaths and diseases it causes. World No Tobacco Day highlights the importance of raising awareness about the dangers of tobacco use, exposing the tactics of tobacco companies, and promoting the fight against this global health crisis. This annual event serves as a powerful reminder of our duty to protect our health and the health of future generations.\n\nWorld No Tobacco Day began with the World Health Assembly's Resolution WHA40.38 in 1987, which called for a World No-Smoking Day on April 7, 1988. Resolution WHA42.19 in 1988 gained momentum with the initiative, establishing May 31 as World No Tobacco Day. This day shines a spotlight on the health risks associated with tobacco use and advocates for effective policies to reduce tobacco consumption.\n\nTobacco use remains one of the leading causes of preventable death worldwide. According to the WHO, tobacco kills more than 8 million people each year, including over 1.2 million non-smokers exposed to second-hand smoke. The tobacco epidemic is not just a health crisis; it also places a significant economic burden on societies, with tobacco-related illnesses leading to substantial healthcare costs and lost productivity.\n\nIn India, the situation is particularly alarming. The country is the second-largest consumer and producer of tobacco globally, with a significant portion of its population using tobacco. The Tobacco Atlas reports that nearly 28.6 per cent of adults and about 15 per cent of children aged 13 to 15 use tobacco in some form. The consequences are dire, with tobacco-related diseases causing almost 13 per cent of all deaths in India.\n\nIn India, smokeless tobacco products, such as gutka, khaini, and betel quid, are particularly prevalent. These products often attract users at a young age. Studies show that children as young as 9 to 10 years old start using these products, leading to early addiction and a lifelong struggle with tobacco dependence.\n\nThe health implications of smokeless tobacco use are severe. It is a major cause of oral cancer, which accounts for a significant portion of cancer cases in India. Additionally, smokeless tobacco use leads to other health issues like gum disease, tooth decay, cardiovascular disease, decreased sperm counts and early abortions. Early initiation compounds these health risks, as prolonged exposure to harmful chemicals in tobacco leads to more significant health problems over time.\n\nEarly initiation of tobacco use among children and adolescents is a growing concern in India. The onset of tobacco use at a young age often results in poor health outcomes, including lower Body Mass Index (BMI) among adolescents and youth. This early exposure to nicotine and other harmful substances stunts growth, impairs cognitive development, and increases the likelihood of addiction.\n\nThe daily consumption of smokeless tobacco products like khaini significantly impacts household finances. The cost of these products takes up a substantial portion of household income, which could otherwise be used for essential needs such as nutrition, education, and healthcare. This economic burden exacerbates poverty and limits opportunities for upward mobility, especially in low-income households.\n\nWhile traditional tobacco products continue to pose significant health risks, e-cigarettes have emerged as a new threat. Marketed as a safer alternative to smoking, e-cigarettes often attract young users with flavours and sleek designs. However, studies show that e-cigarettes can lead to nicotine addiction and serve as a gateway to traditional tobacco use. The long-term health effects of e-cigarette use are still being studied, but early evidence suggests potential harm to lung health and increased risk of cardiovascular disease.\n\nTobacco companies target vulnerable populations, especially children and adolescents. In India, studies show that tobacco companies often advertise products around schools and use tactics designed to appeal to children. They sell single cigarettes, which are more affordable for children, and place tobacco products alongside candies and toys to attract young buyers.\n\nThe prevalence of tobacco use among children in India is disturbingly high. A study conducted in Gujarat revealed that 53.2 per cent of children aged 9 to 13 use tobacco products. The easy accessibility of tobacco products and the influence of family members who use tobacco are significant factors contributing to this high prevalence.\n\nDespite laws like the Cigarettes and Other Tobacco Products Act (COTPA) of 2003, which prohibits the sale of tobacco to minors and bans tobacco advertising within 100 yards of schools, enforcement remains weak. This lax enforcement allows tobacco companies to continue targeting children and adolescents with their marketing strategies.\n\nThe WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC), an international treaty adopted in 2003, provides a comprehensive approach to reducing tobacco use through measures like banning tobacco advertising, increasing tobacco taxes, and creating smoke-free environments. However, these measures are only effective with robust implementation and enforcement at national and local levels.\n\nIndia's demographic dividend presents a unique opportunity for economic growth and development. However, this potential can only be realised if the youth population is healthy and capable of contributing productively to society. Early initiation of tobacco use undermines this potential by compromising the health and well-being of young people.\n\nChildren are the future of our nation, and protecting them from the dangers of tobacco is imperative. Early initiation of tobacco use among children has long-lasting effects, leading to lifelong addiction and significant health burdens. Therefore, it is crucial to focus on preventing tobacco use among children and adolescents.\n\nWorld No Tobacco Day is a powerful reminder of the ongoing battle against the tobacco epidemic. It is a day to reflect on the progress made, acknowledge the challenges that remain, and recommit to protecting our health and the health of future generations. By raising awareness, strengthening policies, and supporting cessation efforts, we can move closer to a tobacco-free world. Let's join hands in this fight and take a stand against tobacco, ensuring a healthier future for all.", "source": {"uri": "news18.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News18"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_No_Tobacco_Day", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "World No Tobacco Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smokeless_tobacco", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Smokeless tobacco"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco_smoking", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tobacco smoking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tobacco"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence_of_tobacco_use", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Prevalence of tobacco use"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tobacco industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_cigarette", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Electronic cigarette"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "World Health Organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolescence", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Adolescence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tobacco_products", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "List of tobacco products"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passive_smoking", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Passive smoking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Assembly", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World Health Assembly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Global health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Productivity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Addiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiovascular_disease", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cardiovascular disease"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_state_of_the_European_Union", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Member state of the European Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Health care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth_decay", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tooth decay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Betel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gujarat", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gujarat"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gujarat"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Health", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Health", "wgt": 68}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Specific_Substances", "label": "dmoz/Health/Specific Substances", "wgt": 63}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Specific_Substances/Tobacco", "label": "dmoz/Health/Specific Substances/Tobacco", "wgt": 65}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Women's_Health/Smoking", "label": "dmoz/Health/Women's Health/Smoking", "wgt": 43}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Tobacco/Cigarettes", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Tobacco/Cigarettes", "wgt": 59}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://images.news18.com/ibnlive/uploads/2024/05/world-no-tobacco-day-2024-2024-05-b732f8a138d495399e1e46ba7857a5f8-16x9.jpg?impolicy=website&width=1200&height=675", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9613244", "eventUri": "eng-9613244", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-31", "textStart": 243, "textEnd": 249, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": -0.04313725490196074, "wgt": 227, "relevance": 1}

These deaths are entirely preventable. People exposed to second-hand tobacco smoke are at risk of dying from heart disease, stroke, respiratory diseases, type 2 diabetes, and cancers,\" she said.\n\nThe Regional Director noted that the organisation supports member states to sustain a consistent momentum in tobacco control by pushing for robust tobacco regulations, and stringent controls on marketing strategies for new and emerging tobacco and nicotine products which are often designed to attract young people.\n\n\"Due to our efforts, 45 countries in the African region have ratified the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, and 22 have ratified the protocol to eliminate illicit trade in tobacco products. Twenty-two countries have adopted new tobacco control laws that have enabled them to implement the provisions of the tobacco control framework effectively.\n\n\"These national legislations have resulted in accelerated implementation of the WHO FCTC in more than 35 countries and contributed significantly to the downward trends in the prevalence of tobacco use in the region,\" she added.\n\nShe, however, said the prevalence of tobacco use among adults in the region has declined from 14.9 per cent in 2010 to 9.5 per cent in 2023, and 22 countries in the African region are on track to achieve a 30 per cent reduction by the year 2025 relative to 2010 rates.\n\nShe highlighted that the tobacco industry spends considerable time and funds promoting misleading science, lobbying, and performing so-called corporate social responsibility activities as tactics to attract young people and to influence policies to favour its commercial interests over public health.\n\n\"This shows that more efforts are still needed to stop the tobacco industry's relentless efforts to market its products to young people. As WHO, we continue working closely with governments to address the barriers to effective response and speed up the momentum to protect Africa's young people from tobacco use.\n\n\"I urge our Member States in the African Region to step up their efforts to protect young people from tobacco industry interference by ensuring governments honour and abide by their obligations under WHO FCTC Article 5.3 by introducing safeguards to protect the tobacco-control policy from tobacco industry interference; countering tobacco industry tactics through evidence-based arguments and best practices with full involvement of civil society organisations.\n\n\"Raising awareness among the public on the tactics of the tobacco industry; and exposing industry efforts to target youth and attract generations of people with addiction through innovative approaches, including marketing new and emerging products and using flavours.\"\n\nShe added, \"As an organisation, we encourage countries to accelerate their implementation of the WHO FCTC with stringent measures on marketing new and emerging tobacco and nicotine products, particularly designed to appeal to youth. These include shisha, e-cigarettes (flavoured products), nicotine pouches, and others that are aggressively promoted through social media platforms.\n\n\"Countries should implement and enforce a 100 per cent ban on public smoking and the use of electronic cigarettes (vaping), apply excise tax and price measures to reduce tobacco consumption, and implement effective measures to communicate health risks through graphic health warnings to populations, including children and youth.\"", "source": {"uri": "punchng.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Punch Newspapers"}, "authors": [{"uri": "lara_adejoro@punchng.com", "name": "Lara Adejoro", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tobacco industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco_control", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tobacco control"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco_smoking", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tobacco smoking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tobacco"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tobacco_products", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "List of tobacco products"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "World Health Organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco_smoke", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tobacco smoke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_No_Tobacco_Day", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World No Tobacco Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passive_smoking", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Passive smoking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Who", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Who"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nicotine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Africa"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_2_diabetes", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Type 2 diabetes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WHO_Framework_Convention_on_Tobacco_Control", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prevalence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing_strategy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marketing strategy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_disease", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Respiratory disease"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Treaty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroke", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stroke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiovascular_disease", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cardiovascular disease"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_state_of_the_European_Union", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Member state of the European Union"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Health", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Health", "wgt": 66}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Specific_Substances", "label": "dmoz/Health/Specific Substances", "wgt": 59}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Specific_Substances/Tobacco", "label": "dmoz/Health/Specific Substances/Tobacco", "wgt": 62}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Women's_Health/Smoking", "label": "dmoz/Health/Women's Health/Smoking", "wgt": 40}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Tobacco/Cigarettes", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Tobacco/Cigarettes", "wgt": 55}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/08024607/smoking-tobacco.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9613244", "eventUri": "eng-9613244", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-31", "textStart": 446, "textEnd": 452}], "sentiment": -0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 221, "relevance": 1}

Youth-led initiatives are powerful tools for change, promoting peer-to-peer education and support. Together, we can create a tobacco-free generation and ensure a healthier, brighter future for our youth,\" she says.\n\nThe importance of World No Tobacco Day, observed annually on May 31st highlights the health risks associated with tobacco use and advocates for effective policies to reduce tobacco consumption. Tobacco is one of the leading causes of preventable deaths worldwide, claiming over 7 million lives each year. Beyond it is well-known that tobacco use is associated with a wide range of cancers due to the numerous carcinogens present in tobacco smoke.\n\nTobacco consumption is linked to types of cancer affecting body parts such as the oral cavity, lungs, liver, stomach, bowel, ovaries and certain forms of leukaemia.\n\nGlobally, it accounts for 25% of all cancer-related deaths, approximately 2.5 million deaths. Notably, smoking alone contributes to 85% of lung cancer deaths, underscoring the need for collaborative actions worldwide to combat tobacco use.\n\nTobacco use is also a major contributor to heart disease, responsible for approximately 12% of all heart disease deaths. And the impact of second-hand smoke is equally alarming, causing nearly 900,000 deaths annually.\n\nThe focus of WNTD 2024 is revolving around safeguarding youth from being targeted by tobacco products. This initiative serves as a platform for people, policymakers, civil society organizations and advocates in tobacco control to address this issue and call upon governments to implement measures that protect people from tobacco companies' marketing tactics.\n\nChildren and young people are affected by the effects of tobacco production and consumption. Governments therefore have great responsibility for this particularly vulnerable group and thus needs to protect and fulfil their rights as recognized in the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC).\n\nThe entirety of children's rights leads to the conclusion that, children have a right to a tobacco-free world and have the right to be protected from the tobacco industry, i.e., not to be exploited in tobacco cultivation, to live in a smoke-free environment that protects them from secondhand smoke as well as from starting to smoke themselves and to have access to smoking cessation support if they have become addicted to tobacco.\n\nFurther, youth have been particularly vulnerable to the harmful effects of tobacco.

Various products such as cigars and cigarettes are made using leaf tobacco as raw material, which is intended to be smoked, sucked, chewed or snuffed. These products contain a highly addictive psychoactive ingredient, nicotine. Those who consume them are vulnerable to health issues regarding the heart, lungs and liver. Meanwhile, tobacco smoke contains many chemicals that are harmful when exposed to human beings. Hence, tobacco use is always problematic.\n\nEvery year, May 31 is celebrated as World No Tobacco Day. This year's theme is \"Tobacco: Protecting Children from Tobacco Industry Interference.\" Last year it was \"Tobacco: Threat to our environment.\"\n\nIt indicates the impact of tobacco on the environment and people's health. The main aim of the annual campaign of WNTD 2022 is to raise awareness among the public on the environmental impact of tobacco from its cultivation, production and distribution to waste management.\n\nBecause a significant portion of the Nepali population consumes tobacco products, it has remained an epidemic here. Hence, raising awareness about the impact of tobacco use on health and the environment is crucial in this country.\n\nCigarette smoking is the most common form of tobacco use worldwide. Other tobacco products include water pipe tobacco, various smokeless tobacco products, cigars, cigarillos, roll-your-own tobacco, pipe tobacco, bidis and kreteks.\n\nIn recent days, e-cigarettes are also in demand. E-cigarettes are devices that heat a liquid to create an aerosol, which is then inhaled by the user. E-cigarettes do not contain tobacco, but are harmful to health and are not safe.\n\nOver 80% of the 1.3 billion tobacco users worldwide live in developing and underdeveloped countries. These countries have high death rates due to tobacco use-related illnesses.\n\nTobacco use continues to be a significant burden among the Nepalis as well. According to the recent STEPS Survey 2019 carried out by Nepal Health Research Council (NHRC), 28.9% of adults belonging to 15 - 69 years of age currently use tobacco in different forms including smoked or smokeless, and this accounts for 3,800,000 adults. The overall prevalence rate of tobacco use was found to be 36.8% by the NHRC in its study conducted between 2016 and 2018.\n\nTherefore, tobacco use can be said to be an ever-prevalent epidemic in Nepal.\n\nBreathing any amount of tobacco smoke can be harmful as there is no safe level of exposure to tobacco. Moreover, tobacco use contributes to poverty by diverting household spending from basic needs such as food and shelter to tobacco.\n\nThe tobacco epidemic is one of the biggest public health threats the world has ever faced, killing more than 8 million people a year, including around 1.2 million deaths from exposure to secondhand smoke.\n\nIn the past two decades, the epidemiological transition from communicable to non-communicable diseases has been highlighted due to lifestyle changes, increasing sedentary behaviour, tobacco use, unhealthy eating and harmful use of alcohol in Nepal.\n\nTobacco use is considered the major risk factor for the majority of these conditions. In fact, every year in Nepal, on average, 27,137 people are killed by tobacco-caused diseases, a majority of them due to cardiovascular diseases (53%) followed by chronic respiratory diseases (21%).\n\nSmoking can cause cancer anywhere in the body including the organs like the lungs, bladder, cervix, colon, rectum, liver, mouth, stomach, pancreas and blood. Nine out of 10 lung cancers are caused by smoking cigarettes or secondhand smoke exposure. Smokers today have a higher risk of lung cancer than in the past due to the change in how cigarettes are manufactured. Smoking not only causes physical problems but can also affect mental health as there are chances that smokers face fear, guilt, depression and more. Likewise, in infants, it causes sudden death syndrome. In pregnant women, it causes low birth weight.\n\nTobacco also affects the environment as much as they affect our health. Every year 3.5 hectares of land are used to grow tobacco, and it causes deforestation and soil degradation. Tobacco production requires a large amount of pesticides. For cultivation, tobacco requires a large amount of water (about 22 trillion litres) and it heavily affects the ecosystem. About 4.5 trillion cigarette butts are not discarded, creating plastic pollution. Smoking tobacco produces carbon dioxide that leads to global warming. Tobacco smoke also contributes to elevated air pollution that directly affects our environment. Likewise, 27.2 million tons of material resources are needed to make cigarettes, depleting precious fossil fuel and metal resources.\n\nA WHO report informs that 600 million trees are chopped down to make cigarettes, and 84 million tons of CO2 emissions are released into the air raising global temperatures. Likewise, 22 billion tons of water are used to make cigarettes. The harmful impact of the tobacco industry on the environment is vast and growing, adding unnecessary pressure to our planet's already scarce resources and fragile ecosystem.\n\nAlmost half of the world's total air is polluted by tobacco smoke. Neither ventilation nor filtration, even in combination, can reduce tobacco smoke exposure indoors to levels that are considered acceptable.\n\nPrevention is the most cost-effective measure. Many countries around the world have already introduced laws to protect people from exposure to tobacco smoke in public places. Celebrations around the globe on World No Tobacco Day encourage more people and more countries to go smoke-free. It also includes a strong emphasis on raising the salience of tobacco use control with politicians and policymakers, and on providing analysis which will support those in government in their efforts to control tobacco.\n\nIn Nepal, recent budget plans have started to increase taxation. Prices have increased over time, however, in real terms, tobacco has become slightly more affordable due to wage increases.

This was done to draw attention to the global tobacco epidemic, and the preventable death and disease it causes.\n\nEvery year, this day reminds us of the dangers of tobacco, and informs us about what our Organization is doing to fight this epidemic. It informs people around the world about what they can do to claim their right to health, and how to protect future generations. It also shines a light on the business practices of tobacco companies.\n\nThis year, World No Tobacco Day calls on us all to protect children from the interference of the tobacco industry. Young people across the world are calling for the tobacco industry to stop targeting them with products that are harmful to their health. They are calling on governments to adopt policies to protect them from the manipulative practices of tobacco and related industries. This includes the relentless marketing of their dangerous products through social media and streaming platforms.\n\nThe fight against tobacco is particularly important for us in South-East Asia. The tobacco industry's targeting of youth is rampant across our Member States. As a result, we have a very worrying 11 million adolescents using various tobacco products. Coupled with the approximate 411 million adult tobacco users, our Region, unfortunately, has the highest number of adolescent and adult users globally.\n\nThe industry lures youth by aggressively introducing new nicotine and tobacco products such as electronic cigarettes and heated tobacco products. These are becoming increasingly popular with the youth in our Region. It is worrying that children and adolescents are regularly exposed to the digital marketing of tobacco products. This is despite having policies and regulations in place to prevent this.\n\nThis situation is likely to get worse, as youngsters spend more time on social media and other similar platforms. Personalized and targeted advertising by the industry appears to dominate here, exposing them to harm. This multibillion-dollar industry recruits 'new' users to reward their investors with even more profits. To achieve this, it preys on children and adolescents through marketing tactics, targeting them with new products. The tobacco industry moves with speed to launch new products, using every means to expand market share before regulations can catch up.\n\nThey continue to oppose evidence-based measures, such as increases in excise taxes, and comprehensive bans on tobacco advertising, promotions and sponsorships. They even threaten legal action against governments that try to protect the health of their citizens. Unfortunately, the response from governments and institutions is lagging. Our efforts are complicated by the rapid changes in the marketing strategies of the tobacco industry.\n\nIt is imperative that the relevant provisions of the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (WHO FCTC) - including Article 5.3 - are implemented in letter and spirit. Also, tools and support are urgently needed to facilitate monitoring and implementation of the WHO FCTC recommendations in 'online' settings.\n\nOur goal for our youth is clear. We want to prevent and reduce tobacco consumption, nicotine addiction, and exposure to new tobacco products. To do this, we need a multistakeholder approach to frame and implement legislation, policies, regulations and administrative measures. This approach needs to cast a wide net. We should engage with all relevant government departments, UN and intergovernmental organizations, civil society, the private sector, academia, and the community, including students, teachers and parents.\n\nA generational tobacco ban, leading to a 'Tobacco-Free Generation', would be a huge step forward for our Region. For this to happen, the WHO FCTC must be recognized as a legally binding international instrument by all our Member States. This ban will require effective enforcement of existing policies, including confronting tobacco industry interference and institutional corruption surrounding the illicit tobacco trade. The governments and tobacco control advocates in the Region must proactively take an evidence-based stance that pre-empts biased arguments against progressive tobacco control measures.\n\nThe opportunity to pass a generational ban must be supported with political will, clear foresight and pragmatic implementation. Only then can we realize the goal of a 'Tobacco-Free Generation' across our Region in the very near future.", "source": {"uri": "who.int", "dataType": "news", "title": "who.int"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tobacco_products", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "List of tobacco products"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_No_Tobacco_Day", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "World No Tobacco Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tobacco industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tobacco"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "World Health Organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeast_Asia", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Southeast Asia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_state_of_the_European_Union", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Member state of the European Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolescence", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Adolescence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Marketing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence_of_tobacco_use", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prevalence of tobacco use"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Right to health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Epidemic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heated_tobacco_product", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Heated tobacco product"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Who", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Who"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_cigarette", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electronic cigarette"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_share", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Market share"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nicotine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotine_marketing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nicotine marketing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WHO_Framework_Convention_on_Tobacco_Control", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Nations"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Health", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Health", "wgt": 66}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Specific_Substances", "label": "dmoz/Health/Specific Substances", "wgt": 54}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Specific_Substances/Tobacco", "label": "dmoz/Health/Specific Substances/Tobacco", "wgt": 57}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Tobacco/Magazines_and_E-zines", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Tobacco/Magazines and E-zines", "wgt": 38}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Tobacco/Cigarettes", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Tobacco/Cigarettes", "wgt": 54}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 86}], "image": "https://cdn.who.int/media/images/default-source/who-campaigns/world-no-tobacco-day-2024/banner-image-resized.tmb-1200v.jpg?sfvrsn=17e2b86b_7", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9613244", "eventUri": "eng-9613244", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-31", "textStart": 221, "textEnd": 227}], "sentiment": -0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 218, "relevance": 1}

These deaths are entirely preventable. People exposed to second-hand tobacco smoke are at risk of dying from heart disease, stroke, respiratory diseases, type 2 diabetes, and cancers,\" she said.\n\nThe Regional Director noted that the organisation supports member states to sustain a consistent momentum in tobacco control by pushing for robust tobacco regulations, and stringent controls on marketing strategies for new and emerging tobacco and nicotine products which are often designed to attract young people.\n\n\"Due to our efforts, 45 countries in the African region have ratified the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, and 22 have ratified the protocol to eliminate illicit trade in tobacco products. Twenty-two countries have adopted new tobacco control laws that have enabled them to implement the provisions of the tobacco control framework effectively.\n\n\"These national legislations have resulted in accelerated implementation of the WHO FCTC in more than 35 countries and contributed significantly to the downward trends in the prevalence of tobacco use in the region,\" she added.\n\nShe, however, said the prevalence of tobacco use among adults in the region has declined from 14.9 per cent in 2010 to 9.5 per cent in 2023, and 22 countries in the African region are on track to achieve a 30 per cent reduction by the year 2025 relative to 2010 rates.\n\nMoeti noted that the tobacco industry spends considerable time and funds promoting misleading science, lobbying, and engaging in so-called corporate social responsibility activities as tactics to attract young people and influence policies in favour of its commercial interests over public health.\n\n\"This shows that more efforts are still needed to stop the tobacco industry's relentless efforts to market its products to young people. As WHO, we continue working closely with governments to address the barriers to effective response and speed up the momentum to protect Africa's young people from tobacco use.\n\n\"I urge our Member States in the African Region to step up their efforts to protect young people from tobacco industry interference by ensuring governments honour and abide by their obligations under WHO FCTC Article 5.3 by introducing safeguards to protect the tobacco-control policy from tobacco industry interference; countering tobacco industry tactics through evidence-based arguments and best practices with full involvement of civil society organisations.\n\n\"Raising awareness among the public on the tactics of the tobacco industry; and exposing industry efforts to target youth and attract generations of people with addiction through innovative approaches, including marketing new and emerging products and using flavours.\n\n\"As an organisation, we encourage countries to accelerate their implementation of the WHO FCTC with stringent measures on marketing new and emerging tobacco and nicotine products, particularly designed to appeal to youth. These include shisha, e-cigarettes (flavoured products), nicotine pouches, and others that are aggressively promoted through social media platforms.\n\n\"Countries should implement and enforce a 100 per cent ban on public smoking and the use of electronic cigarettes (vaping), apply excise tax and price measures to reduce tobacco consumption, and implement effective measures to communicate health risks through graphic health warnings to populations, including children and youth,\" she concluded.", "source": {"uri": "healthwise.punchng.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Healthwise"}, "authors": [{"uri": "lara_adejoro@healthwise.punchng.com", "name": "Lara Adejoro", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tobacco industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco_control", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tobacco control"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco_smoking", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tobacco smoking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tobacco"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tobacco_products", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "List of tobacco products"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco_smoke", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tobacco smoke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_No_Tobacco_Day", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World No Tobacco Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passive_smoking", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Passive smoking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Who", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Who"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nicotine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World Health Organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Africa"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_2_diabetes", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Type 2 diabetes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WHO_Framework_Convention_on_Tobacco_Control", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prevalence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_disease", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Respiratory disease"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Treaty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroke", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stroke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiovascular_disease", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cardiovascular disease"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_state_of_the_European_Union", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Member state of the European Union"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Health", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Health", "wgt": 65}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Specific_Substances", "label": "dmoz/Health/Specific Substances", "wgt": 57}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Specific_Substances/Tobacco", "label": "dmoz/Health/Specific Substances/Tobacco", "wgt": 60}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Women's_Health/Smoking", "label": "dmoz/Health/Women's Health/Smoking", "wgt": 39}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Tobacco/Cigarettes", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Tobacco/Cigarettes", "wgt": 54}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://healthwise.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Smoking-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9613244", "eventUri": "eng-9613244", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-31", "textStart": 592, "textEnd": 598}], "sentiment": -0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 218, "relevance": 1}

It also provides flavoured tobacco products to entice first-time consumers by masking its harshness. Young people are especially susceptible to these marketing strategies.\n\nIn a world where the health and well-being of our youth are paramount, fighting against the tobacco industry is a big challenge. We need to be aware of how tobacco companies try to get young people hooked on to their products. They use sneaky tricks to make smoking seem cool and fun, even though it's bad for the health, pushing them into a lifetime of addiction and health risks.\n\nTo protect children from the influence of the tobacco industry, a combined effort is required from governments, communities, international organizations and family of youths. World No Tobacco Day reminds us of the need to protect our children from the harmful influence of the tobacco industry. This year's theme emphasizes our collective responsibility to act decisively and prevent the next generation from falling into the trap of tobacco addiction. By implementing strong policies, enforcing strict regulations, and fostering environments that support tobacco-free living, we can shield young people from the dangers of tobacco and build a healthier future for everyone.\n\nAccording to Dr Raja Dhar, Director & HOD, Department of Pulmonology, Calcutta Medical Research Institute (CMRI), \"Nicotine is the most addictive substance known to mankind, with tobacco smoking being the most prevalent addiction across the world. It is estimated that over one billion people smoke some form of tobacco globally. In India, about 1 in 3 of the adult population use tobacco in some form or the other. Almost 10% of the population are addicted to smoking and more than 20% use smokeless tobacco.\"\n\nThe tobacco industry uses various strategies to lure young people into using tobacco by creating appealing advertisements and colourful packaging and youth-centric marketing campaigns. They also introduce flavoured tobacco products that mask the harshness of tobacco, making it more attractive to first-time users. Children and teenagers are particularly vulnerable to these marketing tactics.\n\nExposure to tobacco advertising significantly increases the chances that young people will start smoking. Starting to use tobacco at a young age often leads to heavier use, higher dependency, and greater difficulty quitting later in life.\n\n\"Across the world, there are 1.35 million deaths per year from the use of tobacco, a lot more than that from malaria, TB & HIV combined. The reason we celebrate World No Tobacco Day is because tobacco has turned out to be the greatest killer with diseases like chronic lung disease, oral cancer, stroke, heart disease and other lung problems occurring due to the use of tobacco.

The day is observed to educate the public about the health risks associated with tobacco use, including smoking and smokeless tobacco products, and highlight the importance of quitting tobacco and encourage governments, organisations, and individuals to take action against tobacco use.\n\nCelebrated around the world every year on May 31, World No Tobacco Day was created by the Member States of WHO in 1987 to draw global attention to the tobacco epidemic and the preventable death and disease it causes.\n\nHistory and Significance\n\nThe origins of World No Tobacco Day date back to 1987 when the World Health Assembly passed Resolution WHA40.38, calling for April 7, 1988, to be \"a world no-smoking day.\" This initial resolution aimed to provide a single day for people to abstain from smoking and to raise global awareness about the tobacco epidemic. The following year, in 1988, the World Health Assembly passed another resolution, WHA 42.19, designating May 31 as World No Tobacco Day, to be observed annually.\n\nAnti-Tobacco Day serves as a reminder of the devastating impact of tobacco on individuals, families, and communities. It aims to encourage smokers to quit and to prevent young people from starting the habit. By raising awareness and promoting tobacco control measures, Anti-Tobacco Day plays a vital role in reducing the burden of tobacco-related diseases and promoting a healthier society.\n\nThe Impact of Tobacco Use\n\nTobacco use is a leading cause of preventable illness and death worldwide. Smoking and the use of smokeless tobacco products are linked to numerous health problems, including heart disease, stroke, chronic respiratory diseases, and various forms of cancer. The addictive nature of nicotine makes quitting difficult, but the health benefits of stopping tobacco use are substantial and immediate.\n\nPublic health campaigns, education initiatives, and stricter regulations on tobacco advertising and sales are critical components in the fight against tobacco use. Anti-Tobacco Day amplifies these efforts by drawing attention to the importance of tobacco control and the need for ongoing vigilance to protect public health.", "source": {"uri": "republicworld.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Republic World"}, "authors": [{"uri": "digital_desk@republicworld.com", "name": "Digital Desk", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_No_Tobacco_Day", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "World No Tobacco Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco_smoking", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tobacco smoking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tobacco"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoking", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Smoking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "World Health Organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence_of_tobacco_use", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prevalence of tobacco use"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smokeless_tobacco", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Smokeless tobacco"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Assembly", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World Health Assembly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotine_marketing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nicotine marketing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco_control", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tobacco control"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_disease", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Respiratory disease"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroke", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stroke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nicotine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiovascular_disease", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cardiovascular disease"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Public health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cancer"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Health", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Health", "wgt": 67}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Specific_Substances", "label": "dmoz/Health/Specific Substances", "wgt": 62}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Specific_Substances/Tobacco", "label": "dmoz/Health/Specific Substances/Tobacco", "wgt": 65}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Women's_Health/Smoking", "label": "dmoz/Health/Women's Health/Smoking", "wgt": 43}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Tobacco/Cigarettes", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Tobacco/Cigarettes", "wgt": 61}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://img.republicworld.com/rimages/istockphoto-505525860-170667a-171712845478516_9.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9613244", "eventUri": "eng-9613244", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-31", "textStart": 592, "textEnd": 598, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 217, "relevance": 1}

Expert. Dr. Nuran G\u00f6kbulut also drew attention to electronic cigarettes, which are marketed as \"reduced harm products\": They are no different from tobacco.\n\nElectronic Cigarettes Are Offered to the Market as a Harm Reduced Product\n\nTobacco and tobacco products pave the way for many deadly diseases, especially cancer. Stating that 8 million people are affected by tobacco and tobacco products every year, G\u00f6kbulut said, \"Tobacco and tobacco products cause many respiratory diseases such as lung cancer, asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Some diseases are more common in smokers than in non-smokers. While at least more than 8 million people in the world are affected by tobacco and tobacco products every year, tobacco companies introduce electronic cigarettes to the market as a 'reduced harm product.'\" Drawing attention to the harms of cigarettes on May 31, World No Tobacco Day, G\u00f6kbulut stated that electronic cigarettes are no different from tobacco.\n\nAll cigarette smoke is a risk factor\n\n\"Nicotine found in tobacco is the main cause of addiction and its addictive effect is very high,\" said Specialist. Dr. G\u00f6kbulut noted that the dose is not important for the damage caused by nicotine and other harmful substances in the smoke and said, \"Cigarette smoke inhaled with each breath is a risk factor for other diseases, especially cancer.\"\n\nTobacco and Tobacco Products are the cause of many diseases, especially cancer.\n\nSpecialist Dr. G\u00f6kbulut said that tobacco and tobacco products form the basis of many respiratory diseases such as lung cancer, asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and said: \"In addition, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, hypertension, gastrointestinal diseases, brain dysfunctions, forgetfulness, Eye pressure, reproductive system disorders and some skin diseases are more common in smokers than in non-smokers.\" Referring to WHO data, G\u00f6kbulut said that 1.3 percent of the 80 billion people who use tobacco products in the world live in low- and middle-income countries and said, \"Half of the children in the world are exposed to tobacco smoke and 65.000 children die every year due to diseases related to passive tobacco use.\" G\u00f6kbulut reported that those over the age of 15 in Turkey who do not use tobacco products constitute approximately 70 percent of the population.\n\nSmoking affects the baby in the womb\n\nTouching on the effects of using tobacco products during pregnancy on the expectant mother and the baby, G\u00f6kbulut said, \"It causes various lifelong health problems for babies. \"Even passive contact causes fatal harm to people who do not use tobacco,\" he said.\n\nElectronic cigarettes are no different from tobacco\n\nG\u00f6kbulut pointed out that the tobacco industry is shrinking as a result of the fight against tobacco products, and said, \"In order to expand the market again, companies are marketing electronic cigarettes as 'reduced harm products' under the name 'electronic cigarettes and heated tobacco products'.\" Thus, it is aimed to destroy the perception that tobacco products are harmful. Electronic liquids in electronic cigarettes contain flavoring and liquid nicotine, and their transformation from liquid to smoke occurs through special heating mechanisms. \"Although they are marketed as 'innocent water vapor', they are very harmful devices, like all tobacco products,\" he said.\n\nGreen tobacco causes disease\n\nStating that the increase in the production of tobacco products causes food security problems due to the decrease in agricultural areas, G\u00f6kbulut pointed out that forests are also destroyed to make room for tobacco production. Stating that \"Tobacco farming exposes farmers and their families to serious health risks,\" G\u00f6kbulut explained its effect on people as follows: \"Due to skin contact with tobacco leaves during the tobacco production stage, the disease called green tobacco disease occurs. Disease symptoms are vomiting, dizziness, headache, abdominal pain and shortness of breath. As the exposure increases and in humid conditions that increase absorption through skin contact, one can be exposed to nicotine equivalent to 50 cigarettes per day.\" Stating that tobacco and tobacco products affect at least 8 million people in the world every year from the production stage, G\u00f6kbulut said, \"The fight against tobacco use is not only for today but also for the future.\" It is very important for the world. \"We need to say 'YES' to a Tobacco-Free World,\" he said.

These industries are actively targeting schools, children and young people with new products that are essentially a candy-flavoured trap. How can they talk about 'harm reduction' when they are marketing these dangerous, highly addictive products to children?,\" said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director-General of the WHO.\n\nThis year's theme for World No Tobacco Day - 'Protecting children from tobacco industry interference'- advocates for an end to the targeting of youth with harmful tobacco products. The tobacco industry markets fruit and candy flavoured tobacco and nicotine products like gadgets or toys in attractive packaging under the garb of less harmful novel products. In reality, these products are hooking young people across the world to a life time of dangerous addiction.\n\n\"Hooking the next generation\", a new report jointly launched by WHO and STOP, a global tobacco industry watchdog, highlights how the tobacco industry designs products, implements marketing campaigns and influences policies to help addict the youth to tobacco. According to 2022 data, globally, an estimated 37 million children aged 13-15 years use some form of tobacco, and in many countries, the rate of e-cigarette use among adolescents exceeds that of adults. 85% of 15-30-year-olds are exposed to e-cigarette advertising across multiple media platforms, and that higher rates of exposure were linked to higher rates of e-cigarette use.\n\nIn the WHO European Region 4 million 13-15 years old- 11.5% of boys and 10.1% of girls - are tobacco users. Electronic cigarettes and nicotine pouches are gaining popularity among youth. An estimated 12.5% of adolescents in this used e-cigarettes in 2022 compared to 2% of adults. In some countries of the Region, the rates of e-cigarette use among school children are 2-3 times higher than the rates of cigarette smoking.\n\nIt is a well known fact that tobacco kills half of its users prematurely. In India nearly 3600 people die every day due to tobacco use. To find replacement consumers and generate a lifetime of profits, the tobacco industry is targeting the young generation.\n\nIndia's Global Youth Tobacco Survey 2019 found that the prevalence of tobacco among school going children aged between 13-15 years was 8.4%. The survey findings also show that even before celebrating their seventh birthday, 11.4% children start smoking cigarettes, 17.2% starting smoking bidis (hand rolled cheap cigarettes) and 24% start using smokeless tobacco products. India has taken comprehensive measures to reduce tobacco use including prohibition of e-cigarettes. WHO has supported the Indian Ministry of Health and Family Welfare in setting up an online platform to report violations related to the sale and advertisement of e-cigarettes.\n\n\"The industry uses sleek marketing campaigns with new media tools and harmless looking products designed to appeal to young people, thus creating a new wave of addiction. On World No tobacco Day this year, WHO Country Office for India is launching an awareness campaign exposing industry tactics to hook a new generation of users,\" said WHO Representative to India Dr Roderico H. Ofrin.\n\nAt the recently held ASEAN Workshop on Protecting Children from Tobacco Industry Interference government officials, health advocates, and youth leaders reiterated the need to collaborate towards protecting children and youth from tobacco industry tactics. In Asia and globally, the uptake of electronic smoking devices (ESDs) by young people is increasing rapidly. In Malaysia, the prevalence of e-cigarette use among teenagers (13-15 years old) is 23.5% for boys and 6.2% for girls (2022). In Thailand, 20.2% of boys and 15% of girls were using ESDs in 2022.\n\nMaking false claims that ESDs can help smokers quit smoking cigarettes, the industry makes these newer products available in more than 16,000 flavours, most of which are candy and fruit flavors, and promotes them online to lure young people into a lifetime of nicotine addiction. \"The tobacco industry will stop at nothing to ensure that its addictive and harmful business survives and thrives. Our children are under attack,\" stated Professor (Dr) Prakit Vathesatogkit, Executive Director, Action on Smoking and Health, Thailand.\n\nAs per the 7th edition of the tobacco atlas global progress on tobacco endgame is threatened by growing smoking rates among children age 13 to 15 years in many countries and by tobacco industry tactics such as targeting poorer countries with weak regulatory environments and pushing novel products in previously untapped markets.

These industries are actively targeting schools, children and young people with new products that are essentially a candy-flavoured trap. How can they talk about 'harm reduction' when they are marketing these dangerous, highly addictive products to children?,\" said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director-General of the WHO.\n\nThis year's theme for World No Tobacco Day - 'Protecting children from tobacco industry interference'- advocates for an end to the targeting of youth with harmful tobacco products. The tobacco industry markets fruit and candy flavoured tobacco and nicotine products like gadgets or toys in attractive packaging under the garb of less harmful novel products. In reality, these products are hooking young people across the world to a life time of dangerous addiction.\n\n\"Hooking the next generation\", a new report jointly launched by WHO and STOP, a global tobacco industry watchdog, highlights how the tobacco industry designs products, implements marketing campaigns and influences policies to help addict the youth to tobacco. According to 2022 data, globally, an estimated 37 million children aged 13-15 years use some form of tobacco, and in many countries, the rate of e-cigarette use among adolescents exceeds that of adults. 85% of 15-30-year-olds are exposed to e-cigarette advertising across multiple media platforms, and that higher rates of exposure were linked to higher rates of e-cigarette use.\n\nIn the WHO European Region 4 million 13-15 years old- 11.5% of boys and 10.1% of girls - are tobacco users. Electronic cigarettes and nicotine pouches are gaining popularity among youth. An estimated 12.5% of adolescents in this used e-cigarettes in 2022 compared to 2% of adults. In some countries of the Region, the rates of e-cigarette use among school children are 2-3 times higher than the rates of cigarette smoking.\n\nIt is a well known fact that tobacco kills half of its users prematurely. In India nearly 3600 people die every day due to tobacco use. To find replacement consumers and generate a lifetime of profits, the tobacco industry is targeting the young generation.\n\nIndia's Global Youth Tobacco Survey 2019 found that the prevalence of tobacco among school going children aged between 13-15 years was 8.4%. The survey findings also show that even before celebrating their seventh birthday, 11.4% children start smoking cigarettes, 17.2% starting smoking bidis (hand rolled cheap cigarettes) and 24% start using smokeless tobacco products. India has taken comprehensive measures to reduce tobacco use including prohibition of e-cigarettes. WHO has supported the Indian Ministry of Health and Family Welfare in setting up an online platform to report violations related to the sale and advertisement of e-cigarettes.\n\n\"The industry uses sleek marketing campaigns with new media tools and harmless looking products designed to appeal to young people, thus creating a new wave of addiction. On World No tobacco Day this year, WHO Country Office for India is launching an awareness campaign exposing industry tactics to hook a new generation of users,\" said WHO Representative to India Dr Roderico H. Ofrin.\n\nAt the recently held ASEAN Workshop on Protecting Children from Tobacco Industry Interference government officials, health advocates, and youth leaders reiterated the need to collaborate towards protecting children and youth from tobacco industry tactics. In Asia and globally, the uptake of electronic smoking devices (ESDs) by young people is increasing rapidly. In Malaysia, the prevalence of e-cigarette use among teenagers (13-15 years old) is 23.5% for boys and 6.2% for girls (2022). In Thailand, 20.2% of boys and 15% of girls were using ESDs in 2022.\n\nMaking false claims that ESDs can help smokers quit smoking cigarettes, the industry makes these newer products available in more than 16,000 flavours, most of which are candy and fruit flavors, and promotes them online to lure young people into a lifetime of nicotine addiction. \"The tobacco industry will stop at nothing to ensure that its addictive and harmful business survives and thrives. Our children are under attack,\" stated Professor (Dr) Prakit Vathesatogkit, Executive Director, Action on Smoking and Health, Thailand.\n\nAs per the 7th edition of the tobacco atlas global progress on tobacco endgame is threatened by growing smoking rates among children age 13 to 15 years in many countries and by tobacco industry tactics such as targeting poorer countries with weak regulatory environments and pushing novel products in previously untapped markets. Youth tobacco use (girls and/or boys) has increased in 63 of 135 countries surveyed. In several of these countries, including Haiti and Mauritania, tobacco use among adolescent girls is now more common than among adult women, indicating that the historically lower tobacco use among females worldwide may not continue in the near future.\n\nWorld No Tobacco Day 2024 calls upon the governments and tobacco control community to protect current and future generations and to hold the tobacco industry liable for the harm it causes.

Professor Lekan Ayo-Yusuf of the Africa Centre for Tobacco Industry Monitoring and Policy Research (ATIM) at the University of Pretoria discusses tobacco control measures in Africa.\n\nWhat are the tobacco consumption trends in Africa?\n\nTobacco consumption in Africa varies across the continent but generally presents significant public health challenges. While smoking rates in some African countries remain relatively low compared to the global average, tobacco use is steadily increasing, particularly among young people and vulnerable populations. The factors contributing to this trend include aggressive marketing by tobacco companies, weak tobacco control policies and cultural acceptance of smoking in some communities.\n\nAdditionally, smokeless tobacco use, such as chewing tobacco and snuff, is prevalent in certain regions, contributing to overall tobacco consumption. These products often escape regulation and may be perceived as less harmful, leading to their widespread use.\n\nThe economic burden of tobacco-related illnesses is substantial in Africa and places strain on already limited health care resources. Moreover, tobacco farming in some African countries contributes to environmental degradation and labour exploitation.\n\nWhat tobacco control measures exist in Africa?\n\nAfrica has made significant progress in tobacco control, especially since 2000. World Health Organization (WHO)'s Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC) entered into force in 2005 and spurred many countries to intensify their tobacco control efforts, marking a major change in awareness and action across the continent.\n\nKey policies that include smoke-free laws, bans on tobacco advertising, promotion and sponsorship, introduction of warning labels and smoking cessation programmes, have been developed. However, the enforcement of these policies remains a significant challenge.\n\nBans on advertising, promotion and sponsorship have seen more traction, with greater enforcement, whereas public smoking bans are less consistently enforced. Smoking cessation programmes are less common, with only a few countries offering national guidelines and providing \"quit advice\" to all smokers.\n\nTaxation, which is a policy with potential for significant impact, has not been fully leveraged. Only Mauritius has met the recommended guideline of taxation comprising 75% of the retail price. Other countries fall short, with South Africa at 50% and some countries below 40%, which makes tobacco relatively cheap.\n\nWhat are the obstacles to the current tobacco control measures?\n\nIn Africa, tobacco control measures face significant obstacles rooted in economic dependence on the tobacco and the tobacco industry, particularly in countries where tobacco farming is a major source of foreign revenue. Multinational tobacco companies wield considerable economic power and leverage it to influence government policies, often diluting or obstructing tobacco control legislation. The countries from which the major multinational companies originate do little to hold companies to account outside of their own borders. Therefore, most fragile states in Africa with weak governance struggle to enforce regulations effectively, worsening the problem.\n\nThis subsequently leads to issues around illicit markets. If countries have a weak regulatory framework, it becomes easier for illicit trading which undermines tobacco control and the products become even cheaper. There are also discrepancies in policy between countries in the region, which enables illicit cross-border trading. This is why we need harmonization of policy across the region.\n\nFurthermore, social acceptance of tobacco use, fuelled by industry marketing efforts, perpetuates the cycle of smoking initiation, especially among young people. Limited public awareness campaigns and educational initiatives have failed to counter industry misinformation about the risks of tobacco use. Additionally, the health system's inability to provide adequate smoking cessation services further hampers efforts to combat tobacco use.\n\nAddressing these obstacles requires prioritizing tobacco control, strengthening regulatory frameworks including preventing tobacco industry interference with policy process, increasing public awareness and improving access to cessation services within the healthcare system.\n\nHow can tobacco control be scaled up?\n\nOverall, a multifaceted approach involving international cooperation, regional harmonization of policies, robust legislation, public awareness and research is needed to scale up tobacco control efforts in Africa.\n\nInternational cooperation and collaboration are paramount, especially in countering tobacco industry interference. Non-governmental organizations can play a crucial role in supporting governments facing industry pressure.\n\nWHO has provided essential guidelines to countries that otherwise have no starting point for measure. Organisations such as Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids provides legal support to countries facing litigation or threats from the tobacco industry, while ATIM provides training in monitoring tobacco industry with the aim of countering tobacco industry interference in policy process.\n\nIn addition, public awareness campaigns are vital but should be complemented by robust legislation and enforcement.

Also, tools and support are urgently needed to facilitate monitoring and implementation of the WHO FCTC recommendations in 'online' settings.\n\nWazed emphasised that the goal for youth is clear, saying, \"We want to prevent and reduce tobacco consumption, nicotine addiction, and exposure to new tobacco products. To do this, we need a multistakeholder approach to frame and implement legislation, policies, regulations and administrative measures. This approach needs to cast a wide net. We should engage with all relevant government departments, UN and intergovernmental organizations, civil society, the private sector, academia, and the community, including students, teachers and parents.\"Moreover, a generational tobacco ban, leading to a 'Tobacco-Free Generation', would be a huge step forward for our Region, she stressed.\n\nFor this to happen, the WHO FCTC must be recognized as a legally binding international instrument by all the Member States.\n\nThis ban will require effective enforcement of existing policies, including confronting tobacco industry interference and institutional corruption surrounding the illicit tobacco trade.\n\nMeanwhile, the governments and tobacco control advocates in the region must proactively take an evidence-based stance that pre-empts biased arguments against progressive tobacco control measures.\n\nThe opportunity to pass a generational ban must be supported by political will, clear foresight, and pragmatic implementation. \"Only then can we realize the goal of a 'Tobacco-Free Generation' across our Region in the very near future,\" she said.

In addition, 22 of the 56 countries worldwide on course to meet the target are in Africa. In 2014, the World Health Assembly adopted a global target of 30% relative reduction in tobacco use.\n\nWith support from WHO and partners, countries in the African region have introduced robust tobacco laws and regulations, including stringent controls on marketing strategies for new and emerging tobacco and nicotine products, many of which are designed to attract young people. This year, World No Tobacco Day is being commemorated under the theme \"Protecting children from tobacco industry interference\". The theme aimed to mobilize international efforts to shield youth from harmful tobacco and nicotine products and the deceptive strategies applied by the tobacco industry to market their products to them.\n\n\"Countries in the African region are making commendable progress in building safeguards against tobacco use and shielding populations from its harmful impacts. We now need to capitalize on the growing momentum to ensure a healthier future for the younger generation,\" said Dr Matshidiso Moeti, WHO Regional Director for Africa.\n\nIn the African region, 96% of countries have now ratified the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, with Mauritius becoming the first African country to fully implement the entire WHO MPOWER package of tobacco control measures to curb demand. The country is also the first in the region to implement plain packages for cigarette packs.\n\nIn addition, 37 African countries now have bans on public smoking in force, with 14 of these instituting 100% smoke-free laws in all public places. A further 16 countries have introduced graphic health warnings on tobacco products, a cost-effective and powerful way to boost public awareness of associated health risks. In Mauritania, this contributed to a reduction in tobacco use among people aged from 16 to 64 years, from 18% to 10% between 2012 and 2021.\n\nLeveraging cost as a deterrent, WHO supported countries to institute progressive tobacco tax policies, resulting in price increases in 13 countries in the past five years. In effect, the average total tax share of the retail price of most tobacco brands across the region rose from 37% in 2016, to 41% in 2023.\n\nWHO also introduced innovative measures to counter increasing tobacco leaf production, encouraging over 5000 tobacco farmers in Kenya and Zambia to switch to alternative crops. This had the dual benefit of reducing tobacco production, while promoting food and nutrition security, environmental protection, and women empowerment and gender equity.\n\nWhile the African region is witnessing declining use of tobacco, the rapid population growth is still preventing notable reductions from translating to lower actual numbers of users, according to the WHO report.\n\nThe focus on further reductions in tobacco use among adolescents is key, given that the sustainability of the tobacco and nicotine market relies heavily on recruiting new, young users. The tobacco industry continues to target the African region as a viable investment destination not only because of its young population, but also its rapidly growing economies, cheap labour and access to land for tobacco cultivation.", "source": {"uri": "afro.who.int", "dataType": "news", "title": "WHO | Regional Office for Africa"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The industry uses marketing strategies for new products specially designed to appeal to youth,\" she said.\n\nSome of these products are e-cigarettes, flavoured products, smokeless tobacco, snacks, and pouches. She noted that they are aggressively promoted through social media.\n\n\"This shows that more efforts are still needed to stop the tobacco industry's relentless efforts to market its products to young people.\"\n\nWhat data says\n\nAcross the world, there's an increase in the rate of nicotine intake among young people, according to Mrs Matshidiso.\n\nShe said, globally, more than 37 million young people aged between 13 and 15 years use tobacco, while in Africa, about 7 million people between aged 13 and 15 use tobacco.\n\nShe also noted that an estimated 1.3 million people die from second-hand smoke each year.\n\n\"These deaths are entirely preventable. People exposed to second-hand tobacco smoke are at risk of dying from heart disease, stroke, respiratory diseases, type 2 diabetes, and cancers.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the prevalence of tobacco use among adults in the region has declined from 14.9 per cent cent 2010 to 9.5 per cent in 2023.\n\nThe 2023 WHO Global Report on Trends has shown that 22 countries in the African region are on track to achieve a 30 per cent reduction by the year 2025 relative to 2010 rates.\n\nThe regional director said: \"We know that young people in the region are exposed to tobacco products through extensive social media and streaming platform campaigns, as well as the use of social media influencers to promote tobacco products to the youth covertly.\n\n\"This poses a significant threat to their health and well-being. We also know that the tobacco industry isn't just in the business of producing, marketing, and selling tobacco products.\n\n\"It also spends considerable time and funds promoting misleading science, lobbying, and performing so-called corporate social responsibility activities. These tactics are meant to attract young people and to influence policies to favour its commercial interests over public health\".\n\nWhat African countries must do\n\nAs a result, Mrs Moeti has urged the countries to accelerate the implementation of the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC), with stringent measures on marketing new and emerging tobacco and nicotine products, particularly designed to appeal to youth.\n\nShe asked that countries apply high excise tax and price measures to reduce tobacco consumption.\n\nShe also called for the implementation of effective measures to communicate health risks through graphic health warnings to populations, including children and youth.\n\nShe said: \"I urge our member states in the African region to step up their efforts to protect young people from tobacco industry interference by ensuring governments honour and abide by their obligations under WHO FCTC Article 5.3 by introducing safeguards to protect tobacco-control policy from tobacco industry interference.\n\n\"Counter tobacco industry tactics through evidence-based arguments and best practices with full involvement of civil society organisations.\n\n\"Raise awareness among the public on the tactics of the tobacco industry; and expose industry efforts to target youth and attract generations of people with addiction through innovative approaches, including marketing new and emerging products and using flavours.\n\n\"In an innovative measure to counter increasing tobacco leaf production, WHO and other UN agencies and governments have supported over 5000 tobacco farmers in Kenya and Zambia to switch to alternative crops.\"", "source": {"uri": "premiumtimesng.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Premium Times Nigeria"}, "authors": [{"uri": "beloved_john@premiumtimesng.com", "name": "Beloved John", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tobacco industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_cigarette", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Electronic cigarette"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoking", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Smoking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tobacco"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nicotine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "World Health Organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Marketing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Africa"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tobacco_products", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "List of tobacco products"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_No_Tobacco_Day", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World No Tobacco Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passive_smoking", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Passive smoking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco_control", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tobacco control"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco_smoking", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tobacco smoking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_2_diabetes", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Type 2 diabetes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smokeless_tobacco", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Smokeless tobacco"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prevalence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_disease", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Respiratory disease"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroke", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stroke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiovascular_disease", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cardiovascular disease"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zambia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Zambia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Zambia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenya", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kenya"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Kenya"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Health", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Health", "wgt": 65}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Specific_Substances", "label": "dmoz/Health/Specific Substances", "wgt": 59}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Specific_Substances/Tobacco", "label": "dmoz/Health/Specific Substances/Tobacco", "wgt": 62}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Women's_Health/Smoking", "label": "dmoz/Health/Women's Health/Smoking", "wgt": 39}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Tobacco/Cigarettes", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Tobacco/Cigarettes", "wgt": 54}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://media.premiumtimesng.com/wp-content/files/2017/05/cigarettes-e1496207813313.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9613244", "eventUri": "eng-9613244", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.01960784313725494, "wgt": 210, "relevance": 1}

The young people also called on governments to adopt policies to protect them from these manipulative practices, including relentless marketing of harmful products.\n\nThe Member States of the World Health Organization designated May 31 as World No Tobacco Day in 1987, to draw attention to the global tobacco epidemic, and the preventable death and disease it causes. \"This year, World No Tobacco Day calls on us all to protect children from the interference of the tobacco industry. Young people across the world are calling for the tobacco industry to stop targeting them with products that are harmful to their health,\" WHO Regional Director for Southeast Asia, Saima Wazed said.\n\n\"They are calling on governments to adopt policies to protect them from the manipulative practices of tobacco and related industries. This includes the relentless marketing of their dangerous products through social media and streaming platforms,\" Wazed added. She further emphasised that every year, this day reminds us of the dangers of tobacco and informs us about what the WHO Organization is doing to fight this epidemic.\n\n\"It informs people around the world about what they can do to claim their right to health, and how to protect future generations. It also shines a light on the business practices of tobacco companies,\" she said. WHO regional director further highlighted that the tobacco industry's targeting of youth is rampant across the Member States.\n\nAs a result, 11 million adolescents are using various tobacco products, coupled with the approximate 411 million adult tobacco users, \"Our region, unfortunately, has the highest number of adolescent and adult users globally,\" she added. This industry lures youth by aggressively introducing new nicotine and tobacco products such as electronic cigarettes and heated tobacco products.\n\nMoreover, these are becoming increasingly popular with the youth in this region. Wazed expressed concern and said, \"It is worrying that children and adolescents are regularly exposed to the digital marketing of tobacco products. This is despite having policies and regulations in place to prevent this.\"\n\nShe further stressed that the situation is expected to get worse, as youngsters spend more time on social media and other similar platforms. \"This multibillion-dollar industry recruits 'new' users to reward their investors even more profits. To achieve this, it preys on children and adolescents through marketing tactics, targeting them with new products,\" she said.\n\nThe tobacco industry moves with speed to launch new products, using every means to expand market share before regulations can catch up. Moreover, they continue to oppose evidence-based measures, such as increases in excise taxes, and comprehensive bans on tobacco advertising, promotions and sponsorships.\n\n\"They even threaten legal action against governments that try to protect the health of their citizens,\" she said, adding that the response from governments and institutions is lagging. It is imperative that the relevant provisions of the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (WHO FCTC) are implemented in letter and spirit. Also, tools and support are urgently needed to facilitate monitoring and implementation of the WHO FCTC recommendations in 'online' settings.\n\nWazed emphasised that the goal for youth is clear, saying, \"We want to prevent and reduce tobacco consumption, nicotine addiction, and exposure to new tobacco products. To do this, we need a multistakeholder approach to frame and implement legislation, policies, regulations and administrative measures. This approach needs to cast a wide net. We should engage with all relevant government departments, UN and intergovernmental organizations, civil society, the private sector, academia, and the community, including students, teachers and parents.\" Moreover, a generational tobacco ban, leading to a 'Tobacco-Free Generation', would be a huge step forward for our Region, she stressed.\n\nFor this to happen, the WHO FCTC must be recognized as a legally binding international instrument by all the Member States. This ban will require effective enforcement of existing policies, including confronting tobacco industry interference and institutional corruption surrounding the illicit tobacco trade.\n\nMeanwhile, the governments and tobacco control advocates in the region must proactively take an evidence-based stance that pre-empts biased arguments against progressive tobacco control measures. The opportunity to pass a generational ban must be supported by political will, clear foresight, and pragmatic implementation. \"Only then can we realize the goal of a 'Tobacco-Free Generation' across our Region in the very near future,\" she said.

This yearly health campaign highlights the terrible consequences of tobacco use and advocates for sensible legislation to lower tobacco use.\n\nA Long And Unhealthy History With Tobacco\n\nThe history of tobacco cultivation spans several centuries, as evidenced by its utilization in prehistoric Indian societies. Tobacco was once highly valued for its purported therapeutic qualities, but it soon became clear that it was addictive and had negative effects. Despite growing awareness of its dangers, tobacco use continued to rise, particularly with the introduction of cigarettes in the 19th century.\n\nThe Fight For A Smoke-Free Future\n\nThe 20th century saw a substantial change in the public's perception of tobacco use and health. Research has unquestionably shown a connection between tobacco use and heart disease, lung cancer, and a host of other health issues. Worldwide anti-tobacco movements were fueled by this mounting body of evidence.\n\nIn an effort to raise awareness of the tobacco epidemic on a global scale, the World Health Assembly instituted No Tobacco Day in 1987. The first theme, \"The Tobacco Epidemic,\" brought attention to the pervasive and expanding risk that tobacco use poses to public health.\n\nSignificance Of No Tobacco Day\n\nSeveral important goals are served by No Tobacco Day:\n\nPublic education: The campaign aims to raise public awareness of the risks associated with tobacco use, including the financial strain it places on healthcare systems and the effects it has on individual users.\n\nProposing Policy Change: No Tobacco Day serves as a forum to propose more stringent tobacco control laws, such as prohibitions on smoking, prominent health warnings on cigarette packaging, and higher tobacco taxes.\n\nEmpowering people: The campaign offers tools to assist smokers in their efforts to stop and urges them to do so.\n\nThe Path Forward\n\nThe battle against tobacco use has made great strides, but it is far from ended. The illnesses linked to tobacco use continue to claim millions of lives every year. No Tobacco Day is an important reminder of our shared obligation to work toward a world without tobacco use.

But at least, everybody can see.\n\n\"So, anywhere you go to buy cigarettes and there is no graphics it is then illegal. Any company that produces tobacco product and it does not have graphics health warning, it is considered an illegal product. Smokers need to see the health effects on the packs of the product.\n\n\"The image we have right now is someone that is having cancer of the mouth because of smoking. There are so many other things around graphic health warning that people should be aware of, especially for children who are less than 18 years old.\n\n\"I want to minimize the in take of cigarettes and not that the government should ban it.\n\n\"Also, you know that government has banned the advertising of tobacco products on bill boards and electronic media. Those are part of things we are talking about. We are creating awareness on the implications of smoking or exposure to tobacco products.\n\n\"I want Nigerians to pay close attention to their health condition. They should go for regular check up. My area of specialty for almost 10 years is on the area of tobacco control, effect of tobacco smoking and exposure to tobacco.\n\n\"Tobacco can cost different diseases such as cancer, lung cancer, heart attack, and even for pregnant women it can cause serious complications.\n\n\"We need to be aware about the health hazards that comes with tobacco smoking.\n\n\"I have had the privilege to work with management sciences for health, W.H.O, Federal Ministry of Health, to produce some work to create awareness about the effect of tobacco control.\n\n\"Presently, I am the media consultants for management sciences for health. I had the privilege to design the package for tobacco products. What you see on tobacco products these days is what we call graphic health awareness.\n\n\"So, I want Nigerians to be aware that tobacco smoking, and exposing ourselves to tobacco can cause harmful effects on our health.\"", "source": {"uri": "sunnewsonline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Sun Nigeria"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tobacco_products", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "List of tobacco products"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_No_Tobacco_Day", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "World No Tobacco Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco_packaging_warning_messages", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tobacco packaging warning messages"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco_smoking", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tobacco smoking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cigarette", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cigarette"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tobacco"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoking", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Smoking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tobacco industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco_control", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tobacco control"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oral cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Ministry_of_Health_(Germany)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal Ministry of Health (Germany)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung_cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lung cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myocardial_infarction", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Myocardial infarction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Electronics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Advertising"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Health", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Health", "wgt": 66}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Specific_Substances", "label": "dmoz/Health/Specific Substances", "wgt": 66}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Specific_Substances/Tobacco", "label": "dmoz/Health/Specific Substances/Tobacco", "wgt": 68}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Women's_Health/Smoking", "label": "dmoz/Health/Women's Health/Smoking", "wgt": 48}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Tobacco/Cigarettes", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Tobacco/Cigarettes", "wgt": 60}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 84}], "image": "https://assets.sunnewsonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/IMG-20240530-WA0000-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9613244", "eventUri": "eng-9613244", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 206, "relevance": 1}

He stated that the Board, in collaboration with CAPPA, has developed a subsidiary regulation to cater to smoking in movies, as this aspect was not explicitly addressed in the extant law.\n\nWhile tobacco contains a highly addictive stimulant alkaloid known as nicotine, dried tobacco leaves are mainly used for smoking in cigarettes and cigars, as well as pipes and shishas. They can also be consumed as snuff and contain a risk factor for many deadly diseases, especially those affecting the heart, liver, and lungs.\n\nAccording to research, most tobacco use begins in adolescence, causing dependence and prolonged use, and accounts for more than eight million deaths worldwide every year. It is projected that these deaths may reach 10 million by 2030 if optimal control measures are not implemented mostly in low- and middle-income countries where the high burden of tobacco use is due to an ongoing transition from tobacco production to tobacco consumption.\n\nDespite significant progress in reducing tobacco use, the emergence of e-cigarettes and other new tobacco and nicotine products presents a grave threat to youth and tobacco control. Studies demonstrate that e-cigarette use increases conventional cigarette use, particularly among non-smoking youth, by nearly three times.\n\nHowever, poor regulations and tobacco industry interference remain the greatest barriers to reducing global tobacco use, influencing the government to make cigarettes cheap for consumers, make newer products more easily available and weaken restrictions on marketing to the detriment of public health.\n\nThe WHO and STOP, a global tobacco industry watchdog, earlier this week, launched a report highlighting how the tobacco and nicotine industry targets youth for a lifetime of profits, creating a new wave of addiction through product designs, marketing campaigns and works to shape policies to help turn the world's youth into addicts.\n\nObservations by The Guardian have seen a lot of young people, including minors, smoking all kinds of cigarettes purchased with ease at various roadside shops and kiosks at different locations in Lagos. While some of these smokers who were questioned claim it relaxes them, others say it's a harmless lifestyle flex.\n\nFindings have also shown that clubs around the country serve these nicotine variants in various flavours enticing young people into believing they are harmless; thereby endangering the lives of many and increasing the chances of tobacco-related diseases in the future.\n\nWHO Director-General, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, raised the alarm that the industry continues to rebrand and upgrade its products, marketing to young people with enticing flavours like candy and fruit.\n\nHe said: \"History is repeating, as the tobacco industry tries to sell the same nicotine to our children in different packaging. These industries are actively targeting schools, children and young people with new products that are essentially a candy-flavoured trap. How can they talk about harm reduction when they are marketing these dangerous, highly addictive products to children?\n\n\"These deceptive tactics highlight the urgent need for strong regulations to protect young people from a lifetime of harmful dependence and WHO urges governments to protect young people from the uptake of tobacco, e-cigarettes and other nicotine products by banning or tightly regulating these products,\" he said.\n\nTo commemorate this year's WNTD, themed: 'Protecting children from tobacco industry interference', The Guardian engaged experts to educate the public, especially the youth on the dangers of smoking cigarettes and other related substances.\n\nThe Executive Director of CAPPA, Oluwafemi Akinbode, noted that although there are relevant laws in the country for tobacco regulation, the implementation is still not satisfactory as minors are still able to access these products with ease.\n\nHe stated that tobacco is a contributing factor to non-communicable diseases-related deaths in Nigeria as close to 25 per cent of deaths in Nigeria in Nigeria are attributable to non-communicable diseases.\n\nHe decried the influx of new tobacco products such as electronic cigarettes, waterpipes (also known as hookah), narghile, and shisha among others and urged the government to place a maximum restriction on them as they are serving as gateway products to get people hooked on tobacco. \"We need to protect our children and the future generation.\"\n\nHe therefore urged the Federal government to enforce all the existing laws and increase taxes on tobacco products to 70 per cent of the final retail price.\n\nHe noted that the last data showed that about 6.5 per cent of Nigerians, representing about 20 million people are into cigarette smoking.\n\nAccording to him, though Nigeria has the National Tobacco Control Act 2015 and the National Tobacco Regulation Act 2019, the recent restriction of smoking in movies by the NFVCB will go a long way in reducing the platform for recruiting young people into smoking.\n\n\"One of the biggest measures is taxation, we have always asked the government to increase taxes on tobacco products as a way of driving down consumption, we want this government to look at increasing the taxes on tobacco products to the extent that it will affect the prices of packs to achieve the impact.\"\n\nDescribing the prevalence of cancer developments in the country due to smoking, a cardiothoracic surgeon at the University of Nigeria Teaching Hospital Enugu, Dr. Donald C. Aniekwe, said smoking cigarettes ultimately kills and about 85 to 90 per cent of cases of lung cancer is directly linked to smoking cigarettes.\n\nThe surgeon explained that there has been a notable increase in the number of young people diagnosed with health conditions due to tobacco use and this is due to the rise in 'vaping' and electronic cigarettes. He also pointed out that there is an increase in heart-related conditions, stroke and extreme cases of asthma among young people.\n\n\"The numbers have increased, resulting to issues like respiratory problems, which might include chronic bronchitis and terrible exacerbation of asthma that are now common in young people. People who are vaping and using tobacco in any form can also develop cardiovascular problems. This goes without saying, if you are smoking; you are not going to damage just your lungs but also your heart. Early signs of this include elevated blood pressure, which we see more in young people these days, stroke in young people has also increased and there is an increase in mental problems because of nicotine addiction, usually one addiction will breed more addictions,\" he said.\n\nAniekwe illustrated that a single cigar stick is associated with a lot of carcinogens and that the presence of nicotine in cigars increases the chances of dependence and addiction. He continued that people who are usually around smokers are equally liable to develop cancers related to tobacco use.\n\nOn his part, an infectious disease expert at the Department of Microbiology Adeleke University, Ede, Osun State, Dr Oladipo Kolawole, noted that cigarette smoking is still prevalent in Nigeria despite efforts to reduce it through policies and regulations because of limited awareness about the health risks associated with smoking.\n\nKolawole stated that tobacco use significantly shortens life expectancy and degrades the quality of life. \"It damages the respiratory system, leading to chronic bronchitis and emphysema. Smoking also elevates the risk of stroke and various cancers, such as those of the mouth, throat, and bladder. It impairs the immune system, reduces overall health, and can lead to premature death. Additionally, smoking during pregnancy can harm fetal development, causing low birth weight and other complications.\"\n\nKolawole lamented that despite regulations, tobacco advertising can still reach young people through indirect channels such as movies and music videos, adding that social media often glamorise smoking, making it seem appealing and fashionable.\n\nThe university don pointed out that young people may start smoking due to peer pressure or a desire to experiment and rebel, and once they start, nicotine addiction can make quitting difficult.\n\nHe stated that apart from cigarettes, young people in Nigeria are increasingly turning to other substances, including Marijuana (Cannabis), Shisha (Hookah), alcohol, codeine, tramadol, and other synthetic drugs like Methamphetamine or Ecstasy.\n\nSimilarly, a doctor at the Federal Medical Centre Abeokuta, Dr. Olusina Ajidahun, explained that smoking at a younger age increases the chances of developing cancers later in life.\n\n\"The longer the exposure to these substances, the higher the risk. When the cell keeps getting exposed to smoke, it triggers what we call carcinogenesis which is the formation stage of having cancer and a lot of things happen during the cell cycle increasing the risk of mutation and cancer occurrence.\"\n\nAffirming that a lot of minors engage in tobacco use, the president, Association of Psychiatrists in Nigeria, Prof. Taiwo James Obindo, said there has been an increase in the number of smokers and although a national survey needs to be carried out to determine this; many youths smoke early due to peer pressure.\n\n\"We should first of all conduct a national survey because that will help us determine the figure because the last survey was done in 2006 and the figures must have changed since then,\" he said.\n\nThe professor highlighted abuse, dependence and harmful use of the substance as some of the psychological implications of smoking, noting that those who become dependent on tobacco would later develop mental health conditions that would require medical treatment.\n\nPointing how the industry profits from youth addiction, Director, STOP at Vital Strategies, Jorge Alday, said: \"Addicted youth represent a lifetime of profits to the industry, that's why the industry aggressively lobbies to create an environment that makes it cheap, attractive and easy for youth to get hooked. If policymakers don't act, current and future generations may be facing a new wave of harms, characterized by addiction to and use of many tobacco and nicotine products, including cigarettes.\"",

She revealed that children in Nigeria are exposed to flavoured products that are more attractive easier to access.\n\nIn the same vein, Prixina Phiri, communications specialist at the Zambian-based Centre for Primary Care Research, speaking on the Zambian experience said that children access tobacco products from their schools and shopping malls.\n\nShe relayed that children in Zambia, like many countries on the continent have easy access to tobacco products including the e-cigarettes that freely displayed in shopping malls and cigarettes displayed and sold in kiosks and near schools.\n\nShe noted sadly that Zambia is yet to enact a tobacco control law to help protect children from the tobacco industry interference and other tactics of wooing young minds.\n\nSpeaking on the dearth of information on children smoking rates, Mohammed Maikudi, Nigeria Country Lead, DaYTA Programme of the Development Gateway said that his organization in collaboration with the Nigerian Federal Ministry of Health, supported by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, leads the DaYTA (Data on Youth Tobacco in Africa) programme, focusing on addressing critical data gaps related to adolescent tobacco use in Nigeria.\n\nThe initiative aims to gather comprehensive country-level data on tobacco use among young people aged 10 to 17, thereby filling critical evidence gaps and complementing existing data. The research consortium includes key national and regional stakeholders from various sectors including Ministries of Health; Tobacco control advocacy organizations; academic researchers, and representatives from youth member organizations, among others.\n\nMr Maikudi explained that the DaYTA will fill critical evidence gaps and gather detailed and accurate data on tobacco use among adolescents aged 10 to 17 in Nigeria and provide robust data to government stakeholders and policymakers, enabling them to make informed decisions on tobacco control measures.\n\nFounder, Being Africa, Achieng Otieno, who spoke on Framework Convention on Tobacco Control and Children's Rights, told participants that the WHO identified tobacco as the biggest threat to public health and is responsible for over 8 million preventable deaths worldwide.\n\nThis conviction influenced the initiation of the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC) to help governments curb the global tobacco epidemic.\n\nHe said that the WHO FCTC presents a blueprint for governments to adopt effective tobacco control measures including protecting the present and future generations from the devastating health, social, environmental, and economic consequences of tobacco (and nicotine products) consumption and involuntary exposure to tobacco smoke.\n\nOn children, he noted that the Convention on the Rights of the Children explains who children are, all their rights, and the responsibilities of governments. According to the convention, all children's rights are connected, are equally important, and cannot be taken away from children.\n\nThe Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC) and children's rights intersect in several crucial ways, primarily concerning protecting children from the harms of tobacco use and exposure to tobacco and nicotine products.\n\nOn the centrality of the media to the issues discussed by the earlier speakers, Mr Ayong of VVA and Mr Jakpor of RDI emphasized that the media has the onerous task of keeping the tobacco industry in check and government officials on their toes.\n\nMr Ayong who made a presentation on Youth Tobacco Use and SDGs asserted that 14 of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) will not be achieved as long as tobacco merchants are left unchecked.\n\nREAD ALSO: British American Tobacco to pay $110 million over infringement - FCCPC\n\nIn his words, ...\"while SDG 3 encourages universal health coverage, disease prevention, and mental health promotion, tobacco use directly contradicts these goals, causing diseases like cancer, heart ailments, and respiratory disorders. Tobacco infringes upon children's basic rights to health and welfare and child labor in tobacco production persists in many parts of Africa\".\n\nMr Jakpor in his presentation on Producing Captivating Reports on Youth Tobacco Smoking, encouraged the media participants to go beyond arm chair reporting and getting on the frontlines of the tobacco menace.\n\nHe said that good stories can come from tobacco farms, tobacco factories, entertainment centres, hospitals, schools, homes of victims and social media platforms, among others.\n\nMr Jakpor also pointed the participants to credible sources for interviews. They include medical practitioners, teachers, children themselves, victims and their parents.\n\nDocuments according to him, are also sources of information that tobacco corporations are always ready to hide. For this reason he asked the journalists to go after annual reports; allies' internal reports; news sources; newsletters; as well as reports from Annual General Meetings; social media accounts -Facebook, X, Instagram etc.", "source": {"uri": "premiumtimesng.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Premium Times Nigeria"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Tobacco use remains a major health concern and is one of the leading causes of non-communicable diseases and death worldwide due to the harmful chemicals in tobacco products.\n\nThe theme for 2024, 'Protecting Children from Tobacco Industry Interference,' aims to safeguard future generations and ensure a continued decline in tobacco use. This year's focus highlights the alarming trend of the tobacco industry's targeted marketing towards youth.\n\nTobacco is consumed in various ways, including smoke inhalation through cigarettes, pipes, and cigars; waterpipe smoking (also called shisha, narghile, hubble-bubble, and hookah); electronic cigarettes; and smokeless tobacco, which is chewed, sniffed, or sucked. Despite these different methods, manufactured cigarettes remain the most commonly consumed tobacco product worldwide. All forms of tobacco contain nicotine, which can lead to addiction to tobacco products, which can lead to many health problems.\n\nWHO reports that tobacco use is a major risk factor for cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, over 20 different types or subtypes of cancer, and many other chronic conditions. Annually, tobacco use claims over 8 million lives, with most of these deaths occurring in low- and middle-income countries which are frequently targeted by aggressive tobacco industry marketing and interference.\n\nDr. Sohaila Cheema, assistant dean for Institute for Population Health (IPH) and associate professor of clinical population health sciences at Weill Cornell Medicine-Qatar (WCM-Q), said: \"Current data shows that an estimated 37 million youth aged 13-15 years are using tobacco worldwide. We know that that most adult tobacco users begin to use tobacco products as children or young adults. Globally, we are currently seeing an alarming increase in the use of newer products like e-cigarettes (vapes), snuff, heated tobacco products, sucking on nicotine patches. These products have high youth appeal. The tobacco industry is also packaging tobacco in new forms like candy- flavoured products and there is evidence that some tobacco companies are actively targeting schools, children and young adults in certain jurisdictions.\"\n\nDr. Ziyad Mahfoud, professor of research in population health sciences at WCM-Q, said although wrongfully perceived as less harmful than cigarette smoking, shisha smoking is associated with many significant health risks such as exposure to high levels of carbon monoxide, heavy metals and carcinogens, leading to the development of chronic diseases.\n\n\"Research has shown that certain toxicants and carcinogens are found in higher levels in shisha smoking as compared to cigarette smoking,\" he said. \"In addition, the long duration of a shisha smoking session increases the intake of such substances and hence can amplify the health risk associated with it. Moreover, electronic cigarettes or vaping products contain substances that can cause many health risks. Many users reported complications from smoking, the liquid inside the device, and even device exploding.\"", "source": {"uri": "thepeninsulaqatar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Peninsula"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tobacco_products", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "List of tobacco products"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_No_Tobacco_Day", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "World No Tobacco Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hookah", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hookah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco_smoking", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tobacco smoking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tobacco"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "World Health Organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tobacco industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cigarette", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cigarette"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornell_University", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cornell University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-communicable_disease", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Non-communicable disease"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chemical substance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marketing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_condition", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chronic condition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smokeless_tobacco", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Smokeless tobacco"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inhalation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Inhalation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cigar", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cigar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Risk factor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_cigarette", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electronic cigarette"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_disease", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Respiratory disease"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developing_country", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Developing country"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Addiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nicotine"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Health", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Health", "wgt": 66}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Specific_Substances", "label": "dmoz/Health/Specific Substances", "wgt": 67}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Specific_Substances/Tobacco", "label": "dmoz/Health/Specific Substances/Tobacco", "wgt": 70}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Women's_Health/Smoking", "label": "dmoz/Health/Women's Health/Smoking", "wgt": 47}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Tobacco/Cigarettes", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Tobacco/Cigarettes", "wgt": 62}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://thepeninsulaqatar.com/assets/cdn/images/placeholder.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9613244", "eventUri": "eng-9613244", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-31", "textStart": 264, "textEnd": 270}], "sentiment": -0.08235294117647063, "wgt": 204, "relevance": 1}

Moreover, the universities should abstain from offering leniency towards smoking in its premises,\" he said.\n\nThe major consumption of tobacco was at educational institutions that could be managed through stringent punishments like business closures, he added.\n\nSyed Ali Wasif Naqvi, Head of Policy, Advocacy and Outreach, SDPI in his presentation said as per the 2022 data, over 37 million adolescents aged 13-15 globally use tobacco.\n\n\"In the WHO European Region, 11.5% of boys and 10.1% of girls in this age group are tobacco users.\n\nNotably, electronic cigarettes and nicotine pouches are increasingly popular among youth, with 12.5% of adolescents in the European Region using e-cigarettes in 2022 compared to 2% of adults,\" he said.\n\nNaqvi mentioned that with over 1200 children initiating tobacco use daily in this country, and permeation of electronic tobacco and nicotine products in schools, colleges, and universities, the statistics are showing an alarming situation.\n\nThe tobacco industry, he said targets youth to replace millions of customers lost annually to death or cessation.\n\nThe industry employs appealing products and advertising tactics aimed at children and adolescents, using social media and streaming platforms, he added.\n\nDr Minhaj us Siraj, CEO Health Syndicate said the tobacco industry was engaging with children through labour in the tobacco fields, whereas those kids were not able to enter schools to acquire education for life. He also mentioned \"green leaf disease\". He underlined that the exposure of adolescents to dangerous chemicals in tobacco processing was causing severe health complications among them. He said that child protection from tobacco industry needs to be started from the fields.\n\nDr Siraj underlined that SRO 2024 implementation needs to be done in true letter and spirit, whereas his organization during the advocacy and awareness efforts had approached mosques to flag the issue in jumma sermons, and also in 2020, it was highlighted in Makkah.\n\nHe pointed out that online sale of tobacco products was a major challenge at present as it was going unchecked.\n\n\"Lancet journal's study claimed that developed countries were involved in suppressing less developed countries achieving positive results in smoking reduction efforts. Pakistan is among the 28 countries where the tobacco ending game is near and also leading in Eastern Mediterranean region in 2023,\" Dr Siraj mentioned.\n\nDr Amina Khan, Executive Director, The Initiative, said, \"Generally 1 out of 3 people die of tobacco who do not quit tobacco use or smoking, whereas 1200 children between the age of 6-15 start smoking every day in this part of the South Asian region. Two out of five adult smokers start smoking at the age of 10 which rings alarm bells for all to start focusing on the toddlers.\"\n\nShe noted that the policy and implementation by Pakistan was ranked very well globally whereas it should be kept abreast with the emerging trends of the tobacco industry as modern products like vapes, velo, and smokeless tobacco products are introduced that don't fall under the legislation.\n\nTo protect youth, she said the availability of single cigarettes, advertisement, and prevention needs to be given a high priority in the enforcement, policy, and awareness endeavours.\n\n\"Youth engagement in policy-making is important to devise policy actions that are well guided and properly conceived in line with the ground realities to bear optimum results,\" she added.\n\nMuhammad Aftab Ahmed, Project Manager Tobacco Control Cell at MoNHSR&C said the government is working on introducing the first smoke-free model for youth in the Federal capital to promote \"no smoking\" culture among the juvenile and youth.\n\nAhmed, said the SRO 72 of 2020 has not been implemented completely which could help remove cigarettes from the racks of the shopkeepers whereas presently the focus is on reducing advertisements of tobacco products, increasing taxes, and embracing a paradigm shift over a tobacco-free generation.\n\nHe said the government was intending to levy a 30% increased tax on tobacco products in this budget.\n\nDr Waseem Janjua, Research Fellow, SDPI said the tobacco industry was increasing \"misleading tactics\" through advertisements promoting tobacco products that were trapping the innocent youth of the country.\n\nHe said according to a study in the US, the tobacco industry was pumping in $7.62 billion in lieu off tobacco promoting advertisements that indicated the massive magnitude of capital investment to mislead masses on smoking.\n\nSecretary General PANAH, Sanaullah Ghumman said the responses to challenges and crises matters in the fight against tobacco risk and other issues. He added that awareness and advocacy were an expensive and time-consuming laborious task that could be replaced with the option of increasing penalties for smoking and tobacco usage amongst children which could more encouraging outcomes.\n\n\"Over 100 countries have increased taxes on cigarettes making it inaccessible for children that can help protect the 1200 children at risk,\" he said.\n\nIn his vote of thanks, Khurram Hashmi said the session was a much-needed discussion on World No Tobacco Day that helped convene the experts for their insights that should be promoted further in the policy and community circles.", "source": {"uri": "urdupoint.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "UrduPoint"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

It is ranked sixth after China, India, Brazil, the United States of America (USA) and Indonesia with the tobacco produced in Zimbabwe remaining a favourite as it is a flavourant.\n\nMost tobacco growers are located in agro-ecological farming region two and three within Mashonaland West and Mashonaland Central province with the tobacco value chain contributing significantly to economic growth in the country.\n\nThe history of tobacco in Zimbabwe as the country's largest foreign exchange earner is significant and undisputed, dating back to the colonial era. Below is an encapsulated overview of the history and importance of tobacco in Zimbabwe:\n\nColonial era\n\nTobacco production in Zimbabwe has a long history that can be traced back to the colonial period when the British established commercial tobacco farming in the country.\n\nThe fertile soils and favourable climate of Zimbabwe made it an ideal location for growing high-quality tobacco, which quickly became a valuable export commodity.\n\nEconomic importance\n\nTobacco has traditionally been one of Zimbabwe's main agricultural exports and a crucial source of foreign exchange earnings for the country.The revenue generated from tobacco exports has played a significant role in supporting Zimbabwe's economy, contributing to government revenue, employment opportunities, and rural livelihoods.\n\nInternational reputation\n\nZimbabwe's tobacco has gained a reputation for its high quality and unique flavour profiles, particularly in the flue-cured tobacco market.The country has been known for producing premium tobacco that is sought after by international buyers and tobacco manufacturers around the world.\n\nRole in Agriculture\n\nTobacco cultivation has been a major driver of agricultural development in Zimbabwe, with many smallholder farmers and large-scale commercial farms engaged in tobacco production. The tobacco industry has provided farmers with a reliable source of income and has supported the growth of related industries, such as tobacco processing and packaging.\n\nGovernment support\n\nThe Zimbabwean government has historically supported the tobacco industry through various policies, subsidies, and incentives to promote production and export of tobacco. Government interventions, such as price support schemes and marketing arrangements have been aimed at ensuring that tobacco remains a lucrative crop for farmers.\n\nChallenges and controversies\n\nDespite its economic importance, the tobacco industry in Zimbabwe has faced challenges and controversies, including issues related to labour practices, environmental impact, and health concerns associated with tobacco farming and consumption. The reliance on tobacco as a primary export crop has also exposed Zimbabwe to risks associated with fluctuations in global tobacco prices and changes in international trade regulations. The history of tobacco in Zimbabwe as the largest foreign exchange earner reflects its significant role in the country's economy, agricultural sector, and international trade.\n\nWhile tobacco has played a crucial role in Zimbabwe's economic development, it is important to consider the sustainability and long-term implications of relying heavily on tobacco production as a primary source of foreign exchange earnings.\n\nEscalation of commitment\n\nThe benefits associated with tobacco production in Zimbabwe has created conditions where there has been an \"escalation of commitment\" to an industry which Zimbabwe ought to be proactive about moving away from. Any further commitment to produce tobacco in Zimbabwe is a bad decision. It is misguided, wrong and an act of poor judgement because it is not going to serve Zimbabwe well in the future.\n\nOne of the reasons that \"escalation of commitment\" occurs is the illusion of having control on the future. This leads is to the discussion on escalation of commitment theory.\n\nEscalation of commitment theory\n\nThis theory refers to the tendency for individuals or organizations to continue investing resources into a failing course of action even when evidence suggests that it may be better to cut losses and abandon the endeavour. In the context of Zimbabwe's drive to increase its output of tobacco in the coming years, the application of this theory can shed light on the potential risks and challenges associated with the country's continued emphasis on tobacco production despite concerns about sustainability, irresponsibility, and potential dangers.\n\nHere are some key points to ponder when discussing escalation of commitment theory in relation to Zimbabwe's drive to increase its output of tobacco:\n\nSunk costs,\n\nOne aspect of the Escalation of Commitment Theory is the idea of sunk costs, where decision-makers may feel compelled to continue investing in a failing project to justify the resources already committed.\n\nIn the case of Zimbabwe's drive to increase tobacco output, decision-makers may be influenced by past investments in the tobacco industry, such as infrastructure, subsidies, support systems and value chain infrastructure, which could lead to a continuation of policies that promote tobacco cultivation despite potential risks.\n\nPsychological factors\n\nPsychological factors, such as a desire to avoid admitting failure or a belief that success is just around the corner, can also contribute to escalation of commitment.\n\nDecision-makers in Zimbabwe's tobacco industry may be influenced by cognitive biases that lead them to overvalue the potential benefits of increasing tobacco production, while underestimating the negative consequences associated with over-reliance on tobacco in the future.\n\nExternal pressures and incentives\n\nExternal pressures, such as market demands, international trade agreements, and global economic trends, can also influence the escalation of commitment in the tobacco industry.\n\nIncentives provided by the government or industry stakeholders to boost tobacco production may create a situation where decision-makers feel compelled to continue investing in tobacco cultivation, even in the face of mounting challenges.\n\nBy examining the principles of escalation of commitment theory in the context of Zimbabwe's drive to increase tobacco output, policy makers, farmers, and all value chain stakeholders can gain insights into the factors influencing decision-making processes and the potential implications for the sustainability and future development of the tobacco industry in the country.\n\nUnsustainability of tobacco cultivation in Zimbabwe below:\n\nEnvironmental impact\n\nTobacco cultivation is resource-intensive, requiring significant amounts of water, fertilizers, and pesticides. This can lead to soil degradation and water pollution.\n\nFlue-cured tobacco consumes large amounts of wood starting with clearing the land for cultivation, harvesting poles and sticks for barn construction, right up to the deforestation of particularly the indigenous Msasa trees, which are the most preferred by farmers, in the curing process.\n\nThe use of agro-chemicals in tobacco farming can have long-term negative effects on soil health and biodiversity, impacting the sustainability of agriculture in Zimbabwe.\n\nHealth concerns\n\nTobacco farming involves exposure to harmful chemicals and pesticides, posing health risks to farmers and workers.The consumption of tobacco products also contributes to public health challenges, including increased rates of non-communicable diseases, such as cancer, respiratory illnesses, and cardiovascular diseases.\n\nEconomic vulnerability\n\nRelying heavily on tobacco as a primary export crop makes Zimbabwe vulnerable to fluctuations in global tobacco prices and changes in international trade regulations.\n\nThe monoculture of tobacco exposes farmers to market risks and limits diversification opportunities, hindering long-term economic sustainability.\n\nQuestionable viability\n\nStudies are emerging where it is being highlighted that not all farmers producing tobacco are realising super normal profits as is expected. In a 2021 study in Manicaland province, (Chingosho R, Dare C, van Walbeek CTobacco farming and current debt status among smallholder farmers in Manicaland province in ZimbabweTobacco Control 2021;30:610-615.), it was established that, \"there is was no evidence to suggest that tobacco growing, in its current state, had benefited the tobacco farmers in Manicaland province.\n\n\"Tobacco farmers are largely victims, rather than beneficiaries, of the sector, essentially providing a strong case for government intervention to improve the conditions of tobacco farmers, either through direct intervention in the tobacco-growing sector, or by encouraging and promoting crop substitution\".\n\nIn the absence of further research in other provinces, small scale tobacco farmers could very well not be primary beneficiaries within the tobacco value chain, yet they are the ones carrying the largest burden of cropping and curing risk.\n\nBelow are the risks and dangers of relying on tobacco as a foreign currency earner:\n\nMarket volatility\n\nGlobal tobacco prices are subject to fluctuations due to factors such as supply and demand dynamics, regulatory changes, and shifts in consumer preferences.\n\nDependence on tobacco exports for foreign currency earnings exposes Zimbabwe to market volatility and economic uncertainty.\n\nInternational trade restrictions\n\nIncreased regulations on tobacco products and trade agreements aimed at reducing tobacco consumption can impact Zimbabwe's export market and foreign exchange earnings.\n\nCompliance with international standards and regulations may pose challenges for the sustainability of the tobacco industry in Zimbabwe.\n\nSocial implications\n\nThe promotion of tobacco cultivation can perpetuate poverty cycles and socioeconomic disparities, as smallholder farmers may face challenges in accessing markets and earning fair prices for their produce.\n\nTobacco farming communities may also experience negative social impacts, such as child labour, exploitation of labourers, and limited access to education and healthcare services.\n\nBelow are alternatives to tobacco as a cash crop for sustainability:\n\nDiversification of agriculture\n\nEncouraging farmers to diversify their crops by promoting the cultivation of alternative cash crops such as chia, small grains like rapoko millet and superfood fonio, cotton, soybeans, horticultural produce, etcetera. Supporting agricultural practices that are environmentally sustainable, such as agroforestry, organic farming, and conservation agriculture is key and profitable in the long run.\n\nValue-added agriculture\n\nInvesting in value-added processing industries to add more value to agricultural products and create additional revenue streams for farmers.Promoting agro-processing and agribusiness development to enhance the competitiveness of Zimbabwe's agriculture sector.\n\nExport promotion\n\nIdentifying high-value export markets for non-tobacco agricultural products and supporting farmers in accessing these markets.Developing export-oriented agricultural value chains to increase the competitiveness of Zimbabwean agricultural products in international markets.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn conclusion, transitioning away from the unsustainable reliance on tobacco cultivation in Zimbabwe requires a comprehensive approach that addresses environmental, economic, and social challenges.\n\nBy promoting diversification, value addition, and export promotion in agriculture, Zimbabwe can achieve greater sustainability, resilience, and inclusivity in its agricultural sector.", "source": {"uri":

In addition, we want to make sure there are no young people who are just starting. We want those who smoke to stop,\" Ms Kaitiritimba said.\n\nWorld No Tobacco Day was commemorated under the theme: Protecting children from tobacco industry interference.\n\nIn commemoration of the day, UNHCO and other stakeholders launched the Uganda Tobacco Industry Interference Index Report 2023.\n\nAccording to the index Uganda Customs, Currency, and Airport Tax regulations still allow international travellers to bring 200 sticks of cigarettes or 250 gm into the country duty-free.\n\nAccording to their findings, out of 20 schools in Kampala, 10 of them have tobacco points near them, allowing young people easy access to tobacco.\n\n\"This is illegal because these points of sale should not be close to schools. Schools should prohibit tobacco sales within 50 meters of their promises.

So it is a marked improvement in the prevalence of young people,\" Dr Lukwata said.\n\nShe noted, however, that both young and adult tobacco users still require increased advocacy.\n\nShe explained that on such a day, they use the opportunity as a platform to inform everyone that tobacco is dangerous to their health in all its forms and should be able to eliminate it.\n\n\"These young people asked us to ban tobacco and I am very hopeful that they will be able to ban it in this country during their time, not us adults,\" Dr Lukwata said.", "source": {"uri": "monitor.co.ug", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Monitor"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_No_Tobacco_Day", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "World No Tobacco Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tobacco"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uganda", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Uganda"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Uganda"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tobacco industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco_smoking", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tobacco smoking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kampala", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kampala"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kampala"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Uganda"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cigarette", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cigarette"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_(drug)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alcohol (drug)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Health_(New_Zealand)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Health (New Zealand)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoking", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Smoking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World Health Organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Advertising"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Health", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Health", "wgt": 57}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Specific_Substances", "label": "dmoz/Health/Specific Substances", "wgt": 50}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Specific_Substances/Tobacco", "label": "dmoz/Health/Specific Substances/Tobacco", "wgt": 52}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Women's_Health/Smoking", "label": "dmoz/Health/Women's Health/Smoking", "wgt": 35}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Tobacco/Cigarettes", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Tobacco/Cigarettes", "wgt": 49}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 61}], "image": "https://www.monitor.co.ug/resource/image/4642568/landscape_ratio3x2/1200/800/7293d7cf00f478a3878c064aec879090/bW/latest13pix.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9613244", "eventUri": "eng-9613244", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-31", "textStart": 607, "textEnd": 613}], "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 192, "relevance": 1}

Over two-thirds of those trying one cigarette go on to become daily smokers.\n\nAnd quitting is hard. On average, it takes someone 30 attempts to stop smoking.\n\nOn average it takes someone 30 attempts to stop smoking.\n\nIf we want to keep future generations away from tobacco, we need to see significantly sharper measures from decision-makers as well as collective advocacy efforts on both national and global levels.\n\nOf course, there is no single answer to that question, but the main solution is social responsibility and can be divided into three main areas: stricter marketing rules and scaled-up smoke-free measures, tax regulations, and intensified dissemination on the effects of the tobacco industry.\n\nFirstly, the marketing of tobacco products needs to be far more regulated. Today we see how the tobacco industry, in a bid to get new generations hooked and turn them into lifelong customers, pours money into digital and social media advertising, pays vendors near schools to display tobacco products in their shops, and sponsors films and series on streaming platforms to feature tobacco products, often portraying smoking as glamorous and cool.\n\nEver-increasing numbers of vapes target young people, and candy-like flavours make a harmless impression, while bright colors and shapes give them a playful look.\n\nTo protect our new generation from addiction and health risks, we need to regulate all tobacco and nicotine products, with plain packaging, a ban on flavours, health warnings, and bans of all promotional and misleading features or elements, like display in stores.\n\nLast but not least, smoke-free measures must be scaled up, such as smoke-free zones that protect children and young people from the socially contagious behaviour of tobacco use and exposure to secondhand smoke. Smoke-free zones also offer support for smokers who want to quit and have already proven positive effects in several countries.\n\nSecondly, taxing the product is the single most effective measure to reduce tobacco smoking. To make the measurement effective, the taxation needs to be equivalent between tobacco products and between neighbouring countries.\n\nHowever, as important as taxes are, they need to be paired with other regulatory measures to really have an effect and create a society that promotes a healthy lifestyle for everyone, regardless of background, origin, or socioeconomic status.\n\nThirdly, the dissemination of the negative effects of tobacco must be improved and adapted to a younger generation. \"Smoking Kills\" is a ubiquitous warning on cigarette packets. However, as much as this message is relevant - it is far from enough and does not serve the purpose needed.\n\nToday, most young tobacco users believe they will stop after a few years, but, in fact, many will become lifelong consumers. If health warnings fall on deaf ears, we need to find new ways of reaching out to them in a relevant way.\n\nOne way of doing this is by exposing the fact that the tobacco industry's tactics to create a new generation of nicotine addicts are ruthless and manipulative. The misuse and abuse of science, its opposition to anti-tobacco laws, its attempts to influence public health debates, and its aggressive marketing of harmful products, seriously undermine public health efforts.\n\nAnother way is highlighting the tobacco industry's negative effects on the environment - an area that we know has a high engagement among youths. Cigarette butts are the most frequently littered item worldwide. Billions end up in rivers, seas, and oceans, where they contaminate the water and are toxic to sea life. Tobacco production itself is also polluting. Its cultivation alone is responsible for 5 percent of global deforestation. The environmental damage that the tobacco industry causes is very much in the shadows and needs to be highlighted to a much larger extent.\n\nThe WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control clearly states that all nicotine use should be decreased. Yet, we still see that tobacco use is responsible for an estimated 2.5 million deaths annually and that tobacco use among youths is alarmingly high.

It is ranked sixth after China, India, Brazil, the United States of America (USA) and Indonesia with the tobacco produced in Zimbabwe remaining a favourite as it is a flavourant.\n\nMost tobacco growers are located in agro-ecological farming region two and three within Mashonaland West and Mashonaland Central province with the tobacco value chain contributing significantly to economic growth in the country.\n\nThe history of tobacco in Zimbabwe as the country's largest foreign exchange earner is significant and undisputed, dating back to the colonial era. Below is an encapsulated overview of the history and importance of tobacco in Zimbabwe:\n\nColonial era\n\nTobacco production in Zimbabwe has a long history that can be traced back to the colonial period when the British established commercial tobacco farming in the country.\n\nThe fertile soils and favourable climate of Zimbabwe made it an ideal location for growing high-quality tobacco, which quickly became a valuable export commodity.\n\nEconomic importance\n\nTobacco has traditionally been one of Zimbabwe's main agricultural exports and a crucial source of foreign exchange earnings for the country.The revenue generated from tobacco exports has played a significant role in supporting Zimbabwe's economy, contributing to government revenue, employment opportunities, and rural livelihoods.\n\nZimbabwe's tobacco has gained a reputation for its high quality and unique flavour profiles, particularly in the flue-cured tobacco market.The country has been known for producing premium tobacco that is sought after by international buyers and tobacco manufacturers around the world.\n\nRole in Agriculture\n\nTobacco cultivation has been a major driver of agricultural development in Zimbabwe, with many smallholder farmers and large-scale commercial farms engaged in tobacco production. The tobacco industry has provided farmers with a reliable source of income and has supported the growth of related industries, such as tobacco processing and packaging.\n\nGovernment support\n\nThe Zimbabwean government has historically supported the tobacco industry through various policies, subsidies, and incentives to promote production and export of tobacco. Government interventions, such as price support schemes and marketing arrangements have been aimed at ensuring that tobacco remains a lucrative crop for farmers.\n\nChallenges and controversies\n\nDespite its economic importance, the tobacco industry in Zimbabwe has faced challenges and controversies, including issues related to labour practices, environmental impact, and health concerns associated with tobacco farming and consumption. The reliance on tobacco as a primary export crop has also exposed Zimbabwe to risks associated with fluctuations in global tobacco prices and changes in international trade regulations. The history of tobacco in Zimbabwe as the largest foreign exchange earner reflects its significant role in the country's economy, agricultural sector, and international trade.\n\nWhile tobacco has played a crucial role in Zimbabwe's economic development, it is important to consider the sustainability and long-term implications of relying heavily on tobacco production as a primary source of foreign exchange earnings.\n\nEscalation of commitment\n\nThe benefits associated with tobacco production in Zimbabwe has created conditions where there has been an \"escalation of commitment\" to an industry which Zimbabwe ought to be proactive about moving away from. Any further commitment to produce tobacco in Zimbabwe is a bad decision. It is misguided, wrong and an act of poor judgement because it is not going to serve Zimbabwe well in the future.\n\nOne of the reasons that \"escalation of commitment\" occurs is the illusion of having control on the future. This leads is to the discussion on escalation of commitment theory.\n\nEscalation of commitment theory\n\nThis theory refers to the tendency for individuals or organizations to continue investing resources into a failing course of action even when evidence suggests that it may be better to cut losses and abandon the endeavour. In the context of Zimbabwe's drive to increase its output of tobacco in the coming years, the application of this theory can shed light on the potential risks and challenges associated with the country's continued emphasis on tobacco production despite concerns about sustainability, irresponsibility, and potential dangers.\n\nHere are some key points to ponder when discussing escalation of commitment theory in relation to Zimbabwe's drive to increase its output of tobacco:\n\nSunk costs,\n\nOne aspect of the Escalation of Commitment Theory is the idea of sunk costs, where decision-makers may feel compelled to continue investing in a failing project to justify the resources already committed.\n\nIn the case of Zimbabwe's drive to increase tobacco output, decision-makers may be influenced by past investments in the tobacco industry, such as infrastructure, subsidies, support systems and value chain infrastructure, which could lead to a continuation of policies that promote tobacco cultivation despite potential risks.\n\nPsychological factors\n\nPsychological factors, such as a desire to avoid admitting failure or a belief that success is just around the corner, can also contribute to escalation of commitment.\n\nDecision-makers in Zimbabwe's tobacco industry may be influenced by cognitive biases that lead them to overvalue the potential benefits of increasing tobacco production, while underestimating the negative consequences associated with over-reliance on tobacco in the future.\n\nExternal pressures and incentives\n\nExternal pressures, such as market demands, international trade agreements, and global economic trends, can also influence the escalation of commitment in the tobacco industry.\n\nIncentives provided by the government or industry stakeholders to boost tobacco production may create a situation where decision-makers feel compelled to continue investing in tobacco cultivation, even in the face of mounting challenges.\n\nBy examining the principles of escalation of commitment theory in the context of Zimbabwe's drive to increase tobacco output, policy makers, farmers, and all value chain stakeholders can gain insights into the factors influencing decision-making processes and the potential implications for the sustainability and future development of the tobacco industry in the country.\n\nUnsustainability of tobacco cultivation in Zimbabwe below:\n\nEnvironmental impact\n\nTobacco cultivation is resource-intensive, requiring significant amounts of water, fertilizers, and pesticides. This can lead to soil degradation and water pollution.\n\nFlue-cured tobacco consumes large amounts of wood starting with clearing the land for cultivation, harvesting poles and sticks for barn construction, right up to the deforestation of particularly the indigenous Msasa trees, which are the most preferred by farmers, in the curing process.\n\nThe use of agro-chemicals in tobacco farming can have long-term negative effects on soil health and biodiversity, impacting the sustainability of agriculture in Zimbabwe.\n\nHealth concerns\n\nTobacco farming involves exposure to harmful chemicals and pesticides, posing health risks to farmers and workers.The consumption of tobacco products also contributes to public health challenges, including increased rates of non-communicable diseases, such as cancer, respiratory illnesses, and cardiovascular diseases.\n\nEconomic vulnerability\n\nRelying heavily on tobacco as a primary export crop makes Zimbabwe vulnerable to fluctuations in global tobacco prices and changes in international trade regulations.\n\nThe monoculture of tobacco exposes farmers to market risks and limits diversification opportunities, hindering long-term economic sustainability.\n\nQuestionable viability\n\nStudies are emerging where it is being highlighted that not all farmers producing tobacco are realising super normal profits as is expected. In a 2021 study in Manicaland province, (Chingosho R, Dare C, van Walbeek CTobacco farming and current debt status among smallholder farmers in Manicaland province in ZimbabweTobacco Control 2021;30:610-615.), it was established that, \"there is was no evidence to suggest that tobacco growing, in its current state, had benefited the tobacco farmers in Manicaland province.\n\n\"Tobacco farmers are largely victims, rather than beneficiaries, of the sector, essentially providing a strong case for government intervention to improve the conditions of tobacco farmers, either through direct intervention in the tobacco-growing sector, or by encouraging and promoting crop substitution\".\n\nIn the absence of further research in other provinces, small scale tobacco farmers could very well not be primary beneficiaries within the tobacco value chain, yet they are the ones carrying the largest burden of cropping and curing risk.\n\nBelow are the risks and dangers of relying on tobacco as a foreign currency earner:\n\nMarket volatility\n\nGlobal tobacco prices are subject to fluctuations due to factors such as supply and demand dynamics, regulatory changes, and shifts in consumer preferences.\n\nDependence on tobacco exports for foreign currency earnings exposes Zimbabwe to market volatility and economic uncertainty.\n\nInternational trade restrictions\n\nIncreased regulations on tobacco products and trade agreements aimed at reducing tobacco consumption can impact Zimbabwe's export market and foreign exchange earnings.\n\nCompliance with international standards and regulations may pose challenges for the sustainability of the tobacco industry in Zimbabwe.\n\nSocial implications\n\nThe promotion of tobacco cultivation can perpetuate poverty cycles and socioeconomic disparities, as smallholder farmers may face challenges in accessing markets and earning fair prices for their produce.\n\nTobacco farming communities may also experience negative social impacts, such as child labour, exploitation of labourers, and limited access to education and healthcare services.\n\nBelow are alternatives to tobacco as a cash crop for sustainability:\n\nDiversification of agriculture\n\nEncouraging farmers to diversify their crops by promoting the cultivation of alternative cash crops such as chia, small grains like rapoko millet and superfood fonio, cotton, soybeans, horticultural produce, etcetera. Supporting agricultural practices that are environmentally sustainable, such as agroforestry, organic farming, and conservation agriculture is key and profitable in the long run.\n\nValue-added agriculture\n\nInvesting in value-added processing industries to add more value to agricultural products and create additional revenue streams for farmers.Promoting agro-processing and agribusiness development to enhance the competitiveness of Zimbabwe's agriculture sector.\n\nExport promotion\n\nIdentifying high-value export markets for non-tobacco agricultural products and supporting farmers in accessing these markets.Developing export-oriented agricultural value chains to increase the competitiveness of Zimbabwean agricultural products in international markets.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn conclusion, transitioning away from the unsustainable reliance on tobacco cultivation in Zimbabwe requires a comprehensive approach that addresses environmental, economic, and social challenges.\n\nBy promoting diversification, value addition, and export promotion in agriculture, Zimbabwe can achieve greater sustainability, resilience, and inclusivity in its agricultural sector.", "source": {"uri":

On the eve of World No Tobacco Day, city doctors raised the issue of shopkeepers selling tobacco products to minors, openly flouting the law, contributing to a worrying increase in addiction among young people. 'This lack of enforcement has led to a rise in cancer cases, with 40 per cent of patients being youths.\n\nMoreover, the Government Cancer Hospital has seen a rise in cancer cases from 2,412 in 2020 to 3,234 in 2023, with over 5k new cases reported annually including private hospitals as well,' the doctors said. District administration and various social organisations run annual awareness campaigns about the dangers of tobacco, but consumption rates continue to rise. Warning labels and public health messages have proven ineffective, particularly among young women, who are increasingly succumbing to tobacco addiction.\n\nThis trend not only increases cancer risks but also leads to other health issues, such as infertility among women. Dr Dilip Acharya, national chairman of Indian Medical Association's Cancer and Tobacco Control Committee, said tobacco is a major cause of numerous cancers, including oral, lung, esophageal, stomach and blood cancers.\n\n'Tobacco consumption is also linked to diseases like asthma, blindness and coronary heart disease. The tobacco industry targets youth to ensure lifelong profits, perpetuating addiction. With over 7k toxic chemicals in tobacco smoke, smoking reduces life expectancy by an average of ten years,' he added.\n\nUrgent need for action\n\nDr Acharya added that stricter enforcement of tobacco regulations is essential, along with more effective public awareness campaigns. 'Engaging healthcare professionals in tobacco control initiatives can enhance public education on severe health risks associated with tobacco use. Protecting the youth from tobacco addiction is crucial for ensuring the future health and well-being of the community,' he added.", "source": {"uri": "freepressjournal.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "Free Press Journal"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_No_Tobacco_Day", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "World No Tobacco Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tobacco"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indore", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indore"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Public health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Addiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madhya_Pradesh", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Madhya Pradesh"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Madhya Pradesh"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco_smoking", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tobacco smoking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infertility", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Infertility"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco_smoke", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tobacco smoke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Medical_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indian Medical Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_professional", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Health professional"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tobacco industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_artery_disease", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coronary artery disease"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-being", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Well-being"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco_control", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tobacco control"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Toxicity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_impairment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Visual impairment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stomach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esophagus", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Esophagus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoking", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Smoking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asthma", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Asthma"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Health", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Health", "wgt": 58}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Specific_Substances", "label": "dmoz/Health/Specific Substances", "wgt": 56}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Specific_Substances/Tobacco", "label": "dmoz/Health/Specific Substances/Tobacco", "wgt": 57}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Women's_Health/Smoking", "label": "dmoz/Health/Women's Health/Smoking", "wgt": 46}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Tobacco/Cigarettes", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Tobacco/Cigarettes", "wgt": 47}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://media.assettype.com/freepressjournal/2024-05/af4dabfb-322a-448a-a80c-e208e383e8b6/No_Tobacco.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9613244", "eventUri": "eng-9613244", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3647058823529412, "wgt": 189, "relevance": 1}

The industry employs appealing products and advertising tactics aimed at children and adolescents, using social media and streaming platforms, he added.\n\nDr Amina Khan, Executive Director, The Initiative, said, \"Generally 1 out of 3 people die of tobacco who do not quit tobacco use or smoking, whereas 1200 children between the age of 6-15 start smoking every day in Pakistan.\n\nTwo out of five adult smokers start smoking at the age of 10 which rings alarm bells for all to start focusing on the toddlers.\"\n\nShe noted that the policy and implementation of Pakistan was ranked very well globally whereas it should be kept abreast with the emerging trends of the tobacco industry as modern products like vapes, velo, and smokeless tobacco products are introduced that don't fall under the legislation.\n\nTo protect youth, she said the availability of single cigarettes, advertisement, and prevention needs to be given a high priority in the enforcement, policy, and awareness endeavours.\n\n\"Youth engagement in policy-making is important to devise policy actions that are well guided and properly conceived in line with the ground realities to bear optimum results,\" she added.\n\nDr Minhaj us Siraj, CEO Health Syndicate, said the tobacco industry was engaging with children through labour in the tobacco fields, whereas those kids were not able to enter schools to acquire education for life. He also mentioned \"green leaf disease\". He added that without the civil society's support no achievement in this cause was possible.\n\nDr Waseem Janjua, Research Fellow, SDPI, said the tobacco industry uses misleading tactics through advertisements promoting tobacco products that were trapping the innocent youth of the country.\n\nHe said according to a study in the US, the tobacco industry was pumping in $7.62 billion in lieu of tobacco promoting advertisements that indicated the massive magnitude of capital investment to mislead masses on smoking.", "source": {"uri": "urdupoint.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "UrduPoint"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoking", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Smoking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tobacco"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolescence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Adolescence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Administrative_units_of_Pakistan", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Administrative units of Pakistan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_cigarette", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Electronic cigarette"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tobacco industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Who", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Who"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco_smoking", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tobacco smoking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamabad", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Islamabad"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Islamabad"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotine_pouch", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nicotine pouch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electronics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nicotine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tobacco_products", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "List of tobacco products"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smokeless_tobacco", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Smokeless tobacco"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cigarette", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cigarette"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_society", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Civil society"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richter_magnitude_scale", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Richter magnitude scale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Investment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Health", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Health", "wgt": 60}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Specific_Substances", "label": "dmoz/Health/Specific Substances", "wgt": 54}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Specific_Substances/Tobacco", "label": "dmoz/Health/Specific Substances/Tobacco", "wgt": 58}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Women's_Health/Smoking", "label": "dmoz/Health/Women's Health/Smoking", "wgt": 38}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Tobacco/Cigarettes", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Tobacco/Cigarettes", "wgt": 56}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 48}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 49}], "image": "https://photo-cdn.urdupoint.com/images/UrduPoint-English-22.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9613244", "eventUri": "eng-9613244", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 188, "relevance": 1}

From eye-catching social media reels to expressive memes, our youth are pushing back, saying enough is enough!\" says Zanele Mthembu, convenor of Protect our Next.\n\nThe campaign includes a competition for youth to show their reactions to the aggressive marketing of Big Tobacco and the impact it has through social media.\n\nLesego Mateme from the South African Tobacco Free Youth Forum (SATFYF) explains, \"We're talking to youth in the social language that we use. We react to everything in particular ways on social media, and we wanted to tap into that to have a powerful impact.\"\n\nOn the ground, Protect our Next is delivering tailored school programme activities, driving awareness and gathering reactions through interactive edutainment sessions called Tobacco-free Assemblies. School communities are asked to react to Big Tobacco in photo booths. The visual results will be presented to the Department for Health.\n\n\"Protect our Next is educating schools and school communities about the tobacco industry marketing tactics targeted at children,\" says Cart Agency's Sivu Bukula, who runs the national Protect Our Next Schools Ambassador Programme.\n\n\"This campaign is about empowering the youth to take a stand as active participants in the fight against Big Tobacco. By amplifying their voices, we aim to create a ripple effect that drives awareness and sparks conversations among the youth.\"\n\nLorraine Govender, national manager, health programmes for CANSA, says, \"Through our work engaging with schools on tobacco industry targeting and tactics, it is evident that education is needed on tobacco and e-cigarettes across the school communities. Big Tobacco must be blocked. CANSA fully supports the Protect Our Next initiatives and the youth campaigns for World No Tobacco Day and throughout the year.\"\n\nResearch from the South African Medical Research Council (SAMRC) shows the prevalence of tobacco use among adolescents is on the rise, driven by aggressive youth-orientated marketing and easy access to both traditional and electronic cigarettes.\n\nThe SAMRC National University Study Report shows that about one in four university students aged 18 to 24 years report current use of e-cigarettes, and almost one in three students report current hookah smoking. The study further indicates significant exposure to advertising and marketing of these products among young people. Overall, 77.8% were exposed to any advertisement, marketing, and promotion of e-cigarettes.\n\nStudents are particularly vulnerable to marketing tactics, says Dr. Catherine Egbe, senior specialist scientist in the MASTRU at SAMRC.\n\n\"We found that students exposed to any form of advertisement, marketing and promotion were almost three times more likely to be currently using e-cigarettes or hookah compared to those not exposed,\" she said.\n\nMany of the advertising and marketing tactics reported by participants using hookah are illegal under the current law, while e-cigarette marketing has yet to be regulated in the country.\n\nProfessor Lekan Ayo-Yusuf, director of the NCAS and head of the School of Health Systems and Public Health at the University of Pretoria, has documented how tobacco retailers are often strategically located near schools.\n\n\"This proximity increases the likelihood of children being exposed to tobacco marketing and e-cigarette marketing, and facilitates easier access to these products. Early exposure to tobacco marketing contributes to long-term addiction, increasing the likelihood of starting to smoke,\" he said.\n\nStudies show socio-economic factors influence tobacco use among young people. Lower-income youths are particularly vulnerable to targeted marketing due to price promotions and accessibility, Ayo-Yusuf says.\n\nResearch further indicates a significant presence of tobacco and e-cigarette advertising on social media platforms. \"These ads often feature lifestyle imagery and influencer endorsements, making smoking and vaping appear fashionable and socially acceptable among youths,\" he adds.\n\nEgbe highlights the dangers of flavoured tobacco products, specifically designed to attract youth with flavours like fruit and candy.\n\n\"Flavoured tobacco products mask the harshness of tobacco and make it more attractive to first-time users, leading to higher rates of addiction. Flavoured e-cigarettes and hookahs can also serve as entry points for non-smokers, Egbe explains.\n\n\"Many youths perceive these products as less harmful than traditional cigarettes, which can lead to increased experimentation and regular use.\"\n\nProfessor Pamela Naidoo, CEO of the Heart and Stroke Foundation South Africa and a co-author of a policy brief on the harms of tobacco and electronic devices published by the World Heart Federation, says despite the tobacco industry's tactics to influence young people to smoke and vape, we should not underestimate the power of self-empowerment among our youth.\n\n\"As our younger generation becomes more educated and understands at a deeper level the harm that tobacco products pose to their health and well-being, they are sure to create a new wave of positive influence to help their peers stop using harmful substances. Positive behaviour change is within our reach and as advocates in the Protect our Next space, we will persevere in protecting young people across South Africa,\" says Naidoo.\n\nThe Protect Our Next partnership, which includes NCAS, the SAMRC, SATFYF, the Cancer Association of South Africa (CANSA), the Heart and Stroke Foundation South Africa (HSFSA), and the Africa Centre For Tobacco Industry Monitoring and Policy Research (ATIM), calls for several measures to stop Big Tobacco targeting young people.\n\nThese measures include higher taxes on tobacco and vape products to make them less affordable, and robust public awareness campaigns to educate youth.\n\nFurther critical measures supported by the organisations are captured in the proposed Tobacco Products and Electronic Delivery Systems Control Bill, which is still pending approval by Parliament. Importantly, all measures will apply to both tobacco products and electronic delivery systems, regulating products such as e-cigarettes and related products for the first time.\n\nThese include:\n\nThe Protect Our Next partnership strongly supports this Bill, advocating for its swift passage and rigorous enforcement, says Ayo-Yusuf.\n\n\"These measures will collectively create a healthier environment where the younger generation is less likely to initiate and maintain tobacco or e-cigarette use. As we mark World No Tobacco Day 2024, we must take decisive action to protect our next generation. We can create a healthier future by standing together and advocating for stronger regulations.\"", "source": {"uri": "themediaonline.co.za", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Media Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_African_Medical_Research_Council", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "South African Medical Research Council"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_No_Tobacco_Day", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "World No Tobacco Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Tobacco", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Big Tobacco"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_celebrity", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Internet celebrity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tobacco industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_cigarette", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Electronic cigarette"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tobacco"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Marketing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hookah", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hookah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diana,_Princess_of_Wales", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Diana, Princess of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco_smoking", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tobacco smoking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_meme", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Internet meme"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tobacco_products", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "List of tobacco products"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Pretoria", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "University of Pretoria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prevalence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoking", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Smoking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_school", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "State school"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Addiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolescence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Adolescence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Africa"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Health", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Health", "wgt": 63}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Specific_Substances", "label": "dmoz/Health/Specific Substances", "wgt": 54}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Specific_Substances/Tobacco", "label": "dmoz/Health/Specific Substances/Tobacco", "wgt": 56}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Women's_Health/Smoking", "label": "dmoz/Health/Women's Health/Smoking", "wgt": 38}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Tobacco/Cigarettes", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Tobacco/Cigarettes", "wgt": 53}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 85}], "image": "https://themediaonline.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/attractive-woman-standing-vaping-yellow-wall.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9613244", "eventUri": "eng-9613244", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 188, "relevance": 1}

This marketing increases youth exposure to tobacco products, contributing to the estimated 7 million young tobacco users in the African region.\"\n\nMoeti also pointed out the severe health risks of second-hand smoke, which causes 1.3 million preventable deaths annually. \"Second-hand smoke exposure significantly increases the risk of heart disease, stroke, respiratory diseases, type 2 diabetes, and various cancers,\" she emphasized, underscoring the need to protect non-smokers.\n\nIn response to these issues, 45 countries in the African Region have ratified the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (WHO FCTC), and 22 have adopted the protocol to eliminate illicit trade in tobacco products.\n\n\"These legislative measures have facilitated the effective implementation of the WHO FCTC in over 35 countries,\" Moeti reported.\n\nOne of the region's notable successes is the decline in adult tobacco use, from 14.9% in 2010 to 9.5% in 2023. \"The 2023 WHO Global Report on Trends shows that 22 countries in the African region are on track to achieve a 30% reduction by 2025 relative to 2010 rates,\" Dr. Moeti highlighted.\n\n\"WHO has also supported over 5,000 tobacco farmers in Kenya and Zambia to transition to alternative crops. \"This initiative not only helps reduce tobacco production but also supports sustainable livelihoods,\" Dr. Moeti explained.\n\nDespite these efforts, the tobacco industry continues to evolve its strategies to attract young people.\n\n\"The industry has diversified its arsenal, targeting youth with new products such as e-cigarettes, flavored products, smokeless tobacco, and nicotine pouches,\" Moeti said.\n\nThese products are aggressively promoted through social media, posing significant threats to young people's health.\n\nTo combat these tactics, Dr. Moeti urged African governments to enforce robust tobacco regulations. \"Countries should implement stringent controls on marketing strategies and introduce safeguards to protect tobacco-control policies from industry interference,\" she advocated. Public awareness campaigns about the tobacco industry's deceptive practices are also essential.\n\nMoeti emphasized the importance of collaboration, urging, \"All our partners, including other UN agencies, civil society organizations, and communities, must support strong measures that protect youth from the harm of tobacco products.\" Evidence-based arguments and best practices are crucial in countering the tobacco industry's influence.\n\n\"Ensuring a 100% ban on public smoking and the use of electronic cigarettes, along with applying excise taxes to reduce consumption, are effective strategies,\" Moeti stated.\n\nCommunicating health risks through graphic warnings is also critical in educating the public, particularly children and youth.\n\nMoeti reaffirmed WHO's commitment to working closely with governments to protect young people. \"We must accelerate the implementation of the WHO FCTC and take stringent measures against new and emerging tobacco and nicotine products,\" she said.\n\n\"Together, we can safeguard the health of Africa's youth and counter the tobacco industry's relentless efforts.\"\n\nMoeti's call to action is a rallying cry for all stakeholders to intensify efforts to combat tobacco use and protect the younger generation.\n\n\"Our collective efforts can make a significant difference in the fight against tobacco and its impact on public health.\n\n\"Raising awareness among the public on the tactics of the tobacco industry; and exposing industry efforts to target youth and attract generations of people with addiction through innovative approaches, including marketing new and emerging products and using flavours.\n\n\"As an organization, we encourage countries to accelerate their implementation of the WHO FCTC with stringent measures on marketing new and emerging tobacco and nicotine products, particularly designed to appeal to youth. These include shisha, e-cigarettes (flavored products), nicotine pouches, and others that are aggressively promoted through social media platforms.\n\n\"Countries should implement and enforce a 100% ban on public smoking and the use of electronic cigarettes (vaping), apply excise tax and price measures to reduce tobacco consumption and implement effective measures to communicate health risks through graphic health warnings to populations, including children and youth.\n\n\"I encourage all our partners, including other UN agencies, civil society organizations, non-governmental

He said World No Tobacco Day serves as a powerful reminder of the collective effort to combat the pervasive and devastating impact of tobacco use on public health.\n\nThe Prime Minister said it is important to note that tobacco not only impacts the individuals who consume it but also has detrimental effects on the well-being of those in close proximity.\n\nHe added that Pakistan is amongst the fifteen countries of the world, having a heavy burden of tobacco-related ill health and faces a double burden of disease primarily cancers, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes and chronic respiratory diseases.\n\nShehbaz Sharif further said the government has taken stringent measures to curb tobacco use which includes placing large-sized pictorial health warnings on tobacco packages, banning the sale of loose cigarettes, banning point-of-sale displays and increasing tobacco taxation.\n\nHowever to completely eliminate from Pakistan, both production and consumption of tobacco must be reduced. He said we have raised taxation on cigarettes to about 150 percent to discourage the use of tobacco.\n\nMoreover, all forms of tobacco advertising and promotion are prohibited, including advertising on national TV, radio, print media, billboards, point of sale advertising and product display. Restrictions are also in place on sponsorship of cigarette companies and the publicity of such sponsorship.\n\nThe Prime Minister expressed the confidence that by firmly rejecting tobacco, we can establish the groundwork for a healthier and more prosperous Pakistan.

The theme this year is \"protecting children from tobacco industry interference\".\n\nThe study, published in the BMJ, showed that the tobacco industry is flouting regulatory policies via surrogate advertising of smokeless tobacco products. This is of significance since India is a major producer and consumer of smokeless tobacco products with over 200\u2009million adult users.\n\nThe country also contributes to nearly 80 per cent of deaths attributable to smokeless tobacco products, the study showed.\n\nWhile Article 13 of the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCT), India's Cigarettes and Other Tobacco Products Act, 2003 (COTPA) prohibits direct and indirect tobacco advertising, promotion, and sponsorship (TAPS), the tobacco industry spends half a billion dollars annually on the promotion of smokeless tobacco products.\n\nThe study showed that the industry \"circumvents TAPS restrictions\" by making \"indirect and direct tobacco product promotion in sports\".\n\nProf. Monika Arora, Vice-President (Research) at the Public Health Foundation of India, calls the tactic \"brand stretching\" -- a marketing strategy where the industry markets the smokeless tobacco product with a well-developed image in a different product category.\n\nThe Professor noted that in addition to FCTC and COTPA rules, the Cable Television Network Rules, 1995, of India also prohibits TV Channels from carrying out an advertisement that directly or indirectly promotes the sale or consumption of cigarettes and other tobacco products.\n\n\"These smokeless tobacco products are being advertised as elaichi (cardamom) or pan masala as non-tobacco products. Whereas, their primary products available in the market are tobacco variants with the same brand names and are widely used as smokeless tobacco products,\" she said.\n\n\"Bollywood and sports celebrities endorsing these products is an area of concern given their massive fan following and adverse influence on adolescents and youth who consider these celebrities as their role models.\"\n\nAccording to data, India has 266.8 million adult tobacco users, which includes cigarette, and bidi smokers as well as smokeless tobacco users buying products in loose form.\n\nTobacco is a common risk factor for the rising cases of non-communicable diseases like cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and chronic respiratory diseases in India.\n\nThe public health expert called for \"strict enforcement\" of Section 5 of COTPA that underscores the prohibition of direct and indirect forms of Tobacco Advertising Promotions and Sponsorships \"to effectively address the issue of glamourisation of smoking\".\n\n\"We need to initiate targeted campaigns in schools to dissuade children and adolescents from initiating smoking under the influence of excessive exposure being projected through advertisements, movies, and web series on streaming platforms,\" Prof. Monika said.", "source": {"uri": "socialnews.xyz", "dataType": "news", "title": "Social News XYZ"}, "authors":

Smoking was common in his home neighbourhood of Cansado in Nouadhibou and he simply followed by example. \"For me, smoking meant being trendy and mature. But that was just an illusion,\" he says.\n\nOver time, Ifrah realized that the use of tobacco was negatively affecting his health. \"I knew that smoking was bad for me because I experienced breathing difficulties, especially shortness of breath. I tried to stop several times. I'd manage for a few hours, but the urge to smoke was too strong. I'd become anxious and irritable and then I'd relapse,\" he says.\n\nIn Mauritania, World Health Organization's STEPwise approach to surveillance (STEPS) 2008 survey revealed that 22.6% of the country's adolescents aged between 13 and 15 use tobacco, the habit enabled by easy access to tobacco products for everyone, including children.\n\nToday, however, legal steps to introduce graphic health warnings on tobacco packaging are changing the status quo. The 2021 Global Adult Tobacco Survey shows that between 2012 and 2021, tobacco use in Mauritania has declined by 8%, from 18% to 10%.\n\nThe new legislation, implemented in 2018, aligns with WHO recommendations which stipulate that all tobacco products on sale in Mauritania must carry a health warning covering at least 70% of the surface area of both sides of the packaging.\n\nThe aim is to raise public awareness, especially among young people, about the dangers of tobacco use, which is the leading cause of death and noncommunicable diseases such as cancer, heart disease and chronic lung disease in the country.\n\n\"We have seen the law play a major role in the fight against tobacco use in our country,\" says Dr Abdallah Bouhabib, Deputy Director General of Public Health in the Mauritania Ministry of Health. \"Health warnings on tobacco packaging, particularly those combining text and images, have been one of the most cost-effective and efficient ways of raising public awareness of the serious health risks associated with smoking.\"\n\nAccording to the survey, nearly 25% of smokers in Mauritania first noticed health warnings on cigarette packages, while 14% of smokers thought about quitting because of warning labels. \"I stopped smoking when I realized the negative consequences for my health. It wasn't easy, but I made a firm decision to quit,\" says Ahmad Ahki, 41, who used tobacco for more than 10 years. \"I was supported by my whole community. I think that's what allowed me to stay sane and give it up for good.\"\n\nFor Ifrah, the graphic warnings changed everything. \"I saw an image of horror. I felt a heaviness in my chest and dark images of illness and death came to mind. That was the day I decided to stop,\" he says. \"Indeed, a lot of my friends had the same experience and, in our group, we all stopped smoking.\"\n\nThe battle is far from over. The results of the global tobacco use survey indicate that around 34% of Mauritanians are still exposed to tobacco smoke in the workplace and that tobacco consumption among men is almost eight times higher than for women.\n\nFor WHO, tobacco use is an epidemic that demands an effective response. \"The adoption of this law is a good thing because it has helped to reduce the prevalence of smoking in Mauritania. We need to build on these achievements with a social and health approach to change attitudes and demystify the misconceptions surrounding tobacco consumption, especially among young people and adolescents,\" says Dr Charlotte Faty Ndiaye, WHO Representative in Mauritania.\n\n\"The disparities between genders and the high rate of exposure in the workplace, highlighted by the survey, underline the urgent need for robust health campaigns,\" she says.\n\nWith WHO support, Mauritania's Health Ministry has provided tobacco control training to 15 regional governors. Focal people have also been trained and assigned to government and regional departments. They are responsible for raising awareness and mobilizing community leaders, including religious leaders, in support of tobacco control activities.\n\nIn addition to the legal interventions, the country is implementing other anti-smoking initiatives, such as awareness campaigns around the dangers of tobacco consumption, a ban on smoking in public places and the introduction of tobacco taxes, a portion of which funds efforts to combat tobacco-related diseases.\n\n\"Quitting smoking is the best decision I've ever made for my health and I'm very proud of it,\" says Ifrah. \"Giving up smoking is difficult, but not impossible. With willpower and determination, it can be done.\"", "source": {"uri": "afro.who.int", "dataType": "news", "title": "WHO | Regional Office for Africa"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The young people use these nicotine products alongside the traditional tobacco products such as cigarettes, or as a gateway to the traditional tobacco products\" says KETCA.\n\nThe NACADA's TADSAS 2022 survey showed that 3.2 per cent of youths (15-24 years) currently use tobacco products.\n\n\"A higher figure (3.4 per cent), said they had ever used e-cigarettes. Once they get addicted, these youths represent a lifetime of profits to the industry, which is aggressively recruiting more\" says Joel Gitali, the chairman of KETCA which is the umbrella body for all organisations involved in tobacco control in Kenya.\n\nAccording to the World Health Organization, the rate of e-cigarette use among adolescents now exceeds that of adults in many countries.\n\n\"This fact is contained in the WHO's report, \"Hooking the next generation\", which is being launched today. \"This crisis underscores the urgent need to protect Kenyan children and youth from the aggressive tactics of the tobacco industry,\" Gitali observes.\n\n\"With approximately 9,000 Kenyans losing their lives each year to tobacco-related illnesses, the theme for this year World No Tobacco Day -- Protecting Children from Tobacco Industry Interference and Marketing\" -- is both timely and crucial,\" Mr Gitali said.\n\ne-cigarettes\n\nMore than two-thirds (67.8%) of e-cigarette users report using them primarily because of their flavors, while nearly half (49.6%) wrongly believe e-cigarettes are less harmful than traditional tobacco products, latest survey by Tobacco Control Board reveals.\n\nThe study shows that initiation into tobacco use often begins in adolescence, with the minimum age of initiation ranging from six years for traditional tobacco products to 17 years for e-cigarettes and 20 years for nicotine pouches.\n\nKenya has stringent tobacco control laws under the Tobacco Control Act and the Tobacco Control Regulations 2014.\n\n\"However, the full implementation of these laws has never been realised. Indeed the extent of tobacco industry interference in Kenya is increasing alarmingly. According to the Global Tobacco Industry Interference Index 2023, Kenya ranks 21st out of 90 countries, in terms of tobacco industry interference in health policies,\" said Mr Gitali.\n\n\"In light of these concerning trends, KETCA strongly advocates for several policy recommendations. Firstly, there should be a total ban on nicotine pouches, e-cigarettes and all vape products in Kenya. We also call for substantial and regular increase in tobacco taxes to ensure that tobacco prices rise above inflation, as Kenyan youth are highly sensitive to price changes,\" said Mr Thomas Lindi, the National Coordinator of KETCA.\n\nHe further called for a comprehensive ban on the advertising, promotion, sponsorship, online sales, and delivery of all new tobacco products, including e-cigarettes and nicotine pouches, as well as the use of flavours in these products.\n\n\"Larger graphic health warnings on all tobacco and related nicotine products sold in Kenya are necessary to deter youth from initiating use. We call on policymakers, educators, parents, and the broader community to unite in this critical fight to protect our children from the tobacco industry's aggressive and deceptive tactics\" the Alliance insists.", "source": {"uri": "kbc.co.ke", "dataType": "news", "title": "KBC | Kenya's Watching"}, "authors": [{"uri": "margaret_kalekye@kbc.co.ke", "name": "Margaret Kalekye", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotine_pouch", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nicotine pouch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tobacco_products", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "List of tobacco products"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_cigarette", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Electronic cigarette"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tobacco"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Addiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenya", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kenya"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Kenya"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco_Control_(journal)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tobacco Control (journal)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tobacco industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolescence", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Adolescence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_(drug)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alcohol (drug)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hookah", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hookah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco_smoking", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tobacco smoking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lobbying", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lobbying"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World Health Organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_No_Tobacco_Day", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World No Tobacco Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco_control", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tobacco control"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cigarette", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cigarette"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nicotine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marketing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Health policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Advertising"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Health", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Health", "wgt": 60}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Specific_Substances", "label": "dmoz/Health/Specific Substances", "wgt": 52}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Specific_Substances/Tobacco", "label": "dmoz/Health/Specific Substances/Tobacco", "wgt": 55}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Tobacco/Cigarettes", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Tobacco/Cigarettes", "wgt": 52}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Tobacco/Cigarettes", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Tobacco/Cigarettes", "wgt": 36}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://www.kbc.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/tobacco-day.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9613244", "eventUri": "eng-9613244", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-31", "textStart": 269, "textEnd": 275}], "sentiment": -0.1529411764705882, "wgt": 184, "relevance": 1}

In a poignant initiative to mark World No Tobacco Day 2024, P. D. Hinduja Hospital & Medical Research Centre created a striking installation featuring several four-foot-tall cigarettes hanging from trees by nooses. This symbolizes the pervasive impact of tobacco use on people and the environment. P.D. Hinduja Hospital seeks to create awareness and educate the public about the urgent need to quit tobacco and advocate for a healthier life and safe environment.\n\nAccording to the WHO, India is the second-largest consumer and producer of tobacco with over 270 million active users and faces significant repercussions from tobacco consumption. Annually, 1.35 million Indian lives are lost due to this habit. [1]Moreover, the tobacco industry's global footprint includes generating over 170,000 tons of waste and deforesting 600 million trees[2]. Each tree felled produces merely enough paper for 15 packs of cigarettes. This stark reality underscores how tobacco consumption not only impacts human lives but also contributes to deforestation, soil degradation, and environmental pollution.\n\nMr. Gautam Khanna, CEO, of P. D. Hinduja Hospital and Medical Research Centre, expressed his support for the initiative, stating, \"On this World No Tobacco Day, let us remind ourselves of the far-reaching consequences of consuming tobacco. By highlighting the impact on both human health and the environment, we hope to inspire individuals and communities to take decisive action against tobacco use. We are committed to fostering a healthier society and a cleaner environment.\"\n\nIn India, the prevalence of tobacco use remains a significant public health challenge. The Global Adult Tobacco Survey (GATS) indicates that in India, of all adults, 28.6% currently consume tobacco either in smoked or smokeless form, including 42.4% of men and 14.2% of women. Smoking is a major contributor to respiratory diseases, cardiovascular conditions, and cancer in India[3].\n\nDr. Lancelot Mark Pinto, Consultant Pulmonologist and Epidemiologist, P. D. Hinduja Hospital and Medical Research Centre, shared, \"Our daily interactions with patients underscore the devastating impact of tobacco consumption on health, causing respiratory diseases, cardiovascular conditions, and even cancer. This installation highlights the need for comprehensive tobacco control, addressing health and environmental concerns, to mobilise collective efforts to reduce tobacco use and promote sustainability.\"\n\nThe World No Tobacco Day Installation event not only underscores the critical need for tobacco cessation but also emphasizes the importance of environmental stewardship. Through this unique and visually impactful initiative, P.D. Hinduja Hospital and Medical Research Centre hopes to galvanize the community towards a future free from the detrimental effects of tobacco.", "source": {"uri": "indiaeducationdiary.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "India Education,Education News India,Education News  | India Education Diary"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P._D._Hinduja_National_Hospital_and_Medical_Research_Centre", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "P.

The NSS volunteers, equipped with informative pamphlets and posters, engaged in one-on-one interactions with the residents, discussing the ill effects of smoking and chewing tobacco.\n\nIn addition to the distribution of educational materials, the students also conducted a series of street plays and skits to visually and dramatically highlight the consequences of tobacco addiction. These performances drew considerable attention and were highly effective in engagingly conveying the message.\n\nThe programme also featured talks by health experts and former tobacco users who shared their personal stories of struggle and recovery, emphasising the importance of quitting tobacco for a healthier life. These testimonials served as powerful motivators for those contemplating giving up the habit.\n\nThe event concluded with a pledge-taking ceremony where participants vowed to abstain from tobacco use and spread awareness about its dangers within their communities. The success of this campaign has set a positive precedent, encouraging other educational institutions to undertake similar initiatives.\n\nIt is noteworthy that on this World No Tobacco Day, youth across the world called for the tobacco industry to stop targeting them with products that are harmful to their health.\n\nThe young people also called on governments to adopt policies to protect them from these manipulative practices, including relentless marketing of harmful products.\n\nThe Member States of the World Health Organization designated May 31 as World No Tobacco Day in 1987, to draw attention to the global tobacco epidemic, and the preventable death and disease it causes.

India grapples with a staggering challenge in tobacco consumption, recording one of the highest usage rates globally. In 2020, 27% of the population aged 15 and above were tobacco users, while more than 120 million were adult smokers. Both smoking and oral forms of tobacco are alarmingly prevalent. Therefore, it is crucial to implement progressive policies that align with the user's psychometric journey, to minimize the impact on them effectively. On this World No Tobacco Day, subject matter experts and members of the Global Sustainability Alliance's (GSA)'Leadership Council for Good Health and Well-being, a coalition uniting stakeholders committed to achieving equitable and sustainable goals, passionately highlighted the urgent need for adopting progressive harm reduction strategies that could potentially save 1.35 million lives annually.\n\nTobacco-induced diseases currently impact almost 267 million lives in the country alone, with countless more at risk of this epidemic. In 2019, the World Health Organization (WHO) reported that tobacco use cost India almost 1% of its GDP due to disease and premature deaths. Treating tobacco-related illnesses consumes almost 5.3% of the nation's health expenditure, amounting to Rs. 13,500 crores, annually, in medical expenses and productivity losses.\n\nImplementing effective tobacco control policies could significantly reduce these losses, freeing up crucial economic resources for other social policies. This is especially important for a country like India, where reducing non-communicable diseases, such as cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), is vital for accelerating sustainable development within the country.\n\nSharing the dire state of India's tobacco epidemic, Dr. Bharat Gopal, Director & Head, Dept. of Pulmonology, Critical Care & Sleep Medicine, Delhi Heart and Lung Institute (DHLI), said, \"Tobacco use, specifically cigarettes and oral tobacco, have a devastating impact on the Indian population. Numerous lives are lost daily due to consumption of tobacco. According to the report titled 'Human Centric Approach to Tobacco Control', 27% of Indians use tobacco in some form, eventually resulting in a heavy disease burden, which is heart-wrenching to witness, the daily impact it has on families nationwide. It is a known fact by now that tobacco smoke contains over 70 known carcinogens. Smoking damages nearly every organ in the body, leading to numerous diseases and overall diminished health. Many countries like the UK, Sweden & Japan have successfully reduced tobacco consumption, owing to evidence-based policies that their respective governments have adopted.\"\n\nIn 2018, there were 250 million tobacco users aged between 16 to 64 in India. While smoking rates are lower than the global average, they remain substantial. The prevalence of smoking among young adults aged 20-44 is particularly alarming, as this group actively contributes to the workforce. Smoking cigarettes and bidis alone account for a drastic 54.2 percent of the tobacco-using population.\n\nProf. Dr. R Zimlichman, Director of the Brunner Institute for Cardiovascular Research at Tel Aviv University's Sackler Faculty of Medicine, commented on the global success of progressive tobacco policies, saying, \"Global policies aiming to reduce harm have seen success in multiple countries. We know stopping smoking is ideal, but the reality is that millions struggle to quit. Sweden is a great case study for policymakers, to see how harm reduction, a scientifically proven strategic policy approach, offers a pragmatic and potentially life-saving alternative. Embracing these strategies has led to a remarkable decline in mortality rates in Sweden, with almost a 41% lower incidence of cancer in the country, as compared with the EU. The world needs standardized alternatives, promoted by governments, for their safety and efficacy. Delay in implementing these measures costs millions of lives worldwide.\"\n\nFurther emphasizing the importance of scientific strategies for India, Dr. Karan Thakur, Vice President, Apollo Hospitals, New Delhi, stated, \"India is the second-largest tobacco consumer in the world, despite growing awareness about its adverse health effects. We critically need harm reduction strategies to lower tobacco-induced diseases, like cancer. Medical practitioners should advise patients to quit tobacco through approved nicotine replacement therapies and provide less harmful alternatives under strict regulation, for those who cannot quit entirely. Given the current scenario, it is extremely important for public health strategies to emulate the success of progressive policies, relying on innovation and scientific evidence.\"\n\nAs India stands on the brink of becoming a global economic leader, it is vital that the country and its policy leaders adopt successful strategies to support tobacco users and enhance public health. Tobacco, as a grassroots issue, necessitates increased awareness of the associated health risks. A healthy population is essential for India to fully realize its competitive advantage on the world stage -- its citizens. Implementing progressive policies is essential not only for achieving a tobacco-free nation but also for mitigating the substantial health and economic burdens imposed by tobacco use. Adopting harm reduction and innovative strategies can save lives and pave the way for a healthier and more prosperous future for India.\n\nAbout Global Sustainability Alliance's Leadership Council for Good Health and Well-being\n\nThe Global Sustainability Alliance's Leadership Council for Good Health and Well-being is an initiative of The Times Group's Global Sustainability Alliance (GSA) and ET Edge.

It adds that 6.8% of men, 1.5% of women, and 4.3% of all adults currently use smokeless tobacco. Overall, 39.7% of men, 6.2% of women, and 23.7% of all adults either smoke tobacco or use smokeless tobacco.\n\nDr Mushtaq said the government has implemented numerous measures to reduce tobacco consumption. \"Over the past four years, thousands of challans have been issued and substantial fines collected from violators for smoking in public places in the Kashmir division. These efforts have resulted in hundreds of people quitting smoking, with thousands receiving counselling and pharmacotherapy sessions,\" he said.\n\n\"Awareness programs are being conducted to inform people about the ill effects of tobacco. If we can make people conscious of the dangers, enforcement will not be as necessary,\" the Nodal Officer said, adding, \"Various awareness initiatives have already been launched to educate the public about the hazards of tobacco use, and officials have been instructed to carry out regular enforcement drives for the implementation of COTPA-2003.\"\n\nAccording to officials, smokers and tobacco users are 2.5 times more likely to develop tuberculosis (TB). \"Tobacco use raises the risk of TB, increases recurrence, and impairs treatment,\" they said while urging people to quit tobacco for a healthier future.\n\nThe government of Jammu and Kashmir has imposed a complete ban on the sale of loose cigarettes, loose bidis, and loose tobacco. All educational institutions and tourist destinations have been declared tobacco-free zones.\n\nTobacco is recognised as the leading cause of preventable deaths worldwide, killing over seven million people globally and more than one million in India annually.

observance of the World No Tobacco Day on May 31, the Ministry of Health (MoH) has launched a media campaign aimed at preventing the use of electronic cigarettes and heated tobacco products to safeguard children and public health.\n\nThis year's theme, initiated by the World Health Organization (WHO), is 'Protecting children from tobacco industry interference.'\n\nDeputy Minister of Health Tran Van Thuan reported a significant increase in electronic cigarette use among students aged 13 to 17, rising from 2.6% in 2019 to 8.1% in 2023.\n\nIn those aged 13 to 15, usage more than doubled from 3.5% in 2022 to 8% in 2023.\n\nWHO emphasised that this day is an opportunity for young people worldwide to raise awareness and demand that the tobacco industry stop targeting children and adolescents with harmful products.\n\nIt also calls on governments to implement strong tobacco control measures to protect youth from tobacco advertising, including on social media and digital platforms.\n\nThe ministry's campaign not only aims to raise awareness but also to take concrete actions to prevent and reduce the use of new tobacco products in the community, particularly among teenagers, who are the most vulnerable group.\n\n\"We will focus on raising public awareness about the harms of heated tobacco and electronic cigarettes, and encourage parents, schools, and the community to work together to protect the younger generation,\" Thuan said.\n\nIn implementing the National Strategy for Tobacco Harm Prevention and the recent directive from Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh on strengthening the management of electronic cigarettes and heated tobacco products, numerous practical activities have been carried out by ministries, organisations and localities.\n\nThese activities include the campaign 'Vietnamese youth say no to tobacco and electronic cigarettes.'\n\nThe ministry calls on agencies, organisations and the entire community to continue engaging in practical activities and enhancing communication to build a smoke-free environment and strictly enforce the Law on Tobacco Harm Prevention.\n\nSchools are urged to intensify education and organise extracurricular activities to equip students with the knowledge to protect themselves from the allure of new-generation tobacco products.\n\nParents should talk to their children about the risks of electronic cigarettes and heated tobacco, helping them understand and confidently say no to these products./.\n\nVNA", "source": {"uri": "en.vietnamplus.vn", "dataType": "news", "title":

He has received fees for consulting services in court cases pertaining to the content on social media platforms.\n\nAbout 37 million children ages 13 to 15 around the world use tobacco, according to a 2024 report from the World Health Organization.\n\nIn 2023, e-cigarettes were the most commonly used tobacco product in the U.S., with 7.7% of middle school and high school students reporting e-cigarette use. Cigarettes were the next most common, with 1.6% of middle- and high school students saying they had consumed them in the past month.\n\nResearch shows that most people who use tobacco start in childhood.\n\nI am a public health researcher who studies the different ways in which corporations influence adolescent health, with current projects focused on identifying sources of exposure to tobacco marketing among adolescents and young adults.\n\nOver the past decade, I've researched ways in which tobacco companies market to children and young adults.\n\nHealth harms of tobacco\n\nSmoking is harmful to every organ in the human body and is known to cause many types of cancers and heart disease, among other problems. Nicotine, by itself, in products like e-cigarettes and oral pouches, is harmful to adolescent brain development.\n\nThe adolescent brain develops into early adulthood, especially in the prefrontal cortex. This part of the brain is involved in higher cognitive development, including functions pertaining to attention, memory and cognitive flexibility. Research has shown that nicotine exposure results in long-term functional and structural changes in the brain.\n\nOld tactics in new US products\n\nDecades of research have documented how tobacco companies marketed tobacco products for years to attract young customers in order to sustain and grow their businesses.\n\nIn a 2021 study, my team and I showed that exposure to e-cigarette marketing with cartoon images decreased high school students' perceptions of harm from e-cigarettes. Research makes clear that this change in perspective can make adolescents more open to trying e-cigarettes.\n\nIn an earlier study, my team and I examined the impact of e-cigarette product placement and imagery in music videos on propensity to use e-cigarettes among young adults. We found that exposure to e-cigarette product placement in music videos increased young adults' intentions to try e-cigarettes in the future.\n\nStriking at an early age\n\nWhile our research has largely focused on the U.S. context, several recent studies have shown how tobacco companies continue to market to children in other parts of the world.\n\nFor example, a team of researchers conducted focus groups among Chinese adolescents to understand sources of tobacco marketing exposure and what features made ads attractive. They found that adolescents reported being exposed to tobacco ad campaigns near their home and school. These young Chinese people also reported that bright colors, product packaging and price promotions featured in e-cigarette ads and other promotional materials attracted their attention.\n\nIn England, a 2022 study provided an overview of marketing claims present on the websites of popular e-cigarette brands. Most notably, the study found that U.K websites featured medicinal claims for smoking cessation, associations with youth culture and depictions of young people using e-cigarettes.\n\nNormalizing tobacco use\n\nThe emergence of social media platforms has led tobacco companies to shift their marketing tactics from traditional channels like magazines, billboards and retail stores to online channels, capitalizing on the time that young people spend on screens.\n\nTobacco companies have helped normalize tobacco use online with the help of branded social media account pages and social media influencers. For example, in 2021, researchers discovered that e-cigarettes were being used and promoted by influencers on Amazon-owned Twitch, a video-sharing platform popular among adolescent gamers.\n\nSimilarly, streaming platforms normalize tobacco use. For example, in a 2022 study, my team and I analyzed Netflix original TV shows and films for e-cigarette-related content. Most notably, we documented brief representations of teenagers holding e-cigarettes in the PG-13 film \"Hubie Halloween.\" Our findings contradict Netflix's no e-cigarette pledge for PG-13 content.\n\nThis suggests a need for further outside-party monitoring of e-cigarettes in Netflix programming.\n\nSpreading awareness\n\nEvery country will have to effectively enforce and expand restrictions on cigarette and e-cigarette marketing to protect children and teenagers from messages that encourage them to try smoking and vaping. Additional efforts are needed everywhere to help discourage young people from getting hooked on tobacco.\n\nMost parents, teachers and other authority figures are likely unaware of the extent to which young people are exposed to tobacco content online, including tobacco ads and peer-generated posts on social media that normalize tobacco use.\n\nCampaigns focused on tobacco-related digital media literacy could create awareness about tobacco products and describe how they are being marketed in the digital environment. There are various evidence-based resources that could be built upon to help young people evaluate tobacco advertising messages, empowering digital and social media users to actively evaluate information rather than remain a passive target for the industry's marketing.\n\nI am certain that increased awareness could prevent young people from consuming tobacco.", "source": {"uri": "theconversation.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Conversation"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tobacco industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_school", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Secondary school"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_cigarette", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Electronic cigarette"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tobacco"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolescence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Adolescence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Marketing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Brain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco_smoking", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tobacco smoking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotine", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Nicotine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1988_California_Proposition_99", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "1988 California Proposition 99"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_placement", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Product placement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cigarette", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cigarette"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_video", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Music video"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_school", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Middle school"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Institutes_of_Health", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Institutes of Health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_body", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Human body"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_class", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Middle class"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiovascular_disease", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cardiovascular disease"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World Health Organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_people", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chinese people"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Health", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Health", "wgt": 56}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Specific_Substances", "label": "dmoz/Health/Specific Substances", "wgt": 53}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Specific_Substances/Tobacco", "label": "dmoz/Health/Specific Substances/Tobacco", "wgt": 55}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Tobacco/Cigarettes", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Tobacco/Cigarettes", "wgt": 50}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Tobacco/Cigarettes", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Tobacco/Cigarettes", "wgt": 46}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 87}], "image": "https://images.theconversation.com/files/597588/original/file-20240530-17-3qyy7f.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=0%2C246%2C8243%2C4121&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9613244", "eventUri": "eng-9613244", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 174, "relevance": 1}

The significance of this special day is to encourage people who smoke to quit and those\n\nwho don't to never start. World No Tobacco Day is often celebrated by highlighting the health risks\n\nassociated with tobacco use and advocating for the effective monitoring of the sale, distribution,\n\nconsumption and promotion of tobacco products. Every year tobacco kills more than 8 million people, 7\n\nmillion of which are due to tobacco use while approximately 1.2 million are due to non-smokers being\n\nexposed to second-hand smoke.\n\nThis year's theme for World No Tobacco Day, \"Protecting children from tobacco industry interference\",\n\ncuts to the core of a disturbing truth - The tobacco industry needs replacement users and youth are a\n\nprimary target. Many of us use social media and are constantly bombarded with advertisements.\n\nDisturbingly, among these ads, the tobacco industry has found a way to infiltrate the screens of youth with\n\nflashy, colourful promotions for their products. These ads are meticulously designed to appeal to youthful\n\nsensibilities, making smoking and vaping seem attractive and harmless.\n\nThe Rising Threat of New and Emerging Tobacco Products\n\nTraditional cigarettes are no longer the only threat. The rise of electronic cigarettes, oral nicotine products\n\netc., have introduced a new dimension to the problem. These products are often marketed as safer\n\nalternatives or cessation tools, but they pose significant risks, especially to young, developing brains. The\n\nappeal of e-cigarettes to adolescents is particularly troubling. A 2022 study of 47 countries found that\n\n8.6% of youth reported using e-cigarettes in the last 30 days. In the Caribbean a handful of countries are\n\nregulating e-cigarettes including Jamaica, Guyana, and Barbados, who have banned e-cigarette use in\n\npublic places. Antigua and Barbuda, along with Suriname, have taken an even stronger stance by\n\nprohibiting the import, distribution, and sale of e-cigarettes altogether. Despite these measures, the Global\n\nYouth Tobacco Survey (GYTS) data showed current use of e-cigarettes among 13-15-year-old students\n\nranging from 4.0% in Antigua and Barbuda to 17.2% in Trinidad and Tobago. Trinidad and Tobago has the\n\nsecond-highest rate of youth e-cigarette use in all of the Americas, following the United States. Traditional\n\ncigarette smoking among youth still continues to be a major concern because they are regarded as the\n\nsmokers of tomorrow as three to four out of every ten ever-smokers, in the Caribbean region, initiated\n\nsmoking before the age of 10 years.\n\nTobacco use, in any form, is linked to numerous health risks, including an increased likelihood of\n\ndeveloping cancer, heart disease, and respiratory conditions. Electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS)\n\nor e-cigarettes containing nicotine are particularly harmful as they can lead to nicotine addiction, which\n\nadversely affects brain development in adolescents, potentially impairing memory, concentration, and\n\nlearning abilities. Even e-cigarettes without nicotine or electronic non-nicotine delivery systems (ENNDS)\n\ncan be dangerous due to the inhalation of harmful chemicals and flavourings that can cause respiratory\n\nissues and other health problems. Nicotine pouches, though marketed as a safer alternative, still deliver\n\nhighly addictive nicotine and can lead to dependency, oral health issues, and an increased risk of\n\ntransitioning to other tobacco products. The link between vaping and mental health issues is becoming\n\nincreasingly evident. A U.S study published in 2019, examined the association between e-cigarette use\n\nand depression and found that current e-cigarette users had more than twice the odds of reporting a\n\nhistory of clinical depression compared to those who had never used e-cigarettes. Specifically, current\n\ne-cigarette users were 2.10 times more likely to report depression, with the odds increasing with the\n\nfrequency of use.\n\nThe Tobacco Industry's Pervasive Marketing Strategies\n\nAs a youth tobacco control advocate, I am especially concerned with the tobacco industry's persistent\n\nmarketing in the Caribbean. With social media being widely used, especially among young people,\n\ntobacco companies are leveraging platforms like Facebook, Instagram, X formerly known as Twitter, and\n\nTikTok to promote their addictive products. These companies, having honed their skills in targeting youth,\n\nare now implementing online marketing strategies that are both sophisticated and pervasive. These\n\nstrategies include lifestyle campaigns that link tobacco and nicotine with freedom, rebellion, and\n\nyouthfulness, creating an appealing image that resonates strongly with adolescents. Additionally, tobacco\n\ncompanies are compensating social media influencers to endorse their brands subtly, seamlessly\n\nintegrating their products into the daily lives of young followers. A report from the Campaign for\n\nTobacco-Free Kids, titled #SponsoredByBigTobacco, reveals that promotional content for Velo, IQOS and\n\nVuse (products by British American Tobacco and Phillip Morris) has accumulated over 3.4 billion views on\n\nsocial media and reached more than 150 million young people under the age of 25.\n\nThe tobacco industry is also using carnivals and festivals as a marketing opportunity. For example, British\n\nAmerican Tobacco heavily promoted their vaping device, Vuse, during the Jamaican Carnival. They used\n\nsocial media to advertise a promotion where purchasing Vuse products gave participants a chance to win\n\na t-shirt package to Play Mas. They even had their own carnival truck and tents where Vuse products\n\nwere prominently displayed. This type of marketing not only targets young adults but also attracts young\n\nchildren and teenagers, embedding the presence of tobacco products in the festive and culturally\n\nsignificant atmosphere of carnival. This concerted effort has allowed Big Tobacco to reach a massive\n\nyoung audience, making addictive products seem normal and even desirable through extensive in-person\n\nand social media exposure.\n\nFrom conversations with my peers, it's clear why vapes are so enticing: the wide range of flavours, their\n\ntrendy image, affordability, and the misleading perception that they are harmless.Companies like Philip\n\nMorris and the West Indian Tobacco Company Limited have capitalised on these perceptions by\n\nadvancing their own \"smoke-free vision\" - marketing their vaping devices as \"risk-reduced alternatives\"\n\nand a way for adult smokers to quit tobacco. However, the evidence shows a different story. Studies have\n\nshown that youth often misunderstand these claims, and are led to believe that these products are without\n\nharm, leading to an increased likelihood of nicotine and tobacco-use initiation.\n\nThe Urgent Need for Comprehensive Regulations\n\nThe WHO's newly published report, Hooking the Next Generation: how the tobacco industry captures\n\nyoung customers, has revealed the strategies employed by the tobacco and nicotine industry to entice\n\nyouth. Recent statistics show that 85% of 15-30-year-olds have been exposed to e-cigarette advertising,\n\nwith higher exposure linked to increased use. In light of this data, Caribbean youth are joining the call to\n\naction on World No Tobacco Day 2024, urging our governments to protect us from the manipulative\n\ntactics of the tobacco industry. This call to action aims to raise awareness and mobilise efforts to prevent\n\nthe targeting and exploitation of young people by these harmful products and deceptive strategies. It is\n\ncrucial to reveal how the industry markets new products as \"reduced risk\" alternatives, misleading young\n\nconsumers. Moreover, comprehensive regulations are essential to protect youth from new tobacco and\n\nnicotine products. Extending smoke-free laws to include e-cigarettes and other novel products, as well as\n\nbanning flavours that appeal to young users, are vital steps in preventing the renormalization of smoking\n\nbehaviours.\n\nIn collaboration with the HCC, I developed the Youth Tobacco Advocacy Portal, which serves as a\n\nplatform to share information, strategies, and resources to combat tobacco use and influence policy\n\nchanges. For WNTD 2023, the HCC launched a report developed in collaboration with PAHO:, Vaping\n\nAmong Adolescents and Youth in the Caribbean Situation, Policy Responses and Recommended Actions,\n\nwhich provides guidance to Caribbean governments. Governments play a crucial role in this fight and\n\nshould take decisive actions to safeguard youth. Based on this report's recommendations, I urge our\n\ngovernments to implement and enforce the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC):\n\n\u25cf Implement and enforce comprehensive bans on tobacco advertising, promotion, and\n\nsponsorship (TAPS), including guidelines for digital and cross-border marketing, to prevent\n\ntobacco companies from exploiting new media platforms to target youth.\n\n\u25cf Raise prices and taxes on tobacco and nicotine products to make them less affordable and\n\nless accessible to young people.\n\n\u25cf Strictly enforce bans on the sale of tobacco and nicotine products to children.\n\n\u25cf Address tobacco industry interference and conflict of interest. The tobacco industry's\n\npersistent interference in policy-making demands stringent measures. Rejecting any partnerships\n\nor agreements with the industry is paramount, given their history of undermining tobacco control\n\nefforts. Moreover, enhancing transparency in the industry's lobbying and marketing practices is\n\nimperative to safeguard policy-making processes from undue influence. Good governance\n\npolicies must be enacted to ensure transparency and address conflict of interest and industry\n\ninterference, aligning with the principles outlined in the 2023 Bridgetown Declaration on NCDs\n\nand Mental Health and Article 5.3 of the WHO FCTC.\n\n\u25cf Update legislation to include ENDS and ENNDS to address the evolving landscape of tobacco\n\nproducts and ensure comprehensive protection for youth.\n\nAs we commemorate World No Tobacco Day 2024, we must remember that safeguarding our youth from\n\nthe tobacco industry's predatory practices is non-negotiable. The rise of new and alluring tobacco\n\nproducts, coupled with the relentless barrage of social media marketing, underscores the urgency of our\n\nresponse. Our governments must heed the call to action, enacting comprehensive regulations and\n\nenforcing existing frameworks like the WHO FCTC with unwavering determination. By prioritising\n\ntransparency, accountability, and the well-being of our youth, we can dismantle the tobacco industry's web\n\nof deceit and protect future generations from the grip of addiction and disease.\n\nLet this day serve as a catalyst for change, uniting us in our resolve to build a nicotine and tobacco-free\n\nCaribbean.

This shows that the tobacco industry has no qualms about targeting the younger generation.\n\nDeceptive strategies targeting the very young\n\nIn its new products, the tobacco industry promotes sweet, innocuous-looking flavors reminiscent of childhood, such as candy, fruit or chocolate, rather than the \"tobacco\" taste that doesn't appeal to the youngest generation. In fact, over 70% of young e-cigarette users in the United States said they would stop smoking altogether if the only flavor available was \"tobacco\".\n\nThe e-cigarette is just as dangerous and addictive as the traditional cigarette, but it is designed and presented as a toy, and at a low price.\n\n'These industries are intentionally designing products and utilizing marketing strategies that appeal directly to children' says Dr Ruediger Krech, Director of the WHO's Department of Health Promotion.\n\n'The use of child-friendly flavours like cotton candy and bubblegum, combined with sleek and colourful designs that resemble toys, is a blatant attempt to addict young people to these harmful products,' he adds.\n\nGreenwashing by the industry\n\nBig tobacco companies present themselves as leaders in social and environmental responsibility, but only choose evaluation criteria that give them a positive image.\n\nIn an attempt to give themselves a good reputation, they promote simple environmental actions, such as planting trees or collecting cigarette butts on beaches, but in reality these actions have little impact, according to the WHO.\n\nOn the contrary, tobacco seriously harms the environment at every stage of its production; cigarette filters, made of toxic plastics, are one of the main sources of pollution.\n\nSince the development of electronic products in the industry, toxic waste has been on the increase, particularly with the arrival of single-use e-cigarettes known as \"puffs\".\n\nNew product, same danger\n\nDespite existing progress in tobacco cessation, the emergence of e-cigarettes and other novel tobacco and nicotine products poses a serious threat to young people, and even children, and is undermining efforts to combat smoking.\n\nStudies show that using e-cigarettes almost triples the risk of later smoking conventional cigarettes.\n\nThese deceptive strategies underline the need for strict regulation to protect young people from a harmful addiction that would last a lifetime.\n\n'History is repeating, as the tobacco industry tries to sell the same nicotine to our children in different packaging,' says Dr Tedros Adhanom Gebreyesus, Director-General of the WHO. 'These industries are actively targeting schools, children and young people with new products that are essentially a candy-flavoured trap. How can they talk about harm reduction when they are marketing these dangerous, highly-addictive products to children?'\n\nCombating aggressive industry lobbying\n\nThe WHO is calling on governments to take strict measures to protect young people, by banning or severely regulating nicotine-based products, creating 100% smoke-free public spaces and increasing taxes on these products. Raising public awareness of misleading industry advertising and supporting youth-led educational initiatives are also essential.\n\n'Addicted youth represent a lifetime of profits to the industry,' adds Jorge Alday, STOP Director at public health specialist Vital Strategies. 'That's why the industry aggressively lobbies to create an environment that makes it cheap, attractive and easy for youth to get hooked. If policy makers don't act, current and future generations may be facing a new wave of harms, characterized by addiction to and use of many tobacco and nicotine products, including cigarettes.'", "source": {"uri": "unric.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "United Nations Regional Information Centre"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tobacco industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_cigarette", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Electronic cigarette"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tobacco"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "World Health Organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Who", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "The Who"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candy", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Candy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cigarette", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cigarette"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoking", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Smoking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chocolate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chocolate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fruit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fruit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolescence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Adolescence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disposable_product", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Disposable product"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cigarette_filter", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cigarette filter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenwashing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Greenwashing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Health_(Philippines)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Department of Health (Philippines)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxic_waste", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Toxic waste"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Toy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Toxicity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmentalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Environmentalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plastic", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Plastic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electronics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tedros_Adhanom", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tedros Adhanom"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Health", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Health", "wgt": 49}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Specific_Substances", "label": "dmoz/Health/Specific Substances", "wgt": 46}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Specific_Substances/Tobacco", "label": "dmoz/Health/Specific Substances/Tobacco", "wgt": 49}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Tobacco/Cigarettes", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Tobacco/Cigarettes", "wgt": 43}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Tobacco/Cigarettes", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Tobacco/Cigarettes", "wgt": 41}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://e4k4c4x9.rocketcdn.me/en/wp-content/uploads/sites/15/2024/05/Post_2-v7_1080x1080_72dpi.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9613244", "eventUri": "eng-9613244", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 170, "relevance": 1}

Cigarettes were the next most common, with 1.6% of middle- and high school students saying they had consumed them in the past month.\n\nResearch shows that most people who use tobacco start in childhood.\n\nI am a public health researcher who studies the different ways in which corporations influence adolescent health, with current projects focused on identifying sources of exposure to tobacco marketing among adolescents and young adults.\n\nOver the past decade, I've researched ways in which tobacco companies market to children and young adults.\n\nHealth harms of tobacco\n\nSmoking is harmful to every organ in the human body and is known to cause many types of cancers and heart disease, among other problems. Nicotine, by itself, in products like e-cigarettes and oral pouches, is harmful to adolescent brain development.\n\nThe adolescent brain develops into early adulthood, especially in the prefrontal cortex. This part of the brain is involved in higher cognitive development, including functions pertaining to attention, memory and cognitive flexibility. Research has shown that nicotine exposure results in long-term functional and structural changes in the brain.\n\nOld tactics in new US products\n\nDecades of research have documented how tobacco companies marketed tobacco products for years to attract young customers in order to sustain and grow their businesses.\n\nIn a 2021 study, my team and I showed that exposure to e-cigarette marketing with cartoon images decreased high school students' perceptions of harm from e-cigarettes. Research makes clear that this change in perspective can make adolescents more open to trying e-cigarettes.\n\nIn an earlier study, my team and I examined the impact of e-cigarette product placement and imagery in music videos on propensity to use e-cigarettes among young adults. We found that exposure to e-cigarette product placement in music videos increased young adults' intentions to try e-cigarettes in the future.\n\nStriking at an early age\n\nWhile our research has largely focused on the U.S. context, several recent studies have shown how tobacco companies continue to market to children in other parts of the world.\n\nFor example, a team of researchers conducted focus groups among Chinese adolescents to understand sources of tobacco marketing exposure and what features made ads attractive. They found that adolescents reported being exposed to tobacco ad campaigns near their home and school. These young Chinese people also reported that bright colors, product packaging and price promotions featured in e-cigarette ads and other promotional materials attracted their attention.\n\nIn England, a 2022 study provided an overview of marketing claims present on the websites of popular e-cigarette brands. Most notably, the study found that U.K websites featured medicinal claims for smoking cessation, associations with youth culture and depictions of young people using e-cigarettes.\n\nNormalizing tobacco use\n\nThe emergence of social media platforms has led tobacco companies to shift their marketing tactics from traditional channels like magazines, billboards and retail stores to online channels, capitalizing on the time that young people spend on screens.\n\nTobacco companies have helped normalize tobacco use online with the help of branded social media account pages and social media influencers. For example, in 2021, researchers discovered that e-cigarettes were being used and promoted by influencers on Amazon-owned Twitch, a video-sharing platform popular among adolescent gamers.\n\nSimilarly, streaming platforms normalize tobacco use. For example, in a 2022 study, my team and I analyzed Netflix original TV shows and films for e-cigarette-related content. Most notably, we documented brief representations of teenagers holding e-cigarettes in the PG-13 film \"Hubie Halloween.\" Our findings contradict Netflix's no e-cigarette pledge for PG-13 content.\n\nThis suggests a need for further outside-party monitoring of e-cigarettes in Netflix programming.\n\nSpreading awareness\n\nEvery country will have to effectively enforce and expand restrictions on cigarette and e-cigarette marketing to protect children and teenagers from messages that encourage them to try smoking and vaping. Additional efforts are needed everywhere to help discourage young people from getting hooked on tobacco.\n\nMost parents, teachers and other authority figures are likely unaware of the extent to which young people are exposed to tobacco content online, including tobacco ads and peer-generated posts on social media that normalize tobacco use.\n\nCampaigns focused on tobacco-related digital media literacy could create awareness about tobacco products and describe how they are being marketed in the digital environment. There are various evidence-based resources that could be built upon to help young people evaluate tobacco advertising messages, empowering digital and social media users to actively evaluate information rather than remain a passive target for the industry's marketing.\n\nI am certain that increased awareness could prevent young people from consuming tobacco.\n\nJon-Patrick Allem receives funding from the California Tobacco Control Program, and the National Institutes of Health.

young people aged 13-15 years use some form of tobacco.\n\nProducts such as electronic cigarettes and nicotine pouches are gaining popularity among youth.\n\nIt is estimated that 12.5% of adolescents in the European Region used e-cigarettes in 2022 compared to 2% of adults.\n\nIn some countries of the Region, the rates of e-cigarette use among school children are 2-3 times higher than the rates of cigarette smoking.\n\nAs per the WHO The industry wilfully sells a deadly dependency to young people, therefore WNTD 2024 calls on the governments and tobacco control community to protect current and future generations and to hold the tobacco industry liable for the harm it causes.\n\nThe WHO passed a resolution WHA40.38 in 1987 and declared April 7, 1988, \"a world no-smoking day.\n\nThis marks the 40th anniversary of the organisation and this was the first step in the direction of a broader movement.\n\nOnce the no-smoking day succeeded, the WHO established Resolution WHA42.19 in 1988 and created World No Tobacco Day which will be observed every year on May 31.\n\nThis day plays a key role in raising awareness among people about the potential health risks associated with tobacco

And, every year in Canada, exposure to second-hand smoke causes nearly 1000 deaths from lung cancer and heart disease in people who do not smoke. Second-hand smoke contains the same chemicals that are inhaled by the person smoking and is especially dangerous for babies and children.\n\nThis year's theme - Protecting children from tobacco industry interference - highlights the life saving importance of protecting young people from the harmful effects of tobacco and preventing dependency. We will continue to work alongside our partners in Canada and internationally to keep people safe and healthy. The federal government acknowledges that traditional tobacco has long been sacred and important to many First Nations and M\u00e9tis People, whose uses differ from those of commercial tobacco. Today, we are raising awareness of the harms of commercial tobacco use and the benefits of quitting smoking.\n\nOur government has strengthened the packaging and labelling requirements of tobacco products, becoming the first country in the world to require health warnings directly on individual cigarettes. This increases the reach of health warnings, especially among youth who often use individual cigarettes in social situations and may not see the health hazards information printed on the package.\n\nToday, we announced $9,548,880 through the Healthy Canadians and Communities Fund for three organizations, including the Canadian Cancer Society, the University of Toronto and McMaster University. The funding will help create supportive social environments for tobacco prevention and cessation for at-risk populations.\n\nThe Government of Canada has resources available to help people quit smoking.

Young people across the world are calling for the tobacco industry to stop targeting them with products that are harmful to their health,\" WHO Regional Director for Southeast Asia, Saima Wazed, said.\n\nAccording to the WHO, tobacco use is a major risk factor for many chronic diseases, including cancer, lung disease, cardiovascular disease and stroke. It is one of the major causes of death and disease in India and accounts for nearly 1.35 million deaths every year. India is also the second-largest consumer and producer of tobacco.

And even if awareness has been growing steadily over the past few decades, the fact remains that in Quebec, smoking claims 35 victims a day. It is responsible for the deaths of nearly 13,000 Quebecers every year. Tobacco consumption is the world's leading cause of preventable illness and death. It has major repercussions on smokers and on all living beings around them.\n\nAnyone over the age of 40 probably remembers seeing people in bars (a law was passed in 2006 to ban smoking), in restaurants, when they started out with sections reserved for smokers, and respect for this so-called section was often left to the goodwill of restaurant owners who didn't want to displease their clientele.\n\nThose over 65 no doubt remember smoking in offices, hospitals and most means of transport, even planes and trains. Then came the introduction of non-smoking sections in transport, which wasn't an unqualified success either, as the smoke escaped everywhere or forced smokers to practically faint in a smoky, overcrowded mini-section.\n\nIn Quebec, both smokers and non-smokers have been made aware over the years of the effects of involuntary exposure to tobacco smoke through a number of media campaigns and the adoption of legislation restricting smoking in certain places. Since 1998, successive provincial laws have banned smoking in workplaces and public places, on school grounds, and within a nine-metre radius of entrances to health, social services and educational establishments, day-care centers, etc., as well as in public places.\n\nOnce again this year, on World No Tobacco Day, WHO and public health advocates from around the world will join forces to raise awareness of the tobacco industry's harmful influences on young people. Protecting children from tobacco industry interference is the theme of World No Tobacco Day 2024.\n\nThis theme is a plea to stop targeting youth with harmful tobacco products. It provides a forum for young people, policy-makers and tobacco control advocates around the world to discuss the issue and urge governments to adopt policies that protect young people from the manipulative practices of the tobacco and related industries. Although tobacco use has declined over the years, thanks to the phenomenal efforts made by those involved in tobacco control, more needs to be done to protect these vulnerable groups.\n\nWorldwide, according to data from 2022, at least 37 million young people aged 13 to 15 use some form of tobacco.\n\nIf you visit the Qu\u00e9bec sans tabac portal, you'll find a wealth of information on tips and methods for quitting smoking, as well as on how to ask for help, get information, prevent or stop smoking:\n\nhttps://www.quebecsanstabac.ca/?\n\nMay 31, 2024 could be the best time to think about it, make up your mind or ask for help.

Photo Courtesy: Pixabay\n\nAccording to various studies and data by hospitals, tobacco-induced cancer cases are seeing a surge by putting a significant burden on the state's healthcare system. Experts are of the opinion that this is majorly because of the lack of awareness about the symptoms of such cancers, and exposure to tobacco products in early age. Studies say that 27 per cent of Maharashtra's population is affected by the adverse effects of tobacco consumption.\n\nDr Sabita Jiwnani, professor, Thoracic services at Department of Surgical Oncology, Tata Memorial Hospital, emphasised the urgent need to make sure that school and college students are not exposed to tobacco products. Commenting on the need to prevent students from initiating the use of tobacco, Dr. Sabita said, \"People who start smoking before 21 years of age are more likely to become addicted to tobacco and continue smoking throughout their lives. This indicates the urgency to strengthen the regulations prohibiting the sale of tobacco products near to school and college premises. This itself will help to a great extent to reduce the number of tobacco induced health problems.\"\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nPrevention is the most effective way to reduce mortality due to cancer from tobacco. But despite increased education and awareness about the harmful effects of tobacco use, people are still prone to start smoking due to peer influence and the easy availability of tobacco products. Hence, it's important for those who use tobacco products regularly to undergo timely screening. If tobacco related cancers are detected early, they can be treated well with advanced minimal invasive techniques, one of them being robotic-assisted surgery by using Da Vinci.\n\nHighlighting the significance of early screening and detection, Dr Sabita added, \"In 2023, at the Tata Memorial hospital, the Thoracic Disease Management group registered 2600 lung cancer patients and 1800 oesophageal cancer patients, but only 140 lung cancer cases and 180 oesophagus cases could be operated, as the rest of them either reported at an advanced stage or were not fit for surgery. Even among the 140 patients with lung cancer, hardly 10 were in stage 1.\"\n\nMany people tend to ignore symptoms like a persistent cough that lasts for three to four weeks. For instance, common symptoms of lung cancer include chest pain, coughing up blood, and shortness of breath. These symptoms are often mistaken for pulmonary tuberculosis, leading to misdiagnosis and treatment with anti-tubercular medications, which leaves the root problem untreated.\n\nDr. Sabita further added, \"It is important to educate the public about the signs and symptoms associated with lung cancer and esophageal cancer resulting from tobacco use. It is equally crucial that patients with a history of smoking, tobacco chewing or those who have smoked for more than 15 years undergo low dose CT scans every year. Early detection of these cancers increases the five-year survival rate to 80 to 85 percent, while detecting them at an advanced stage can pose significant challenges for treatment and cure\".\n\n\"However, with the advancement of technology, patients are able to surpass various challenges that come with the detection in later stages, and doctors are able to effectively treat some of the complex cases by using multimodality therapy, and minimally invasive approaches like robot-assisted surgery thus offering hope for better prognosis\", she added.", "source": {"uri": "mid-day.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "mid-day"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoking", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Smoking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tobacco"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tata_Memorial_Centre", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tata Memorial Centre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncology", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Oncology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung_cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lung cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Health system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Adverse effect"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esophageal_cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Esophageal cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco_smoking", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tobacco smoking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortality_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mortality rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Surgery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimally_invasive_procedure", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minimally invasive procedure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medication", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Medication"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CT_scan", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CT scan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortness_of_breath", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shortness of breath"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robot-assisted_surgery", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Robot-assisted surgery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five-year_survival_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Five-year survival rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_error", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Medical error"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemoptysis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hemoptysis"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Health", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Health", "wgt": 53}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Specific_Substances", "label": "dmoz/Health/Specific Substances", "wgt": 57}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Specific_Substances/Tobacco", "label": "dmoz/Health/Specific Substances/Tobacco", "wgt": 58}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Women's_Health/Smoking", "label": "dmoz/Health/Women's Health/Smoking", "wgt": 46}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Tobacco/Cigarettes", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Tobacco/Cigarettes", "wgt": 49}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 82}], "image": "https://images.mid-day.com/images/images/2024/may/Smokingpixabay_d.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9613244", "eventUri": "eng-9613244", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-31", "textStart": 307, "textEnd": 313}], "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 167, "relevance": 1}

Tobacco uses significantly increases the risk of cancers of the oral cavity, oesophagus, larynx, bladder, pancreas, cervix, kidney, and leukemia. Effective tobacco control requires a two-pronged approach: preventing initiation and supporting those who already use tobacco. To help them quit, readily available smoking cessation programs should be offered.\n\nThese programs can be a lifeline, providing various forms of support: tailored counselling sessions for coping with cravings and triggers, nicotine replacement therapy (gum or patches) to ease withdrawal symptoms, and even prescription medications that target the brain's addiction pathways.\n\nThis ever-evolving landscape of nicotine delivery systems demands a nimble public health response. While complete abstinence is the ultimate goal, harm reduction strategies could be explored as a complementary approach. Imagine encouraging smokers to switch to potentially less harmful alternatives, like regulated e-cigarettes (with the emphasis on potentially and regulated). This wouldn't be an endorsement of e-cigarettes, but a pragmatic recognition that some individuals might struggle to quit entirely.\n\nThe Invisible Threat: Second-hand Smoke\n\nThe danger zone extends far beyond the smoker themselves. Inhaling second-hand smoke, the invisible fumes that waft from a burning cigarette or other tobacco product, poses a significant health risk to non-smokers. These fumes aren't harmless bystanders - they're a toxic cocktail containing over 7,000 chemicals, including the same 70 known carcinogens found in direct smoke.\n\nThis toxic exposure puts non-smoking bystanders at increased risk for a range of devastating health problems. They face a higher risk of lung cancer, even if they've never touched a cigarette in their life. Second-hand smoke also damages the heart and blood vessels, increasing the risk of heart disease and stroke. For children exposed to second-hand smoke, the consequences can be even more severe. They can experience frequent respiratory infections, ear infections, and even develop asthma. Perhaps the most heartbreaking consequence is the increased risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) for babies exposed in utero or after birth. Second-hand smoke isn't just an unpleasant odor - it's a silent threat with potentially deadly consequences.\n\nThe Staggering Human Cost of Tobacco Use\n\nThe misconception that smokeless tobacco products like chewing tobacco or snuff are a safer alternative to cigarettes is a dangerous public health myth. These products deliver a potent dose of nicotine, the highly addictive substance in tobacco that keeps users hooked. However, the risk factors doesn't stop. Smokeless tobacco also harbours a multitude of carcinogens that can cause oral cancer, a particularly devastating form of the disease.\n\nA Future Free from Tobacco's Grip\n\nThe fight against tobacco is a moving target. The long-term health effects of e-cigarettes remain unclear, but concerns are rising about their potential to hook young people onto nicotine. Public health efforts need to adapt to this evolving landscape of nicotine delivery systems. Additionally, while complete abstinence is ideal, harm reduction strategies like encouraging smokers to switch to potentially less harmful alternatives, such as regulated e-cigarettes, could be explored as a complementary approach.\n\nThe battle against tobacco's grip on global health demands a multifaceted approach. By acknowledging the deceptive nature of tobacco products, implementing robust public health policies, and providing accessible cessation programs, we can create a future where tobacco use is no longer a leading driver of the cancer epidemic. However, the fight doesn't stop there. Continued research on emerging trends like e-cigarettes and a willingness to explore harm reduction strategies, when appropriate, are crucial for staying ahead of this evolving public health challenge. Ultimately, by working together, we can empower individuals to make informed choices and pave the way for a healthier world, free from the devastating consequences of tobacco use.\n\nTobacco use is a major driver of the cancer epidemic. By acknowledging the dangers of tobacco, implementing effective public health measures, and empowering individuals to quit, we can collectively work towards a future with a significantly reduced cancer burden. This future requires sustained commitment from governments, public health organisations, and individuals alike. By prioritising tobacco control efforts, we can create a healthier world for generations to come.", "source": {"uri": "news9live.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News9live"}, "authors": [{"uri": "simran_arora@news9live.com", "name": "Simran Arora", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passive_smoking", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Passive smoking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_cigarette", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Electronic cigarette"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cigarette", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cigarette"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tobacco"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Public health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco_smoking", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tobacco smoking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotine", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Nicotine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bladder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bladder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIDS", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "SIDS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotine_replacement_therapy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nicotine replacement therapy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harm_reduction", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Harm reduction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoking_cessation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Smoking cessation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cervix", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cervix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_withdrawal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Drug withdrawal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukemia", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Leukemia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larynx", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Larynx"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinogen", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Carcinogen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prescription_drug", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prescription drug"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Toxicity"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Health", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Health", "wgt": 56}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Specific_Substances", "label": "dmoz/Health/Specific Substances", "wgt": 62}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Specific_Substances/Tobacco", "label": "dmoz/Health/Specific Substances/Tobacco", "wgt": 63}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Women's_Health/Smoking", "label": "dmoz/Health/Women's Health/Smoking", "wgt": 45}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Tobacco/Cigarettes", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Tobacco/Cigarettes", "wgt": 51}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://images.news9live.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/vaping-2-scaled.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9613244", "eventUri": "eng-9613244", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 167, "relevance": 1}

However, recent data from the World Health Organisation (WHO) provides a beacon of hope: the world could be free of tobacco by 2040. This ambitious vision is supported by promising trends in smoking cessation, alternative habits, and public health initiatives.\n\nA comparative study by WHO highlights a significant decline in the number of active smokers worldwide. The global smoking rate has decreased from 27 per cent in 2000 to 19 per cent in 2020. This decline is attributed to stringent tobacco control policies, increased awareness (including commercial activities) of smoking hazards, and higher taxes on tobacco products. Countries like Australia and the United Kingdom have seen particularly sharp declines due to their aggressive anti-smoking campaigns.\n\nEncouragingly, the number of people quitting smoking is on the rise. A recent study by the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC) shows that over the past decade about 40 per cent of smokers in high-income countries, such as countries in Southeast Asia, Eastern Europe, and parts of Africa, have successfully quit. In the United States, the percentage of former smokers rose from 13 per cent in 2000 to 20 per cent in 2020. This trend is bolstered by effective cessation programs, support groups, and medical interventions such as nicotine replacement therapy and prescription medications.\n\nWhile quitting smoking altogether is ideal, many have turned to alternative habits. The rise of e-cigarettes, nicotine patches, lozenges, and gums provide smokers with less harmful options. The WHO reports that about 15 per cent of former smokers have switched to e-cigarettes, citing them as less harmful but not entirely risk-free. E-cigarettes and vaping devices, although controversial, have been instrumental in reducing conventional cigarette use.\n\nCountries with the highest smoking rates and tobacco-related diseases\n\nDespite the global decline, some countries still struggle with high smoking rates. Bangladesh, Indonesia, Russia, and China top the list, with smoking rates exceeding 30 per cent. These countries face significant challenges due to cultural norms, weak tobacco control policies, and the tobacco industry's influence.\n\nOn the health front, countries with the highest incidence of lung diseases due to smoking include China, India, and the United States. These nations report the highest numbers of lung cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and other respiratory illnesses directly linked to tobacco use. The economic burden of these diseases is immense, straining healthcare systems and reducing productivity.\n\nTobacco use dramatically increases the chances of developing serious lung diseases. According to the National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion studies, smokers have an 85 per cent chance of developing COPD (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease), a 25 per cent chance of developing asthma, and a 15 per cent chance of developing lung cancer. These sobering statistics highlight the critical need for tobacco cessation and prevention efforts.\n\nThe age demographics of smokers reveal that young adults are the most affected group. In May 2024, WHO released a global report which highlighted globally 37 million children aged as young as 13-15 years have been smoking tobacco, and the rate of e-cigarette use among adolescents surpassed that of adults. However, anti-smoking campaigns and educational programs in schools are making strides in curbing this trend.\n\nThe market for tobacco alternatives has expanded significantly, offering various products like e-cigarettes, heated tobacco products, and smokeless tobacco. While these alternatives are generally considered less harmful than traditional cigarettes, their long-term health effects are still under scrutiny. Studies indicate that e-cigarettes and heated tobacco products contain fewer carcinogens but are not completely risk-free. In fact, it has been found that e-cigarette use increases conventional use of cigarettes, particularly among non-smoking youth, by nearly three times.\n\nNicotine patches and gums are among the safer options, aiding many in their journey to quit smoking. These products have proven beneficial in reducing withdrawal symptoms and doubling the chances of quitting successfully compared to going cold turkey.", "source": {"uri": "expresshealthcare.in",

But this comes with major risks, not only for smokers, but also for the environment, especially the soil and water.\n\nOutput has increased constantly in recent years. According to the Department of Agricultural Extension (DAE), this was made possible by higher yielding varieties, along with an intensive use of chemical fertilisers and pesticides.\n\nHowever, a 2017 report by the World Health Organisation (WHO) found that the more intensive use of fertilisers in these varieties is more harmful for the environment and farmers.\n\nIn 2016, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina promised to impose stricter tobacco controls to bring the country into line with the 2003 WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control.\n\nAlthough the effects of tobacco on human health are well-known (cardiovascular diseases, cancers, and respiratory illnesses), its impact on the environment are almost unknown.\n\nThe various effects of tobacco production can negatively affect soil fertility, contaminate water, and pollute the air on such a scale that it poses a much greater risk than the production of any other crop.\n\nTobacco is also a major cause of carbon emissions and deforestation: 300 cigarettes are equivalent to 1 tree.\n\nBangladesh is the 12th largest tobacco grower in the world as of 2020, according to the University of Bath, United Kingdom.\n\nIn 2022/2023, 65,227 tonnes of tobacco were produced on 26,475 hectares (65,421 acres) of land, that is 1 per cent of the country's arable land.\n\nAlthough the sector is good for the Bangladeshi economy, as a major sources of tax revenue and exports, it carries high risks, such as the reckless use of pesticides. Combined with the natural characteristics of the plant, this can change the natural composition of water and soil.\n\n\"As farmers often apply excessive chemical fertilisers and pesticides provided by the big tobacco companies for higher yields, the soil loses fertility and the nearby water turns toxic, according to a scientific study done in Kushtia, a major tobacco growing district,\" writes The Daily Star.\n\nThe effects on water are also not negligible. According to a 2022 WHO report, a single cigarette requires about 3.7 litres of water in its life cycle through cultivation, production, transportation, use, and disposal.\n\nTobacco needs eight times more water than crops like tomatoes and potatoes. The drinking water needs of one person can be met for an entire year with the amount of water used in producing, consuming, and disposing of a single kilogram of tobacco.\n\nAccording to The Daily Star, \"The 2015 study in Kushtia shows that various hazardous residues, including 1,3-dichloropropene and aldicarb sulfoxide and aldicarb sulfonic toxic elements that come from pesticides, can enter the drainage aquifer and surface water and turn the water toxic.\"\n\nOne example is the Halda River, in the south of the country, where tobacco farming has compromised aquatic life, including some fish species.\n\nLocal farmers say they are aware of the risks. The Daily Star interviewed seven of them in Bandarban and Khagracchari, all of whom confirmed the negative effects on the environment and their health.\n\n\"Yet they are attracted to tobacco farming because of the high profit margin compared to other crops made possible by the cash, input and technical support from tobacco companies,\" explains the paper.\n\nAccording to a study by the Policy Research Institute, tobacco farmers' earnings are 30 per cent higher than those of those who grow other crops.\n\nThese growers are \"contracted\" with large tobacco companies, first and foremost British American Tobacco (BAT), the main player in the sector.\n\nAccording to the company's own data, almost 52,000 farmers were contracted in 2023, up from 30,000 in 2018, confirming the countrywide trend.", "source": {"uri": "asianews.it", "dataType": "news", "title": "Asia News.it"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fertilizer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5,

It is essential to understand why the tobacco industry targets the youth and the harmful effects of tobacco intake, in any form, on the human body.\n\nOne of the main components of tobacco is nicotine. Nicotine is a psychoactive compound that exerts profound effects on the brain's reward system, neurotransmitter activity, and neural circuits, contributing to addiction and impacting various cognitive and emotional functions.\n\nWhy is the youth so easily influenced and targeted? During adolescence, part of the brain responsible for decision-making and impulse control, the pre-frontal cortex, is still undergoing development. This developmental stage makes young individuals susceptible to risk-taking behaviours concerning their health and safety. This includes the usage of nicotine and other\n\nsubstances. There are many risks associated with exposing their developing brains to nicotine, such as increased vulnerability to long-term consequences like nicotine addiction, mood disorders, and enduring reductions in impulse control, potentially damaging brain regions crucial for attention and learning processes.\n\nNicotine can have significant effects on the brain, particularly when it comes to addiction. The brain releases a chemical known as dopamine, which causes mood-altering changes that temporarily make the person feel good. Inhaled smoke delivers nicotine to the brain within 20 seconds, making it highly addictive; giving feelings of relaxation and pleasure. This level of addiction can be compared to that of opioids, alcohol, and cocaine. Repeated use results in the brain reducing the number of dopamine receptors, which creates tolerance and subsequently reinforces addiction. Furthermore, nicotine affects various neurotransmitters, impacting mood regulation, cognitive function, and attention span.\n\nChronic nicotine exposure leads to long-term changes in brain structure and function, altering synaptic transmission, receptor density, and neuronal connectivity, contributing to dependence and addiction. A drop in nicotine levels leads to withdrawal symptoms such as irritability, anxiety, restlessness, difficulty concentrating, increased appetite, and leading to consequent nicotine cravings which can make quitting quite a challenging task.\n\nThe tobacco industry utilises behavioural science research to market tobacco to the youth through various strategies, such as digital marketing, which intensifies exposure to tobacco advertisements through multiple channels more than traditional marketing. The tobacco industry employs various tactics to target youth despite regulations aimed at preventing such practices. These include advertising and marketing strategies that appeal to young people, such as colourful packaging, catchy slogans, and imagery associating smoking with glamour, independence, and social status. Product placement in movies, TV shows, and music videos which normalise smoking, making it seem desirable to young audiences. The introduction of flavoured tobacco products, like fruit or candy-flavoured cigarettes and e-cigarettes, masks the harsh taste of tobacco, increasing its palatability.\n\nTobacco companies also leverage social media platforms and influencers to reach young audiences through sponsored content and partnerships with famous personalities; this includes sponsorship of events such as music concerts and sporting events, increases brand visibility and associates tobacco products with activities that appeal to young people. Offering discounts, coupons, and promotional giveaways makes tobacco products more accessible and appealing to young consumers with limited disposable income.\n\nDespite increased scrutiny and regulations in many countries, the tobacco industry continues to adapt marketing strategies to reach young people, often exploiting legal loopholes or operating in regions with less stringent regulations.\n\nWhat is the way forward?\n\nFirstly, educating parents and raising awareness amongst adolescents is incredibly important. Parents are encouraged to foster strong relationships with their children by spending quality time together and help regulate their children's electronic device usage by involving them in extra-curricular or outdoor activities. When children face certain challenges, seeking help from mental health professionals such as psychiatrists and psychologists is advised to help them overcome whatever struggles they are facing.\n\nLastly, government officials and policymakers need to formulate and implement policies to monitor tobacco marketing to protect our youth further. Through this, we can create a supportive environment that promotes children's and adolescents' well-being and healthy development.", "source": {"uri": "tribune.com.pk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Express Tribune"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tobacco industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tobacco"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Addiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nicotine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Brain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurotransmitter", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Neurotransmitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inhibitory_control", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Inhibitory control"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognition", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cognition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_circuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Neural circuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision-making", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Decision-making"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reward_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Reward system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prefrontal_cortex", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prefrontal cortex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mood_disorder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mood disorder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoactive_drug", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Psychoactive drug"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupational_safety_and_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Occupational safety and health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_body", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Human body"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prenatal_development", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prenatal development"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotine_marketing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nicotine marketing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_(drug)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alcohol (drug)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurotransmission", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Neurotransmission"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Health", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Health", "wgt": 49}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Specific_Substances", "label": "dmoz/Health/Specific Substances", "wgt": 47}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Specific_Substances/Tobacco", "label": "dmoz/Health/Specific Substances/Tobacco", "wgt": 49}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Women's_Health/Smoking", "label": "dmoz/Health/Women's Health/Smoking", "wgt": 30}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Tobacco/Cigarettes", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Tobacco/Cigarettes", "wgt": 39}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/tobacco1717148913-0/tobacco1717148913-0.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9613244", "eventUri": "eng-9613244", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-31", "textStart": 54, "textEnd": 60}], "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 162, "relevance": 1}

And, every year in Canada, exposure to second-hand smoke causes nearly 1000 deaths from lung cancer and heart disease in people who do not smoke. Second-hand smoke contains the same chemicals that are inhaled by the person smoking and is especially dangerous for babies and children.\n\nThis year's theme - Protecting children from tobacco industry interference - highlights the life saving importance of protecting young people from the harmful effects of tobacco and preventing dependency. We will continue to work alongside our partners in Canada and internationally to keep people safe and healthy. The federal government acknowledges that traditional tobacco has long been sacred and important to many First Nations and M\u00e9tis People, whose uses differ from those of commercial tobacco. Today, we are raising awareness of the harms of commercial tobacco use and the benefits of quitting smoking.\n\nOur government has strengthened the packaging and labelling requirements of tobacco products, becoming the first country in the world to require health warnings directly on individual cigarettes. This increases the reach of health warnings, especially among youth who often use individual cigarettes in social situations and may not see the health hazards information printed on the package.\n\nToday, we announced $9,548,880 through the Healthy Canadians and Communities Fund for three organizations, including the Canadian Cancer Society, the University of Toronto and McMaster University. The funding will help create supportive social environments for tobacco prevention and cessation for at-risk populations.\n\nThe Government of Canada has resources available to help people quit smoking. The \"I Quit for Me\" guide equips youth with practical information to help them quit smoking or vaping. Additionally, the Tools for a Smoke-Free Life campaign encourages individuals who smoke to learn more about the array of tools and supports that can help them quit.\n\nQuitting smoking is possible. Building a quit plan around your needs is the first step to success. Canadians can contact the pan-Canadian toll-free quitline where trained specialists can help them develop a plan, provide support, answer questions and provide referrals to programs and services in their community.

For the full year, the company reported sales was PKR 315,844.42 million compared to PKR 232,600.28 million a year ago.\n\nRevenue was PKR 109,932.87 million compared to PKR 94,862.24 million a year ago. Net income was PKR 28,959.66 million compared to PKR 21,320.93 million a year ago. Basic earnings per share from continuing operations was PKR 113.35 compared to PKR 83.45 a year ago.\" Refuting the claims made by the tobacco industry regarding their contributions to the Pakistani economy and their threats to withdraw investment requires a closer examination of the broader economic, social, and health impacts of the tobacco industry. This brief analysis will help clarify the situation and highlight why encouraging the tobacco industry to move its operations out of Pakistan could be beneficial in the long run.\n\nImagine an iceberg floating in the ocean. The visible tip above the water represents the direct taxes paid by the tobacco industry to the Pakistani government, which the tobacco industry claims to be significant. However, the much larger, submerged part of the iceberg represents the hidden and indirect costs imposed by the tobacco industry on society, which are often overlooked in such discussions. These hidden costs far outweigh the visible benefits. Both local as well as international tobacco industries and their affiliates argue that their presence in Pakistan brings substantial financial benefits through taxes and investments. They highlight that the tobacco sector is projected to pay Rs220 billion in taxes this fiscal year, a figure presented as a critical contribution to the national economy. They also mention that increased taxes on cigarettes have led to a 38 percent slump in sales and a rise in the illicit market, claiming that this reduces overall tax revenue. However, they completely ignore and shove under the rug the unregulated sales of e-cigarettes/vapes and nicotine pouches - making our youth a generation of nicotine addicts.\n\nThe visible tip above the water represents the direct taxes paid by the tobacco industry.\n\nAdditionally, the submerged part of the iceberg - representing the hidden costs - tells a very different story. The true cost of the tobacco industry in Pakistan includes: Firstly, the healthcare cost. Tobacco use is a major cause of various health issues, including 12 types of cancers including lung, throat, mouth, and numerous other kinds of cancers, heart disease, and respiratory illnesses. Treating these diseases imposes a heavy burden on Pakistan's healthcare system. According to estimates by SDPI, PIDE, and SPDC, the cost of tobacco-related diseases in Pakistan runs into hundreds of billions of rupees annually - up to PKR 615 billion. This far exceeds the taxes paid by the tobacco companies that have thus far maxed out almost PKR 140 billion. Secondly, this also results in lost productivity: Smoking-related illnesses and deaths reduce the workforce and lower productivity. This loss is often not immediately visible but has a profound impact on the economy. Workers who fall ill or die prematurely due to smoking-related conditions contribute to lost economic output, further diminishing the supposed benefits of the tobacco industry. Hooking up the youth would mean bestowing Pakistan with a sick generation that is addicted to electronic and nicotine products. Thirdly, the environmental damage is unfathomable. The cultivation and production of tobacco contribute to deforestation, soil degradation, water pollution, and fresh air. These environmental impacts have long-term consequences that require significant resources to mitigate and rectify, and the tobacco industry in Pakistan is going scot-free.\n\nMore recently, there have been reports regarding the confiscation of large swaths of illicit cigarettes in many towns where tobacco factories operate. The tobacco industry also claims that high taxes drive the illicit market, but the reality is that the existence of an illicit market is often facilitated by the same companies' practices. They benefit from it indirectly by maintaining a market presence through cheaper, untaxed products. Additionally, strong enforcement and regulatory measures, rather than lowering taxes, are key to combating illicit trade. The presence of the tobacco industry in Pakistan also has social costs, including increased rates of smoking among youth and vulnerable populations, leading to a cycle of addiction and health problems that can perpetuate poverty and hinder social progress.\n\nAs reported by the newspapers, some of the tobacco industry representatives threatened to withdraw investment and relocate operations if taxes are increased further should be seen in the context of the larger iceberg of hidden costs. While the visible tip - tax contributions and investments-appears significant, it is dwarfed by the submerged costs borne by society. The claimed Rs220 billion in taxes projected by the tobacco sector this year is overshadowed by the estimated annual economic loss of PKR 615 billion due to healthcare costs, lost productivity, and other indirect costs. Moreover, these taxes have increased due to the successful implementation of the Tobacco Track-and-Trace System in Pakistan. The net effect of the tobacco industry's presence is thus a substantial economic drain rather than a benefit.\n\nthe assertion that increased taxes have caused a 38 percent slump in sales and growth in the illicit market is highly misleading. This slump should be viewed as a positive public health outcome rather than a negative economic impact. Reducing cigarette sales directly correlates with lower smoking rates and better public health outcomes. Additionally, within the \"reduced cigarettes consumption\" narrative, the tobacco industry also failed to mention profits made through unregulated/untaxed sales of nicotine pouches, electronic tobacco and nicotine devices, chemical refills, and many other hazardous tobacco industry (related) products. There is no doubt that addressing the illicit market requires better enforcement and regulatory measures, not lowering taxes. There is no known or scientific relationship between illicit products and taxes. Countries with effective enforcement and strong regulatory frameworks have successfully minimized the illicit trade of tobacco products without compromising public health objectives.\n\nEncouraging the tobacco industry's desire to relocate outside Pakistan can open up opportunities for economic diversification inside Pakistan and attract more health-friendly investments. With less than 0.5 percent employment and less than 1 percent contribution to the local economy, tobacco production and sales are hardly doing any favour to the country. The resources currently allocated to managing the negative impacts of the tobacco industry could be redirected to support sectors with more sustainable and positive contributions to the economy, such as healthcare, education, clean energy, environment and climate change.\n\nConclusively, Pakistan needs to adopt sustainable economic policies that prioritize public health and long-term economic stability over short-term gains from tobacco taxes. This includes enhancing enforcement measures to combat the illicit tobacco trade effectively. This involves improving border controls, increasing penalties for smuggling, and investing in technology to track and trace tobacco products. Implementing comprehensive public health campaigns to reduce smoking rates. This includes education programs, smoking cessation support, and strict advertising regulations.

According to a World Bank report, every day, between 82,000 and 99,000 children and adolescents across Earth take up smoking. In India alone, more than 50,000 children take their first puff every day.\n\nOver the years, developed nations have recognised the risks of cigarettes and there has been a drastic reduction in smoking. But in developing countries, tobacco companies have been able to outwit vulnerable populations with aggressive marketing strategies. Direct, indirect, and surrogate marketing has been the norm of these companies. Glamorous projections of their products lure the young. Hence, the 2024 theme for the World No Tobacco Day is \"Protecting children from tobacco industry interference\".\n\nWHY KIDS GET ADDICTED\n\nThere is adequate scientific evidence that children exposed to smoke tend to smoke themselves in the future. Recent research shows that even one cigarette can prime a child's brain for nicotine addiction. Chewable forms of tobacco are known to deliver nicotine three to four times higher than cigarettes, making them more addictive.\n\nSeveral factors influence the initiation of children into these products. Family usage of tobacco, peer pressure, experimentation, easy access and availability, personality factors, underlying emotional and psychological problems, risk-taking behaviours, and most importantly, aggressive strategies of the tobacco industry. In the 1940s and 1950s, every movie had scenes depicting smoking, which was at the time considered a symbol of sophistication and good life. These made impressionable minds adopt such behaviour. Indirect promotions as big sponsors to mega events like sports, bravery awards, etc. have also influenced the youngsters.\n\nHOW TO HELP THEM\n\nThe difficulty in quitting tobacco stems from the fact that individuals develop physiological and behavioural dependence, which is attributed to nicotine. Scientifically, nicotine produced from these substances is considered to be more addictive than cocaine and heroin. Though physiological dependency can be taken care of through the use of nicotine replacement therapy and various drugs, behavioural therapy forms an integral part of the treatment as well. Regular counselling, rational emotive behavioural therapy, cognitive behavioural therapy, and temptation and cues management, all form part of the treatment.\n\nLOOKING INWARD\n\nFalling prey to various addictions is a perfect example of an individual's inability to hold onto one's reins. We as youths, never think twice before exercising our bodies. But often the well-being of the mind takes a back seat. The root cause of most of our sufferings is primarily because of the way we run our thoughts. Since our entire existence is experienced through the mind, we can make it our best friend or our worst enemy. But we should realise that a calm mind is not just peaceful, it is focused, self-directing, and divine. It is also the ultimate weapon against challenges and the various battles we face.\n\nToday, everything is growing rapidly, whether it's religion, science, technology, medical research, academia, space exploration, or even the material world. To keep pace with everything, stress has become a constant companion. Two Cs which have created havoc in our lives: unhealthy Competition and Comparison. But to counter these stressful situations, we should include certain spiritual techniques such as prayer, practising self-surrender to God, meditation, yoga, and physical activities.\n\nThough our modern culture looks at happiness in the outer world, it is the outer world which distracts us most from a permanent and stable sense of well-being. We spend all our lives searching for a sense of well-being in things like money, recognition, power, and physical pleasure. One realises with time that these worldly sources of happiness are only temporary. But if at an early age, we were to understand the essence of spirituality and incorporate its various teachings, we may be able to develop a healthy body and mind and also ignite our soul with strength and joy. Most of us are unaware that a spiritual background is intensely useful in preserving strength and peace of mind\n\nYoga works holistically at all levels: body, mind, emotions, intellect, and bliss. It not only strengthens the immune system but also calms the mind and helps better control the body-mind connections. Meditation, on the other hand, enhances one's sense of self-control and increases one's enjoyment of day-to-day living. Regular physical activity will not only help us feel more youthful and energetic but will also help us sharpen our mental faculties and help improve our self-image.\n\nA bird sitting on a tree is never afraid of the branch breaking, because its trust is not in the branch but in its wings. In life, we should always believe in ourselves. If life is like an ocean, all that we need to learn is how to swim in its turbulent waters, not by resorting to vices but by accepting every challenge as a fight and winning it with dignity and grace.", "source": {"uri": "indiatoday.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "India Today"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_No_Tobacco_Day", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "World No Tobacco Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulnerability", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vulnerability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tobacco industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cigarette", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cigarette"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoking", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Smoking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tobacco"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nicotine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolescence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Adolescence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Addiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Marketing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Brain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_norm", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social norm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_evidence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scientific evidence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco_smoking", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tobacco smoking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developing_country", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Developing country"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Earth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developed_country", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Developed country"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physiology", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Physiology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotine_replacement_therapy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nicotine replacement therapy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rationality", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rationality"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Health", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Health", "wgt": 43}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Specific_Substances", "label": "dmoz/Health/Specific Substances", "wgt": 42}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Specific_Substances/Tobacco", "label": "dmoz/Health/Specific Substances/Tobacco", "wgt": 44}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Women's_Health/Smoking", "label": "dmoz/Health/Women's Health/Smoking", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Tobacco/Cigarettes", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Tobacco/Cigarettes", "wgt": 37}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/202405/smoking-kills-223026469-16x9.jpg?VersionId=GFmu.AOQo0J7w96xdbCNqLX5ul6Nqhj8", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9613244", "eventUri": "eng-9613244", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 162, "relevance": 1}

(Image: Canva)\n\nWorld No Tobacco Day 2024: Worldwide, tobacco use is a significant public health concern since it can lead to a wide range of health issues that impact different bodily systems. People who smoke and use other tobacco products are exposed to a variety of dangerous substances, which can cause major health problems. Tobacco use continues to be a major contributor to avoidable illnesses and fatalities even in the face of widespread public health initiatives and rising awareness.\n\nTo encourage quitting and lower the prevalence of tobacco use, it is essential to comprehend the vast range of health hazards connected to smoking. The effects of tobacco usage are extensive and serious, ranging from cancer and cardiovascular problems to respiratory ailments.\n\nRespiratory diseases\n\nThe respiratory system is one of the most directly impacted areas of tobacco use, says Dr Pratibha Dogra, senior consultant - pulmonology and sleep medicine expert, Marengo Asia hospital, Gurugram. She says that toxic compounds are inhaled by tobacco smoke smokers, which can harm lungs both immediately and over time.\n\nChronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD): Emphysema and chronic bronchitis are among the lung disorders that are associated with COPD, which is mostly caused by tobacco use. Breathing problems, a persistent cough, and a lower quality of life are caused by COPD.\n\nLung cancer: The primary cause of lung cancer is smoking. Lung cells are harmed by the carcinogens in tobacco smoke, which can result in mutations and malignant growths. There is also a higher danger for nonsmokers who are around secondhand smoke.\n\nCardiovascular diseases\n\nThe cardiovascular system is greatly impacted by tobacco use, which also contributes to a number of heart and blood vessel problems, says Dr Dogra.\n\nAtherosclerosis: Tobacco smoke contains chemicals that harm the arteries inside lining and encourage the accumulation of plaque. Atherosclerosis is a disorder that narrows blood vessels and increases the risk of heart attacks and strokes.\n\nElevated heart rate and blood pressure: Nicotine triggers the release of adrenaline, which raises blood pressure and heart rate. This puts further stress on the heart and raises the risk of heart disease.\n\nCancer diseases\n\nAccording to Dr Dogra, in addition to lung cancer, tobacco use is connected to a number of other cancers that impact different body parts.\n\nOral cancer: Cancers of the mouth, throat, and esophagus can be brought on by smoking and chewing tobacco. Due to their late discovery, these tumors frequently have poor prognoses.\n\nBladder cancer: The kidneys filter the carcinogens from tobacco smoke, which are then retained in the bladder and raise the risk of bladder cancer.\n\nOther health risks\n\nTobacco use has harmful repercussions that extend beyond problems with the heart, lungs, and cancer. It has numerous additional effects on general health as well.\n\nReproductive health: Smoking can impact a person's ability to conceive, which can result in pregnancy difficulties and a higher chance of birth abnormalities in both men and women.\n\nSuppression of the immune system: Smoking impairs immunity, leaving the body more vulnerable to illnesses and infections.\n\nBone health: Osteoporosis, a disorder that weakens bones and raises the risk of fractures, is associated with smoking.", "source": {"uri": "moneycontrol.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MoneyControl"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco_smoke", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tobacco smoke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco_smoking", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tobacco smoking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_obstructive_pulmonary_disease", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tobacco"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Public health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_disease", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Respiratory disease"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiovascular_disease", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cardiovascular disease"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Artery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prevalence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung_cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lung cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lung"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortness_of_breath", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shortness of breath"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passive_smoking", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Passive smoking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronchitis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bronchitis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonology", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pulmonology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atherosclerosis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Atherosclerosis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinogen", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Carcinogen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_vessel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Blood vessel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Toxicity"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Health", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Health", "wgt": 54}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Specific_Substances", "label": "dmoz/Health/Specific Substances", "wgt": 66}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Specific_Substances/Tobacco", "label": "dmoz/Health/Specific Substances/Tobacco", "wgt": 67}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Women's_Health/Smoking", "label": "dmoz/Health/Women's Health/Smoking", "wgt": 54}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Tobacco/Cigarettes", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Tobacco/Cigarettes", "wgt": 52}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://images.moneycontrol.com/static-mcnews/2024/05/20240531063202_World-No-Tobacco-Day.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9613244", "eventUri": "eng-9613244", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3333333333333334, "wgt": 161, "relevance": 1}

(Image Credits:\n\nHealth Effects of Smoking: Using any kind of tobacco product is unsafe, especially for kids, teens, and young adults. But worldwide, at least 14 million young people aged 13 to 15 currently use tobacco products, according to CDC's 2006-2017 Global Youth Tobacco Survey. Tobacco companies, meanwhile, spend billions of dollars every year on marketing tobacco products, including cigarettes, cigars, and e-cigarettes.\n\nSince 1988, the World Health Organization (WHO) has used World No Tobacco Day to highlight the harmful effects of cigarettes and other tobacco products on a person's overall health. This year, WHO is focusing on preventing youth tobacco product use and the tobacco industry's attempts to attract youth.\n\nThis World No Tobacco Day, learn what individuals and communities can do to help keep young people tobacco-free, or help them quit for good?\n\nAccording to Dr. Aditya Sarin, Consultant, Medical Oncology, Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, about 40 percent of middle and high school students reported ever using any kind of tobacco product -- including e-cigarettes -- and 23 percent said they had used a tobacco product in the past 30 days.\n\nStudies show that most adults who regularly use tobacco products started before the age of 18. Using any tobacco product, including e-cigarettes, is unsafe.\n\n\"Tobacco products -- including cigarettes, smokeless tobacco, and most e-cigarettes -- contain nicotine, which is an addictive drug. Being exposed to nicotine can also harm brain development. Exposure to nicotine can harm the parts of the brain that control attention, learning, mood, and impulse control,\" Dr. Sarin told Financial Express.com.\n\nSecondhand smoke: A danger at home and abroad\n\nTobacco flavors\n\nThe flavors in tobacco products, including e-cigarettes, make these products appealing to kids and teens. Since 2009, tobacco companies have not been allowed to sell cigarettes in flavors other than menthol. Still, youth are more likely than adults to smoke menthol cigarettes.\n\nFlavoring is also a major driver of e-cigarette use among young people. More than 2 out of 3 youth who currently use e-cigarettes use flavored e-cigarettes, and flavors are a major reason they report starting to use e-cigarettes.\n\nThe danger of e-cigarettes for youth\n\nSince 2014, most U.S. youth who said they had ever used tobacco products reported using e-cigarettes. This percentage has grown over time. E-cigarettes typically contain nicotine. Newer e-cigarettes use a new form of nicotine called nicotine salts, which make it easier to inhale higher levels of nicotine.\n\nBecause of the recent rise in e-cigarette use by middle and high school students, CDC offers resources for parents, teachers, and health care providers to help them talk to kids about e-cigarettes.\n\nWhat you can do\n\nParents and other caregivers can:\n\nSmoking and Death\n\nCigarette smoking is the leading cause of preventable deaths.\n\nCigarette smoking causes more than 480,000 deaths each year in the United States.

Local artist Monika Singer performed entertainment karaoke, adding to the celebratory atmosphere.\n\nIn his address, Chief Guest Armand Ch. Momin emphasized the importance of preventing tobacco usage starting from home. \"If we want to prevent tobacco usage, we can. Children spend maximum time at home, so if they see their parents using tobacco, they will be influenced by their bad habits. If we can reduce the use of tobacco, even our society and community will progress,\" he stated.

He recently switched to growing other crops, such as soya beans, groundnuts and maize. His motivation to change was mostly economic, he says.\n\n\"With tobacco, I was losing,\" says Banda. \"It requires a lot of inputs like fertilizer, which is very expensive now and tobacco is too labour intensive.\"\n\n\"Now I use the soya beans and groundnut residues to develop composite manure. I apply the manure in my maize field and for this reason, I use less fertilizer and keep expenditure down. The crops that I grow now are easy to manage and sell as there are locally available markets everywhere. For maize I sell some and keep the rest as food for my family. We are a happy and self-reliant family,\" he says.\n\nIn late 2023, Malawi took a significant step forward in its tobacco control measures by ratifying World Health Organization (WHO)'s Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC), a crucial international treaty designed to address the severe public health risks associated with tobacco consumption and exposure to tobacco smoke.\n\nA key aspect of implementation of the FCTC is to work with tobacco farmers on crop replacement and diversification which also has long-term economic, agricultural and health benefits. In Malawi, implementation is in its infancy and so farmers like Banda, and Bazilio Luuwanga, another farmer from Kasungu District, are demonstrating the power of these benefits.\n\nLuuwanga explains that the difficulties with tobacco farming extend far beyond the field. Tobacco farmers must arrange transport for themselves and their baled crops to the tobacco auction floors where they are sold. The floors are located very far from home. When the tobacco is sold, farmers must then travel far to banks in district headquarters or cities to access their payments.\n\n\"When I was growing tobacco and I used to travel to the tobacco auction floors, sometimes the other farmers and I had no money to buy food,\" he says. \"We could spend nights in unsafe accommodation, putting our lives at risk. In all this I used to think about my wife and children at home only to come back with less returns due to controlled prices and so many unexplained deductions.\"\n\nNow that Luuwanga farms food crops such as maize, he has more control. \"The big difference now is that I am in direct contact with buyers, some even come here right to my farm. This way, I am now able to negotiate the selling price with the buyer right here at home,\" he says.\n\nWHO estimates that tobacco farmers may absorb nicotine equivalent to smoking 50 cigarettes a day and Luuwanga bears testament to this reality. \"During harvesting, leaf type quality grading and when packing into bales, I used to suffer a lot of chest pains and persistent coughing'\" he says. \"This was very bad as I had to seek medical attention all the time.\"", "source": {"uri": "afro.who.int", "dataType": "news", "title": "WHO | Regional Office for Africa"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peanut", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Peanut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soybean", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Soybean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tobacco"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maize", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Maize"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malawi", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Malawi"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Malawi"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kasungu_District", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kasungu District"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kasungu District"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Malawi"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco_control", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tobacco control"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manure", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Manure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fertilizer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fertilizer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agriculture", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Agriculture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lilongwe", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lilongwe"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Lilongwe"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Malawi"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco_smoke", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tobacco smoke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Treaty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World Health Organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Public health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crop", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Crop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cigarette", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cigarette"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoking", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Smoking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nicotine"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Health", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Health", "wgt": 49}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Specific_Substances", "label": "dmoz/Health/Specific Substances", "wgt": 44}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Specific_Substances/Tobacco", "label": "dmoz/Health/Specific Substances/Tobacco", "wgt": 47}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Women's_Health/Smoking", "label": "dmoz/Health/Women's Health/Smoking", "wgt": 30}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Tobacco/Cigarettes", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Tobacco/Cigarettes", "wgt": 45}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 71}], "image": "https://www.afro.who.int/sites/default/files/styles/teaser_thumbnail_600x600_/public/2024-05/Luuwanga.JPG?itok=-tzLN5GE", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9613244", "eventUri": "eng-9613244", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 159, "relevance": 1}

Dr Paparao Nadakuduru, Internal & General Medicine Physician, Citizens Specialty Hospital, Hyderabad aims to debunk common myths and present the reality of smokeless tobacco use.\n\nOne of the most prevalent myths is that smokeless tobacco is harmless. The reality, however, is far from this assumption. Smokeless tobacco contains numerous harmful chemicals, including nicotine, nitrosamines, and heavy metals. Nitrosamines, in particular, are potent carcinogens linked to various cancers, including oral, esophageal, and pancreatic cancer.\n\nAccording to the American Cancer Society, users of smokeless tobacco have an increased risk of developing oral cancers. The constant exposure of the mouth tissues to the harmful chemicals in tobacco can lead to precancerous lesions known as leukoplakia, which can progress to cancer if not addressed.\n\nAnother common myth is that smokeless tobacco is a safe and effective method for quitting smoking. While it might seem like a step down from the harmful effects of smoking, switching to smokeless tobacco does not address nicotine addiction. Nicotine is highly addictive, and its presence in smokeless tobacco can perpetuate dependence rather than help overcome it.\n\nMoreover, studies have shown that using smokeless tobacco as a cessation tool is not effective. In many cases, individuals who switch to smokeless tobacco end up using both products, a practice known as dual use, which exposes them to the combined risks of both smoking and smokeless tobacco.\n\nSome believe that smokeless tobacco is less addictive than smoking cigarettes. This misconception likely arises from the absence of smoke and the perceived lower intake of nicotine. However, smokeless tobacco products can deliver higher doses of nicotine compared to cigarettes, making them equally, if not more, addictive.\n\nThe method of consumption allows nicotine to be absorbed directly through the mucous membranes in the mouth, leading to rapid and significant absorption into the bloodstream. This can result in strong nicotine dependence, making it challenging for users to quit.\n\nThe belief that smokeless tobacco does not cause significant health problems is misleading. In reality, its use is associated with several serious health issues beyond cancer. These include cardiovascular diseases, gum disease, tooth decay, and complications during pregnancy.\n\nThe cardiovascular risks stem from nicotine's effects on the heart and blood vessels, potentially leading to hypertension and increased risk of heart attacks. Oral health problems are also prevalent among smokeless tobacco users, with gum recession, tooth loss, and bad breath being common consequences.\n\nThere is a growing market for \"natural\" or \"herbal\" smokeless tobacco products, often marketed as safer alternatives. However, these products can still contain harmful substances and pose health risks. The lack of regulation and standardization means users cannot be sure of the contents and their potential effects.\n\nSmokeless tobacco is far from a safe alternative to smoking. It exposes users to various harmful chemicals and significant health risks. The perception of it being a harmless habit is dangerous and misleading, and it's crucial to understand the reality behind its use.\n\nFor those looking to quit smoking, there are safer and more effective cessation methods available, such as nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), prescription medications, and counseling. These options address nicotine addiction without the added risks associated with smokeless tobacco.\n\nUnderstanding the myths versus the reality of smokeless tobacco is essential for making informed decisions about its use. While it may eliminate the dangers of smoke inhalation, it introduces its own set of risks that can lead to serious health problems. Public awareness and education are critical in dispelling these myths and promoting healthier alternatives for those seeking to overcome nicotine addiction. Smokeless tobacco is not a heaven; it is a hazardous habit with significant health consequences.", "source": {"uri": "zeenews.india.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Zee News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smokeless_tobacco", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Smokeless tobacco"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoking", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Smoking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nicotine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrosamine", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Nitrosamine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chemical substance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snuff_(tobacco)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Snuff (tobacco)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavy_metals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Heavy metals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chewing_tobacco", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chewing tobacco"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Snus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inhalation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inhalation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oral cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinogen", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Carcinogen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Cancer_Society", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American Cancer Society"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mouth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cigarette", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cigarette"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esophagus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Esophagus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreatic_cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pancreatic cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tissue (biology)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Physician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Health", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Health", "wgt": 43}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Specific_Substances", "label": "dmoz/Health/Specific Substances", "wgt": 51}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Specific_Substances/Tobacco", "label": "dmoz/Health/Specific Substances/Tobacco", "wgt": 53}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Women's_Health/Smoking", "label": "dmoz/Health/Women's Health/Smoking", "wgt": 34}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Tobacco/Cigarettes", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Tobacco/Cigarettes", "wgt": 40}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://english.cdn.zeenews.com/sites/default/files/2024/05/31/1411202-smoking-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9613244", "eventUri": "eng-9613244", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.01960784313725494, "wgt": 157, "relevance": 1}

However, none of the actions foreseen in its implementation roadmap have been concluded.\n\nAt the heart of the matter are delays in updating existing legislation on tobacco products, including stricter controls on purchasing, taxation, and advertising, and in issuing a Council recommendation on smoke-free environments, planned for the third quarter of 2023.\n\nTobacco control is now back in the spotlight with the EU election campaign, emerging as a priority in the programmes of The Party of European Socialists, of the European Greens and the European Left.\n\nSFP's Director Lilia Olefir told Euractiv \"the scale of industry interference at the EU level points out that the delays of all EU files is not a coincidence\".\n\nContacted by Euractiv, a source from S&D said that delays are quite clearly due to pressure from the tobacco lobby on the Commission to delay the roll-out of updated legislation that would hamper tobacco sales.\n\nThe tobacco industry comprehensively spent \u20ac19 million in 2022 on lobbying activities with the Commission, according to the SFP's analysis of the EU transparency register.\n\nThe European Ombudsman has concluded on lack of transparency from the Commission regarding meetings it had with tobacco lobbyists in 2020 and 2021.\n\nIn a letter sent to the Commission, EU Ombudsman Emily O'Reilly noted \"These meetings not only took place with senior staff within the Commission (Commissioners, Heads of Cabinets, and Directors-General) but also with staff at lower levels\".\n\nAsked to comment by Euractiv, a Commission spokesperson stated that \"When it comes to contacts with the tobacco industry, the Commission has been uncompromising in delivering the highest standards of transparency (...) DG SANTE publishes online details of all meetings with the tobacco industry\".\n\nIn the past five years, the tobacco industry has held more than 100 meetings with nembers of the European Parliament, according to the EU transparency register.\n\nEuropean Conservatives and Reformists (ECR) and Identity and Democracy (ID) were the groups who held the most meetings with a total of 35.\n\nMeetings were also held during Parliament's work on the report of the Special Committee on Beating Cancer (BECA), and the report on non-communicable diseases (NCD).\n\nSeveral amendments were tabled in BECA to distinguish electronic from traditional cigarettes.\n\nConsumption of tobacco amongst EU's youth is on the rise, according to a new World Health Organisation (WHO) survey. 20% of school-aged children smoke e-cigarettes and 15% smoke traditional cigarettes.\n\nWith the increase in the sales of products such as e-cigarettes and nicotine pouches, the Commission has prohibited the use of flavoured heated tobacco products, but it is facing increasing political pressure for more comprehensive legislation on novel tobacco products.\n\nGreens/EFA have requested no tax exemptions for e-cigarettes, whereas the EPP and ECR advocate for a \"moderate approach to harm reduction\".", "source": {"uri": "euractiv.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "EurActiv.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Of the 4.77 lakh calls received, 1,44,938 individuals have successfully quit. The rising awareness and determination among young adults, combined with comprehensive counselling and pharmacotherapy, are key factors driving this success.\n\nOf the 4.77 lakh calls received on the Centre's national tobacco cessation quitline that is operated by the Vallabhbhai Patel Chest Institute (VPCI) here, 1,44,938 callers have quit tobacco in any form, officials said on Friday.\n\nSince the launch of the national quitline service in 2016, the total number of calls to hit the IVR is 82 lakh.\n\nThe findings of a survey conducted in this regard were released by the VPCI on World No Tobacco Day (May 31) on Sunday.\n\nDr Raj Kumar, director, VPCI, said 46.96 per cent of the calls were from young adults aged between 18 and 24 years, making them the largest group of quitters.\n\n''This data highlights the growing awareness and determination among India's youth to combat tobacco addiction,'' Kumar said.\n\nSince its inception, the Tobacco Cessation Centre (TCC) at the VPCI has been at the forefront of tobacco control, providing critical support to individuals battling tobacco addiction, he said.\n\n''Our comprehensive approach, combining counselling and pharmacotherapy, has significantly improved the quit rates and public health outcomes,'' Kumar added.\n\nMore than 43 per cent of the callers were self-employed, 75.85 per cent had no family history of tobacco use and 68.63 per cent used smokeless tobacco, he said.\n\nUttar Pradesh tops the chart with 1,50,925 (31.6 per cent) calls and 29.68 per cent quitters. Additionally, 72.96 per cent of the calls were from individuals with one to 10 years of tobacco use and 77.74 per cent had no history of alcohol use, Kumar said.\n\nIndia's first TCC was established at the VPCI, New Delhi in November 2001.\n\nIn 2016, the National Tobacco Quitline Service (NTQL), a prestigious project of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, was launched. Operating from 8 am to 8 pm, the toll-free service (1800-11-2356) provides counselling in 15 languages.\n\nTrained professionals guide the callers through the quitting process, providing information, addressing concerns and preparing personalised quit plans.\n\nThis comprehensive approach is key to success. Now, satellite centres are also functioning at the Tata Memorial Hospital in Mumbai, the NIMHANS in Bengaluru and the Dr Bhubaneswar Borooah Cancer Institute in Guwahati.\n\n''The NTQLS provides free, confidential counselling and guidance to tobacco users across the country, empowering them to take charge of their health. Quitting tobacco is not just about willpower. We address the psychological and behavioural factors that contribute to addiction, offering strategies to manage cravings and overcome withdrawal symptoms,'' Kumar said.\n\nOver the last 23 years, the TCC at the VPCI has organised 376 public awareness programmes, anti-tobacco campaigns and seminars, reaching more than 13 lakh people.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is

Despite concerted efforts to curb tobacco consumption, recent data unveils a disheartening reality, particularly among the nation's youth.\n\nTobacco addiction, fuelled by harmful nicotine, a highly addictive compound inherent in tobacco plants, ensnares vulnerable groups in a web of physical, social, and mental dependencies from an early age if exposed. This addiction isn't just a personal struggle; it takes a heavy toll on society, contributing significantly to preventable deaths and economic burdens.\n\nAccording to the Lung Association, tobacco remains the leading cause of preventable deaths globally, claiming one in ten lives. In India alone, approximately 267 million people are tobacco users, with a staggering 28.6% of the population aged 15 and above consuming tobacco products. Among this demographic, 8.5% are teenagers aged 13 to 15, revealing a troubling trend that demands urgent attention.\n\nDr. Arup Haldar, Consultant Pulmonologist, CMRI Hospital, a prominent voice in public health, elucidates the intricate nature of nicotine addiction, highlighting its ability to manipulate brain chemistry and induce pleasurable sensations. \" Tobacco consumption can almost feel like a crutch, a steady friend relied upon during challenging times. Harmful nicotine consumption with tobacco itself releases dopamine towards reward centres of the brain, elevating mood and providing a sense of comfort\", he said.\n\nMoreover, it's important to discuss the importance of addressing all facets of the addiction cycle -- physical, social, and psychological to achieve successful cessation. Proven methods to quit smoking involve identifying triggers and relearning behaviours through a holistic plan. We must provide comprehensive support systems to aid people, especially kids who are at a formative time of their growth in their journey towards a tobacco-free life. In the realm of cessation strategies, Nicotine Replacement Therapy (NRT) emerges as a promising therapy as it helps ease withdrawal symptoms by delivering nicotine to the body without the harmful toxins found in cigarettes. This powerful therapy can reduce cravings and manage withdrawal symptoms, but it's crucial to consult with a healthcare provider for personalised guidance.\n\nHowever, the pervasive influence of social and behavioural factors complicates efforts to combat teenage smoking. Peer dynamics, lack of awareness, and societal norms perpetuate the cycle of tobacco use among youth, exacerbating the public health challenge.\n\nDr. Arup Haldar, further sheds light on the insidious role of e-cigarettes and vaping in this landscape. \"E-cigarettes and vaping, once hailed as cessation aids, are now embraced as trendy accessories among teenagers. Despite governmental bans, these products continue to proliferate, easily accessible online and offline.\"He questions the efficacy of bans, noting their limited impact in curbing vaping's allure among teenagers. \"Is banning the solution? Or is it even effective? Bans have done little to curb the impact of vaping, as these devices remain readily available, fuelling the emergence of a new generation of consumers.\"\n\nMrs. Malavika Kaura Saxena, Chief Marketing Officer, of Rusan Pharma, asserts, \"In light of the persistent challenges posed by teenage tobacco consumption, we must adopt a multifaceted approach to address this pressing public health concern.\"She emphasises the need for stringent regulations to safeguard vulnerable groups and promote tobacco cessation effectively. Additionally, Malavika advocates for the expansion of de-addiction clinics nationwide, stating, \"These clinics serve as lifelines for tobacco-dependant people seeking assistance in their journey towards tobacco-free living, offering tailored interventions and support systems.\"Recognising the pervasive impact of passive smoking on family members and friends, she underscores the importance of proactive measures and public education initiatives to mitigate exposure to second-hand smoke, fostering healthier environments for all. Malavika also highlights the significance of Nicotine Replacement Therapies, such as nicotine replacement patches, as safer alternatives to quitting tobacco consumption ultimately.\n\nThe economic ramifications of tobacco consumption are staggering, with India bearing a substantial burden of tobacco-attributable diseases and deaths. From 2017 to 2018, the economic cost amounted to a staggering INR 1773.4 billion, representing 1.04% of the nation's GDP. Direct health care costs accounted for 22% of this total, while indirect costs, including lost productivity, constituted a staggering 78%.\n\nAs we reflect on World No Tobacco Day, it's imperative to renew our commitment to combating teenage smoking in India. Through robust policy interventions, public awareness campaigns, and comprehensive cessation support, we can empower our youth to break free from the shackles of tobacco addiction, paving the way for a healthier, tobacco-free future.", "source": {"uri": "zeenews.india.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Zee News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_cigarette", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Electronic cigarette"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tobacco"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Addiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nicotine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Public health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotiana", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nicotiana"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_No_Tobacco_Day", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World No Tobacco Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurochemistry", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Neurochemistry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonology", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pulmonology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_withdrawal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Drug withdrawal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoking", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Smoking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotine_replacement_therapy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nicotine replacement therapy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_professional", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Health professional"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dopamine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dopamine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoking_cessation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Smoking cessation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Holism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxin", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Toxin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco_smoking", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tobacco smoking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cigarette", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cigarette"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Psychology"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Health", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Health", "wgt": 54}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Specific_Substances", "label": "dmoz/Health/Specific Substances", "wgt": 52}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Specific_Substances/Tobacco", "label": "dmoz/Health/Specific Substances/Tobacco", "wgt": 55}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Women's_Health/Smoking", "label": "dmoz/Health/Women's Health/Smoking", "wgt": 36}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Tobacco/Cigarettes", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Tobacco/Cigarettes", "wgt": 48}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://english.cdn.zeenews.com/sites/default/files/2024/05/31/1411002-smoke.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9613244", "eventUri": "eng-9613244", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-31", "textStart": 57, "textEnd": 65}], "sentiment": 0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 151, "relevance": 1}

And, as noted by the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, the tobacco industry has historically promoted the use of menthol cigarettes among African Americans.\n\nThe CDC reports that nearly 9 out of 10 adults who smoke cigarettes daily usually begin this habit by age 18, and that flavorings like menthol make these products more appealing to youth.\n\nThe Baltimore County Department of Health offers resources to help deter tobacco use before it starts and to help smokers quit. Programs include Control, a virtual five-week quit smoking program; ASPIRE, a smoking prevention interactive experience; smoking cessation, nicotine replacement therapy and more.\n\nAll of these programs and resources are free.\n\nLet World Tobacco Day be the day you break the habit!

In his address on World No Tobacco Day in Delhi, the WHO representative said on Friday, \"The tobacco industry has blood on its hands. It designs and sells products that kill half of its users prematurely. And that's why they have to keep recruiting new users. And that, sadly, is the youth. You have to start them young so that they can earn more because eventually, they'll stop if they get sick.\"\n\nFurther, he mentions a report released by WHO and states that according to the report, 'Hooking the Next Generation' the tobacco and nicotine industry designs products that look like gadgets or toys and implements marketing campaigns. \"A new report by WHO and partners called 'Hooking the Next Generation', I would like to do a bit of, highlights how the tobacco and nicotine industry designs products, you've seen, it looks like gadgets or toys implements marketing campaigns, they use Netflix, Amazon, everywhere, and works to shape policy environments that addict the world's youth sponsoring sports events,\" Roderico H Ofrin said.\n\n\"The latest Global Youth Tabaco survey 2019 from India has started and is very worrying and timely. Tobaco prevalence is 8.4 per cent among 13 to 15 years old school children,\" he added. WHO representative also reports that 11.4 per cent of children start smoking cigarettes before they turn 7, and 24 per cent use smokeless tobacco products like hookah, and Zabut. This shows that the tobacco industry's strategy of targeting young children is effective.\n\nWHO representative underscored that the tobacco industry uses knowledge about addiction, social marketing, and advertising very effectively. \"The science that we know about addictiveness, social marketing, ads, is being used by the tobacco industry so efficiently. The World No Tobacco Day 2024 theme of protecting children from tobacco industry interference is not just a call to action, but a critical imperative for protecting future generations,\" said Roderico H Ofrin.\n\n\"We must join hands to shield young people from manipulative practices by sensitizing the public about the tobacco industry's tactics to create new markets, and protect tobacco control policies from industry influence,\" he added. Roderico H Ofrin mentions that, like India, new measures are needed to counter the tobacco industry's tactics.\n\n\"So like India is doing, it's updating its app. Before it was just TV and films. A new amendment was put in for up over the top like Netflix, Amazon, et cetera. Because the industry will find a way to escape. Exposing industry tactics through innovative approaches,\" said Roderico H Ofrin. \"India is a global leader in regulating tobacco depiction ODP platforms and enacting the prohibition of electronic cigarettes. The act was which adopted in 2019. These indeed are phenomenal achievements, and we should hold on to that. However, we must not forget the industry is always on the prowl and trying to find a way,\" he added,\n\nHe ended his address by stating, \"We must act together now to expose the deception and protect the youth, and spread the message that is smart, don't stop.\" (ANI)\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tobacco industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "World Health Organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_No_Tobacco_Day", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "World No Tobacco Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tobacco"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotine", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Nicotine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Marketing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Who", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Who"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smokeless_tobacco", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Smokeless tobacco"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Amazon (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hookah", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hookah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_marketing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social marketing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prevalence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cigarette", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cigarette"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoking", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Smoking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Addiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prohibition_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prohibition in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco_control", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tobacco control"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deception", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Deception"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_cigarette", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Electronic cigarette"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadcast_syndication", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Broadcast syndication"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mobile app"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Health", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Health", "wgt": 58}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Specific_Substances", "label": "dmoz/Health/Specific Substances", "wgt": 48}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Specific_Substances/Tobacco", "label": "dmoz/Health/Specific Substances/Tobacco", "wgt": 50}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Tobacco/Magazines_and_E-zines", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Tobacco/Magazines and E-zines", "wgt": 33}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Tobacco/Cigarettes", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Tobacco/Cigarettes", "wgt": 46}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/devnews/31_05_2024_23_38_07_9788055.jpg?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9613244", "eventUri": "eng-9613244", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1058823529411764, "wgt": 150, "relevance": 1}

It affects almost every organ system, said doctors on World No Tobacco Day on Friday, calling for the need to quit smoke.\n\nAs smoking is majorly linked to lung cancer and cardiovascular diseases, the full spectrum of tobacco damage is often underestimated. Tobacco smoke contains over 7,000 chemicals, many of which are toxic, and at least 70 are known to cause cancer.\n\nIt can cause chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), emphysema, and chronic bronchitis. It also leads to peptic ulcers, harms the reproductive system, and weakens the immune system, making the body more susceptible to infections, said the experts.\n\n\"The tar in tobacco smoke damages the cilia -- small hair-like structures in the lungs that help clear out mucus and dirt -, leading to chronic bronchitis and an increased risk of fatal infections,\" Dr. Arindam Datta, Associate Consultant, Respiratory Medicine and Pulmonary Interventions, Narayana Hospital, Howrah, told IANS.\n\nThe doctor informed that long-term smokers, industrial workers, people with a history of asthma, and those exposed to secondhand smoke, dust, and pollutants both indoors and outdoors are at the highest risk.\n\nTobacco's impact on cardiovascular health is profound. It increases heart rate, tightens major arteries, and can create an irregular heart rhythm. Chemicals in tobacco also damage the lining of the arteries, narrowing and hardening them with the buildup of plaque, resulting in heart attacks and strokes.\n\n\"Tobacco smoke contains carbon monoxide and nicotine, which increase the heart's workload and decrease its efficiency. Carbon monoxide binds with haemoglobin in red blood cells, reducing their oxygen-carrying capacity. Nicotine increases blood pressure and heart rate, which can lead to hypertension. This combination of effects significantly raises the risk of coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, and stroke,\" Dr. Samir Kubba, Director - Cardiology, Dharamshila Narayana Hospital, told IANS.\n\n\"Individuals with a family history of heart disease, those who have hypertension or diabetes, and smokers of all ages are at increased risk,\" he added.\n\nFurther, tobacco use is also the leading cause of preventable cancer. Carcinogens in tobacco such as nitrosamines and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, damage DNA and hinder the body's ability to repair damaged cells, leading to mutations that can cause cancer, said medical oncologist Dr. Samit Purohit - Senior Consultant from Action Cancer Hospital told IANS.\n\n\"Tobacco use is responsible for nearly 90 per cent of all lung cancer cases, but its impact is not limited to the lungs. It is a major risk factor for cancers of the mouth, throat, oesophagus, bladder, pancreas, kidney, and cervix,\" he added.\n\nSecondhand smoke also causes great harm. Non-smokers who live with smokers have about a 20-30 per cent greater risk of developing lung cancer. This exposure can also increase the risk of cancers of the larynx and pharynx.\n\nImportantly, the health experts noted that smokeless tobacco products are equally dangerous. They can lead to oral, oesophageal, and pancreatic cancers, and precancerous lesions in the mouth that can transform into malignant tumours.\n\nThey called on health authorities \"to focus on prevention, early cessation support, and make stringent policies on tobacco advertising.\"", "source": {"uri": "mangalorean.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mangalorean.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco_smoke", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tobacco smoke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_No_Tobacco_Day", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "World No Tobacco Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tobacco"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronchitis", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bronchitis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_obstructive_pulmonary_disease", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoking", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Smoking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chemical substance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiovascular_disease", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cardiovascular disease"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Infection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Organ system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptic_ulcer_disease", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Peptic ulcer disease"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mucus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cilium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cilium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproductive_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Reproductive system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung_cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lung cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Toxicity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_monoxide", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Carbon monoxide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Immune system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_body", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Human body"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Health", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Health", "wgt": 49}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Specific_Substances", "label": "dmoz/Health/Specific Substances", "wgt": 59}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Specific_Substances/Tobacco", "label": "dmoz/Health/Specific Substances/Tobacco", "wgt": 60}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Women's_Health/Smoking", "label": "dmoz/Health/Women's Health/Smoking", "wgt": 45}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Tobacco/Cigarettes", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Tobacco/Cigarettes", "wgt": 46}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.mangalorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Tobacco-Day.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9613244", "eventUri": "eng-9613244", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3803921568627451, "wgt": 146, "relevance": 1}

They emphasised the urgent need to implement evidence-based, progressive policies that align with users' psychometric journeys to reduce the severe health and economic impacts of tobacco use.\n\nThe GSA leadership council emphasised the need for progressive harm reduction strategies that could potentially save 1.35 million lives annually. Tobacco-related diseases impact 267 million lives in India and cost the country almost 1 per cent of its GDP due to disease and premature deaths, according to a 2019 WHO report. Tobacco-related healthcare expenses amount to Rs. 13,500 crores annually.\n\nDr Bharat, Director and Head, Dept. of Pulmonology, Critical Care & Sleep Medicine, Delhi Heart and Lung Institute (DHLI), said, \"According to the report titled 'Human Centric Approach to Tobacco Control', 27 per cent of Indians use tobacco in some form, eventually resulting in a heavy disease burden, which is heart-wrenching to witness, the daily impact it has on families nationwide. It is a known fact by now that tobacco smoke contains over 70 known carcinogens. Many countries like the UK, Sweden & Japan have successfully reduced tobacco consumption, owing to evidence-based policies that their respective governments have adopted.\"\n\nProfessor Dr R Zimlichman, Director of the Brunner Institute for Cardiovascular Research at Tel Aviv University's Sackler Faculty of Medicine, commented on the global success of progressive tobacco policies, saying, \"Sweden is a great case study for policymakers, to see how harm reduction, a scientifically proven strategic policy approach, offers a pragmatic and potentially life-saving alternative. Embracing these strategies has led to a remarkable decline in mortality rates in Sweden, with almost a 41 per cent lower incidence of cancer in the country, as compared with the EU.

paper presentation at the 259th Inaugural Lecture of the university entitled: \"White Matter Matters in the Search for Phytochemical Candidates for Demyenilating Disorders'.\"\n\nThe don, who teaches in the Faculty of Basic Medical Sciences, College of Health Science of the university, quoted the World Health Organisation (WHO) as stating that the latest global estimate of tobacco users stood at 1.25 billion people.\n\nHe added that \"tobacco causes more than eight million deaths yearly, out of which, 1.3 million are non-smokers exposed to second-hand smoke.\n\n\"This makes it a leading cause of preventable death and disease worldwide.\"\n\nOmotoso lamented that in spite of a great deal of health education on the grave implications of cigarette smoking, many people are still caught in the web of the habit, while tobacco companies continue to make fortune on the business.\n\nHe, therefore, stressed the need to specially protect children from tobacco, highlighting\n\nthe consequences of cigarette smoke on different organs of the body.\n\n\"This includes its adverse effects on male gonads and reproductive fertility, degenerative change in the liver, disruption of the canalicular network and lipid metabolism and other hepatocellular injuries,\" he said.\n\nHe urged Federal Government to enforce Tobacco Production Laws to protect youths from industry manipulation and prevent them from tobacco and nicotine use.\n\nThe News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that May 31 is annually celebrated as World No Tobacco Day, a global campaign aimed at raising awareness on the harmful effects of tobacco.\n\nThe theme of the 2024 edition is \"Protecting Children from Tobacco Industry Interference.\"(NAN)", "source": {"uri": "nationalaccordnewspaper.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

It is observed on May 31st every year. The theme for World No Tobacco Day 2024 is 'Protecting Children From Tobacco Industry Interference.' This year's theme aims to protect young people and urges the tobacco industry to stop targeting the young population with products that are harmful to their health. The World Health Organisation created World No Tobacco Day in 1987 to prevent tobacco-related deaths and diseases.\n\nAccording to the World Health Organisation, tobacco kills more than 8 million people each year, including an estimated 1.3 million non-smokers who are exposed to second-hand smoke. From lung cancer to reproductive issues, tobacco use can trigger the risk of developing several chronic and serious health conditions. On World No Tobacco Day 2024, let's understand the harmful effects of tobacco use on your cardiovascular health.\n\nHere's how tobacco affects your heart health\n\nTobacco use is also one of the risk factors for heart disease. Smoking can reduce blood and oxygen flow to the heart by narrowing arteries.\n\n\"The toxic compounds found in tobacco smoke make smoking extremely dangerous for your cardiovascular system. Nicotine and carbon monoxide are two of these compounds that have a major effect on the heart and circulation,\" says Dr Pratibha Dogra, Senior Consultant - Pulmonology and Sleep Medicine Expert at Marengo Asia Hospital, Gurugram.\n\n\"Smoking causes atherosclerosis, raises blood pressure, and increases the risk of serious cardiovascular diseases such as peripheral artery disease and heart attacks. These effects are felt in the heart and blood vessels. Cutting back on tobacco use is essential for preserving cardiovascular health and averting these serious illnesses,\" she adds.\n\nSmoking is also a cause of peripheral arterial disease (PAD), in addition to diabetes, lack of physical activity, hypertension, poor cholesterol levels and more.\n\n\"Smoking has been connected to peripheral arterial disease (PAD), a condition in which plaque accumulates in the limb arteries. This causes pain, numbness, and an increased risk of infections and ulcers by decreasing blood supply to the extremities,\" Dr. Dogra explains.\n\nPromotedListen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.com\n\n(Dr Pratibha Dogra, Senior Consultant - Pulmonology snd sleep medicine expert, Marengo Asia Hospital, Gurugram)\n\nDisclaimer: This content including advice provides generic information only.

The Demon Deacons play VCU on Friday in Greenville.\n\nTOM FOREMAN JR.\n\nIn the 1960s, you could usually set your calendar by the parade of pickup trucks rolling into Greenville, their cargo beds loaded with so much flue-cured tobacco that the rear ends virtually touched the asphalt. The farmers who grew it were bound for one of the massive tobacco warehouses to sell their crop at auction.\n\nSome of that tobacco would wind up, among other locations, in Winston-Salem, home to cigarette manufacturer R.J. Reynolds. The small, eastern North Carolina town was linked to the bigger Piedmont Triad community through the cash crop that was a key element of the North Carolina economy for decades.\n\nBut times change, and each location has transformed its respective profiles.\n\nAs those tobacco warehouses sit idle, Greenville, where an old AM radio WGTC stood for \"World's Greatest Tobacco Center,\" now has East Carolina University as its centerpiece, and health care as its primary economic engine. Winston-Salem, where once upon a time passengers on city transit buses could light up as show of support for the industry, has seen most of its old downtown tobacco manufacturing plants converted to research and living space.\n\nIn a sense, the two worlds will come together when the Wake Forest baseball team plays at ECU's Clark-LeClair Stadium in Greenville in a regional of the NCAA Division I Baseball Championship beginning this weekend.\n\n\"Greenville has transitioned from a town that went through a sustained economic boom as a result of tobacco marketing, tobacco sales and so on,\" said John Allen Tucker, a professor of history and the ECU historian.\n\n\"Tobacco has not disappeared, as best as I can tell, from the region,\" Tucker said. \"It has gone into a state where you don't see what's happening anymore.\"\n\nThe family farms have been overtaken by megafarms, selling tobacco on a contract basis to the big companies. The change may have been sparked in 2004, when the U.S. Senate approved a plan to put limits on cigarette makers and pay tobacco farmers $12 billion to give up federal quotas that kept prices up.\n\nThe buyout would pay roughly 400,000 tobacco quota owners, including those in North Carolina, to give up federal allotments limiting how much they can sell each year. Without the quotas keeping prices up, roughly half of the 100,000 active tobacco growers at the time were anticipated to give up growing tobacco altogether.\n\n\"A lot of allotment holders were given a lump sum of money, and at that time decided, 'This is it for me,'\" Tucker said.\n\nAs one motors into Greenville from the west on U.S. Highway 264, the transition is quite apparent. Some of the ground where tobacco was grown has been replaced by the ECU Health hospital as well as the Brody School of Medicine. The old Pitt County Memorial Hospital looms in the distance.\"East Carolina was easily 60 going on 70 years old, and it had an economic impact, but nothing like the med school and the health care professions have generated,\" Tucker said. \"That has really transformed our stature, our economic vitality, dynamism,\" Tucker said. \"And there's no end in sight, to tell you the truth.\"\n\nAnother example of how much Greenville has changed is the fact that ECU is hosting the baseball regional. Such an event wasn't likely years ago. Leo Jenkins, a former president of the school, made it his mission to make then-East Carolina College a centerpiece of the region, not only in education, but in sports as well.\n\n\"Leo Jenkins was the one who believed that if you want to get this school on the map, you need to not just get university status and a medical school, but sports, and football,\" Tucker said.\n\nEven the baseball stadium was built on what used to be farmland that Tucker's grandparents owned. It's now part of a substantial athletic complex that includes a softball stadium, a track and field complex, football practice fields and a renovated Dowdy-Ficklen Stadium, which now seats approximately 50,000.\n\nIn Winston-Salem, a relic of a long-ago era stands in the midst of progress. Old R.J. Reynolds smokestacks rise as a reminder of what used to occur on the east side of the city.\n\nTobacco and textiles were the prime commodities in the late 1800s and early 1900s, but farmers had been growing tobacco in Forsyth County since the mid-1800s, according to NCpedia. From those crops grew manufacturers who made chewing and plug tobacco, and by 1885, cigarette and cigar makers were setting up their businesses.\n\nIn 1875, R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. was born, and it would eventually become the world's largest plug tobacco maker before becoming a prominent cigarette manufacturer. But more than a century later, there would be changes.\n\nR.J. Reynolds announced in 1987 that it would move its corporate headquarters to Atlanta. While only 250 to 300 executives out of more than 14,000 employees made the move, The New York Times reported that \"for Winston-Salem it will be an emotional loss.\"\n\nEventually, the headquarters returned to Winston-Salem after Reynolds bought Brown & Williamson Tobacco Co. -- from its first owner British American Tobacco Plc -- but the hustle and bustle of that section of town ground to a halt, and it took downtown with it.\n\n\"When I moved to Winston in 1993, downtown Winston was dead after 5 p.m.,\" said Ajay Patel, professor and Thomas S. Goho Chair in Finance at Wake Forest University. \"There was nothing to do there. The Innovation Quarter, similarly, was dead after 5 p.m.\"\n\nAccording to Patel, community leaders, including then-Wake Forest president Thomas Hearn and retired Winston-Salem Chamber of Commerce chief executive Gayle Anderson, determined that Winston-Salem's dependence on tobacco, textile and furniture would decline in the future.\n\nThey sought alternative investments to reinvigorate the city. A consulting firm was hired to provide guidance on what the city should reinvest in, and that firm took aim at refocusing on innovation and the arts. Since Wake Forest and Winston-Salem State universities were focused on innovation, especially the medical sciences, that field of research became the building block for the innovation portion of the new strategy, Patel said.\n\nAs R.J. Reynolds vacated first to its mammoth Whitaker Park production plant and then the 2-million-square-feet behemoth in Tobaccoville, the company no longer had need for many of the downtown properties.\n\nReynolds chose to donate several Wake Forest University School of Medicine and WSSU. As additional research teams were brought to the area, Patel said, \"the idea of building on innovation started becoming a reality.\"\n\nWhat brought even more life to the area was the decision to invest in housing, restaurants and other services in the immediate vicinity, as well as in downtown Winston-Salem. And while Greenville, once bustling with a tobacco industry, will come to life this weekend with postseason college baseball and a new football season looming, Winston-Salem has an area that converted that same activity to a palatable lifestyle.\n\n\"To me, the transformation from what it used to be to what it is today is beyond amazing,\" Patel said. \"My wife and I took a colleague who is retiring and his wife to eat at Six Hundred Degrees in the Innovation Quarter last weekend. Even though he has been at (Wake Forest) and Winston for 35 years, he had not been in the Innovation Quarter for several years and was shocked at how much the area had changed -- all for the good. The restaurant and food reminded him of what he expects at some of the larger cities in the U.S, not what Winston used to offer.\"\n\nSkip.foreman@greensboro.com\n\n336-373-7316\n\nTags Tobacco Herbal And Fungal Stimulants Crops Originating From The Americas Winston-salem, North Carolina Piedmont Triad Individual Psychoactive Drugs Vehicles Cars Pickup Trucks Road Haulage Wheeled Vehicles Trucks Light Trucks Land Vehicles Commercial Vehicles Motor Vehicles Greenville, North Carolina East Carolina University Ecu Brody School Of Medicine R.

This year's WNTD theme is \"Protecting children from tobacco industry interference\". The newly launched manual has been designed in line with the theme.\n\nThe manual aims to assist schools in adhering to the ToFEI guidelines issued by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, thereby creating a healthier, tobacco-free environment for students. This initiative will empower all the stakeholders to adopt and enforce guidelines that protect students from the dangers of tobacco.\n\nPrior to the event, Shri Sanjay Kumar, Secretary, DoSEL, in his message, urged that all educational institutions should take steps to discourage the use of tobacco and safeguard children from being addicted to the use of tobacco by making the educational institutions a tobacco-free zone.\n\nUnveiling the manual, Shri Anandrao V. Patil, Additional Secretary, DoSEL, Ministry of Education, stressed the importance of protecting children from tobacco not just as a health imperative but also as a moral obligation. He emphasized on the need to create a tobacco-free educational environment and to ensure that tobacco doesn't have a harmful impact on the students. He highlighted the grim mortality rate due to the harmful consumption of tobacco and encouraged the stakeholders to actively execute the Implementation Manual for ToFEI.\n\nDr. Amarpreet Duggal, Joint Secretary, DoSEL, welcomed the participants to the launch event and stressed the importance of collaborative efforts by all stakeholders to combat tobacco use among students. She mentioned that as per the Global Youth Tobacco Survey (GYTS), 2019, 8.5% of students in the age group of 13 to 15 consume tobacco.\n\nReiterating their commitment, all dignitaries took an oath against tobacco use, a collective endeavour, to create a healthier, tobacco-free future for the nation's youth. Senior officials from the Ministry of Education, autonomous bodies and States/UTs graced the event. Dr. Rana J Singh and Shri Deepak Mishra of SEEDS were also present on the occasion.\n\nThe event concluded with a vote of thanks by Shri U.P. Singh, Director, DoSEL. He expressed gratitude to all dignitaries, partners, and participants for their support and contribution towards the successful launch of the Implementation Manual for ToFEI.", "source": {"uri": "indiaeducationdiary.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "India Education,Education News India,Education News  | India Education Diary"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WNTD", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "WNTD"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tobacco"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Education_(India)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Education (India)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Health_and_Family_Welfare", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Health and Family Welfare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_No_Tobacco_Day", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World No Tobacco Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tobacco industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Literacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stakeholder_(corporate)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stakeholder (corporate)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco_smoking", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tobacco smoking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortality_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mortality rate"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Health", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Health", "wgt": 52}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Specific_Substances", "label": "dmoz/Health/Specific Substances", "wgt": 43}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Specific_Substances/Tobacco", "label": "dmoz/Health/Specific Substances/Tobacco", "wgt": 46}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Tobacco/Magazines_and_E-zines", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Tobacco/Magazines and E-zines", "wgt": 32}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Tobacco/Cigarettes", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Tobacco/Cigarettes", "wgt": 45}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 69}], "image": "https://indiaeducationdiary.in/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/image0010AYD.jpg?w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9613244", "eventUri": "eng-9613244", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 137, "relevance": 1}

When you smoke, these harmful substances enter your bloodstream, damaging your DNA and leading to abnormal cell growth.\n\nTobacco consumption significantly increases the risk of developing various types of cancer, with smokers having a 15 to 30 times higher risk of lung cancer compared to non-smokers, says Dr Vicky Makker, MD, Gynaecological Oncologist, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. She adds, \"Moreover, tobacco use is linked to cancers of the mouth, throat, esophagus, pancreas, bladder, and cervix. Understanding the mechanisms through which tobacco contributes to cancer is crucial for developing effective prevention strategies.\"\n\nDr Makker shares the various ways tobacco increases the risk of developing cancer.:\n\nToxic substances: Tobacco contains 70 chemicals that are known as \"carcinogens\" which are known to initiate or promote cancer in the body. Carcinogens in tobacco are excreted in urine, causing genetic changes in the cells of the bladder and increasing the risk of bladder cancer.\n\nGenetic damage: Tobacco smoke causes direct damage to DNA within cells. This damage can result in mutations, which are changes in the DNA sequence of a cell. These mutations can cause a cell to grow uncontrollably, leading to the formation of a cancerous tumor.\n\nInflammation and oxidative stress: Inflammation and oxidative stress from tobacco can damage proteins, fats, and DNA. This can lead to chronic inflammation and weaken the body's defenses against antioxidants. Chronic inflammation is linked to cancer progression, as it can cause cell mutations and support tumor growth.\n\nWeakening immune system: Smoking tobacco leads to the suppression of the immune system, making it less effective at identifying and destroying cancerous cells. This immunosuppression allows cancer cells to proliferate unchecked.\n\nIncrease in cell proliferation: Tobacco's harmful compounds, like nicotine, boost cell growth. This condition encourages mutations. The increase in cellular proliferation enhances the likelihood of genetic errors that can lead to cancer.\n\nDisturbance in angiogenesis: Components of tobacco smoke can disturb the process of angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels. This can lead to an abnormal blood supply to tissues, providing tumours with the nutrients and oxygen they need to grow and spread.\n\nOral cancer: Tobacco uses significantly increases the risk of cancers in the mouth and throat due to direct contact with carcinogens. Smokeless tobacco products, such as chewing tobacco, also contribute to oral cancers by exposing the mucous membranes to high concentrations of carcinogens.", "source": {"uri": "moneycontrol.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MoneyControl"}, "authors": [{"uri": "namita_s_kalla@moneycontrol.com", "name": "Namita S Kalla", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tobacco"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinogen", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Carcinogen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mouth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "DNA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoking", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Smoking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bladder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bladder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatigue", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fatigue"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cell growth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edema", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Edema"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Immunity (medical)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mutation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco_smoking", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tobacco smoking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdomen", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Abdomen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inflammation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Circulatory system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cough", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cough"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco_smoke", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tobacco smoke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memorial_Sloan_Kettering_Cancer_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excretion", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Excretion"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Health", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Health", "wgt": 42}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Specific_Substances", "label": "dmoz/Health/Specific Substances", "wgt": 49}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Specific_Substances/Tobacco", "label": "dmoz/Health/Specific Substances/Tobacco", "wgt": 50}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Cancer", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Cancer", "wgt": 42}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Women's_Health/Smoking", "label": "dmoz/Health/Women's Health/Smoking", "wgt": 41}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://images.moneycontrol.com/static-mcnews/2024/05/20240531062227_Health-risks-of-tobacco-consumption.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9613244", "eventUri": "eng-9613244", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.4509803921568627, "wgt": 136, "relevance": 1}

Of the 10 journals in the field of respiratory medicine, six had a tobacco policy, but in oncology only one did, and in cardiology, none had one. Among the 10 general medicine journals, only The BMJ had such a policy.\n\nBut even among the journals that have a policy, the editors struggle to identify subsidiaries or organizations associated with the tobacco companies, according to the researchers. Last year, one of BMJ Group's titles, BMJ Open, retracted a paper after it became clear that the listed funder receives sponsorship from the Foundation for a Smoke-Free World, a group supported and fully funded by tobacco company Philip Morris International.\n\n(The Foundation for a Smoke-Free World ended its PMI funding agreement in October 2023. More recently, the group rebranded as Global Action to End Smoking and adopted a policy to not seek or accept funding from any industry that manufactures tobacco products or non-medicinal nicotine products.)\n\nThe investigation cites the case of Dutch researcher Wytse van den Bosch, who had a research grant from pharmaceutical company Vectura when the company was bought by PMI in 2021. Nevertheless, his study was still published in the European Respiratory Society journal which said the research was not in breach of its policy as the grant from Vectura was initiated in 2018.\n\nRuth Malone, professor of social behavioral sciences at the University of California and former editor-in-chief of BMJ Group's Tobacco Control journal, said that institutions, professionals and scientific journals should refuse involvement with the tobacco industry.\n\n\"Anyone who understands the history, extent and nature of the epidemic and the tobacco industry's strategic efforts to divide the public health community knows that industry money should be rejected,\" she said in a statement.\n\nNicholas Hopkinson, professor of respiratory medicine at Imperial College London, notes that given the industry's \"long-standing history of dishonesty\" it is \"very straightforward\" that researchers should cut ties to companies after they are acquired by big tobacco, as otherwise they would be \"working with the tobacco industry\" and contribute to their profits.\n\nOn May 30, BMJ updated its 2013 tobacco policy. In addition to excluding research funded by the tobacco industry, BMJ journals will also exclude work where authors have personal financial ties to the tobacco industry.\n\n\"The updated policy is one action BMJ journals can take to reduce the publication of content which downplays the harms of smoking or hinders the creation of a world free from the harms of smoking,\" the publisher wrote in a statement.\n\n\"Creating a stronger firewall between the tobacco industry and BMJ content will provide space for editors to curate and publish content that is more independent and trusted, and contributes to a healthier world.\"", "source": {"uri": "tobaccoreporter.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "tobaccoreporter.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_journal", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Medical journal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tobacco industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tobacco"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_BMJ", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "The BMJ"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vectura", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vectura"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundation_for_a_Smoke-Free_World", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Foundation for a Smoke-Free World"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMJ_(company)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "BMJ (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonology", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pulmonology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_medicine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Internal medicine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiology", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cardiology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncology", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oncology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMJ_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "BMJ Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Respiratory_Society", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "European Respiratory Society"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Morris_International", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Philip Morris International"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grant_(money)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Grant (money)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoking", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Smoking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nicotine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pharmaceutical industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco_Control_(journal)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tobacco Control (journal)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Tobacco", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Big Tobacco"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_College_London", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Imperial College London"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemic", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Epidemic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Health", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Health", "wgt": 55}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Specific_Substances", "label": "dmoz/Health/Specific Substances", "wgt": 49}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Specific_Substances/Tobacco", "label": "dmoz/Health/Specific Substances/Tobacco", "wgt": 51}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Women's_Health/Smoking", "label": "dmoz/Health/Women's Health/Smoking", "wgt": 33}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Tobacco/Cigarettes", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Tobacco/Cigarettes", "wgt": 46}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 76}], "image": "https://files.tobaccoreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/05/medical-journal-850x560.jpg?x70034", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9613244", "eventUri": "eng-9613244", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-30", "textStart": 2672, "textEnd": 2678}], "sentiment": -0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 133, "relevance": 1}

It affects almost every organ system, said doctors on World No Tobacco Day on Friday, calling for the need to quit smoke.\n\nAs smoking is majorly linked to lung cancer and cardiovascular diseases, the full spectrum of tobacco damage is often underestimated. Tobacco smoke contains over 7,000 chemicals, many of which are toxic, and at least 70 are known to cause cancer.\n\nIt can cause chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), emphysema, and chronic bronchitis. It also leads to peptic ulcers, harms the reproductive system, and weakens the immune system, making the body more susceptible to infections, said the experts.\n\n\"The tar in tobacco smoke damages the cilia -- small hair-like structures in the lungs that help clear out mucus and dirt -, leading to chronic bronchitis and an increased risk of fatal infections,\" Dr. Arindam Datta, Associate Consultant, Respiratory Medicine and Pulmonary Interventions, Narayana Hospital, Howrah, told VOICE.\n\nThe doctor informed that long-term smokers, industrial workers, people with a history of asthma, and those exposed to secondhand smoke, dust, and pollutants both indoors and outdoors are at the highest risk.\n\nTobacco's impact on cardiovascular health is profound. It increases heart rate, tightens major arteries, and can create an irregular heart rhythm. Chemicals in tobacco also damage the lining of the arteries, narrowing and hardening them with the buildup of plaque, resulting in heart attacks and strokes.\n\n\"Tobacco smoke contains carbon monoxide and nicotine, which increase the heart's workload and decrease its efficiency. Carbon monoxide binds with haemoglobin in red blood cells, reducing their oxygen-carrying capacity. Nicotine increases blood pressure and heart rate, which can lead to hypertension. This combination of effects significantly raises the risk of coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, and stroke,\" Dr. Samir Kubba, Director - Cardiology, Dharamshila Narayana Hospital, told VOICE.\n\n\"Individuals with a family history of heart disease, those who have hypertension or diabetes, and smokers of all ages are at increased risk,\" he added.\n\nFurther, tobacco use is also the leading cause of preventable cancer. Carcinogens in tobacco such as nitrosamines and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, damage DNA and hinder the body's ability to repair damaged cells, leading to mutations that can cause cancer, said medical oncologist Dr. Samit Purohit - Senior Consultant from Action Cancer Hospital told VOICE.\n\n\"Tobacco use is responsible for nearly 90 per cent of all lung cancer cases, but its impact is not limited to the lungs. It is a major risk factor for cancers of the mouth, throat, oesophagus, bladder, pancreas, kidney, and cervix,\" he added.\n\nSecondhand smoke also causes great harm. Non-smokers who live with smokers have about a 20-30 per cent greater risk of developing lung cancer. This exposure can also increase the risk of cancers of the larynx and pharynx.\n\nImportantly, the health experts noted that smokeless tobacco products are equally dangerous.

I noticed this started a few years ago but not all companies are doing that.\n\n\"The same is supposed to be for shisha and all other tobacco products. But as you may have also found out, compliance with this has been quite poor, which is why the enforcement agents and stakeholders must spring into action to ensure that the law is enforced, particularly on all the other tobacco products.\n\n\"What we have now is some compliance with cigarette packages, but it should be across all tobacco products. It is a form of deterrence. Studies have shown that when we have graphic health warnings, they deter people who don't use tobacco from starting, it reinforces the willingness to quit for people who are already taking the products.\n\nA former Chairman of the Association of Private Medical Practitioners of Nigeria, Dr Tunji Akintade said every consumable should be regularised under a strict administration law.\n\nHe explained, \"All these things are drugs, as far as I'm concerned because it alters your physiology from one state to the other. Snuff, shisha, marijuana, or Colorado must be regulated. Even the adverts on social media for these products should be regularised.\n\n\"I advocate that the government's regulatory body look at the contents of these things and implement the graphic health warnings and labelling on them.\"\n\nThe Executive Director of Renevlyn Development Initiative, Philip Jakpor, said Nigeria should adhere strictly to WHO's recommendations to discourage young people who are impressionable from taking up the habit.\n\nHe said, \"Smoking starts by seeing those beautiful packs and then wanting to experiment. So, tobacco packs should have pictures and health warnings to discourage smokers. For instance, we can have aborted babies, diseased lungs, and mouth cancer, among others, even though every country is free to come up with its warnings.\n\n\"If you go to the market today, most of the cigarette packs have pictorials and health warnings that cover at least 50 per cent of the front, side, and back. But, it is not meant to be only on cigarettes. Unfortunately, if you go to the Nigerian markets, other tobacco products like shisha and snus don't have the warnings.\n\n\"There is no full compliance to the graphic health warnings yet. The Ministry of Health is supposed to drive it, and I think has been driving it. The Federal Competition and Consumer Protection Commission carries out enforcement exercises but it's not nationwide, simultaneous.\n\nA study carried out by an international non-profit organisation, Development Gateway, showed that shisha smoking is growing alarmingly among students in high school and tertiary education.\n\nThe study titled, 'The factors associated with shisha use in Nigeria' revealed that 3.6 per cent of current shisha smokers were also current cigarette smokers, and 0.2 per cent of those who were both current shisha and cigarette smokers reported always or sometimes combining shisha smoking with cigarettes.\n\nThe organisation recommended that there should be \"Restrictions on flavours, awareness raising on the harmful health effects of shisha, and providing interventions to help people stop smoking shisha.\n\n\"Compliance monitoring and enforcement of the existing tobacco control laws need to be strengthened, particularly in smoke-free environments in indoor and outdoor places, health (both written and graphical) warnings in English on shisha products including the pots, and application of the specific tax, and sale of shisha to minors.\"",

This backgrounder accompanies the news release entitled \"New investments to help people in Canada quit smoking\" that was issued today.\n\nMay 31, 2024\n\nThrough the Healthy Canadians and Communities Fund (HCCF), the Public Health Agency of Canada supports projects that address tobacco cessation and prevention, unhealthy eating and physical inactivity. Projects funded through the HCCF help lower the risk of chronic disease, including type 2 diabetes, cancer and cardiovascular disease, with a focus on populations in Canada at the highest risk.\n\nTo support projects at various stages, HCCF's approach to project funding has three phases: design, implement, and scale. As part of the implement phase, the Government of Canada is providing more than $9 million to three Canadian organizations that share a common goal of creating supportive social environments for tobacco prevention and cessation.\n\nDescription: This project will contribute to implementing a holistic approach to tobacco cessation, by offering culturally appropriate strategies through a group-based program aimed at fostering social support to decrease commercial tobacco use and increase physical activity. It will be done in collaboration with First Nations, M\u00e9tis, and urban Indigenous communities in Manitoba, Saskatchewan and British Columbia.\n\nDescription: This project will aim to reduce the risk of cancers and chronic diseases in newcomers to Canada and racialized communities through activities that will support tobacco reduction and cessation. Peer health coaches and prevention practitioners with lived experience will be recruited from priority populations and trained to help participants adopt and sustain positive behavior change for tobacco reduction and cessation.\n\nProject name: CP@clinic Intervention to Decrease Smoking and Improve Healthy Aging\n\nDescription: This project will bring forward tools and activities that will aim to decrease smoking and improve healthy aging. This project will reach approximately 1,750 older adults with low incomes living in Ontario and British Columbia communities. The project will empower groups of residents in social housing by fostering social connectedness, peer support, resource sharing, and participant-led goal setting.\n\nDescription: This project will design two social marketing campaigns. One campaign will include new innovations to support Two-Spirit people, queer and trans young adults in smoking cessation, by raising awareness on risks of smoking tobacco and vaping e-cigarettes on health.

Additionally, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, reduced fertility, type-2 diabetes, compromised immune function, gum disease and tooth loss are associated with excessive tobacco use. \"Tobacco consumption can lead to a weakened immune system and decreased life expectancy, resulting in a diminished quality of life,\" she said, emphasising the importance of embracing a healthy lifestyle, consuming nutritious foods and maintaining emotional well-being. The event underscored the critical role of individual choices in safeguarding personal health,\" she said.\n\nThe World Anti-Tobacco Day event was organised in the Seminar Hall under the joint auspices of the Department of Sociology and the NSS Unit of Government Medical College in Anantapur.\n\nDr. S Manikya Rao, Principal, and Dr. K.S.S. Venkateswara Rao, Superintendent of Government General Hospital, underscored the harmful effects of tobacco use, particularly its association with cancer and adverse impacts on various organs. They highlighted the government's initiative to establish de-addiction centres in all the district hospitals to combat smoking. Dr. S Manikya Rao led a pledge to combat tobacco use, with all participants expressing appreciation for the impactful 15-minute play \"Keep your children away from tobacco products,\" performed by the 2021 batch of medical students under the guidance of Dr. Sushma and Dr. Gitanjali, Assistant Professors of the SPM Department.\n\nRead Comments", "source": {"uri": "thehindu.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hindu"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tobacco"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-being", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Well-being"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco_smoking", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tobacco smoking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chittoor,_Andhra_Pradesh", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chittoor, Andhra Pradesh"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chittoor, Andhra Pradesh"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_2_diabetes", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Type 2 diabetes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beedi", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Beedi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chewing_tobacco", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chewing tobacco"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth_loss", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tooth loss"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodontitis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Periodontitis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunodeficiency", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Immunodeficiency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cigarette", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cigarette"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_disease", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Respiratory disease"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_obstructive_pulmonary_disease", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Quality of life"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Immune system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroke", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stroke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fertility", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fertility"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nicotine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Circulatory system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiovascular_disease", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cardiovascular disease"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_expectancy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Life expectancy"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Health", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Health", "wgt": 48}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Specific_Substances", "label": "dmoz/Health/Specific Substances", "wgt": 46}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Specific_Substances/Tobacco", "label": "dmoz/Health/Specific Substances/Tobacco", "wgt": 47}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Women's_Health/Smoking", "label": "dmoz/Health/Women's Health/Smoking", "wgt": 31}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Tobacco/Cigarettes", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Tobacco/Cigarettes", "wgt": 40}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://www.thehindu.com/theme/images/og-image.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9613244", "eventUri": "eng-9613244", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 126, "relevance": 1}

Cigarettes were the next most common, with 1.6% of middle- and high school students saying they had consumed them in the past month.\n\nResearch shows that most people who use tobacco start in childhood.\n\nI am a public health researcher who studies the different ways in which corporations influence adolescent health, with current projects focused on identifying sources of exposure to tobacco marketing among adolescents and young adults.\n\nOver the past decade, I've researched ways in which tobacco companies market to children and young adults.\n\nSmoking is harmful to every organ in the human body and is known to cause many types of cancers and heart disease, among other problems. Nicotine, by itself, in products like e-cigarettes and oral pouches, is harmful to adolescent brain development.\n\nThe adolescent brain develops into early adulthood, especially in the prefrontal cortex. This part of the brain is involved in higher cognitive development, including functions pertaining to attention, memory and cognitive flexibility. Research has shown that nicotine exposure results in long-term functional and structural changes in the brain.\n\nDecades of research have documented how tobacco companies marketed tobacco products for years to attract young customers in order to sustain and grow their businesses.\n\nIn a 2021 study, my team and I showed that exposure to e-cigarette marketing with cartoon images decreased high school students' perceptions of harm from e-cigarettes. Research makes clear that this change in perspective can make adolescents more open to trying e-cigarettes.\n\nIn an earlier study, my team and I examined the impact of e-cigarette product placement and imagery in music videos on propensity to use e-cigarettes among young adults.

I noticed this started a few years ago but not all companies are doing that.\n\n\"The same is supposed to be for shisha and all other tobacco products. But as you may have also found out, compliance with this has been quite poor, which is why the enforcement agents and stakeholders must spring into action to ensure that the law is enforced, particularly on all the other tobacco products.\n\n\"What we have now is some compliance with cigarette packages, but it should be across all tobacco products. It is a form of deterrence. Studies have shown that when we have graphic health warnings, they deter people who don't use tobacco from starting; it reinforces the willingness to quit for people who are already taking the products.\n\nA former Chairman of the Association of Private Medical Practitioners of Nigeria, Dr Tunji Akintade, said every consumable should be regularised under a strict administration law.\n\n\"All these things are drugs, as far as I'm concerned because it alters your physiology from one state to the other. Snuff, shisha, marijuana, or Colorado must be regulated. Even the adverts on social media for these products should be regularised.\n\n\"I advocate that the government's regulatory body should look at the contents of these things and implement the graphic health warnings and labelling on them,\" Dr Akintade said.\n\nThe Executive Director of Renevlyn Development Initiative, Philip Jakpor said Nigeria should adhere strictly to WHO's recommendations to discourage young people who are impressionable from taking up the habit.\n\nJakpor said, \"Smoking starts by seeing those beautiful packs and then wanting to experiment. So, tobacco packs should have pictures and health warnings to discourage smokers. For instance, we can have aborted babies, diseased lungs, and mouth cancer, among others, even though every country is free to come up with its warnings.\n\n\"If you go to the market today, most of the cigarette packs have pictorials and health warnings that cover at least 50 per cent of the front, side, and back. But, it is not meant to be only on cigarettes. Unfortunately, if you go to the Nigerian markets, other tobacco products like shisha and snus don't have the warnings.\n\n\"There is no full compliance to the graphic health warnings yet. The Ministry of Health is supposed to drive it, and I think it has been driving it. The Federal Competition and Consumer Protection Commission carries out enforcement exercises but it's not nationwide, simultaneous.\n\nA study carried out by an international non-profit organisation, Development Gateway, showed that shisha smoking is growing alarmingly among students in high school and tertiary education.\n\nThe study titled, 'The factors associated with shisha use in Nigeria' revealed that 3.6 per cent of current shisha smokers were also current cigarette smokers, and 0.2 per cent of those who were both current shisha and cigarette smokers reported always or sometimes combining shisha smoking with cigarettes.\n\nThe organisation recommended that there should be \"Restrictions on flavours, awareness raising on the harmful health effects of shisha, and providing interventions to help people stop smoking shisha.\n\n\"Compliance monitoring and enforcement of the existing tobacco control laws need to be strengthened, particularly in smoke-free environments in indoor and outdoor places, health (both written and graphical) warnings in English on shisha products including the pots, and application of the specific tax, and sale of shisha to minors.\"",

Tobacco consumption stands as a paramount contributor to preventable illnesses and fatalities worldwide casting a long shadow of adverse health consequences ranging from cancer to fertility complications.\n\nDanger of cancer\n\nTobacco usage represents the foremost preventable cause of cancer globally, accounting for approximately 22 per cent of cancer-related deaths. Among its myriad devastating impacts, tobacco smoke significantly heightens the risk of lung cancer, serving as the primary culprit in approximately 85 per cent of cases. Moreover, tobacco consumption, whether through smoking or smokeless means like chewing tobacco, is a prominent risk factor for cancers affecting the oral cavity, throat, esophagus, bladder, pancreas, kidney, cervix, stomach, and acute myeloid leukemia.\n\n\"Smoking is injurious to health and can adversely affect overall health and well-being. When cigarette smoke is inhaled, it can cause severe damage to the lungs, kidneys, voice box(larynx) and mouth. Heavy smokers have a higher chance of developing cancer of the mouth, throat and lungs as these parts of the body are directly exposed to the harmful toxins in cigarette smoke. A cigarette is made of cancer-causing substances such as tar, nicotine, arsenic and benzene which eventually decrease life expectancy and increase the chances of cancer. These harmful chemicals when exposed to the lungs can damage DNA lead to genetic mutation, and also cause inflammation and damage cells gradually,\" said Dr Atul Narayankar, Consultant Medical Oncologist, Wockhardt Hospitals, Mira Road in Mumbai.\n\n\"Tobacco use is the leading preventable cause of cancer and cancer deaths. Almost 40 per cent of cancers in India are caused by tobacco exposure. It can cause not only lung cancer -- but also cancers of the mouth and throat, voice box, esophagus, stomach, kidney, pancreas, liver, bladder, cervix, colon and rectum and a type of leukemia,\" said Narayankar.\n\nThe symptoms include hoarseness or a cough that does not go away, a hard time swallowing, discomfort after eating, changes in bowel or bladder habits, unusual bleeding or discharge, a thickening or lump in any part of the body, weight loss with no known reason and a sore that does not heal'\n\n\"The goal of oral cancer screening is to detect mouth cancer or precancerous lesions that may lead to mouth cancer at an early stage -- when cancer or lesions are easiest to remove and most likely to be cured. People with a high risk of oral cancer may be more likely to benefit from oral cancer screening\n\n\"Smoking causes cancer in multiple ways. The main way is by damaging the DNA in our cells. DNA controls how our cells grow and behave. Damage to DNA causes cells to behave in ways that they're not supposed to. And the build-up of DNA damage over time can lead to cancer.\n\nSecondhand smoke is what you inhale accidentally (called passive smoking) when you are near sources of tobacco smoke. For example, at parties or public gatherings, you might mingle with people who smoke. You may not feel any changes, but breathing secondhand smoke can affect your health,\" said Narayankar. \"Quitting smoking is the best thing you can do if you smoke and saying no to smoking is another wise thing to do if you have not yet indulged in this bad habit.\"\n\nPossibility of infertility?\n\nIn addition to its profound association with cancer, tobacco usage exerts a deleterious toll on fertility, afflicting both women and men. In women, smoking disrupts hormone production, precipitating irregular menstrual cycles and heightened susceptibility to anovulation. Furthermore, the toxins in tobacco smoke compromise the quality of eggs, elevating the risk of chromosomal aberrations and impairing fertility.\n\nStructural damage inflicted upon the fallopian tubes amplifies the likelihood of ectopic pregnancies, exacerbating reproductive challenges. Conversely, in men, tobacco consumption impairs sperm count, motility, and morphology, compromising fertility potential. The onslaught of DNA damage in sperm cells instigated by tobacco smoke engenders genetic anomalies in offspring and augments the risk of miscarriages. Additionally, smoking-induced vascular impairment can culminate in erectile dysfunction, further complicating matters of fertility.\n\n\"Male fertility occurs when one is unable to produce enough sperm which is necessary for conceiving. It can be caused by various reasons such as your body being unable to generate enough sperm or healthy sperm, the reproductive system tube getting blocked, problems in hormonal or pituitary glands, a weak immune system, certain diseases or medical conditions, and genetics. There are several male infertility conditions like Azoospermia(zero or no sperms in the ejaculate), Oligospermia(low sperm count) Asthenospermia(poor sperm motility) and Varicocele(an enlargement of the veins within the loose bag of skin that holds the testicles) among the others,\" said Dr Soumya Shetty, Fertility Consultant, Nova IVF, at Chembur in Mumbai.\n\n\"Fertility specialists provide a personalised form of treatment as per the condition, few male infertility conditions can be treated through medications or surgery, while some require the help of fertility treatments like IVF, IUI etc. Few studies show that few men with male infertility issues may be more prone to other health conditions like cardiovascular diseases, cancer etc, however there is not enough data to support this. Infertility can cause hormonal imbalances in the body, and lead to lower testosterone levels and disturbance in the functioning of the endocrine. Lifestyle factors such as irregular sleeping patterns, eating junk and processed food, excessive consumption of alcohol, smoking, chewing tobacco, or being overweight are the factors which can significantly increase the risk of male infertility. Certain autoimmune diseases could be the potential reason that could cause male infertility,\" said Shetty .\n\nPurpose of World No Tobacco Day\n\nThe observance of World No Tobacco Day highlights the multifaceted repercussions of tobacco use spanning from cancer to the intricate dynamics of fertility. By fostering awareness and advocating for tobacco cessation initiatives, this global campaign endeavors to mitigate the pervasive health hazards engendered by tobacco consumption. The cessation of smoking and the mitigation of secondhand smoke exposure emerge as indispensable imperatives in safeguarding against the profound health afflictions wrought by tobacco.", "source": {"uri": "firstpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Firstpost"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bladder", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bladder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco_smoke", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tobacco smoke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Oral cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larynx", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Larynx"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kidney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mouth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco_smoking", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tobacco smoking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "DNA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoking", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Smoking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tobacco"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fertility", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fertility"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lung"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_No_Tobacco_Day", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "World No Tobacco Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cervix", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cervix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sperm", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sperm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung_cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lung cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Stomach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esophagus", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Esophagus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreas", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pancreas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Health", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Health", "wgt": 47}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Specific_Substances", "label": "dmoz/Health/Specific Substances", "wgt": 60}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Specific_Substances/Tobacco", "label": "dmoz/Health/Specific Substances/Tobacco", "wgt": 61}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Women's_Health/Smoking", "label": "dmoz/Health/Women's Health/Smoking", "wgt": 51}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Tobacco/Cigarettes", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Tobacco/Cigarettes", "wgt": 48}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://images.firstpost.com/uploads/2024/05/Tobacco1200Reu-2024-05-ca818b46b25424d4be6bb7a4a8517485.jpg?im=FitAndFill=(1200,675)", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9613244", "eventUri": "eng-9613244", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-31", "textStart": 205, "textEnd": 211}], "sentiment": -0.5686274509803921, "wgt": 122, "relevance": 1}

This highlights the need for stricter regulations to ban tobacco advertising in sports.\n\nNearly half of the advertisements telecast during the last 17 matches of the Cricket World Cup 2023 were surrogate promotion of smokeless tobacco brands, according to a study that has called for a complete ban on promoting tobacco products in all sports.\n\nAccording to the study conducted by a group of experts from the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and Vital Strategies, of the total 41.3 per cent surrogate advertisements of smokeless tobacco (SLT) brands, 39.9 per cent were telecast during India's matches and 37.8 per cent during matches featuring one or both teams from South Asia (Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Pakistan and Sri Lanka).\n\nCardamom was the main product promoted through such advertisements.\n\n''Two SLT brands, Vimal and Kamla Pasand, contributed to the surrogate SLT advertisements. While the promotion of the Vimal brand was entirely led by prominent Bollywood celebrities, former cricketers led the surrogate advertisements for Kamla Pasand,'' the study that was published in the British Medical Journal in May said.\n\nThe International Cricket Council's (ICC) Men's Cricket World Cup 2023 was hosted by India and officially broadcast on television channel Star Sports. Ten countries (Afghanistan, Australia, Bangladesh, England, India, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Pakistan, South Africa and Sri Lanka) participated in the 46-day tournament, which received over a trillion viewing minutes globally.\n\nThe study examined the surrogate SLT brand advertisements during the tournament.\n\nSmokeless tobacco is consumed by more than 35 crore people across 70 countries covering all World Health Organization (WHO) regions. India is a major producer and consumer of SLT products with more than 20 crore adult users and accounts for nearly 80 per cent of the SLT-attributable deaths globally.\n\nThe tobacco industry spends half a billion dollars annually on SLT product promotion.\n\nConsistent with Article 13 of the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC), India's Cigarettes and Other Tobacco Products Act, 2003 (COTPA) prohibits direct and indirect tobacco advertising, promotion and sponsorship (TAPS). Indirect and direct tobacco product promotion in sports is a tobacco-industry tactic to circumvent the TAPS restrictions.\n\nFive trained researchers collected data during the telecasts of the last 17 world cup matches, with a total streaming time of approximately 126 hours and an average stream time per match of 7:47 hours.\n\nThe data was entered into a spreadsheet using Microsoft Excel (V.2010) and analysed. All the advertisements were categorised as surrogate advertising for tobacco products.\n\nSurrogate advertisement is defined as using an established brand name associated with any product that is prohibited from being advertised under any law for the time being in force or under any rules or regulations made thereunder to promote another product.\n\nThe SLT industry primarily targeted matches where one of the five South Asian countries played, reinforcing why this region continues to be the SLT-use hotspot.\n\nIn 2023, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) released a list of brand categories, including tobacco, to be prohibited from applying for sponsorship.\n\nIn India, section 5 of the COTPA and the Cable Television Network Rules, 1995 clearly prohibit the display of any direct and indirect advertising of tobacco products in film and television. Since September 1, 2023, the prohibition has also been extended to cover OTT (over-the-top) platforms.\n\n''Surrogate advertising of SLT products through international cricket tournaments helps the industry to promote its products in global markets, in violation of FCTC Article 13. National and international cricket and other sports boards should consider imposing a complete prohibition on any kind of direct and indirect brand association of tobacco products in all sports,'' the

of cigarettes", "body": "The Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration des buralistes, which represents the interests of tobacco retailers in France, has come out against a Senate report that recommends raising the price of a pack of cigarettes to \u20ac25 by 2040.\n\nFrance, where a pack of twenty cigarettes costs around \u20ac12.50, is one of the six countries in the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) with the highest prices of a pack of cigarettes.\n\n\"In Europe, only the UK and Ireland have higher prices\", the Senate Social Affairs Committee said in its report adopted on Wednesday (May 29).\n\nDespite the high price, France remains one of the countries with the highest number of daily smokers, and every year tobacco causes 70,000 premature deaths.\n\nThe report noted that \"the policy of reducing smoking has failed\", and recommended increasing the price by at least 3.25% every year between now and 2040, which would mean raising the price of a pack of cigarettes to \u20ac25.\n\nThe tobacco retailers went up in arms, arguing that French tobacco taxation already leads the way in Europe.\n\n\"The Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration des buralistes condemns the remarks made in this report, which aim to minimise the impact of contraband and counterfeit tobacco markets in the country,\" said their press release issued on Friday (May 31).\n\nAccording to the Senate, in France, the prevalence of smoking decreases when the price increases by more than 4%.\n\nThe tobacconists replied that \"the reports in the memo are unacceptable and demonstrate a blatant disregard for the consequences of price, both on the country's public health and on the network's economic situation\".,\n\nThe World Health Organisation (WHO) also considers raising the price per pack to be one of the most effective measures, and has deplored the fact that \"high tobacco taxes are rarely implemented\".\n\nFrance's 2023-2027 National Tobacco Control Plan, presented in November by former health minister Aur\u00e9lien Rousseau, currently plans a price of \u20ac13 per pack by 2026.\n\nFor tobacconists, efforts should focus on the fight against the black market, i.e. smuggling and counterfeit cigarettes, which account for between 30% and 40% of cigarettes consumed in France.\n\nHowever, this figure is disputed by anti-tobacco association ACT, the directorates of public finances and customs, and the Observatoire fran\u00e7ais des drogues et des tendances addictives (ODFT), who put the figure at around 6%.\n\nIn Brussels, tobacco taxation will be on the agenda during the next term of office, following June's EU elections, since the current Commission has not reviewed the Tobacco Products Directive and the Tobacco Taxation Directive, dating from 2014 and 2011 respectively, as originally planned.", "source": {"uri": "euractiv.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "EurActiv.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cigarette", "type": "wiki",

Aida Rami\u0107 \u010catak, Ph.D. med., assistant director for medical affairs and head of the Public Health Sector of the Public Health Institute of the FBiH, in an interview with Fena, reminded that the latest study on the state of health of the adult population in the Federation of BiH from 2012 showed that 44.1 percent of the adult population in FBiH smokes.\n\nIn the analysis of the smoking habits of school children, the results of the Global Research on Smoking among School Children and Youth (GYTS), which is conducted periodically every five years in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, are used.\n\nWith the support of the Federal Ministry of Health, the FBiH Public Health Institute conducted this research in 2019, and the results showed that as many as 24.4 percent of school children consume tobacco products.\n\nThe fact that 81.4 percent of the surveyed consumers of tobacco products among school children are not prevented from buying these products despite their age, Rami\u0107 \u010catak warned.\n\nMortality and economic damage\n\nWhen it comes to the impact of smoking on the health of the population, Rami\u0107 \u010catak pointed out that the Institute of Public Health of the FBiH monitors the trend of morbidity and mortality related to smoking, and one of the most relevant indicators is the analysis of the trend of the mortality rate from malignant neoplasms of the bronchi and lungs, which are directly connected with smoking as the leading risk factor.\n\n- In the period from 2013 to 2022, an increase in the number of deaths was recorded. In 2014, 831 people died from these diseases, in 2021, 1,432 people died, while in 2022, the number was slightly lower compared to the previous year: 1,037 died from malignant neoplasms of the bronchi and lungs - warned Rami\u0107 \u010catak.\n\nFrom the non-governmental organization PROI, which has been working for years on improving public health policies and advocating tobacco control in BiH, we received information that the direct costs of tobacco consumption in our country, which relate to the costs of treating smokers suffering from smoking-related diseases, are estimated at an amount between 557 and 766 million marks.\n\nThere are also the indirect costs of mortality from smoking, which represent the value of human lives lost due to premature death caused by the consequences of smoking, and they are estimated at between 111 and 141 million marks.", "source": {"uri": "sarajevotimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sarajevo Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoking", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Smoking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tobacco"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federation_of_Bosnia_and_Herzegovina", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bosnia and Herzegovina"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bosnia_and_Herzegovina", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bosnia and Herzegovina"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bosnia and Herzegovina"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tobacco industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cigarette", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cigarette"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-governmental_organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Non-governmental organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Ministry_of_Health_(Germany)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal Ministry of Health (Germany)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortality_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mortality rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronchus", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bronchus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco_control", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tobacco control"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_effects_of_tobacco", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Health effects of tobacco"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Risk factor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Disease"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lung"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Public health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cancer"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Health", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Health", "wgt": 46}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Specific_Substances", "label": "dmoz/Health/Specific Substances", "wgt": 52}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Specific_Substances/Tobacco", "label": "dmoz/Health/Specific Substances/Tobacco", "wgt": 52}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Women's_Health/Smoking", "label": "dmoz/Health/Women's Health/Smoking", "wgt": 37}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Tobacco/Cigarettes", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Tobacco/Cigarettes", "wgt": 43}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 84}], "image": "https://sarajevotimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/New-Prices-of-Cigarettes-in-BH.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9613244", "eventUri": "eng-9613244", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-31", "textStart": 74, "textEnd": 80}], "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 119, "relevance": 1}

According to the study conducted by a group of experts from the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and Vital Strategies, of the total 41.3 per cent surrogate advertisements of smokeless tobacco (SLT) brands, 39.9 per cent were telecast during India's matches and 37.8 per cent during matches featuring one or both teams from South Asia (Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Pakistan and Sri Lanka).\n\nCardamom was the main product promoted through such advertisements.\n\n\"Two SLT brands, Vimal and Kamla Pasand, contributed to the surrogate SLT advertisements. While the promotion of the Vimal brand was entirely led by prominent Bollywood celebrities, former cricketers led the surrogate advertisements for Kamla Pasand,\" the study that was published in the British Medical Journal in May said.\n\nThe International Cricket Council's (ICC) Men's Cricket World Cup 2023 was hosted by India and officially broadcast on television channel Star Sports. Ten countries (Afghanistan, Australia, Bangladesh, England, India, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Pakistan, South Africa and Sri Lanka) participated in the 46-day tournament, which received over a trillion viewing minutes globally.\n\nThe study examined the surrogate SLT brand advertisements during the tournament.\n\nSmokeless tobacco is consumed by more than 35 crore people across 70 countries covering all World Health Organization (WHO) regions. India is a major producer and consumer of SLT products with more than 20 crore adult users and accounts for nearly 80 per cent of the SLT-attributable deaths globally.\n\nThe tobacco industry spends half a billion dollars annually on SLT product promotion.\n\nConsistent with Article 13 of the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC), India's Cigarettes and Other Tobacco Products Act, 2003 (COTPA) prohibits direct and indirect tobacco advertising, promotion and sponsorship (TAPS). Indirect and direct tobacco product promotion in sports is a tobacco-industry tactic to circumvent the TAPS restrictions.\n\nFive trained researchers collected data during the telecasts of the last 17 world cup matches, with a total streaming time of approximately 126 hours and an average stream time per match of 7:47 hours.\n\nThe data was entered into a spreadsheet using Microsoft Excel (V.2010) and analysed. All the advertisements were categorised as surrogate advertising for tobacco products.\n\nSurrogate advertisement is defined as using an established brand name associated with any product that is prohibited from being advertised under any law for the time being in force or under any rules or regulations made thereunder to promote another product.\n\nThe SLT industry primarily targeted matches where one of the five South Asian countries played, reinforcing why this region continues to be the SLT-use hotspot.\n\nIn 2023, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) released a list of brand categories, including tobacco, to be prohibited from applying for sponsorship.\n\nIn India, section 5 of the COTPA and the Cable Television Network Rules, 1995 clearly prohibit the display of any direct and indirect advertising of tobacco products in film and television. Since September 1, 2023, the prohibition has also been extended to cover OTT (over-the-top) platforms.\n\n\"Surrogate advertising of SLT products through international cricket tournaments helps the industry to promote its products in global markets, in violation of FCTC Article 13. National and international cricket and other sports boards should consider imposing a complete prohibition on any kind of direct and indirect brand association of tobacco products in all sports,\" the

As part of the implement phase, the Government of Canada is providing more than $9 million to three Canadian organizations that share a common goal of creating supportive social environments for tobacco prevention and cessation.\n\nThe projects receiving funding are:\n\nLead organization: Canadian Cancer Society\n\nProject name: Connect to Change\n\nDescription: This project will contribute to implementing a holistic approach to tobacco cessation, by offering culturally appropriate strategies through a group-based program aimed at fostering social support to decrease commercial tobacco use and increase physical activity. It will be done in collaboration with First Nations, M\u00e9tis, and urban Indigenous communities in Manitoba, Saskatchewan and British Columbia.\n\nFunding: $2,873,452\n\nLead organization: Canadian Cancer Society\n\nProject name: BETTER for All\n\nDescription: This project will aim to reduce the risk of cancers and chronic diseases in newcomers to Canada and racialized communities through activities that will support tobacco reduction and cessation. Peer health coaches and prevention practitioners with lived experience will be recruited from priority populations and trained to help participants adopt and sustain positive behavior change for tobacco reduction and cessation.\n\nFunding: $3,000,000\n\nLead organization: McMaster University\n\nProject name: CP@clinic Intervention to Decrease Smoking and Improve Healthy Aging\n\nDescription: This project will bring forward tools and activities that will aim to decrease smoking and improve healthy aging. This project will reach approximately 1,750 older adults with low incomes living in Ontario and British Columbia communities. The project will empower groups of residents in social housing by fostering social connectedness, peer support, resource sharing, and participant-led goal setting.\n\nFunding: $679,783\n\nLead organization: The Governing Council of the University of Toronto\n\nProject name: Expand Project Implementation Phase\n\nDescription: This project will design two social marketing campaigns. One campaign will include new innovations to support Two-Spirit people, queer and trans young adults in smoking cessation, by raising awareness on risks of smoking tobacco and vaping e-cigarettes on health. The second campaign will be designed and led by Indigenous partners to have conversations around reclaiming the bond of Semaa (traditional tobacco) as sacred medicine, while highlighting the impacts of commercial tobacco on health and well-being.\n\nFunding: $2,995,645\n\nSearch for related information by keyword:\n\nSmoking\n\n|\n\nPublic Health Agency of Canada\n\n|\n\nHealth Canada\n\n|\n\nCanada\n\n|\n\nQuit smoking\n\n|\n\ngeneral public\n\n|\n\nbackgrounders\n\n|\n\nHon.

While the promotion of the Vimal brand was entirely led by prominent Bollywood celebrities, former cricketers led the surrogate advertisements for Kamla Pasand,\" the study that was published in the British Medical Journal in May said.\n\nAlso Read | Tahsin Mohammed Jamshid Becomes First Indian-Origin Footballer To Be Picked in Qatar National Team After Being Included in Squad for FIFA World Cup 2026 Qualifiers.\n\nThe International Cricket Council's (ICC) Men's Cricket World Cup 2023 was hosted by India and officially broadcast on television channel Star Sports. Ten countries (Afghanistan, Australia, Bangladesh, England, India, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Pakistan, South Africa and Sri Lanka) participated in the 46-day tournament, which received over a trillion viewing minutes globally.\n\nThe study examined the surrogate SLT brand advertisements during the tournament.\n\nSmokeless tobacco is consumed by more than 35 crore people across 70 countries covering all World Health Organization (WHO) regions. India is a major producer and consumer of SLT products with more than 20 crore adult users and accounts for nearly 80 per cent of the SLT-attributable deaths globally.\n\nThe tobacco industry spends half a billion dollars annually on SLT product promotion.\n\nConsistent with Article 13 of the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC), India's Cigarettes and Other Tobacco Products Act, 2003 (COTPA) prohibits direct and indirect tobacco advertising, promotion and sponsorship (TAPS). Indirect and direct tobacco product promotion in sports is a tobacco-industry tactic to circumvent the TAPS restrictions.\n\nFive trained researchers collected data during the telecasts of the last 17 world cup matches, with a total streaming time of approximately 126 hours and an average stream time per match of 7:47 hours.\n\nThe data was entered into a spreadsheet using Microsoft Excel (V.2010) and analysed. All the advertisements were categorised as surrogate advertising for tobacco products.\n\nSurrogate advertisement is defined as using an established brand name associated with any product that is prohibited from being advertised under any law for the time being in force or under any rules or regulations made thereunder to promote another product.\n\nThe SLT industry primarily targeted matches where one of the five South Asian countries played, reinforcing why this region continues to be the SLT-use hotspot.\n\nIn 2023, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) released a list of brand categories, including tobacco, to be prohibited from applying for sponsorship.\n\nIn India, section 5 of the COTPA and the Cable Television Network Rules, 1995 clearly prohibit the display of any direct and indirect advertising of tobacco products in film and television. Since September 1, 2023, the prohibition has also been extended to cover OTT (over-the-top) platforms.\n\n\"Surrogate advertising of SLT products through international cricket tournaments helps the industry to promote its products in global markets, in violation of FCTC Article 13. National and international cricket and other sports boards should consider imposing a complete prohibition on any kind of direct and indirect brand association of tobacco products in all sports,\" the study said.", "source": {"uri": "latestly.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "LatestLY"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smokeless_tobacco", "type": "wiki", "score":

Kumar, who inaugurated the event, called tobacco a hugely powerful global industry running at the cost of people's health. \"It generally starts as a fashionable thing, as many youths see it as an 'in vogue' practice, which later becomes an addiction.

Psychiatrists stressed the behavioural impact of tobacco addiction. Speakers at the event also deliberated upon the current year's theme 'Protecting Children from Tobacco Industry Interference'.\n\nMarking the occasion, the Akanksha Charitable Organisation led by its general secretary Mardhala Ravibabu took out a rally from the Ambedkar statue to Gandhi statue in Renigunta town to spread awareness about the ill effects of tobacco products.\n\nRead Comments", "source": {"uri": "thehindu.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hindu"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tobacco"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tirupati", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tirupati"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Venkateswara_Institute_of_Medical_Sciences", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sri Venkateswara Institute of Medical Sciences"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tirumala_Tirupati_Devasthanams", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_No_Tobacco_Day", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World No Tobacco Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-being", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Well-being"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoking", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Smoking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Environment_Programme", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Nations Environment Programme"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Addiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lung"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Circulatory system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World Health Organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Secretary_of_the_Chinese_Communist_Party", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passive_smoking", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Passive smoking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco_control", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tobacco control"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_degradation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Environmental degradation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahatma_Gandhi", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mahatma Gandhi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nicotine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renigunta", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Renigunta"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Renigunta"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Health", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Health", "wgt": 51}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Specific_Substances", "label": "dmoz/Health/Specific Substances", "wgt": 48}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Specific_Substances/Tobacco", "label": "dmoz/Health/Specific Substances/Tobacco", "wgt": 50}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Women's_Health/Smoking", "label": "dmoz/Health/Women's Health/Smoking", "wgt": 34}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Tobacco/Cigarettes", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Tobacco/Cigarettes", "wgt": 46}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 86}], "image": "https://th-i.thgim.com/public/incoming/j0er12/article68237233.ece/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1200/10745_31_5_2024_19_39_13_1_IMG_20240531_WA0028.JPG", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9613244", "eventUri": "eng-9613244", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 110, "relevance": 1}

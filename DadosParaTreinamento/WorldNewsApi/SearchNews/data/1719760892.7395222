Over the last 15 years, Sonar has analyzed more than half a trillion lines of code across all industries and company sizes, resulting in a deep understanding of how code is written and managed. Sonar evaluates code for quality and security issues at two points \u2013 in the IDE with SonarLint, and in the Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline, with SonarQube. Sonar\u2019s offering is built on the principles of Clean Code, which is the belief that when code is consistent, intentional, adaptable, and responsible \u2013 meaning it is easy to understand and change, operates smoothly at runtime, and contains no technical debt \u2013 it results in software that is maintainable, reliable, of quality, and secure. \u201cCode is one of the most valuable assets in a digital economy. As companies adopt AI and move to the cloud, we want them to continue having seamless access to Sonar\u2019s Clean Code solutions as part of their DevOps environment in the cloud,\u201d said Harry Wang, VP of Strategic Partnerships & Head of Product Marketing at Sonar. \u201cSonarQube availability on Google Cloud Marketplace means that organizations can easily combine Google\u2019s AI capabilities with the familiar Clean Code solution that they trust, to evolve and accelerate software development safely and responsibly.\u201d", "summary": "Google Cloud Marketplace listing simplifies procurement, implementation, and management for efficient Clean Code delivery GENEVA &#038; AUSTIN, Texas &#8212; Sonar, the leader in Clean Code solutions, today announced that SonarQube is now available on Google Cloud Marketplace, enabling organizations to accelerate DevOps transformations in the cloud, modernize software development workflows, and deliver higher-quality, secure applications.

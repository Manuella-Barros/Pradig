He saw a huge piece of concrete lifted up on the East Federal side of the building.\n\nThe entire first floor, all the Federal Plaza side and East Federal side suffered extraordinary damage, the worst of it apparently near the northeast corner of the building, where concrete heaved up.\n\nFirefighters focused much of their attention near that area in the minutes after they arrived, moving two people out of the destruction of the first floor on gurneys.\n\nAnother man sat at the base of a monument on Federal Plaza in front of the exploded building with blood and dust on his face and people stopping to offer him water.\n\nThe 13-floor Realty Towers building has a Chase Bank branch on the first floor and apartments and condominiums on the upper floors.\n\nIt is not known what caused the explosion.\n\nThis is a developing story.

In 2024, the mobile gaming segment in Southeast Asia is projected to generate around US$3.14 billion (S$4.24 billion) in revenue, reflecting the market\u2019s strong potential. Amid this growth, game developers and publishers face the challenge of creating engaging games while ensuring seamless and secure in-game transactions. This is where digital payments provider PayPal comes into play, offering solutions that streamline the purchasing process while safeguarding user data. Not only does this enhance the gaming experience for the individual but it also helps gaming businesses to grow their global footprint. \u201cTo improve retention and revenue per player, in-game purchases must be intuitive,\u201d said Ms Pooja Sanan, head of sales (Southeast Asia) at PayPal. \u201cThis can be achieved through PayPal\u2019s secure one-click checkouts, allowing gamers to return to the action as quickly as possible without the hassle of navigating payment processes mid-game.\u201d She added: \u201cBy integrating PayPal\u2019s solutions, gaming companies gain access to a suite of tools and services, enabling them to offer a variety of payment methods used across the globe, with the flexibility to activate them as required in their target markets.\u201d TOP-NOTCH SECURITY MEASURES Security is a cornerstone of PayPal\u2019s solutions, especially in an industry with high transaction volumes and low transaction values, which can be appealing targets for fraud. In Southeast Asia, the independent monitoring group Cyber Scam Monitor reports significant growth in the online gaming and scam industries since 2010, with rapid expansion in countries like the Philippines, Cambodia, Myanmar and Laos. Closer to home, Singapore experienced 32 million digital fraud attacks in 2022, primarily targeting e-commerce payment transactions. This represents a 146 per cent increase from the previous year and is more than five times the global average. The rise of digital fraud demonstrates the need for sophisticated security solutions that reduce the risk of data breaches and scams. \u201cUsing a payment service like PayPal that supports vaulting and tokenisation can enhance the overall security posture for gaming merchants and their customers,\u201d said Ms Sanan. Another security measure implemented by PayPal for users is Passkeys \u2013 a method of securely logging into the PayPal platform using biometrics instead of a password. This enhances user peace of mind while completing online transactions. LEVERAGING PAYMENTS FOR EXPANSION One gaming company that has benefited from PayPal\u2019s solutions is global lifestyle brand Razer, which has developed a comprehensive ecosystem for gamers, including high-performance gaming hardware, software and services. The Razer Gold platform, a virtual credit system, allows gamers to securely buy digital content and services across various games and platforms. Gamers can use the virtual currency to pay for over 60,000 games and entertainment titles.", "summary": "PayPal empowers gaming companies to expand their businesses with its user-friendly features and advanced security protocols.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/advertorial/levelling-mobile-gaming-secure-and-convenient-payment-solutions-4376786", "image": "https://onecms-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/s--wMEyjwvc--/f_auto,q_auto/c_fill,g_auto,h_338,w_600/v1/mediacorp/cna/image/2024/05/31/bstudio_paypal_pooja_sanan.jpg?itok=UFyQ1TPY", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-18 01:15:00", "author": "Brand Studio", "authors": ["Brand Studio"], "language": "en", "source_country": "sg", "sentiment": 0.257}

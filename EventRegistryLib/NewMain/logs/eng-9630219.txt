Nine minutes later, they left.\n\nMore calls came is as they drove to the First Nation. They arrived in 28 minutes.\n\nAs the situation unfolded, RCMP decided to start up its division emergency operations centre, composed of senior management in Regina. But at times, says the report, it was unclear who was in charge.\n\nThe confusion was starkly apparent on Sept. 7, when Mounties were chasing Sanderson in a stolen truck. Two lead commanders made the call to force the vehicle off the road, but they did not loop in another commander in charge of overseeing tactics.\n\nThe report says it would have taken too long to bring everyone up to speed in that moment, so the move was justified. But it recommends next time RCMP clearly communicate that the division emergency operations centre has overarching authority.\n\nOther communications lapses were also found during the manhunt, which took place on the ground and in the air.\n\nThe report says aircrews were inundated with requests from officers, and pilots weren't sure who they should be taking direction from. This resulted in them flying \"with little purpose.\"\n\nAt one point on Sept. 7, when Sanderson was spotted in the town of Wakaw, all aircraft were down refuelling.\n\n\"This caused a delay at a critical time and perhaps highlighted one of the key issues during this incident,\" the report says.\n\nThese issues could be addressed by having a flight co-ordinator to manage pilots, says the report.\n\nIn response to the report, Mounties said they have since changed procedures and will now assign an \"air boss.\"\n\nThe report adds missed communication also happened when some call centre tips on Sanderson's whereabouts did not reach decision-makers.\n\nThe RCMP said in future crises it will embed a criminal analyst and major crimes investigator in its call centre.\n\nIt also said it has since implemented a new command structure for large incidents, including better technology to allow investigators to communicate in real time.\n\nThe force said it has also purchased radios that work better on James Smith Cree Nation and in the surrounding area.\n\nThe report lauded Mounties for helping in the aftermath of the killings, allowing families to grieve and hold ceremonies before bodies were removed for autopsies.

Myles Sanderson killed 11 people and injured 17 others on the James Smith Cree Nation and in the nearby village of Weldon on Sept. 4, 2022. He died of a cocaine overdose three days later, shortly after he was taken into police custody.\n\nOn a broad level, the report didn't identify any \"common underlying circumstance\" that significantly impeded the RCMP's ability to manage its response. It did, however, find areas where the RCMP can make improvements.\n\nAppropriate response time\n\nThe report says it took 37 minutes for officers to arrive at the scene after the initial 911 call. One officer had to wait for his partner to arrive at the Melfort RCMP detachment, which the report says was the correct course of action, before they drove 40 kilometres to the First Nation. The response time was appropriate, the report says, and the call for dispatch \"could not have been streamlined more than it already was.\"\n\nNeed for two police cars\n\nThe report says RCMP should look at whether the two officers who first arrived at James Smith should have taken two vehicles instead of one. It says an additional car may have been helpful, as they decided to split up after getting there. The report says deploying the most members and vehicles possible to a scene is ideal but not always possible in rural areas.\n\nClearer chain of command\n\nAt times it was unclear who was in charge of overall command, the report says. During a pursuit of the stolen truck Sanderson was in, two lead commanders made the call to force the vehicle off the road. But they didn't loop in another commander who was in charge of overseeing tactics.\n\n\"Air boss\" required\n\nThere was a lapse in communication when pilots with the police air unit didn't know who they should be taking direction from. Aircrews were inundated with requests, which had them flying \"with little purpose.\" The report says the RCMP needs to have one flight co-ordinator. Mounties say they have since changed procedures and will assign an \"air boss.\"\n\nPlane needs fixing\n\nA Saskatchewan RCMP plane was not operational during the manhunt for Sanderson. A plane from the Saskatoon Police Service was used instead. The report says RCMP plane upgrades need approval from the Saskatchewan government. It says Mounties hope progress can be made in updating the plane.\n\nSome tips not relayed\n\nPeople called in sightings of Sanderson in the town of Wakaw during the manhunt, but the report says some of that information never made its way to those in charge. One tip came from a caller who knew Sanderson. The report recommends a closer link between the police emergency operations and the call centre.\n\nVictims services team effective\n\nOfficers allowed families to grieve and hold ceremonies before the victims' bodies were removed for autopsies. Sweats and smudges took place in the community, and officers kept victims up to date on the status of their homes that required restoration.\n\nSupport for victims services staff\n\nThe report recommends victims services employees have access to the same wellness programs as officers. It says those who helped victims felt burned out and had little support. The RCMP says it will make sure these supports are in place.\n\nRegular communication with First Nation\n\nThe jury at a coroner's inquest into the deaths recommended RCMP meet regularly with James Smith Cree Nation leadership and attend community events. The RCMP says it meets with the First Nation on a quarterly basis to discuss crime trends and promote safety.\n\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published June 6, 2024.", "source": {"uri": "brandonsun.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Brandon Sun"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Canadian_Mounted_Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Royal Canadian Mounted Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saskatchewan", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Saskatchewan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Saskatchewan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_stabbing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mass stabbing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Smith_Cree_Nation", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "James Smith Cree Nation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_overdose", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Drug overdose"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cocaine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cocaine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weldon,_Saskatchewan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Weldon, Saskatchewan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Weldon, Saskatchewan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regina,_Saskatchewan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Regina, Saskatchewan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Regina, Saskatchewan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melfort,_Saskatchewan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Melfort, Saskatchewan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Melfort, Saskatchewan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Nations_in_Canada", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "First Nations in Canada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime_boss", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Crime boss"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhunt_(law_enforcement)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manhunt (law enforcement)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_car", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Police car"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wakaw", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wakaw"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wakaw"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saskatoon_Police_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Saskatoon Police Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics_of_Saskatchewan", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Politics of Saskatchewan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coroner", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coroner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Canadian_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Canadian Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autopsy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Autopsy"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law_Enforcement", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law Enforcement", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Major_Companies/Company_Information", "label": "dmoz/Business/Major Companies/Company Information", "wgt": 15}], "image": "https://www.brandonsun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/11/squaresun_web.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9630219", "eventUri": "eng-9630219", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Regina, Saskatchewan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.02745098039215688, "wgt": 207, "relevance": 1}

Sign in You are logged in Switch accounts\n\nSanderson, 32, died of a cocaine overdose shortly after he was taken into custody.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nOn Thursday, RCMP released a report, conducted by Mounties in Alberta, assessing the police response in 2022 and recommending improvements.\n\n\"On a broad level, the review team did not identify any common underlying circumstance that significantly impeded the RCMP's ability to manage the response to the (James Smith Cree Nation and Weldon) event,\" says the report.\n\n\"At the same time, certain areas for growth were identified with the underlying purpose of enhancing responses to future, similar situations.\"\n\nThe report's team included an observer from the Federation of Sovereign Indigenous Nations, which represents 74 First Nations Saskatchewan.\n\nJames Smith Cree Nation had raised concerns that officers should have responded faster to the stabbing rampage, but the report concluded the response time was appropriate and the first call for dispatch \"could not have been streamlined more than it already was.\"\n\nThe report says the situation unfolded quickly after the first report of the attacks reached the Melfort RCMP detachment before 6 a.m. on Sept. 4, 2022.\n\nOne officer was there but had to wait for his partner to arrive at the station. Nine minutes later, they left.\n\nMore calls came is as they drove to the First Nation. They arrived in 28 minutes.\n\nAs the situation unfolded, RCMP decided to start up its division emergency operations centre, composed of senior management in Regina. But at times, says the report, it was unclear who was in charge.\n\nThe confusion was starkly apparent on Sept. 7, when Mounties were chasing Sanderson in a stolen truck. Two lead commanders made the call to force the vehicle off the road, but they did not loop in another commander in charge of overseeing tactics.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nThe report says it would have taken too long to bring everyone up to speed in that moment, so the move was justified. But it recommends next time RCMP clearly communicate that the division emergency operations centre has overarching authority.\n\nOther communications lapses were also found during the manhunt, which took place on the ground and in the air.\n\nThe report says aircrews were inundated with requests from officers, and pilots weren't sure who they should be taking direction from. This resulted in them flying \"with little purpose.\"\n\nAt one point on Sept. 7, when Sanderson was spotted in the town of Wakaw, all aircraft were down refuelling.\n\n\"This caused a delay at a critical time and perhaps highlighted one of the key issues during this incident,\" the report says.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nThese issues could be addressed by having a flight co-ordinator to manage pilots, says the report.\n\nIn response to the report, Mounties said they have since changed procedures and will now assign an \"air boss.\"\n\nThe report adds missed communication also happened when some call centre tips on Sanderson's whereabouts did not reach decision-makers.\n\nThe RCMP said in future crises it will embed a criminal analyst and major crimes investigator in its call centre.\n\nIt also said it has since implemented a new command structure for large incidents, including better technology to allow investigators to communicate in real time.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nThe force said it has also purchased radios that work better on James Smith Cree Nation and in the surrounding area.\n\nThe report lauded Mounties for helping in the aftermath of the killings, allowing families to grieve and hold ceremonies before bodies were removed for autopsies. Sweats and smudges also took place in the community, and officers kept victims up to date on the status of their homes that required restoration.\n\nThe report says there were times when bodies were exposed to onlookers. RCMP have since purchased tents and portable walls that can be used to block viewing.\n\nHowever, families have said they believe more can be done to improve relationships with James Smith Cree Nation, recommending RCMP attend events and hold regular meetings with leaders.\n\nIn response, RCMP said the Melfort detachment tries its best to make event appearances but has a small number of staff. It said it's committed to helping the community recover.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nThere have been several others reviews into the stabbings.\n\nA report on why Sanderson was free on statutory release at the time, despite a record of violent assaults, found there was no way to have foreseen his rampage but called for more time for parole board staff to conduct assessments.\n\nA coroner's inquest into the attacks recommended RCMP fully staff specialized teams and improve their relationship and communication with James Smith Cree Nation.\n\nAnother inquest that determined Sanderson died from an accidental overdose while in custody urged more training for police on high-speed pursuits.\n\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published June 6,

Eleven people died and 17 more were injured.\n\nEleven recommendations were directed at RCMP at an inquest in January with respect to the 11 deaths at the hands of Sanderson. The recommendations are meant to improve how RCMP handled the mass casualty event, including the manhunt for Sanderson.\n\nThe jury made three recommendations for RCMP during the inquest in January, with eight additional recommendations coming from the inquest coroner.\n\nPublic alerts were distributed during the mass casualty evening in September 2022, one of which included an incorrect photo of Sanderson, sparking recommendations from the jury and inquest coroner to implement technologies that will ensure officers have access to the most current photo of a suspect.\n\nRCMP said moving forward, a system will be implemented that will ensure all subject photos have an identifying occurrence number showing when the photo was taken.\n\nIn the next fiscal year, RCMP said officers will also be able to pull from government databases, including SGI, police RMS and private source photos from in-car workstations.\n\nThe inquest coroner recommended that RCMP take all reasonable measures to ensure that the warrant enforcement and suppression team (WEST), crime reduction team (CRT) and Saskatchewan trafficking response team (STRT) be fully staffed and that the divisions also consider expansion.\n\nRCMP said the divisions are facing vacancies between 20 and 40 per cent and that any expansion of the divisions would require more resources from the province.\n\nCurrent projections are for 1,280 new RCMP applicants to attend training during the 2024-25 fiscal year, followed by 1,600 new applicants for the following two years.\n\nRCMP noted that asking for expansions within the divisions wouldn't be feasible considering the current vacancies.\n\nMyles Sanderson was considered unlawfully at large for months leading up to the killings after breaking the conditions of his statutory release.\n\nA program is used that scores and ranks offenders who are considered unlawfully at large or have outstanding warrants for violent offences issued by RCMP. Domestic violence is currently not considered on the prioritization matrix.\n\nThe RCMP said it is exploring adding domestic violence to the prioritization matrix, but said it is a manual task and the labour is intense. Until a more efficient process is found, each offender will be investigated manually and a flag placed on their record to indicate a history of domestic violence.\n\nA Top 10 Most Wanted list was distributed to the lead officer of the two warrant enforcement and suppression teams on a monthly basis but since March 2024 the list has also been distributed to the detachment officers in the offender's area, including warrant status and the severity of their crimes.\n\nMoving forward, RCMP said it is also developing monthly person of interest reports that will rank violence offenders based on their past 18 months' occurrence history.\n\nRCMP said this practice is already addressed in national policy but added that the enhancements to the Most Violent Offender and Most Wanted lists will allow for more collaboration between RCMP and First Nations leadership.\n\nWithin the next month, RCMP said detachment commanders can expect instruction on when they can have discussions with First Nations leaders to make sure they are aware when a violent offender is affiliated with or living in their community. This is to be done after commanders review the most recent list of offenders with active warrants or currently at large.\n\nSanderson died on Sept. 7, 2022, of a cocaine overdose shortly after being brought into RCMP custody.\n\nAn inquest into his death was held in Saskatoon in late February 2024, where the jury provided three recommendations to RCMP after watching and listening to detailed accounts of his arrest.\n\nDuring the inquest into Sanderson's death, the jury watched dashcam footage from Const. Heidi Marshall as she spun Sanderson's stolen vehicle off the road, resulting in his capture.\n\nAccording to RCMP leadership, Marshall's execution of the pit manoeuvre was flawless, despite her lack of training in the tactic.\n\nThe jury recommended that officers be trained in the pit manoeuvre but the RCMP said conducting the move above 80 kilometres an hour is considered an application of lethal force and dangerous to the public in the area.\n\n\"The expected outcome is the death of the driver,\" the report said. \"These maneuvers are only considered in situations where exigent circumstances involving danger to life or grievous bodily harm exist, and may only be utilized when approved by a pursuit supervisor following a complete risk assessment in consideration of the totality of the situation.\"\n\nRCMP said the Advanced Emergency Vehicle Operators Course is currently undergoing a national update that will look at the potential of including the dangerous move in officer driving training.\n\nDuring the inquest, the jury watched RCMP pull Sanderson out of the vehicle he had stolen after he had been spun off the road and into the ditch. Sanderson was concealed by the airbag and officers said it was hard to tell if he was holding any weapons in his hands.\n\nRCMP said extraction techniques are already addressed through formal officer training, including safely pulling a suspect from a vehicle during a high-risk event.\n\nThe current criteria for a high-speed pursuit are addressed by national policy, according to RCMP, and authorizing a pursuit is only done after a risk assessment is done based on the evolving situation.\n\n\"This revised policy seeks to provide a less restrictive ability to justify the necessity for a continued pursuit,\" the report said. \"Included in this policy revision was the implementation of the mandatory Emergency Vehicle Operations on-line training course which includes modules on conducting and applying pursuit related risk assessments.\"\n\nAfter an extensive review of its own response to the event, RCMP compiled a detailed report on actions taken by officers during the three-day event and looked at areas the organization could improve its efforts.\n\nDuring the early hours of the massacre, only two RCMP officers were patrolling the First Nation. The situation was unfolding rapidly, and the two constables split up for a period of time, putting them at a tactical disadvantage, according to the report.\n\nAt times, the officers were approximately 12 kilometres apart and the reception on James Smith Cree Nation was poor.\n\nRCMP noted there is no current national policy guidance on the issue of one- or two-person patrols.\n\nAs a result, the RCMP is considering additional training around one- or two-person patrol vehicle response, including the delegation of resources and discussions surrounding risk when only two officers are able to respond to an initial scene.\n\n\"The most obvious solution would be to always deploy the maximum number of members with the maximum number of patrol vehicles possible; however, the reality is this scenario is seldom available in rural policing environments today,\" the report said.\n\nRCMP also recommended the detachment commander encourage other officers to attend James Smith Cree Nation regularly for patrol or other events to solidify relationships within the community.\n\nDuring its review of the RCMP major crimes branch and its response to the homicides, the RCMP recommended providing more resources to forensic identification services for scenes of this magnitude.\n\nDuring the event on James Smith Cree Nation, forensic identification services is responsible for processing more than 40 separate crime scenes and more than 700 exhibits. The unit was also required to attend 10 autopsies.\n\nAs a result, RCMP recommended exploring the possibility of leveraging civilian resources to help process exhibits and having someone stationed permanently at the exhibit room.\n\nIn respect to the crime scenes, RCMP said it will consider purchasing inflatable tents or additional fabric walls for forensic identification services to protect evidence and provide more dignity to the deceased while processing scenes.\n\nThe RCMP also said it is interested in improving communication between tip intake co-ordinators and apprehension teams to assist with the delegation of resources.\n\nRCMP said due to the tragic community impact brought on by the event, improvements can be made to victim services.\n\nRCMP recommended training additional members and supervisors in the specialty of mass casualty events in the areas of deployment and reporting structures, documentation processes and the function of family liaisons.\n\nRCMP will consider generating a document to be distributed among RCMP divisions outlining cultural considerations so appropriate and respectful support can be offered to victim families.\n\nVictim \"support kits\" were also recommended, including documents, pre-printed support pamphlets in multiple languages and program referral links.\n\nRCMP noted that two separate reviews are being conducted related to the preventability of the event by Correctional Service Canada and the Parole Board of Canada. The reviews will look at Sanderson's statutory release and community supervision.\n\nThe RCMP said it will review the reports when they are available.", "source": {"uri": "globalnews.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "Global News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coroner", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Coroner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Canadian_Mounted_Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Royal Canadian Mounted Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inquest", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inquest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domestic_violence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Domestic violence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saskatchewan", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Saskatchewan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Saskatchewan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Nations_in_Canada", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "First Nations in Canada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Smith_Cree_Nation", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "James Smith Cree Nation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statute", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Statute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiscal_year", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fiscal year"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhunt_(law_enforcement)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manhunt (law enforcement)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provinces_and_territories_of_Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Provinces and territories of Canada"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mass murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_assessment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Risk assessment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Database"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wanted_poster", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wanted poster"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FBI_Ten_Most_Wanted_Fugitives", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FBI Ten Most Wanted Fugitives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadly_force", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Deadly force"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dashcam", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dashcam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Person_of_interest", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Person of interest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_overdose", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Drug overdose"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cocaine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cocaine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grievous_bodily_harm", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Grievous bodily harm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saskatoon", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Saskatoon"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Saskatoon"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parole_Board_of_Canada", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Parole Board of Canada"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Sex_Offenses", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Sex Offenses", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Violence_and_Abuse", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Violence and Abuse", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Research", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Research", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://globalnews.ca/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/teepee.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&w=720&h=379&crop=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9630219", "eventUri": "eng-9630219", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1529411764705882, "wgt": 166, "relevance": 1}

As a result, the review does not incorporate details heard during the pair of coroner's inquests.\n\nThe report released on Thursday highlights how the Mounties' initial response was found to be appropriate.\n\nTwo police officers, Const. Tanner Maynard and Const. Dave Miller, were dispatched after the initial 911 call was received.\n\nMiller, who was on call, took nine minutes to arrive at the Melfort detachment and then leave with Maynard in the same police vehicle. The review found this was the only delay in response and that it was reasonable.\n\nAt that point, the only information the pair had was that there had been a single stabbing, with the suspects having departed from the scene. However, the nature of the call required Maynard to have backup with him.\n\nBoth officers were informed there were more crime scenes and more alleged victims as they travelled to James Smith Cree Nation.\n\nThe police vehicle travelled at speeds up to 178 km/hr and it took the officers 28 minutes to arrive at James Smith Cree Nation after leaving the Melfort detachment.\n\nMaynard and Miller separated after arriving at the first of what would eventually be 40 crime scenes.\n\nThe decision to separate, with Maynard moving on to another crime scene and Miller staying behind to provide first aid, is criticized in the report even while their work is described as commendable.\n\nThe two officers were put at a tactical disadvantage, since there was only one vehicle and they were roughly 12 kilometres apart, the review said.\n\nNeither Miller nor Maynard could back each other up if required, and the portable radio reception in the area of James Smith Cree Nation was poor, so they may not have been able to easily contact each other.\n\nThe report recommended addressing the issue of whether officers should travel together or separately. At the time of the James Smith Cree Nation stabbings, there was no national policy or guidance on the subject, the review highlighted.\n\nThat's why the first recommendation in the review is for a policy be developed.\n\nThe Saskatchewan RCMP have created a divisional policy that requires each detachment to conduct a risk assessment on whether two-person or one-person patrol vehicles are viable for each shift. It's not clear whether a national policy has been developed.\n\nAnother recommendation made in the review is for the RCMP to encourage its officers to make their presence known in the James Smith Cree Nation.\n\nThose visits could be for a patrol or for specific events, to create a relationship with the community, according to the review.\n\nAn unspecified number of residents of James Smith Cree Nation reported a belief that if an officer had been posted to the community, there would have been fewer victims.\n\nThe review noted that type of service \"was not an option\" and went beyond the scope of the review, but enough people voiced concerns about the lack of visibility of the RCMP in the community that the recommendation was made.\n\nThe Saskatchewan RCMP's response was that although officers do try to attend events at the First Nation, the limited number of officers poses a challenge.\n\nThe Melfort detachment has 16 officers responsible for patrolling 6,216 square kilometres, including one city, eight towns and 11 rural municipalities, as well as James Smith Cree Nation.\n\nThe officer in charge of the RCMP's response immediately identified there was a need for a plane capable of searching for and locating the suspects.\n\nHowever, the Mounties were forced to rely on the plane operated by the Saskatoon Police Service.\n\nThe RCMP has three planes in Saskatchewan, two of which are only used for transporting personnel and cargo. The other plane, a Cessna, was not operational at the time of the James Smith Cree Nation search.\n\nInstead, air assets from other RCMP divisions were called in to assist.\n\nThe report notes that upgrades are needed, but any upgrades to the fleet have to be approved by the Government of Saskatchewan, which leases the vehicles.\n\n\"Although there is a recognized need to upgrade mission equipment and remedy the issues preventing the use of certain assets ... the provincial government seems reluctant to supply the funds,\" the report said.\n\nAlthough the air services unit has submitted multiple business cases to the province for upgrading the Cessna, it has so far been unsuccessful.\n\n\"All of this puts F Division Air Services in a difficult position as far as being able to efficiently assist with operations,\" the report said.\n\nThe RCMP review also provides details on why a public alert was issued for Regina on Sept. 4, reporting that the suspects may have been travelling on Arcola Avenue in the city.\n\nThe public had been told in previous alerts that the suspect or suspects were travelling in a Nissan Rogue.\n\nThe review reveals that a tip was reported to the Regina Police Service advising that a black Nissan Rogue had been spotted driving in Regina. However, in this case, a plate number for the vehicle was not relayed to the 911 operator.\n\nBut since the plate number for the vehicle was assumed by the operator, it was forwarded as part of the tip.\n\nThe credibility of the tip was believed high enough that the public alert was issued and an RCMP helicopter from Alberta was briefly rerouted to Regina instead of James Smith Cree Nation.\n\nThe review said it was just a \"momentary shift of focus\" but that it \"did not divert the ongoing efforts\" in the Weldon and James Smith Cree Nation area.\n\nThe report's conclusions are being welcomed by Jason Stonechild, an independent observer who served as a liaison with the James Smith Cree Nation community and provided cultural guidance.\n\nStonechild is the executive director of justice for the Federation of Sovereign Indigenous Nations, which represents 74 First Nations in Saskatchewan.\n\nStonechild is also a retired deputy police chief of the Prince Albert Police Service.\n\nIn comments included in the report, Stonechild said the team leading the review was \"highly competent\" and \"impartial.\"\n\n\"I believe the findings contained within this report are

(Lisa Schick/980 CJME)\n\nAbout three months after a pair of inquests into the 2022 stabbing attacks on the James Smith Cree Nation and in Weldon, the Saskatchewan RCMP is responding to recommendations made by the juries and presiding coroners.\n\nThere were 14 recommendations altogether after the inquest into the 11 killings Myles Sanderson perpetrated on the James Smith Cree Nation and in Weldon, though some overlapped with each other. Eleven recommendations were directed at RCMP by the jury and presiding coroner Blaine Beaven, with the goal of preventing similar deaths in the future.\n\nIn the second inquest, which looked into the circumstances surrounding the in-custody death of Sanderson, three recommendations were made to the RCMP by the jury.\n\nAssistant commissioner Rhonda Blackmore, commanding officer of the Saskatchewan RCMP, said the police force would take a look at the recommendations and see if they could be implemented.\n\nAt the end of May, Blackmore sent the RCMP's response to the province's chief coroner. In many cases, the RCMP agreed with the recommendations and was already working toward implementing them.\n\nOne recommendation was to prominently date photos of suspects, as an RCMP officer had spoken with Damien Sanderson, Myles' brother, just ahead of the killings, but the photo of Damien the officer saw was several years old and badly out of date.\n\nThe RCMP said in its response that it agreed with the recommendation and was working on processes around photos. In the future, the Mounties said photos will include an identifying occurrence number, the detachment responsible for getting the photo and the date the picture was obtained. It's also working on different ways to view and utilize photos, including in a new mobile app.\n\nThe RCMP said it is also working on a recommendation to provide a list and details of the 60 highest-priority targets of its Warrant Enforcement Suppression Team to detachment commanders on a regular basis. The Mounties said the team now sends a list of the most violent offenders in a detachment area to each detachment commander.\n\nThe RCMP said it also already has processes and guidelines in place to let leaders of a First Nation know when a member is a most-wanted target - the leaders of the James Smith First Nation have said they should have been informed that Myles Sanderson was at large.\n\nThe RCMP said it was already meeting other recommendations.\n\nRegarding a recommendation that police review the criteria for a high-speed pursuit, the RCMP said it has national policy that addresses this, and its operational manual got a complete re-write in 2020 and was further enhanced in 2023. The response said there's no longer specific criteria for a high-speed pursuit, and instead the situation is continually evaluated.\n\nAnother recommendation called for the Mounties to add more training around enhanced extraction techniques for arrests, but the RCMP said officers already have the appropriate training. The response said any further work on the techniques would have to be developed at a national level.\n\nOther responses got a little more complicated.\n\nA number of the recommendations were around providing more resources to, and even expanding, the RCMP's specialized response teams like the Warrant Enforcement Suppression Team, Crime Reduction Team and Saskatchewan Trafficking Response Team.\n\nThe RCMP said it agrees with those recommendations in principle, but said staffing is a challenge. Vacancies on the teams range between 20 and 40 per cent, and while the RCMP is working on staffing up and said recruitment projections over the next few years will help, funding for the teams is provided by the province and the RCMP won't ask for more funding to expand while vacancies remain so high.\n\nAnother of the recommendations was to include repeat domestic violence offenders in the matrix used by the warrant team and rank those individuals higher. The RCMP again agreed with the recommendation in principle, but explained that it would have to be a manual addition to the system which would be complicated, take significant time, and has limitations.\n\nIn the meantime, the RCMP said it has a new template for the monthly most-wanted list which adds a flag to those with a history of domestic violence - it doesn't rank them higher, but does help officers decide which offenders to concentrate on.\n\nThe RCMP's response amounted to a maybe on a recommendation that the RCMP include the PIT maneuver - the precision immobilization technique which was used to get Myles Sanderson's truck off the road before he was arrested - in mandatory enhanced driver training.\n\nThe RCMP said the Advanced Emergency Vehicle Operators Course is going through a national update, and the police force will look at potentially including an optional module on the PIT maneuver.\n\nBlackmore and other Saskatchewan RCMP leaders are expected to speak to media on Thursday morning to answer questions about the recommendations and the RCMP's responses.\n\nThey're also expected to publicly present an internal review the RCMP completed on its response to the mass stabbing.", "source": {"uri": "cjme.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "980 CJME"}, "authors": [{"uri": "lisa_schick@cjme.com", "name": "Lisa Schick", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Smith_Cree_Nation", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "James Smith Cree Nation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coroner", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Coroner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Canadian_Mounted_Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Royal Canadian Mounted Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inquest", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inquest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weldon,_Saskatchewan", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Weldon, Saskatchewan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Weldon, Saskatchewan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saskatchewan", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Saskatchewan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Saskatchewan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Nations_in_Canada", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "First Nations in Canada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warrant_(law)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Warrant (law)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mobile app"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PIT_maneuver", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "PIT maneuver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provinces_and_territories_of_Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Provinces and territories of Canada"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domestic_violence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Domestic violence"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law_Enforcement", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law Enforcement", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Domestic_Violence", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Domestic Violence", "wgt": 9}], "image": "https://media-cdn.socastsrm.com/wordpress/wp-content/blogs.dir/648/files/2024/06/blackmore-884x512.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9630219", "eventUri": "eng-9630219", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2235294117647059, "wgt": 162, "relevance": 1}

THE CANADIAN PRESS/Heywood Yu\n\nAn internal review on the RCMP's response to the mass murder on James Smith Cree Nation (JSCN) and in Weldon is being released today, with a summary of 36 recommendations and effective practices Mounties used throughout the event and in its aftermath.\n\nOn Sept. 4, 2022, Myles Sanderson killed 11 and injured 18 others in one of Canada's worst mass murder events. The search for Sanderson led to a three-day province-wide manhunt and culminated with a high speed chase near Rosthern on Sept. 7. Sanderson's vehicle was stopped with a PIT maneuver and he died from an overdose shortly after his arrest.\n\nThese types of reports are conducted after mass casualty events to determine what lessons were learned, whether the RCMP provided an effective response and identify areas for recommended improvements. Similar reports have been created for the mass shooting incident in Moncton, New Brunswick in 2014 and a report is still in progress for the mass casualty incident in Portapique, Nova Scotia in 2020.\n\nThe areas recognized in the report included the initial response, the command structure, the major crimes unit response, air services, strategic communications, operational communications, mass casualty and victim response and pre-event intelligence.\n\nThe review team consisted of four brass from Alberta RCMP and included 24 investigative advisers from policing agencies across the country. Jason Stonechild, the executive director of justice of the Federation of Sovereign Indigenous Nations (FSIN) and retired deputy police chief of the Prince Albert Police Service was appointed as an independent observer and liaison to the JSCN community. He also provided cultural guidance to the review team.\n\nReception issues\n\nPoor radio reception was a concern brought up by virtually all members interviewed for the review. Members on scene were plagued by poor radio communication from the outset of the event, which was both a safety concern and hampered police efforts to locate victims and the suspect.\n\nThere were incidents on the James Smith Cree Nation where Mounties had to leave a residence or the victims they were attending to so they could stand outside for their radio to work effectively. Or, they had to rely on their cellphones. Later on, a piece of equipment was delivered to the area which enhanced radio coverage. The Saskatchewan RCMP relies on the provincial telecommunications network for radio communication and its known there are areas with poor reception, including on JSCN. For that reason, the review recommended the RCMP work with the province and band council to address radio communication issues. This was an issue that also came up in the Moncton case and its subsequent review.\n\nAnother technological issue officers faced is the mapping software in their vehicles was not working properly, which led to dispatchers not knowing where officers were stationed. It was recommended the mapping system be upgraded to share members' movements.\n\nCommand Structure\n\nWith so many units, agencies and resources arriving on scene (549 police resources), issues with command structure led to some gaps in communication and location of resources. The report noted this issue didn't lead to any issues with the outcome of the police response, but that there should be a 'crimes in action protocol' and command structure chart created for consistency and for the staff to know who is commanding them. It was also recommended technology be used to link all staff so all commanders are aware and up to date.\n\nA key moment for this uncertainty was on Sept. 7 when the suspect vehicle was seen driving over 140 km/h the wrong way down the highway. During this time, an inspector and Chief Superintendent Teddy Munro were receiving information from a member monitoring the pursuit. The two supervisors decided to issue the directive to take the suspect vehicle off the road. Munro asked for his direction to \"use whatever force necessary to stop the suspect vehicle\" be transmitted over the radio. The member who issued the directive was confused because they believed it was the role of another officer to delegate.\n\nThere were other recommendations which suggested adding dedicated scribes to teams to handle the administrative tasks and take meeting minutes to ensure proper communication.\n\nAir Services\n\nThe command structure also lacked a point person, known as an 'air boss' for the planes used to assist with this investigation. Because there was no flight coordinator or a single point of contact, it led to all commanders of different units contacting pilots directly. This confusion led to planes \"essentially flying with little purpose\" leading to the recommendation that in future major events an air boss must be identified early on. Because the planes were flying regularly, when the suspect was identified to be in Wakaw on Sept. 7, all three were on the ground refuelling, which delayed the search.\n\nWhile it was not a recommendation, it was highlighted in the report that one of the Cesna aircrafts stationed in Saskatchewan was not operational during the event and the RCMP had to borrow a plane from Saskatoon Police. The federal government does not own the planes; they are leased by the Saskatchewan government.\n\n\"Although there is a recognized need to upgrade mission equipment and remedy the issues preventing the use of certain assets in order to resume those duties in support of frontline policing units, the provincial government seems reluctant to supply the funds,\" the report said. \"F Division air services have submitted multiple business cases to the province and now, following several high profile cases, are hopeful of making progress. All this puts Division Air Services in a difficult position as far as being able to efficiently assist with operations.\"\n\nEvidence\n\nDue to the magnitude of this file, there were over 700 exhibits processed and over 40 separate crime scenes, including buildings and vehicles. Exhibit storage overwhelmed the nearby Melfort detachment and eventually had to be split between Prince Albert and exhibit storage in Saskatoon. Adding to the complexity, some of the crime scenes were far apart. Because so many officers were working on this file, it was recommended to explore the possibility of having civilian employees act as exhibit custodians to process evidence.\n\nDispatch\n\nCivilian employees were also discussed in the report when it came to dispatchers and call takers employed by the RCMP. It was noted there are 15 staff vacancies in the Operational Communications Centre and only one of eight bilingual positions filled. Report writers pointed out that pay for the RCMP is significantly lower than in municipal services. During the incident, the centre received over 2,600 phone calls. Due to the workload (and radio communication issues) dispatchers abandoned doing safety check-ins with front line officers. Dispatchers from Regina Police Service were also brought in to assist with the high workload.\n\nIt was noted some calls were not forwarded to specific teams working on apprehending the suspect. For that reason, the report writers recommended that during major incidents, a major crimes investigator, a crime analyst and a dedicated dispatch supervisor work together to analyze calls in real time to determine trends or patterns.\n\nCultural Awareness & Victim Services\n\nThe number of victims in this case was numerous and family liaison officers were assigned to promote direct contact to victims and their families to help explain policing efforts, deliver next of kin notifications, and keep everyone informed. The report noted Indigenous Policing Services was crucial at fostering communication between investigators and the James Smith community.\n\nDrawing from this event, it was noted members displayed cultural awareness for the needs from the community, specifically when it came to prayer circles and smudging as ceremonies for the deceased before their transport. It was also ensured that cleaning of various scenes also included coordinating cultural processes such as smudging the home or burning items covered in blood.\n\nThese takeaways led report writers to recommend the Saskatchewan RCMP create a 'legacy document' to be disseminated to outline various cultural considerations used to provide proper support for victim families.\n\nA separate recommendation was written to address keeping family liaisons and media relations in contact for scheduled media announcements as Damian Sanderson's family learned of his death from a media report.\n\nMyles Sanderson's Criminal History and Parole Decision\n\nMyles Sanderson's criminal history was highlighted in the report and consisted of over 160 police interactions from 1996 to 2022. In his extensive criminal record, he had over 10 assault convictions and a lengthy history of violating court orders. At the time of the mass murder, Sanderson was wanted on a warrant for violating his parole release conditions.\n\nSanderson's parole officer did not recommend for his release into the community as he was considered a high risk to reoffend. He breached his release conditions 19 days after his release from prison. He breached a second time and that's what triggered his warrant. No cautions or flags were entered on Sanderson's profile on the RCMP database.\n\nThe parole officer spoke with Melfort RCMP in July 2022 regarding Sanderson and his warrant and was assured by members that they would search for him. The report noted there was no RCMP record related to this contact found on any of the police computer systems.\n\nThe report made two recommendations for the RCMP to review the findings from the

Myles Sanderson killed 11 people and injured 17 others on the James Smith Cree Nation and in the nearby village of Weldon on Sept. 4, 2022. He died of a cocaine overdose three days later, shortly after he was taken into police custody.\n\nHere are some of key points from the report:\n\n\u00d7\n\nAlready a Subscriber? Sign in You are logged in Switch accounts\n\nNo fundamental issues\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nOn a broad level, the report didn't identify any \"common underlying circumstance\" that significantly impeded the RCMP's ability to manage its response. It did, however, find areas where the RCMP can make improvements.\n\nAppropriate response time\n\nThe report says it took 37 minutes for officers to arrive at the scene after the initial 911 call. One officer had to wait for his partner to arrive at the Melfort RCMP detachment, which the report says was the correct course of action, before they drove 40 kilometres to the First Nation. The response time was appropriate, the report says, and the call for dispatch \"could not have been streamlined more than it already was.\"\n\nNeed for two police cars\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nThe report says RCMP should look at whether the two officers who first arrived at James Smith should have taken two vehicles instead of one. It says an additional car may have been helpful, as they decided to split up after getting there. The report says deploying the most members and vehicles possible to a scene is ideal but not always possible in rural areas.\n\nYou might be interested in Peterborough And Area News Dec 31, 1969 Peterborough And Area News Dec 31, 1969 ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nClearer chain of command\n\nAt times it was unclear who was in charge of overall command, the report says. During a pursuit of the stolen truck Sanderson was in, two lead commanders made the call to force the vehicle off the road. But they didn't loop in another commander who was in charge of overseeing tactics.\n\n\"Air boss\" required\n\nThere was a lapse in communication when pilots with the police air unit didn't know who they should be taking direction from. Aircrews were inundated with requests, which had them flying \"with little purpose.\" The report says the RCMP needs to have one flight co-ordinator. Mounties say they have since changed procedures and will assign an \"air boss.\"\n\nPlane needs fixing\n\nA Saskatchewan RCMP plane was not operational during the manhunt for Sanderson. A plane from the Saskatoon Police Service was used instead. The report says RCMP plane upgrades need approval from the Saskatchewan government. It says Mounties hope progress can be made in updating the plane.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nSome tips not relayed\n\nPeople called in sightings of Sanderson in the town of Wakaw during the manhunt, but the report says some of that information never made its way to those in charge. One tip came from a caller who knew Sanderson. The report recommends a closer link between the police emergency operations and the call centre.\n\nVictims services team effective\n\nOfficers allowed families to grieve and hold ceremonies before the victims' bodies were removed for autopsies. Sweats and smudges took place in the community, and officers kept victims up to date on the status of their homes that required restoration.\n\nSupport for victims services staff\n\nThe report recommends victims services employees have access to the same wellness programs as officers.

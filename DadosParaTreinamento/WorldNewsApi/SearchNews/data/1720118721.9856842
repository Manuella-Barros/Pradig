But then Doocy dug further, asking: \u201cAre you worried this could happen to you someday? Somebody comes up with some charges and tries to bring you into court after your term?\u201d Biden, unperturbed, replied: \u201cNot at all. I didn\u2019t do anything wrong. The system still works.\u201d Trump and his allies have repeatedly claimed the trial against him in New York, in which he was found guilty on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records, was somehow rigged at the behest of Biden. Doocy pushed Biden on those claims, telling him, \u201cTrump thinks you\u2019re pulling the strings behind the scenes and doing all of this to help yourself.\u201d Biden simply laughed before responding, \u201cI didn\u2019t know I was that powerful,\u201d and walking off.", "url": "https://www.yahoo.com/news/fox-reporter-asks-biden-worries-013037322.html", "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/thedailybeast.com/43ab45813a9c710001d7d54135d4932d", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-02 12:29:02", "author": "Owen Lavine", "authors": ["Owen Lavine"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.498}

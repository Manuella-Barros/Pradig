This step will make it the first country to deploy and operate such weapons in the military, the country's arms procurement agency said on Thursday.\n\nThe laser weapons have been developed by Hanwha Aerospace for the South Korean military and they are reportedly effective and cheap. Each laser shot costs 2,000 won ($1.45) and is quiet and invisible, according to the Defense Acquisition Program Administration (DAPA).\n\n\"Our country is becoming the first country in the world to deploy and operate laser weapons, and our military's response capabilities on North Korea's drone provocation will be further strengthened,\" DAPA said, calling those weapons as a game changer in the future battlefield.\n\nThe lasers are effective in bringing down drones by burning down their engines or other electric equipment in drones with beams of light for 10 to 20 seconds, a DAPA spokesperson explained at a briefing. These weapons can \"precisely strike small unmanned aerial vehicles and multicopters at close range\".\n\nEach of these weapons is roughly the size of a shipping container with a laser mounted on top along with a radar or tracking device placed on one side of the platform, CNN reported. This unit measures 9 m by 3 m by 3 m (29.5 feet by 9.8 feet by 9.8 feet), and fires laser rays that are difficult if not impossible to detect before impact.\n\n\"It is invisible and noiseless, does not require separate ammunition and can be operated only when electricity is supplied,\" the DAPA said. If upgrade, future versions of these laser weapons can be used to take out bigger targets like aircraft and ballistic missiles. DAPA will release Block-I version of the weapons and is working on Block-II with increased output and range.\n\nDAPA said the Block-I weapon has been in development for five years, with more than $63 million invested for its use. The system was evaluated suitable for combat in April 2023 after achieving 100 per cent success in shooting down targets in live-fire tests, according to DAPA.\n\nThe use of laser weapons comes at a time of increasing tensions between North and South Korea. Five North Korean drones crossed into South Korea, which is technically still at war with Pyongyang, in December, prompting Seoul to scramble fighter jets and attack helicopters, and try to shoot them down, in the first such intrusion since 2017.\n\nTensions on the Korean peninsula have increased since the North last year scrapped a 2018 pact aimed at de-escalating tensions near the military border drawn up under a truce ending the 1950-53 Korean War and then labelled the South \"enemy No. 1\". Pyongyang says it has been forced to boost its nuclear and missile programs to deal with US-led hostilities, viewing the joint drills with Seoul as an invasion rehearsal.\n\nNorth and South Korea have both violated the armistice that governs their shared border by sending drones into each other's airspace, the United States has said. Meanwhile, countries like China and the United Kingdom are racing to develop and deploy laser weapons, also known as directed energy weapons, according to a US nonprofit think tank RAND Corporation.",

It said the system, developed by local company Hanwha Aerospace, costs just 2,000 won (about $1.50) per shot.\n\n\"We face North Korea on our doorstep and its drones pose present threats to us, so that's why we've been aiming to build and deploy laser weapons soon to cope with them,\" an agency official said, requesting anonymity because he wasn't authorized to speak to media on the issue.\n\nHe said that other countries like the United States and Israel are ahead of South Korea in laser weapons technology, but their primary focus has been on higher-powered laser guns that can shoot down incoming ballistic missiles. South Korea also hopes to develop such anti-missile laser weapons, which its defense procurement agency called \"a game changer\" in future combat environments.\n\nThe \"Block-I\" system is meant to hit circuit boards and other equipment in enemy drones to make them malfunction and crash on the ground. Tests of the weapons system in 2022-2023 were successful and proved its credibility, the official said.\n\nSome experts questioned the technology.\n\nLee Illwoo, an expert with the Korea Defense Network in South Korea, doubts how effectively South Korea can use its laser weapons since its anti-air radar systems aren't advanced enough to detect North Korean drones well. He said the range of a laser weapon is relatively short, so high-power microwave weapons would be better when enemy drones are flown in large numbers simultaneously.\n\nJung Chang Wook, head of the Korea Defense Study Forum think tank in Seoul, said South Korea is likely about five years away from acquiring a functioning laser weapon that can shoot down the drones used by North Korea.\n\nNorth Korea has periodically flown drones across its heavily fortified border with South Korea for several years, in what observers have called tests of South Korean readiness. In December 2022, South Korea accused the North of sending drones across the border for the first time in five years.

It said the system, developed by local company Hanwha Aerospace, costs just 2,000 won (about $1.50) per shot.\n\n\"We face North Korea on our doorstep and its drones pose present threats to us, so that's why we've been aiming to build and deploy laser weapons soon to cope with them,\" an agency official said, requesting anonymity because he wasn't authorized to speak to media on the issue.\n\nHe said that other countries like the United States and Israel are ahead of South Korea in laser weapons technology, but their primary focus has been on higher-powered laser guns that can shoot down incoming ballistic missiles. South Korea also hopes to develop such anti-missile laser weapons, which its defense procurement agency called \"a game changer\" in future combat environments.\n\nThe \"Block-I\" system is meant to hit circuit boards and other equipment in enemy drones to make them malfunction and crash on the ground. Tests of the weapons system in 2022-2023 were successful and proved its credibility, the official said.\n\nSome experts questioned the technology.\n\nLee Illwoo, an expert with the Korea Defense Network in South Korea, doubts how effectively South Korea can use its laser weapons since its anti-air radar systems aren't advanced enough to detect North Korean drones well. He said the range of a laser weapon is relatively short, so high-power microwave weapons would be better when enemy drones are flown in large numbers simultaneously.\n\nJung Chang Wook, head of the Korea Defense Study Forum think tank in Seoul, said South Korea is likely about five years away from acquiring a functioning laser weapon that can shoot down the drones used by North Korea.\n\nNorth Korea has periodically flown drones across its heavily fortified border with South Korea for several years, in what observers have called tests of South Korean readiness.

The initiative, known as the \"StarWars project,\" is spearheaded by South Korea's arms procurement agency, the Defense Acquisition Program Administration (DAPA), in collaboration with Hanwha Aerospace.\n\nThe laser weapons are designed to shoot down drones by burning through their engines or other electronic components with beams of light for 10 to 20 seconds. These systems are described as both effective and cost-efficient, with each shot costing approximately 2,000 won ($1.45). The lasers operate quietly and are invisible to the naked eye, providing a significant strategic advantage.\n\n\"Our country is becoming the first in the world to deploy and operate laser weapons, enhancing our military's response capabilities against North Korea's drone provocations,\" DAPA stated. The agency said that these weapons could be a game changer on future battlefields.\n\nThe urgency of deploying these laser systems has been underscored by recent incidents. In December, five North Korean drones breached South Korean airspace, leading Seoul to dispatch fighter jets and attack helicopters in an attempt to neutralise the threat. This was the first such incursion since 2017, highlighting the ongoing tensions and the necessity for advanced defensive measures.\n\nThe Korean Peninsula remains technically at war, as the Korean War (1950-1953) ended with an armistice rather than a peace treaty, maintaining a volatile Demilitarised Zone (DMZ) between North and South Korea. Both nations have previously violated the armistice by sending drones into each other's territory, according to the United States.\n\nThe global race to develop and deploy laser weapons, also known as directed energy weapons, is intensifying. Countries such as China and the United Kingdom are also pursuing similar technologies to counter the increasing proliferation of unmanned systems, as well as to target missiles and satellites. According to the RAND Corporation, a U.S. nonprofit think tank, there is substantial interest in these weapons for their potential to reshape modern warfare.", "source": {"uri": "arise.tv",

It said the system, developed by local company Hanwha Aerospace, costs just 2,000 won (about $1.50) per shot.\n\n\"We face North Korea on our doorstep and its drones pose present threats to us, so that's why we've been aiming to build and deploy laser weapons soon to cope with them,\" an agency official said, requesting anonymity because he wasn't authorized to speak to media on the issue.\n\nHe said that other countries like the United States and Israel are ahead of South Korea in laser weapons technology, but their primary focus has been on higher-powered laser guns that can shoot down incoming ballistic missiles. South Korea also hopes to develop such anti-missile laser weapons, which its defense procurement agency called \"a game changer\" in future combat environments.\n\nThe \"Block-I\" system is meant to hit circuit boards and other equipment in enemy drones to make them malfunction and crash on the ground. Tests of the weapons system in 2022-2023 were successful and proved its credibility, the official said.\n\nSome experts questioned the technology.\n\nLee Illwoo, an expert with the Korea Defense Network in South Korea, doubts how effectively South Korea can use its laser weapons since its anti-air radar systems aren't advanced enough to detect North Korean drones well. He said the range of a laser weapon is relatively short, so high-power microwave weapons would be better when enemy drones are flown in large numbers simultaneously.\n\nJung Chang Wook, head of the Korea Defense Study Forum think tank in Seoul, said South Korea is likely about five years away from acquiring a functioning laser weapon that can shoot down the drones used by North Korea.\n\nNorth Korea has periodically flown drones across its heavily fortified border with South Korea for several years, in what observers have called tests of South Korean readiness. In December 2022, South Korea accused the North of sending drones across the border for the first time in five years. South Korea fired warning shots and launched fighter jets and helicopters but failed to shoot down any of the drones.\n\nIn a key political meeting in December 2023, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un vowed to introduce various types of unmanned combat equipment such as attack drones for 2024. Foreign experts say Kim likely regards drones as a cheap yet effective method to trigger security jitters and an internal divide in South Korea.\n\nAnimosities between the two Koreas, split along the world's most heavily fortified border, have deepened in recent months, with North Korea flying trash-carrying balloons toward South Korea in response to South Korean activists floating political leaflets via their own balloons.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

The South fired warning shots and launched fighter jets and helicopters but failed to shoot down any of the drones.\n\nIn a key political meeting in December 2023, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un vowed to introduce various types of unmanned combat equipment such as attack drones for 2024.\n\nForeign experts say he probably regards drones as a cheap yet effective method to trigger security jitters and an internal divide in South Korea.\n\nAnimosity between the two Koreas, split along the world's most heavily fortified border, has deepened in recent months, with North Korea flying waste-carrying balloons towards the South in response to South Korean activists floating political leaflets on their own balloons.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser_weapon", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Laser weapon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned_aerial_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Unmanned aerial vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "South Korea"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Korea"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Korea", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "North Korea"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "North Korea"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arms_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Arms industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-aircraft_warfare", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Anti-aircraft warfare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanwha_Aerospace", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hanwha Aerospace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Jong_Un", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kim Jong Un"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Leader_(North_Korean_title)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Leader (North Korean title)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printed_circuit_board", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Printed circuit board"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missile_defense", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Missile defense"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballistic_missile", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ballistic missile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_Central_News_Agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Korean Central News Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radar", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Radar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seoul", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Seoul"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Seoul"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Korea"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balloon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Balloon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microwave", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Microwave"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Think_tank", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Think tank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fighter_aircraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fighter aircraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helicopter", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Helicopter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyongyang", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pyongyang"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pyongyang"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "North Korea"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Korean", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Korean", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Tang_Soo_Do_and_Soo_Bahk_Do", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Tang Soo Do and Soo Bahk Do", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Hapkido", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Hapkido", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 62}], "image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/07/11/12/wire-87198757-1720696932-311_636x382.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9723313", "eventUri": "eng-9723313", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2313725490196078, "wgt": 206, "relevance": 1}

Each shot costs about 2,000 won ($1.45).\n\n\"The laser weapon is invisible, silent and does not need ammunition, making it highly cost-effective, unlike traditional guided missiles,\" said DAPA spokesperson Jo Yong-jin during a press briefing on Thursday. \"This makes it particularly effective against low-cost targets such as small drones.\"\n\nThe Block-I project marks the inaugural initiative of Korea's \"Star Wars\" project, integrating laser technology into battlefield weaponry.\n\nDevelopment of the laser weapon began in August 2019 with a budget of 87.1 billion won. The Agency for Defense Development led the system development project, and Hanwha Aerospace served as the prototype company.\n\nThe project achieved a 100 percent success rate in live-fire tests and received combat suitability certification in April last year, DAPA said.\n\n\"By signing the mass production contract for the Block-I, our country has become a leading nation in deploying laser weapons in military operations,\" said Lee Dong-seok, head of DAPA's Guided Weapon Project Division. \"This will significantly enhance our military's ability to respond to North Korea's drone provocations.\"\n\nTo address Block-I's limitations, such as its performance in adverse weather conditions like rain and fog, DAPA announced plans to develop a Block-II variant with a more powerful laser.\n\nAdditionally, the state arms procurement agency plans to develop core technologies to increase the power of laser oscillators to several hundred kilowatts. The system is expected to be a game-changer on the battlefield, potentially countering aircraft and ballistic missiles.\n\nBY SEO JI-EUN [seo.jieun1@joongang.co.kr]", "source": {"uri": "koreajoongangdaily.joins.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "\uc911\uc559\uc77c\ubcf4"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser_weapon", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Laser weapon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defense_Acquisition_Program_Administration", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Defense Acquisition Program Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Laser"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_production", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mass production"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned_aerial_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Unmanned aerial vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Korea", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "North Korea"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "North Korea"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanwha_Aerospace", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hanwha Aerospace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Korea_Armed_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republic of Korea Armed Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_fiber", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Optical fiber"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ammunition", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ammunition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-aircraft_warfare", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anti-aircraft warfare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Military"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "South Korea"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Korea"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Target_drone", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Target drone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fahrenheit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fahrenheit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trajectory", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Trajectory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Celsius"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electronics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Star Wars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electricity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radar", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Radar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missile", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Missile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Heat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agency_for_Defense_Development", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Agency for Defense Development"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Defense", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Defense", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Military_Science", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Military Science", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 69}], "image": "https://koreajoongangdaily.joins.com/data/photo/2024/07/11/7dcfc599-3330-4a64-bcbc-edf6e815d06e.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9723313", "eventUri": "eng-9723313", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-25", "textStart": 440, "textEnd": 447}, {"amb": false, "date": "2019-08-", "textStart": 1634, "textEnd": 1645}], "sentiment": -0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 184, "relevance": 1}

The system was assessed as combat suitable in April last year after undergoing successful live-fire tests.\n\nDAPA said it plans to develop an improved version with enhanced output and range.\n\nThe military has sought to beef up its response capabilities against small UAVs after five North Korean drones intruded across the inter-Korean border in December 2022.", "source": {"uri": "en.yna.co.kr", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yonhap News Agency"}, "authors": [{"uri": "chae_yun_hwan@en.yna.co.kr", "name": "Chae Yun-hwan", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser_weapon", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Laser weapon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defense_Acquisition_Program_Administration", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Defense Acquisition Program Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned_aerial_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Unmanned aerial vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "South Korea"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Korea"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Laser"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanwha_Aerospace", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hanwha Aerospace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yonhap_News_Agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Yonhap News Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arms_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arms industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procurement", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Procurement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States dollar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_battery", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electric battery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precision-guided_munition", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Precision-guided munition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_fiber", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Optical fiber"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electricity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballistic_missile", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ballistic missile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Korea", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "North Korea"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "North Korea"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Defense", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Defense", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Military_Science", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Military Science", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military/Weapons_and_Equipment", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military/Weapons and Equipment", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns/Reloading", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns/Reloading", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 46}], "image": "https://img2.yna.co.kr/etc/inner/EN/2024/07/11/AEN20240711002851315_02_i_P4.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9723313", "eventUri": "eng-9723313", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-11", "textStart": 62, "textEnd": 69}], "sentiment": -0.0980392156862745, "wgt": 180, "relevance": 1}

Future versions could be developed to take out much bigger targets, including aircraft and ballistic missiles, which would be a potential \"game changer,\" according to the release.\n\nDAPA will develop \"a laser anti-aircraft weapon (Block-II) system with improved output and range compared to the current one,\" the release said.\n\nBut the Block-I weapon itself comes online at an important time. In Ukraine, the Middle East and elsewhere, small drones - some available off the shelf - have shown the ability to disable or destroy multimillion-dollar pieces of military hardware, including tanks.\n\nMilitaries have typically responded by trying to take out low-cost drones with defensive systems that cost tens of thousands of dollars per strike. A weapon that could do the same for practically pennies would be a big boost to the country that can deploy it.\n\n\"Low-cost drones and rockets have swung the economic calculus of offense and defense in favor of those using large volumes of cheap unmanned systems and munitions to overwhelm more-sophisticated air and missile defenses,\" James Black, assistant director defense and security for the RAND Europe think tank, wrote in a blog post in January.\n\nDAPA said the Block-I weapon has been in development for five years, with more than $63 million invested.\n\nThe Korea Institute for Defense Analyses led the system development with participation from Hanwha Aerospace, it said.\n\nThe system was evaluated suitable for combat in April 2023 after achieving 100% success in shooting down targets in live-fire tests, according to DAPA.\n\nThe agency said South Korea is the first country to publicly acknowledge it will deploy a mass-produced laser weapon.\n\nEarlier this year, Britain showed off a new laser weapon that its military says could deliver lethal missile or aircraft defense at around $13 a shot.\n\nBut no possible deployment date for that weapon had been announced.\n\nIn 2022, the US Navy successfully tested a high-energy laser system against a target representing a cruise missile.\n\nBut a Navy account of that test said there was no plan to get it into the hands of warfighters, adding that it \"offers a glimpse into the future of laser weapons.\"", "source": {"uri": "cnn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CNN"}, "authors": [{"uri": "brad_lendon@cnn.com",

Despite our small size, our scientific community has always thrived on making something out of nothing, as there was a lack of resources in Soviet times,\" says Antanas Laurutis, CEO of Altechna, an international laser optics provider based in Lithuania.\n\nNow, in its 35th year as an independent country, Lithuania produces a wide range of internationally recognised laser technologies.\n\n\"Lithuania's laser industry hub, which developed from humble beginnings, now boasts a complete value chain, from optics manufacturing to systems integration, strategically positioning the country in the global market. This comprehensive chain rivals the world's largest laser hubs, making Lithuania an attractive destination for foreign investment and further industry consolidation,\" continues Laurutis.\n\nLithuania's laser industry currently features diverse solutions such as material growth and preparation, precise optical, mechanical, and electronic components, subassembly contract manufacturing, a wide variety of optical devices and cutting-edge lasers, integration services, systems manufacturing, and even final products made by laser systems.\n\nAs a result, Lithuanian laser companies are also impacting several key sectors globally.\n\nThe semiconductor industry, projected to reach a value of one trillion US dollars by 2030, is one of them. Lithuanian lasers are essential in global semiconductor manufacturing, enabling precise processes and contributing to the global consumer electronics market growth, valued at 773.4 billion US dollars in 2023.\n\nAnother sector is the augmented reality (AR) market, which is expected to skyrocket from 93.67 billion US dollars in 2024 to 1.86 trillion US dollars by 2032. The instrumentation market, enabled by compound semiconductors, is projected to grow from 18.46 billion US dollars in 2024 to 21.76 billion US dollars by 2029.\n\n\"The markets we operate in are predicted to have at least a seven per cent CAGR [compound annual growth rate] through 2030,\" adds Laurutis.\n\n\"While some sectors like display and semiconductor are currently in a downturn, growth is expected to resume by 2025. Defence and space markets, driven by geopolitical factors, will offer reliable growth opportunities. We're also seeing new localisation trends, which will open new doors as old ones close.\"\n\nAs Lithuania's laser market players navigate these changes, adapting focus to rapidly growing sectors will be crucial for continued growth.\n\n\"Altechna is focusing on booming sectors such as semiconductor manufacturing, space, and automotive. Providing optics and complex subassemblies for such industries will require us to change our course and prepare for the expected growth,\" concludes Laurutis.\n\nThe global laser market stood at 17.82 billion US dollars in 2022. It is expected to expand at a CAGR of 7.8 per cent from 2023 to 2030, and Lithuania is significantly contributing to this growth.\n\nThe country is already a major player in scientific and industrial laser technologies, exporting laser solutions to over 80 countries and collaborating with organisations including NASA and CERN.", "source": {"uri": "emerging-europe.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Emerging Europe | Intelligence, Community, News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Optics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Laser"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithuania", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lithuania"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Lithuania"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States dollar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photonics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Photonics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Soviet Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiconductor_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Semiconductor industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contract_manufacturer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Contract manufacturer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiconductor_device_fabrication", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Semiconductor device fabrication"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_component", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electronic component"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_electronics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Consumer electronics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compound_annual_growth_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Compound annual growth rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiconductor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Semiconductor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_direct_investment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Foreign direct investment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instrumentation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Instrumentation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CERN", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CERN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geopolitics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Geopolitics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arms_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arms industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augmented_reality", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Augmented reality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automotive_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Automotive industry"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Electronics_and_Electrical/Optoelectronics_and_Fiber", "label": "dmoz/Business/Electronics and Electrical/Optoelectronics and Fiber", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/E-Commerce/Marketplaces", "label": "dmoz/Business/E-Commerce/Marketplaces", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Major_Companies/Publicly_Traded", "label": "dmoz/Business/Major Companies/Publicly Traded", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 69}], "image": "https://emerging-europe.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/bigstock-cnc-laser-cutting-of-metal-mo-433794554.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9723313", "eventUri": "eng-9723313", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 164, "relevance": 1}

Not only is this a world's first, but xTool has also raised the bar for laser engravers by implementing a camera and a conveyor system.\n\nThe xTool F1 Ultra is a laser engraving machine that features both a 20W diode laser and a 20W fiber laser along with rotary and conveyor capability.\n\nFor the last couple of years, I've been working extensively with the xTool laser engravers. However, until now, they have all been gantry-style lasers. When the review offer came along for the xTool F1 Ultra, I was extremely excited that it was not only a Galvo laser but also a fiber laser.\n\nThe xTool F1 Ultra is not only larger than the original F1, but also has a larger working area and a larger exhaust port. The 3-inch exhaust port seems to work very well for extracting smoke and dust while engraving. The remote touchscreen works well and allows you to operate the laser without bumping it.\n\nA gantry-style laser has a laser head that moves on sets of rails, one set for left/right and one for forward/back. These commonly have a speed that is limited to about 400 to 600mm/s. The F1 Ultra is a galvo-style laser that uses a fixed laser head and a pair of mirrors that \"steer\" the laser across the material at working speeds up to 10,000mm/s. Each type of laser has its pros and cons though, so there's not really a laser that's \"best,\" just what is best for the project you're doing.\n\nThe xTool F1 Ultra is the world's first 20W fiber and 20W diode dual laser engraver. So why two lasers? There are several types of lasers (diode, CO2, fiber, etc), each with different properties, but the main difference is the wavelength of the emitted light. The various wavelengths affect materials in different ways. For example, fiber lasers don't work well (or at all) on organic materials, diode lasers don't work well on transparent materials, and CO2 lasers don't work well on metals.\n\nWith the dual laser system in the F1 Ultra, it can process almost all materials like wood, slate, stone, acrylic, leather, metals, and plastic. The dual laser is beneficial not only for being able to process almost all types of material but often both lasers can be used on a single project. For example, one laser can be used for cutting or the main engraving while the other can be used for either engraving, cutting, or a clean-up pass.\n\nThe fiber laser is one of the key features of the F1 Ultra. Fiber lasers operate in a pulsed nature, giving it much more power than a similarly rated diode laser. The fiber laser is an IR laser, which means it works well on various metals and plastics. When combined with the embossing feature in the software, the fiber laser can also depth engrave 3D designs.\n\nAt 220x220mm (8.66\u00d78.66 inch), the F1 Ultra has the largest working area among desktop galvo lasers. When combined with the conveyor accessory, this working area can be expanded to 220x500mm. Most other galvo lasers have a 150x150mm working area, so the F1 Ultra is 115% larger.\n\nAnother exclusive feature of the F1 Ultra is its built-in 16MP camera. Placing designs on items is extremely easy and accurate. Fine-tuning of design placement can also be checked with the framing feature that projects a low-power beam of light around the design so you can confirm or correct placement.\n\nThe dual lasers of the xTool F1 Ultra engraver can also help create different effects on some materials. For example, on the blue stainless dog tag, the diode laser maintains the glossy finish, while the fiber laser creates an etching effect. For the blue light engraving, I made separate setting adjustments for the heart over the \"i\" to make it pink. I did see a little color variation on the lettering, but that could be worked out with a little experimentation.\n\nConveyor Accessory\n\nThe F1 Ultra is fast. For example, a typical business card that took 4.5 minutes on the xTool S1 took only 30 seconds on the F1 Ultra. Additionally, the F1 Ultra goes one step further when the optional conveyor accessory is used. The conveyor accessory not only increases the area for a single engraving to 220x500mm, it also enables batch engraving which streamlines batch production of multiple items.\n\nWith the Conveyor Batch function, you simply frame the material and the software will align your design on the material as it advances the conveyor belt. If the software can't recognize the material for some reason, it will simply skip that item.\n\nI had some successful runs with the conveyor, however I did have issues. The software would not work on some green foam and some purple business cards. I switched to blue business cards and it engraved the first one, but skipped the rest. I think the batch functionality still needs some work.\n\nThe conveyor mode will continually advance the belt and detect items with the camera. The software will align your designs on the items regardless of their orientation. Once the conveyor has advanced 5 times without detecting items it will stop.\n\nEmbossment\n\nTo take full advantage of the power of the fiber laser, the xTool software has an embossment mode. This mode takes an image and engraves it with multiple passes. The software even has a feature in the AI section that will convert images to the style needed for embossment engraving.\n\nIt does take some testing to figure out what settings work best. It appears that the coin engravings I've seen others do look better than the ones I did. A typical challenge-type 40mm coin will take from 2 to 5 hours to complete. Although this is fine for a hobbyist making the occasional coin, I don't think the 20W laser would be fast enough for production work if you're making many of them.\n\nStone Engraving\n\nI was really impressed at how well the 20W fiber laser engraved stone. I think I may have found a new hobby, it was quite a lot of fun making rocks for my grandchildren. In just a few minutes I was able to engrave some light-colored stones to a depth of 1 to 2mm. I found that the darker/harder stones were a bit more difficult to get an engraving that was easy to read, which is often the nature with dark stone or slate.\n\nMetal Engraving\n\nThe metal engraving with the IR fiber laser is a lot of fun. However, it does take a bit more experimenting with the settings. You can get a great range of both colors and textures when varying the settings.\n\nIn this dragon engraving, I used an SVG file. I first engraved it, then scored the outline of the dragon with different settings.\n\nMetal Cutting\n\nThe F1 Ultra can cut thin metal with the fiber (IR) laser. I found that this method takes a bit of trial and error, although that is pretty standard with any laser. I made some earrings from a metal business card. I used 100% power, 100mm/s, 10 passes.\n\nI did some experimenting with various combinations of settings such as 100% power, 1mm/s, 1 pass and 100% power, 5mm/s, 2 passes and had similar results. Even though this was a slower speed than other projects, these 18mm (3/4'') earrings only took 13 seconds each to engrave and cut.\n\nPlastic\n\nEngraving plastic is sometimes tricky, but once you do a few tests you'll quickly get an idea of what settings work on various materials. You can get dark engravings on light-colored plastic, and light engravings on dark-colored plastic.\n\nWood engraving with the F1 Ultra is similar to other lasers. I found the 20W blue laser to be very good for wood engraving with a fair amount of speed. My experience with diode and CO2 lasers is that the speed for engraving is fairly linear, meaning that a laser with twice the power will engrave twice as fast.\n\nThe F1 Ultra being a galvo laser adds the ability to frame with an outline of the engraving, making the process of positioning the design much easier than with gantry-style lasers. The accuracy of the F1 Ultra also makes it easy to make adjustments and to make additional passes if needed without worrying about the design shifting.\n\nRotary\n\nThe xTool F1 Ultra supports the xTool RA2 Pro rotary. The process is pretty much the same as other xTool lasers. The advantage of the F1 Ultra is that you can use one laser to engrave, and one laser to do a cleanup pass.\n\nThe xTool F1 Ultra has become my favorite laser for engraving.

Gen. Keith Kellogg discusses the global implications of Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un signing an 'aggression' pact on 'Your World.'\n\nSouth Korea is preparing to launch a laser-based defense system that will more easily destroy drones flying in from the North.\n\nThe \"Block-I\" program, also referred to as \"StarWars\" hopes to make South Korea the first national military in the world to weaponize directed light.\n\n\"Our country is becoming the first country in the world to deploy and operate laser weapons, and our military's response capabilities on North Korea's drone provocation will be further strengthened,\" the nation's Defense Acquisition Program Administration (DAPA) wrote in a statement.\n\nKIM JONG UN SUPERVISED DRILLS SIMULATING ATTACKS ON SOUTH KOREA, NORTH KOREA\n\n\"We face North Korea on our doorstep and its drones pose present threats to us, so that's why we've been aiming to build and deploy laser weapons soon to cope with them,\" an agency official told the Associated Press on background.\n\nThe lasers, developed in partnership with Hanwha Aerospace, would shoot sustained beams of light at aerial targets for up to 20 seconds.\n\nThe heat generated by the lasers can overheat and fry targets without necessitating a traditional projectile.\n\nUS CONDUCTS FIRST PRECISION BOMBING DRILL WITH SOUTH KOREA IN 7 YEARS AS TENSIONS WITH NORTH KOREA RISE\n\nOperation of these weapons is expected to be extremely effective for a small price, hypothetically costing less than $2 USD per discharge.\n\nThe most obvious outlet for the StarWars weaponry is against aerial targets from North Korea.\n\nThe communist nation has floated massive balloons carrying trash over the Demilitarized Zone and into South Korean airspace as a token of disrespect.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nNorth Korea's balloons were allegedly released in response to similar crafts carrying anti-North Korean propaganda floated northward from South Korea by activists.\n\nSupreme leader Kim Jong Un has abandoned any hopes of reconciling his hermit country with South Korea, instead embracing an unclear role in alliance with Russia and China.", "source": {"uri": "foxnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fox News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "timothy_nerozzi@foxnews.com", "name": "Timothy Nerozzi", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}],

(AP) -- The remnants of Hurricane Beryl caused damaging flooding in Vermont on Thursday, a year after catastrophic rainfall inundated parts of the state.\n\nRoads were flooded, washed out or covered with debris around Vermont after heavy rain moved through the state starting Wednesday. Rescues were reported Wednesday night, and some communities were under evacuation orders.\n\nAreas of central Vermont, which was hit hard by last July's flooding, have suffered some of the heaviest damage. Roads and homes were reportedly flooded in the city of Barre.\n\nBeryl, which landed in Texas on Monday as a Category 1 hurricane, was a post-tropical cyclone that brought tornadoes and flooding from the Great Lakes to northern New England after leaving millions in the Houston area without power.\n\nParts of northern New York and New England, including Vermont, remained under flood watches or warnings early Thursday. Thunderstorms associated with Beryl were forecast for much of the East Coast through Friday, the National Weather Service said.\n\nIn Vermont, the weather service had said Wednesday the storm \"will not be like last July's catastrophic flooding but will still pose real dangers where flash flooding occurs.\"\n\nIn a Wednesday night update, Vermont Emergency Management said there had been an unspecified number of evacuations and road closures due to flooding, primarily in the central part of the state.\n\n\"Vermonters and visitors are encouraged to seek higher ground should floodwaters approach,\" the statement said.\n\nRescue teams and the National Guard were at the ready, the agency said.\n\nVermont, far inland, nonetheless has experience with tropical weather. Tropical Storm Irene dumped 11 inches of rain on parts of Vermont in 24 hours in 2011. The storm killed six in the state, washed homes off their foundations, and damaged or destroyed more than 200 bridges and 500 miles of highway.\n\nBeryl has been blamed for at least seven U.S. deaths -- one in Louisiana and six in Texas -- and at least 11 in the Caribbean. More than 1.3 million homes and businesses in Texas still lacked electricity early Thursday, down from a peak of over 2.7 million on Monday, according to PowerOutage.us.\n\nThe storm has caused at least $3.3 billion in damage in the United States, Mexico and the Caribbean, according to Karen Clark & Company, a Boston-based firm that works with insurance companies to estimate disaster costs.\n\nIt calculated a flash estimate Thursday of $2.7 billion in privately insured U.S. losses, along with $510 million in the Caribbean and $90 million in Mexico. The estimate is only for insured properties and does not include homes covered by the U.S. National Flood Insurance Program, so total losses will be higher.", "source": {"uri": "aol.com", "dataType":

Rescues were reported Wednesday night, and some communities were under evacuation orders.\n\nIn Plainfield, residents of a six-unit apartment building had only 15 minutes to evacuate before the entire structure was swept away by floodwaters that also took out at least seven bridges and left many roads impassable and people stranded, said town Emergency Management Director Michael Billingsley.

The estimate is only for insured properties and does not include homes covered by the U.S. National Flood Insurance Program, so total losses will be higher.\n\n___\n\nBy LISA RATHKE Associated

Currents are fast and there is a tremendous amount of flood debris in the water,\" she said.\n\nThe deluge dropped more than 6 inches of rain on parts of Vermont, and the heaviest rainfall was in areas hit hard a year ago, said Marlon Verasamy, of the National Weather Service in Burlington.

The disaster came a year to the day after catastrophic rainfall inundated parts of the state.\n\nRoads were flooded, washed out or covered with debris after heavy rain that started Wednesday and persisted into Thursday. Rescues were reported Wednesday night, and some communities were under evacuation orders.\n\nIn Plainfield, residents of a six-unit apartment building had only 15 minutes to evacuate before the entire structure was swept away by floodwaters that also took out at least seven bridges and left many roads impassable and people stranded, said town Emergency Management Director Michael Billingsley. One car was swept away, but the occupant escaped, he said.\n\nAcross the state, emergency workers assessed damage Thursday morning, and Billingsley said it could take several days to know the full extent. Areas of central Vermont, which was hit hard by last July's flooding, suffered some of the heaviest damage. Roads and homes were also reportedly flooded in the city of Barre.\n\nThere were no immediate reports of any deaths in Vermont.\n\nBeryl landed in Texas on Monday as a Category 1 hurricane and left millions in the Houston area without power.

Thunderstorms associated with Beryl were forecast for much of the East Coast through Friday, the National Weather Service said.\n\nVermont Emergency Management said Wednesday night there had been an unspecified number of evacuations and road closures due to flooding, primarily in the central part of the state.\n\n\"Vermonters and visitors are encouraged to seek higher ground should floodwaters approach,\" the statement said. Rescue teams and the National Guard were at the ready, the agency said.\n\nThe weather service had said Wednesday that the storm \"will not be like last July's catastrophic flooding but will still pose real dangers where flash flooding occurs.\"\n\nVermont, far inland, nonetheless has experience with tropical weather. Tropical Storm Irene dumped 11 inches of rain on parts of Vermont in 24 hours in 2011. The storm killed six in the state, washed homes off their foundations, and damaged or destroyed more than 200 bridges and 500 miles of highway.\n\nDamage from the severe weather was also reported in northern New Hampshire.\n\nIn Dalton, several roads were impassable due to washouts. Photos showed gaping holes in several roads.\n\n\"What may look a passable may infact not be. Do not venture out for a day unless you absolutely need to,\" Dalton Fire Rescue warned residents.\n\nLittleton, located in the White Mountains region of New Hampshire, reported a possible microburst.\n\nThere was flooding with multiple trees and wires down Wednesday night.\n\nBeryl has been blamed for at least seven U.S. deaths -- one in Louisiana and six in Texas -- and at least 11 in the Caribbean.

Phil Scott told reporters Thursday, adding that the state's \"response and tools are only stronger\" as a result of the tragedy a year ago.\n\nThe death came in the community of Peacham, officials said.\n\nPublic Safety Commissioner Jennifer Morrison urged people to continue to take precautions and stay out of the water, even as temperatures rise and make it temping to take a dip. \"Regardless of river levels, our waterways are not safe right now. Currents are fast and there is a tremendous amount of flood debris in the water,\" she said.\n\nThe deluge dropped more than 6 inches (15 centimeters) of rain on parts of Vermont, and the heaviest rainfall was in areas hit hard a year ago, said Marlon Verasamy, of the National Weather Service in Burlington.

(AP) -- Floodwaters brought by the remnants of Hurricane Beryl caused at least one death in Vermont, officials said Thursday, a year after catastrophic rainfall devastated some of the same parts of the state.\n\n\"It's not lost on any of us the irony of the flood falling on the one year anniversary to the day when many towns were hit last year,\" Gov. Phil Scott said at a news conference. \"I know that only adds to the emotion many are feeling this morning ... but we're ready, our response and tools are only stronger as a result of last year, and we will get through this. The fact is, we're Vermont strong for a reason.\"\n\nOfficials said the person who died was a male from Peacham.\n\nSafety Commissioner Jennifer Morrison said: \"Regardless of river levels, our waterways are not safe right now. Currents are fast and there is a tremendous amount of flood debris in the water. The weather is going to get hot and humid in the next few days, and it may be tempting to cool off in a river or stream, but please don't.\"\n\nTHIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP's earlier story follows below.\n\nPLAINFIELD, Vt. (AP) -- The remnants of Hurricane Beryl brought floodwaters to central Vermont that caused frantic evacuations, knocked down bridges and washed away an apartment building, a year to the day after catastrophic rainfall inundated some of the same parts of the state.\n\nRoads were flooded, washed out or covered with debris after heavy rain that started Wednesday and persisted into Thursday. Rescues continued late into the night, and some communities were under evacuation orders.\n\nIn Plainfield, residents of a six-unit apartment building had only 15 minutes to evacuate before the entire structure was swept away by floodwaters that also took out at least seven bridges and left many roads impassable and people stranded, said town Emergency Management Director Michael Billingsley. One car was swept away, but the occupant escaped, he said.\n\nHilary Conant, who fled her second-floor Plainfield apartment, said she also had to flee rising waters a year ago.\n\n\"The water was coming up, so I knew it was time to leave with my dog. It's very retraumatizing,\" she said. A neighbor offered a camper to temporarily house her.\n\nArt Edelstein assessed the destruction Thursday morning around a home he has owned for 50 years and now rents to tenants.\n\n\"I don't even know how much water came from where because it's just mud everywhere,\" he said. \"This is, in my impression, catastrophic. I've just never seen anything like this.\"\n\nIn the small community of Moretown, the damage appeared worse than it was a year ago, and the school was among buildings once again damaged by floodwaters, said Tom Martin, chair of the town board. Workers hoped to install a temporary bridge Thursday on the main artery that provides access to the community, he said.\n\n\"They say we're Vermont strong. We'll get through it,\" said Martin, his voice full of emotion.\n\nThe deluge dropped more than 6 inches (15 centimeters) of rain on parts of Vermont, and the heaviest was in areas hit hard a year ago, said Marlon Verasamy, of the National Weather Service in Burlington. But the damage was not as widespread across the entire state as it was a year ago, he said.\n\nFlash flooding also closed roads in several northern New Hampshire communities, including Monroe, Dalton, Lancaster and Littleton, where officials said 20 people were temporarily stranded at a Walmart store and crews made water rescues.\n\nTwo tornadoes were confirmed Wednesday in western New York. Some areas in the northern part of the state got 4 inches (10 centimeters) or more of rain, causing water to rush down streets in the village of Lowville.\n\nParts of northern New York and New England, including Vermont, remained under flood watches or warnings early Thursday. Thunderstorms associated with Beryl were forecast for much of the East Coast through Friday, the National Weather Service said.\n\nThere were no immediate reports of any deaths in the region. Vermont emergency managers had urged residents Wednesday to seek higher ground if floodwaters approached and said rescue teams and the National Guard were at the ready.\n\nEven though Vermont is not a coastal state, it nonetheless has experience with tropical weather. Tropical Storm Irene dumped 11 inches (28 centimeters) of rain on parts of Vermont in 24 hours in 2011. The storm killed six in the state, washed homes off their foundations, and damaged or destroyed more than 200 bridges and 500 miles of highway.\n\nIn May, Vermont became the first state to enact a law requiring fossil fuel companies to pay a share of the damage caused by extreme weather fueled by climate change.\n\nRepublican Gov. Phil Scott allowed the bill to become law without his signature, saying he was concerned about the costs of a grueling legal fight. But he acknowledged that he understands something has to be done to address the toll of climate change.\n\nBeryl landed in Texas on Monday as a Category 1 hurricane and left millions in the Houston area without power. It then carved a path across the interior U.S. as a post-tropical cyclone that brought flooding and sometimes tornadoes from the Great Lakes to Canada and northern New England.\n\nBeryl has been blamed for at least seven U.S. deaths -- one in Louisiana and six in Texas -- and at least 11 in the Caribbean. More than 1.3 million homes and businesses in Texas still lacked electricity early Thursday, down from a peak of over 2.7 million on Monday, according to PowerOutage.us.\n\nThe storm has caused at least $3.3 billion in damage in the United States, Mexico and the Caribbean, according to Karen Clark & Co., a Boston-based firm that works with insurance companies to estimate disaster costs.\n\nIt calculated a flash estimate Thursday of $2.7 billion in privately insured U.S. losses, along with $510 million in the Caribbean and $90 million in Mexico.

At least one person died.\n\nRoads were flooded, washed out or covered with debris after heavy rain that started Wednesday and persisted into Thursday. Rescues continued late into the night, and some communities were under evacuation orders, The AP reported.\n\nIn Plainfield, residents of a six-unit apartment building had only 15 minutes to evacuate before the entire structure was swept away by floodwaters that also took out at least seven bridges and left many roads impassable and people stranded, said town Emergency Management Director Michael Billingsley. One car was swept away, but the occupant escaped, he said.\n\n\"It's not lost on any of us the irony of the flood falling on the one-year anniversary to the day when many towns were hit last year. I know that only adds to the emotion many are feeling this morning,\" Gov. Phil Scott told reporters Thursday, adding that the state's \"response and tools are only stronger\" as a result of the tragedy a year ago.\n\nThe death came in the community of Peacham, officials said.\n\nPublic Safety Commissioner Jennifer Morrison urged people to continue to take precautions and stay out of the water, even as temperatures rise and make it temping to take a dip. \"Regardless of river levels, our waterways are not safe right now. Currents are fast and there is a tremendous amount of flood debris in the water,\" she said.\n\nThe deluge dropped more than 6 inches (15 centimeters) of rain on parts of Vermont, and the heaviest rainfall was in areas hit hard a year ago, said Marlon Verasamy, of the National Weather Service in Burlington. But the damage was not as widespread across the entire state as it was a year ago, he said.\n\nHilary Conant, who fled her second-floor Plainfield apartment, said she also had to flee rising waters a year ago.\n\n\"The water was coming up, so I knew it was time to leave with my dog. It's very retraumatizing,\" she said. A neighbor offered a camper to temporarily house her.\n\nArt Edelstein assessed the destruction Thursday morning around a home he has owned for 50 years and now rents to tenants.\n\n\"I don't even know how much water came from where because it's just mud everywhere,\" he said. \"This is, in my impression, catastrophic. I've just never seen anything like this.\"\n\nIn the small community of Moretown, the damage appeared worse than it was a year ago, and the school was among buildings once again damaged by floodwaters, said Tom Martin, chair of the town board. Workers hoped to install a temporary bridge Thursday on the main artery that provides access to the community, he said.\n\n\"They say we're Vermont strong. We'll get through it,\" said Martin, his voice full of emotion.\n\nFlash flooding also closed roads in several northern New Hampshire communities, including Monroe, Dalton, Lancaster and Littleton, where officials said 20 people were temporarily stranded at a Walmart store and crews made water rescues.\n\nTwo tornadoes were confirmed Wednesday in western New York. Some areas in the northern part of the state got 4 inches (10 centimeters) or more of rain, causing water to rush down streets in the village of Lowville.\n\nParts of northern New York and New England, including Vermont, remained under flood watches or warnings early Thursday. Thunderstorms associated with Beryl were forecast for much of the East Coast through Friday, the National Weather Service said.\n\nVermont emergency managers had urged residents Wednesday to seek higher ground if floodwaters approached and said rescue teams and the National Guard were at the ready.\n\nEven though Vermont is not a coastal state, it nonetheless has experience with tropical weather. Tropical Storm Irene dumped 11 inches (28 centimeters) of rain on parts of Vermont in 24 hours in 2011. The storm killed six in the state, washed homes off their foundations, and damaged or destroyed more than 200 bridges and 500 miles of highway.\n\nIn May, Vermont became the first state to enact a law requiring fossil fuel companies to pay a share of the damage caused by extreme weather fueled by climate change.\n\nRepublican Gov. Phil Scott allowed the bill to become law without his signature, saying he was concerned about the costs of a grueling legal fight. But he acknowledged that he understands something has to be done to address the toll of climate change.\n\nBeryl landed in Texas on Monday as a Category 1 hurricane and left millions in the Houston area without power. It then carved a path across the interior U.S. as a post-tropical cyclone that brought flooding and sometimes tornadoes from the Great Lakes to Canada and northern New England.\n\nBeryl has been blamed for at least seven U.S. deaths -- one in Louisiana and six in Texas -- and at least 11 in the Caribbean. More than 1.3 million homes and businesses in Texas still lacked electricity early Thursday, down from a peak of over 2.7 million on Monday, according to PowerOutage.us.\n\nThe storm has caused at least $3.3 billion in damage in the United States, Mexico and the Caribbean, according to Karen Clark & Co., a Boston-based firm that works with insurance companies to estimate disaster costs.\n\nIt calculated a flash estimate Thursday of $2.7 billion in privately insured U.S. losses, along with $510 million in the Caribbean and $90 million in Mexico.

(AP) -- The remnants of Hurricane Beryl brought flooding to Vermont that led to frantic evacuations, knocked down bridges and washed away an apartment building. The disaster came a year to the day after catastrophic rainfall inundated parts of the state.\n\nRoads were flooded, washed out or covered with debris after heavy rain that started Wednesday and persisted into Thursday. Rescues were reported Wednesday night, and some communities were under evacuation orders.\n\nIn Plainfield, residents of a six-unit apartment building had only 15 minutes to evacuate before the entire structure was swept away by floodwaters that also took out at least seven bridges and left many roads impassable and people stranded, said town Emergency Management Director Michael Billingsley. One car was swept away, but the occupant escaped, he said.\n\nAcross the state, emergency workers assessed damage Thursday morning, and Billingsley said it could take several days to know the full extent. Areas of central Vermont, which was hit hard by last July's flooding, suffered some of the heaviest damage. Roads and homes were also reportedly flooded in the city of Barre.\n\nThere were no immediate reports of any deaths in Vermont.\n\nBeryl landed in Texas on Monday as a Category 1 hurricane and left millions in the Houston area without power. It then carved a path across the interior U.S. as a post-tropical cyclone that brought flooding and sometimes tornadoes from the Great Lakes to Canada and northern New England.\n\nParts of northern New York and New England, including Vermont, remained under flood watches or warnings early Thursday. Thunderstorms associated with Beryl were forecast for much of the East Coast through Friday, the National Weather Service said.\n\nVermont Emergency Management said Wednesday night there had been an unspecified number of evacuations and road closures due to flooding, primarily in the central part of the state.\n\n\"Vermonters and visitors are encouraged to seek higher ground should floodwaters approach,\" the statement said. Rescue teams and the National Guard were at the ready, the agency said.\n\nThe weather service had said Wednesday that the storm \"will not be like last July's catastrophic flooding but will still pose real dangers where flash flooding occurs.\"\n\nVermont, far inland, nonetheless has experience with tropical weather. Tropical Storm Irene dumped 11 inches of rain on parts of Vermont in 24 hours in 2011. The storm killed six in the state, washed homes off their foundations, and damaged or destroyed more than 200 bridges and 500 miles of highway.\n\nBeryl has been blamed for at least seven U.S. deaths -- one in Louisiana and six in Texas -- and at least 11 in the Caribbean. More than 1.3 million homes and businesses in Texas still lacked electricity early Thursday, down from a peak of over 2.7 million on Monday, according to PowerOutage.us.\n\nThe storm has caused at least $3.3 billion in damage in the United States, Mexico and the Caribbean, according to Karen Clark & Company, a Boston-based firm that works with insurance companies to estimate disaster costs.\n\nIt calculated a flash estimate Thursday of $2.7 billion in privately insured U.S. losses, along with $510 million in the Caribbean and $90 million in Mexico. The estimate is only for insured properties and does not include homes covered by the U.S. National Flood Insurance Program, so total losses will be higher.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers David

The Ausable River in the Adirondacks is the only river in the region expected to reach flood stage.\n\n\"The flash flooding threat today is serious but I think it will be more localized and not to that degree of what we saw last July,\" Peter Banacos, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service office in Burlington, said Wednesday morning.\n\n\"That's a hard thing to articulate because we want people to take this seriously -- it's a serious flash flood threat,\" he said.\n\nThe storm comes as patches in the northern half of the state have high soil moisture levels following a wet spring and early summer, which makes runoff, and flash flooding, more likely.\n\nAreas in southern Vermont have a risk of isolated tornadoes. Banacos says this is something to be aware of, but not as much of a threat as flash flooding. \"They generally affect small areas in Vermont -- if we get tornadoes, they maybe only cover a couple of hundred yards,\" he said.\n\nThis storm is unusual for its intensity this early in the hurricane season.

(AP) - Floodwaters brought by the remnants of Hurricane Beryl caused at least one death in Vermont, officials said Thursday, a year after catastrophic rainfall devastated some of the same parts of the state. \"It's not lost on any of us the irony of the flood falling on the one year anniversary to the day when many towns were hit last year,\" Gov. Phil Scott said at a news conference. \"I know that only adds to the emotion many are feeling this morning \"| but we're ready, our response and tools are only stronger as a result of last year, and we will get through this. The fact is, we're Vermont strong for a reason.\"\u009d Officials said the person who died was a male from Peacham. Safety Commissioner Jennifer Morrison said: \"Regardless of river levels, our waterways are not safe right now. Currents are fast and there is a tremendous amount of flood debris in the water. The weather is going to get hot and humid in the next few days, and it may be tempting to cool off in a river or stream, but please don't.\"\u009d THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP's earlier story follows below. PLAINFIELD, Vt. (AP) - The remnants of Hurricane Beryl brought floodwaters to central Vermont that caused frantic evacuations, knocked down bridges and washed away an apartment building, a year to the day after catastrophic rainfall inundated some of the same parts of the state. Roads were flooded, washed out or covered with debris after heavy rain that started Wednesday and persisted into Thursday. Rescues continued late into the night, and some communities were under evacuation orders. In Plainfield, residents of a six-unit apartment building had only 15 minutes to evacuate before the entire structure was swept away by floodwaters that also took out at least seven bridges and left many roads impassable and people stranded, said town Emergency Management Director Michael Billingsley. One car was swept away, but the occupant escaped, he said. Hilary Conant, who fled her second-floor Plainfield apartment, said she also had to flee rising waters a year ago. \"The water was coming up, so I knew it was time to leave with my dog. It's very retraumatizing,\"\u009d she said. A neighbor offered a camper to temporarily house her. Art Edelstein assessed the destruction Thursday morning around a home he has owned for 50 years and now rents to tenants. \"I don't even know how much water came from where because it's just mud everywhere,\"\u009d he said. \"This is, in my impression, catastrophic. I've just never seen anything like this.\"\u009d In the small community of Moretown, the damage appeared worse than it was a year ago, and the school was among buildings once again damaged by floodwaters, said Tom Martin, chair of the town board. Workers hoped to install a temporary bridge Thursday on the main artery that provides access to the community, he said. \"They say we're Vermont strong. We'll get through it,\"\u009d said Martin, his voice full of emotion. The deluge dropped more than 6 inches (15 centimeters) of rain on parts of Vermont, and the heaviest was in areas hit hard a year ago, said Marlon Verasamy, of the National Weather Service in Burlington. But the damage was not as widespread across the entire state as it was a year ago, he said. Flash flooding also closed roads in several northern New Hampshire communities, including Monroe, Dalton, Lancaster and Littleton, where officials said 20 people were temporarily stranded at a Walmart store and crews made water rescues. Two tornadoes were confirmed Wednesday in western New York. Some areas in the northern part of the state got 4 inches (10 centimeters) or more of rain, causing water to rush down streets in the village of Lowville. Parts of northern New York and New England, including Vermont, remained under flood watches or warnings early Thursday. Thunderstorms associated with Beryl were forecast for much of the East Coast through Friday, the National Weather Service said. There were no immediate reports of any deaths in the region. Vermont emergency managers had urged residents Wednesday to seek higher ground if floodwaters approached and said rescue teams and the National Guard were at the ready. Even though Vermont is not a coastal state, it nonetheless has experience with tropical weather. Tropical Storm Irene dumped 11 inches (28 centimeters) of rain on parts of Vermont in 24 hours in 2011. The storm killed six in the state, washed homes off their foundations, and damaged or destroyed more than 200 bridges and 500 miles of highway. In May, Vermont became the first state to enact a law requiring fossil fuel companies to pay a share of the damage caused by extreme weather fueled by climate change. Republican Gov. Phil Scott allowed the bill to become law without his signature, saying he was concerned about the costs of a grueling legal fight. But he acknowledged that he understands something has to be done to address the toll of climate change. Beryl landed in Texas on Monday as a Category 1 hurricane and left millions in the Houston area without power. It then carved a path across the interior U.S. as a post-tropical cyclone that brought flooding and sometimes tornadoes from the Great Lakes to Canada and northern New England. Beryl has been blamed for at least seven U.S. deaths - one in Louisiana and six in Texas - and at least 11 in the Caribbean. More than 1.3 million homes and businesses in Texas still lacked electricity early Thursday, down from a peak of over 2.7 million on Monday, according to PowerOutage.us. The storm has caused at least $3.3 billion in damage in the United States, Mexico and the Caribbean, according to Karen Clark & Co., a Boston-based firm that works with insurance companies to estimate disaster costs. It calculated a flash estimate Thursday of $2.7 billion in privately insured U.S. losses, along with $510 million in the Caribbean and $90 million in Mexico. The estimate is only for insured properties and does not include homes covered by the U.S. National Flood Insurance Program, so total losses will be higher. ___ Associated Press writers David Sharp in

(AP) -- The remnants of Hurricane Beryl dumped heavy rain on Vermont, causing flooding that washed away an apartment building, knocked out bridges and cut off towns, and retraumatized a state still recovering from catastrophic flooding that hit a year ago to the day. At least one person died.\n\nRoads were flooded, washed out or covered with debris after heavy rain that started Wednesday and persisted into Thursday. Rescues continued late into the night, and some communities were under evacuation orders.\n\nIn Plainfield, residents of a six-unit apartment building had only 15 minutes to evacuate before the entire structure was swept away by floodwaters that also took out at least seven bridges and left many roads impassable and people stranded, said town Emergency Management Director Michael Billingsley. One car was swept away, but the occupant escaped, he said.\n\n\"It's not lost on any of us the irony of the flood falling on the one-year anniversary to the day when many towns were hit last year. I know that only adds to the emotion many are feeling this morning,\" Gov. Phil Scott told reporters Thursday, adding that the state's \"response and tools are only stronger\" as a result of the tragedy a year ago.\n\nThe death came in the community of Peacham, officials said.\n\nPublic Safety Commissioner Jennifer Morrison urged people to continue to take precautions and stay out of the water, even as temperatures rise and make it temping to take a dip. \"Regardless of river levels, our waterways are not safe right now. Currents are fast and there is a tremendous amount of flood debris in the water,\" she said.\n\nThe deluge dropped more than 6 inches (15 centimeters) of rain on parts of Vermont, and the heaviest rainfall was in areas hit hard a year ago, said Marlon Verasamy, of the National Weather Service in Burlington. But the damage was not as widespread across the entire state as it was a year ago, he said.\n\nHilary Conant, who fled her second-floor Plainfield apartment, said she also had to flee rising waters a year ago.\n\n\"The water was coming up, so I knew it was time to leave with my dog. It's very retraumatizing,\" she said. A neighbor offered a camper to temporarily house her.\n\nArt Edelstein assessed the destruction Thursday morning around a home he has owned for 50 years and now rents to tenants.\n\n\"I don't even know how much water came from where because it's just mud everywhere,\" he said. \"This is, in my impression, catastrophic. I've just never seen anything like this.\"\n\nIn the small community of Moretown, the damage appeared worse than it was a year ago, and the school was among buildings once again damaged by floodwaters, said Tom Martin, chair of the town board. Workers hoped to install a temporary bridge Thursday on the main artery that provides access to the community, he said.\n\n\"They say we're Vermont strong. We'll get through it,\" said Martin, his voice full of emotion.\n\nFlash flooding also closed roads in several northern New Hampshire communities, including Monroe, Dalton, Lancaster and Littleton, where officials said 20 people were temporarily stranded at a Walmart store and crews made water rescues.\n\nTwo tornadoes were confirmed Wednesday in western New York. Some areas in the northern part of the state got 4 inches (10 centimeters) or more of rain, causing water to rush down streets in the village of Lowville.\n\nParts of northern New York and New England, including Vermont, remained under flood watches or warnings early Thursday. Thunderstorms associated with Beryl were forecast for much of the East Coast through Friday, the National Weather Service said.\n\nThere were no immediate reports of any deaths in the region. Vermont emergency managers had urged residents Wednesday to seek higher ground if floodwaters approached and said rescue teams and the National Guard were at the ready.\n\nEven though Vermont is not a coastal state, it nonetheless has experience with tropical weather. Tropical Storm Irene dumped 11 inches (28 centimeters) of rain on parts of Vermont in 24 hours in 2011. The storm killed six in the state, washed homes off their foundations, and damaged or destroyed more than 200 bridges and 500 miles of highway.\n\nIn May, Vermont became the first state to enact a law requiring fossil fuel companies to pay a share of the damage caused by extreme weather fueled by climate change.\n\nRepublican Gov. Phil Scott allowed the bill to become law without his signature, saying he was concerned about the costs of a grueling legal fight. But he acknowledged that he understands something has to be done to address the toll of climate change.\n\nBeryl landed in Texas on Monday as a Category 1 hurricane and left millions in the Houston area without power. It then carved a path across the interior U.S. as a post-tropical cyclone that brought flooding and sometimes tornadoes from the Great Lakes to Canada and northern New England.\n\nBeryl has been blamed for at least seven U.S. deaths -- one in Louisiana and six in Texas -- and at least 11 in the Caribbean.

A tornado watch covers large areas when conditions are right for tornadoes to form.\n\nThe storm comes at ominous timing, on the anniversary of last July's flooding, but meteorologists are not expecting large rivers in Vermont to flood or damage to be anywhere as widespread as this time last year. The Ausable River in the Adirondacks is the only river in the region expected to reach flood stage.\n\n\"It's more of a flash floods threat where we see water where it's not supposed to be coming down hillsides, road washouts, things like that, not necessarily in the main river channels,\" Peter Banacos, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service office in Burlington, said Wednesday morning.\n\n\"That's a hard thing to articulate because we want people to take this seriously -- it's a serious flash flood threat, I just think it will be more localized\" Banacos said.\n\nThe storm comes as patches in the northern half of the state have high soil moisture levels following a wet spring and early summer, which makes runoff, and flash flooding, more likely.\n\nAreas in southern Vermont have a risk of isolated tornadoes. Banacos says this is something to be aware of, but not as much of a threat. \"They generally affect small areas in Vermont -- if we get tornadoes, they maybe only cover a couple of hundred yards,\" he said.\n\nThis storm is unusual for its intensity this early in the hurricane season. It briefly reached Category 5 status, fueled by warm ocean surface temperatures, largely due to human-caused climate change.\n\n\"We've never had a Category 5 storm, in the Atlantic basin at least, this early in the hurricane season,\" Banacos said.\n\nBeryl has killed several people and left millions without power, and has caused inland flooding and isolated tornadoes in recent days.\n\nThat's the concern in Vermont, and Banacos advises drivers to be cautious on roads later today and to avoid driving or walking through floodwaters.\n\nAt a press conference Tuesday, state Public Safety Commissioner Jennifer Morrison also urged residents to take the following precautions:\n\nState officials at Vermont Emergency Management say they've been monitoring the storm for days and are now coordinating between the Agency of Transportation, the state's urban search and rescue teams, and the Agency of Human Services and the Red Cross about potential emergency shelters if people are displaced from their homes.\n\nThe focus of their efforts has been in the northern half of the state, but emergency responders are still watching the forecast to determine where they should be stationed, Mark Bosma, the public information officer with Vermont Emergency Management, said early Wednesday afternoon.\n\n\"Generally the search and rescue teams find either a fire station or some other municipal building on high ground where they will wait, and if it looks like the storm is shifting to another area of the state, they'll move to another station,\" he said.\n\nIn Montpelier, city officials say projected river heights from today's rain event won't be nearly high enough to imperil the homes and businesses that were inundated last July.\n\nMontpelier City Manager Bill Fraser said that as of about noon, forecasts from the National Weather Service indicated a peak height of 8 feet in the Winooski River, which flows through the city's downtown.\n\nThat's 7 feet below the level at which the city would experience minor flooding, and 13 feet below the river's peak height last summer.\n\n\"We're choosing to err on the side of caution and be fully prepared and let people know,\" Fraser said Wednesday. \"But we're not seeing anything right now that says we are going to be in for a major catastrophe.\"\n\nThose preparations include establishing an emergency shelter for unhoused people, as well as a shelter for residents who may become displaced if the river does jump its banks.\n\nThe city trucked in sandbags to the fire department early Wednesday for use by businesses or residents who want to gird against possible flood damage. Sandbags are also available at the Department of Public Works garage on Dog River Road.\n\nFor some, preparing for another storm has been a painful reminder of the flooding last year.\n\n\"It being the exact anniversary, even just as a responder, I have an uneasy feeling. Even though I know it's not going to be on the scale of last year, it does kind of bring it all back,\" Bosma said.\n\n\"Despite our hopes, we still have to prepare for the worst.\"", "source":

(AP) -- The remnants of Hurricane Beryl brought floodwaters to central Vermont that caused frantic evacuations, knocked down bridges and washed away an apartment building, a year to the day after catastrophic rainfall inundated some of the same parts of the state.\n\nRoads were flooded, washed out or covered with debris after heavy rain that started Wednesday and persisted into Thursday. Rescues continued late into the night, and some communities were under evacuation orders.\n\nIn Plainfield, residents of a six-unit apartment building had only 15 minutes to evacuate before the entire structure was swept away by floodwaters that also took out at least seven bridges and left many roads impassable and people stranded, said town Emergency Management Director Michael Billingsley. One car was swept away, but the occupant escaped, he said.\n\nHilary Conant, who fled her second-floor Plainfield apartment, said she also had to flee rising waters a year ago.\n\n\"The water was coming up, so I knew it was time to leave with my dog. It's very retraumatizing,\" she said. A neighbor offered a camper to temporarily house her.\n\nArt Edelstein assessed the destruction Thursday morning around a home he has owned for 50 years and now rents to tenants.\n\n\"I don't even know how much water came from where because it's just mud everywhere,\" he said. \"This is, in my impression, catastrophic. I've just never seen anything like this.\"\n\nIn the small community of Moretown, the damage appeared worse than it was a year ago, and the school was among buildings once again damaged by floodwaters, said Tom Martin, chair of the town board. Workers hoped to install a temporary bridge Thursday on the main artery that provides access to the community, he said.\n\n\"They say we're Vermont strong. We'll get through it,\" said Martin, his voice full of emotion.\n\nThe deluge dropped more than 6 inches (15 centimeters) of rain on parts of Vermont, and the heaviest was in areas hit hard a year ago, said Marlon Verasamy, of the National Weather Service in Burlington. But the damage was not as widespread across the entire state as it was a year ago, he said.\n\nFlash flooding also closed roads in several northern New Hampshire communities, including Monroe, Dalton, Lancaster and Littleton, where officials said 20 people were temporarily stranded at a Walmart store and crews made water rescues.\n\nTwo tornadoes were confirmed Wednesday in western New York. Some areas in the northern part of the state got 4 inches (10 centimeters) or more of rain, causing water to rush down streets in the village of Lowville.\n\nParts of northern New York and New England, including Vermont, remained under flood watches or warnings early Thursday. Thunderstorms associated with Beryl were forecast for much of the East Coast through Friday, the National Weather Service said.\n\nThere were no immediate reports of any deaths in the region. Vermont emergency managers had urged residents Wednesday to seek higher ground if floodwaters approached and said rescue teams and the National Guard were at the ready.\n\nEven though Vermont is not a coastal state, it nonetheless has experience with tropical weather. Tropical Storm Irene dumped 11 inches (28 centimeters) of rain on parts of Vermont in 24 hours in 2011. The storm killed six in the state, washed homes off their foundations, and damaged or destroyed more than 200 bridges and 500 miles of highway.\n\nIn May, Vermont became the first state to enact a law requiring fossil fuel companies to pay a share of the damage caused by extreme weather fueled by climate change.\n\nRepublican Gov. Phil Scott allowed the bill to become law without his signature, saying he was concerned about the costs of a grueling legal fight. But he acknowledged that he understands something has to be done to address the toll of climate change.\n\nBeryl landed in Texas on Monday as a Category 1 hurricane and left millions in the Houston area without power. It then carved a path across the interior U.S. as a post-tropical cyclone that brought flooding and sometimes tornadoes from the Great Lakes to Canada and northern New England.\n\nBeryl has been blamed for at least seven U.S. deaths -- one in Louisiana and six in Texas -- and at least 11 in the Caribbean. More than 1.3 million homes and businesses in Texas still lacked electricity early Thursday, down from a peak of over 2.7 million on Monday, according to PowerOutage.us.\n\nThe storm has caused at least $3.3 billion in damage in the United States, Mexico and the Caribbean, according to Karen Clark & Co., a Boston-based firm that works with insurance companies to estimate disaster costs.\n\nIt calculated a flash estimate Thursday of $2.7 billion in privately insured U.S. losses, along with $510 million in the Caribbean and $90 million in Mexico. The estimate is only for insured properties and does not include homes covered by the U.S. National Flood Insurance Program, so total losses will be higher.\n\nAssociated Press writers David Sharp in

Join our growing community of more than 28,000 Daily Digger subscribers today.\n\nOn July 10 last year, heavy rains that had begun the night before unleashed catastrophic floods across Vermont.\n\nThis Wednesday, exactly a year later, torrential downpours may once again threaten the state with flooding, according to a forecast issued Monday by the National Weather Service.\n\nThe culprit? The collision of Tropical System Beryl with the hot, humid air already hanging over the state, according to Seth Kutikoff, a meteorologist from the Burlington branch of the National Weather Service.\n\n\"This fuels heavy rain and thunderstorms,\" said Kutikoff.\n\nAnd although the current expectation is a widespread 1 to 2 inches of rain -- with some areas getting 2 to 4 inches -- there \"are increasing indications\" the state could see up to 4 to 6 inches between Wednesday and Friday mornings, according to the weather service, \"with isolated 6 to 8 inches\" in some towns.\n\nIf that materializes, the rainfall \"would be comparable\" to the 3 to 9 inches that fell during a 48-hour-period last July, causing widespread flooding throughout the state, according to the weather service forecast.\n\nA big concern, according to Kutikoff, is that much of northern Vermont has seen twice the amount of rainfall it typically gets around this time of year. Similar conditions were present ahead of last summer's flooding.\n\n\"The soil in some localized areas can't absorb any more water,\" said Kutikoff.\n\nStill, Kutikoff emphasized that, as of Monday, it remained a worst-case scenario that this week's flooding could rival last summer's.\n\n\"We are not expecting anywhere near the coverage and total amounts of rain we saw last year,\" he said.\n\nThe most likely outcome is isolated flash floods in areas that sustain the most rain, according to Kutikoff. He is keeping his eye on an east-west line running from Essex County through southern Orleans, Caledonia, Lamoille and Chittenden counties.\n\n\"That doesn't mean there will be flash floods there, just that that's where the highest risk of them is,\" said Kutikoff.\n\nKutikoff said the public should not be too concerned about seeing something on the scale of last summer. But he recommended that people take precautions, such as avoiding roads at risk of flash flooding on Wednesday and Thursday and check the NWS forecasts frequently, since conditions could change for better or for worse.\n\n\"There's still a chance that the heavier rains go up to southern Canada, and there's still a possibility that rainfall could increase over Vermont,\" said Kutikoff.", "source": {"uri": "vtdigger.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "VTDigger"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Flood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vermont", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vermont"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Vermont"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Weather_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National Weather Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burlington,_Vermont", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Burlington, Vermont"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Burlington, Vermont"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thunderstorm", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Thunderstorm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_flood", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Flash flood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "County (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamoille_County,_Vermont", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lamoille County, Vermont"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Lamoille County, Vermont"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chittenden_County,_Vermont", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chittenden County, Vermont"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chittenden County, Vermont"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caledonia_County,_Vermont", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Caledonia County, Vermont"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Caledonia County, Vermont"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essex_County,_New_Jersey", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Essex County, New Jersey"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Essex County, New Jersey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Atmospheric_Sciences", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Atmospheric Sciences", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/GR_CfECaEAAHwHa.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9724461", "eventUri": "eng-9724461", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-10", "textStart": 159, "textEnd": 166}], "sentiment": -0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 176, "relevance": 1}

(AP) -- The remnants of Hurricane Beryl dumped heavy rain on Vermont, causing flooding that washed away an apartment building, knocked out bridges and cut off towns, and retraumatized a state still recovering from catastrophic flooding that hit a year ago to the day. At least one person died.\n\nRoads were flooded, washed out or covered with debris after heavy rain that started Wednesday and persisted into Thursday. Rescues continued late into the night, and some communities were under evacuation orders.\n\nIn Plainfield, residents of a six-unit apartment building had only 15 minutes to evacuate before the entire structure was swept away by floodwaters that also took out at least seven bridges and left many roads impassable and people stranded, said town Emergency Management Director Michael Billingsley. One car was swept away, but the occupant escaped, he said.\n\nPeople are also reading...

I know that only adds to the emotion many are feeling this morning,\" Gov. Phil Scott told reporters Thursday, adding that the state's \"response and tools are only stronger\" as a result of the tragedy a year ago.\n\nThe death came in the community of Peacham, officials said.\n\nPublic Safety Commissioner Jennifer Morrison urged people to continue to take precautions and stay out of the water, even as temperatures rise and make it temping to take a dip. \"Regardless of river levels, our waterways are not safe right now. Currents are fast and there is a tremendous amount of flood debris in the water,\" she said.\n\nThe deluge dropped more than 6 inches (15 centimeters) of rain on parts of Vermont, and the heaviest rainfall was in areas hit hard a year ago, said Marlon Verasamy, of the National Weather Service in Burlington. But the damage was not as widespread across the entire state as it was a year ago, he said.\n\nHilary Conant, who fled her second-floor Plainfield apartment, said she also had to flee rising waters a year ago.\n\n\"The water was coming up, so I knew it was time to leave with my dog. It's very retraumatizing,\" she said. A neighbor offered a camper to temporarily house her.\n\nArt Edelstein assessed the destruction Thursday morning around a home he has owned for 50 years and now rents to tenants.\n\n\"I don't even know how much water came from where because it's just mud everywhere,\" he said. \"This is, in my impression, catastrophic. I've just never seen anything like this.\"\n\nIn the small community of Moretown, the damage appeared worse than it was a year ago, and the school was among buildings once again damaged by floodwaters, said Tom Martin, chair of the town board. Workers hoped to install a temporary bridge Thursday on the main artery that provides access to the community, he said.\n\n\"They say we're Vermont strong. We'll get through it,\" said Martin, his voice full of emotion.\n\nFlash flooding also closed roads in several northern New Hampshire communities, including Monroe, Dalton, Lancaster and Littleton, where officials said 20 people were temporarily stranded at a Walmart store and crews made water rescues.\n\nTwo tornadoes were confirmed Wednesday in western New York. Some areas in the northern part of the state got 4 inches (10 centimeters) or more of rain, causing water to rush down streets in the village of Lowville.\n\nParts of northern New York and New England, including Vermont, remained under flood watches or warnings early Thursday. Thunderstorms associated with Beryl were forecast for much of the East Coast through Friday, the National Weather Service said.\n\nVermont emergency managers had urged residents Wednesday to seek higher ground if floodwaters approached and said rescue teams and the National Guard were at the ready.\n\nEven though Vermont is not a coastal state, it nonetheless has experience with tropical weather. Tropical Storm Irene dumped 11 inches (28 centimeters) of rain on parts of Vermont in 24 hours in 2011. The storm killed six in the state, washed homes off their foundations, and damaged or destroyed more than 200 bridges and 500 miles of highway.\n\nIn May, Vermont became the first state to enact a law requiring fossil fuel companies to pay a share of the damage caused by extreme weather fueled by climate change.\n\nRepublican Gov. Phil Scott allowed the bill to become law without his signature, saying he was concerned about the costs of a grueling legal fight. But he acknowledged that he understands something has to be done to address the toll of climate change.\n\nBeryl landed in Texas on Monday as a Category 1 hurricane and left millions in the Houston area without power. It then carved a path across the interior U.S. as a post-tropical cyclone that brought flooding and sometimes tornadoes from the Great Lakes to Canada and northern New England.\n\nBeryl has been blamed for at least seven U.S. deaths -- one in Louisiana and six in Texas -- and at least 11 in the Caribbean. More than 1.3 million homes and businesses in Texas still lacked electricity early Thursday, down from a peak of over 2.7 million on Monday, according to PowerOutage.us.\n\nThe storm has caused at least $3.3 billion in damage in the United States, Mexico and the Caribbean, according to Karen Clark & Co., a Boston-based firm that works with insurance companies to estimate disaster costs.\n\nIt calculated a flash estimate Thursday of $2.7 billion in privately insured U.S. losses, along with $510 million in the Caribbean and $90 million in Mexico. The estimate is only for insured properties and does not include homes covered by the U.S. National Flood Insurance Program, so total losses will be higher.\n\nAssociated Press writers David Sharp in Maine, Holly Ramer in New Hampshire and Seth Borenstein in Washington contributed to this report.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Join our growing community of more than 28,000 Daily Digger subscribers today.\n\nAs the last spasms of Tropical Storm Beryl head toward Vermont -- a year after last summer's devastating floods -- meteorologists are increasingly confident that the incoming clouds will loosen a quick, heavy downpour on the state.\n\nSo quick, in fact, that the storm appears unlikely to result in the widespread flooding of last July, according to a forecast issued Tuesday morning by the National Weather Service. Rather, it is more likely to cause flash floods wherever rain is heaviest.\n\n\"Last year it was a marathon. This year it's more of a sprint,\" said Robert Haynes, a meteorologist at the Burlington branch of the National Weather Service.\n\nThe bulk of the rain is expected to fall Wednesday afternoon and night, according to the forecast, with most of the state getting 1-3 inches. That's a far cry from the 3-9 inches that fell over two days last July. The issue this time around, according to Haynes, is that the rain is likely to strike in a shorter, 6- to 12-hour window.\n\n\"We're looking at less rain, but in a shorter time-frame,\" Haynes said. \"So, that would mean flash flooding in narrower regions, rather than statewide.\"\n\nThere could, however, be parts of the state that receive 3-4 inches, and within those, \"there\n\ncould be a few spots that approach 5 inches,\" according to the forecast. If those quantities materialize, the forecast warns about the possibility of \"additional flooding across low-lying plains and roads,\" on top of the flash flooding worries.\n\nThough the when and how much of the storm are relatively clear at this point, pinpointing exactly where the heaviest rains will strike remains a challenge, according to Haynes. The major issue, he said, is the difference between the two types of prediction models the weather service uses for its forecasts.\n\nThe global-scale models, which cover the entirety of the planet, place the heaviest rains in the north of the state, along the Canadian border. But the larger scope of those models means they have lower resolution for specific regions, and as such they \"can't really resolve things like thunderstorms,\" according to Haynes.\n\nThe high-resolution regional models differ widely, placing the heaviest rains in southern Vermont. But though these models \"give you a better sense of the maximum precipitation amounts,\" according to Haynes, they're still quite iffy when it comes to accurately predicting location.\n\n\"Our current forecast is a blend between the two,\" said Haynes.\n\nTim Humphrey, a meteorologist with the weather service's Albany, New York office, which covers southern Vermont, said that until the storm came closer, the discrepancies between the models would persist.\n\n\"Once we get into that 24-hour time frame we should have much more certainty,\" said Humphrey.\n\nOne thing the models do agree on is that the skies should clear up fast on Thursday, with dry air scattering the rain. But with the soil in central and northern Vermont having absorbed \"150-200% above normal\" rain levels in the past 40 days, runoff could make the rivers rise.\n\nAccording to the forecast, \"a reasonable worst case scenario would support the potential for minor flooding at the Mad River at Moretown, the Winooski River at Essex Junction, Otter Creek at Center Rutland and the East Branch Ausable River at Ausable Forks.\"\n\nHaynes recommended drivers avoid roads at risk of flooding, such as North Williston Road in Essex Junction and South Creek Road in Rutland.\n\nHaynes put the chances of that worst-case scenario panning out at 10%.", "source": {"uri": "vtdigger.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "VTDigger"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorologist", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Meteorologist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_flood", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Flash flood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Flood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vermont", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vermont"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Vermont"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Weather_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National Weather Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burlington,_Vermont", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Burlington, Vermont"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Burlington, Vermont"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moretown,_Vermont", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Moretown, Vermont"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Moretown, Vermont"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winooski_River", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Winooski River"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ausable_River_(New_York)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ausable River (New York)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otter_Creek_(Vermont)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Otter Creek (Vermont)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada\u2013United_States_border", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Canada\u2013United States border"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_runoff", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Surface runoff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Soil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thunderstorm", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Thunderstorm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "River"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precipitation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Precipitation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Williston,_North_Dakota", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Williston, North Dakota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Williston, North Dakota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rutland_(city),_Vermont", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rutland (city), Vermont"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rutland (city), Vermont"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essex_Junction,_Vermont", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Essex Junction, Vermont"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Essex Junction, Vermont"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albany,_New_York", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Albany, New York"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Albany, New York"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Atmospheric_Sciences", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Atmospheric Sciences", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/QPF_72hr.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9724461", "eventUri": "eng-9724461", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.04313725490196074, "wgt": 168, "relevance": 1}

Around mid-afternoon Wednesday, the main body of clouds will break over Vermont, according to a forecast from the National Weather Service, pelting broad swaths of the state with 1.5-3 inches of rain in less than 12 hours.\n\nThe hardest-hit places could get nearly double those amounts, though \"where the heaviest rain axis is going to set up is still uncertain,\" according to Robert Haynes, a meteorologist with the weather service.\n\nThe high chance of heavy rains has led the weather service to elevate much of the state to a Moderate Risk Outlook, indicating \"a 40-70 percent chance for rainfall rates to exceed flash flood guidance,\" according to the forecast.\n\nAnd at noon on Wednesday, the NWS also put 12 Vermont counties on a tornado watch until 9 p.m.\n\n\"There's going to be a pocket of southern Vermont, south of Middlebury onwards, where strong gusts of wind give the small possibility of tornadoes,\" Haynes said. \"But we want people to be most worried about the flash flood potential.\"\n\nWherever the rain is heaviest, damage to property from flash floods will become a real possibility, he said.\n\n\"Everywhere you get 3-5 inches, you could get water entering homes and businesses, basements,\" Haynes said.\n\nAnd the strip of land that got rained on last night -- parts of Rutland, Addison, Washington, and Caledonia counties -- \"will be particularly vulnerable today,\" according to Haynes.\n\n\"We'll be watching for rainfall rates of 1 and \u2153 inches per hour in that area,\" he said.\n\nShould that come about, those places could get flash floods washing out roads, according to Haynes.\n\n\"Turn around, don't drown,\" he said, urging caution. \"Two thirds of flood deaths are from people driving into flooded roads.\"\n\nVermont Emergency Management announced in a press release that it is activating the State Emergency Operations Center, which acts as a hub to coordinate the government's response to emergencies, on Wednesday afternoon.\n\nThe state's urban search and rescue teams are \"staging ahead of the storm\" and plan to \"move with the storm\" to cover the hardest-hit areas, according to the release. The Vermont National Guard will assist them, according to the release.\n\nAccording to Haynes, \"areas near low-lying creeks and streams, areas in bowls where water likes to flow quickly\" are particularly vulnerable. This includes towns such as Barre, he said, which are \"very flashy due to how water funnels into them.\"\n\nIn neighboring Montpelier, the city announced that \"out of an abundance of caution\" it had made sandbags available \"for properties in the immediate downtown area\" to defend against flash flooding.\n\nThough these preparations are reasonable, Haynes said, \"we're not dealing with a situation where the town of Montpelier is under water like last year.\"\n\nMontpelier is not alone in readying for the worst. Richmond Town Manager Josh Arneson said the town had shut off the pump to its well, to keep the drinking water clean in case the Winooski river floods. He also said the highway department had \"checked the roadside ditches and culverts to make sure they're free of obstruction.\"\n\n\"They've got everything fueled up and ready to go should they need to respond if there's anything happening with road closures or any corrosion on the roads,\" said Arneson.\n\nBut where exactly the storms will unleash their greatest fury is still a mystery, according to Haynes.\n\nFrom noon until 4 p.m. people should expect a feint, Haynes said, with scattered showers and some thunder. Around 7 p.m, the downpour is expected to start in earnest, with widespread rains smothering most of the state until about 4 a.m. Thursday morning.\n\nAfter that, the attention will likely turn to the rivers, as the rain runoff begins to make them swell up the banks, cresting early to late tomorrow morning, according to Haynes.\n\n\"Most of the rivers can manage this rain,\" said Haynes. He believed the risk of minor river floods remained low, around 10%.\n\nHaynes said he understood Vermonters' concern, though, especially on the anniversary of last summer's devastating floods. However, he urged them to remain optimistic that history will not repeat itself.\n\n\"Yes, today is a day we will experience scattered to numerous flash floods, but it won't be anywhere near as bad.\"", "source": {"uri": "vtdigger.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "VTDigger"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Weather_Service", "type": "wiki",

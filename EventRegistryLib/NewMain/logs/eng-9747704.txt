That list includes Atlanta; Boulder, Colorado; Cincinnati, Ohio; Louisville, Kentucky; Park City/Salt Lake City, Utah; and Santa Fe, New Mexico. Up next: Sundance Institute selection committee members will travel to those cities in coming weeks for site visits with a final location expected to be announced by year's end or during the first quarter of 2025.\n\nThe six finalists represent the roster that surfaced following a request for proposals that closed on June 21. As part of its evaluation, the Institute assessed \"infrastructure, ethos and equity values, event capabilities to host the festival, and how each finalist could sustainably serve and support the ever-growing Sundance Film Festival community of independent artists and audiences,\" per the festival.\n\nIt's understood that the exploratory process will include a commitment for a long-term deal wherever the fest finds a home, and key to the discussions will be making sure that wherever it goes there will be transportation, adequate theater venues, hotels and lodging, and a community ready and willing to embrace the influx that comes with hosting thousands of film-lovers, auteurs and industry insiders.\n\n\"As we very carefully consider this important decision for our festival, we believe these six finalists allow us the best opportunity to not only secure a sustainable future for our festival, but also to build upon its legacy while continuing to support the next generation of storytellers and highlight bold new works of art,\" said Ebs Burnough, Sundance Institute board chair, and Amanda Kelso, Sundance Institute acting CEO in a joint statement. \"We are grateful to all the communities who have expressed interest and been a part of the process, and we have valued the opportunity to learn about the uniqueness of each location. We look forward to the site visits in each of the finalist cities.\"\n\nSundance festival director and director of programming Eugene Hernandez said the process included \"lively, creative, and supportive conversations\" with a host of elected officials including governors, mayors, arts advocates, film commissioners and other local leaders. \"Getting to six finalists was a difficult decision. Each of these cities has a vibrant creative ecosystem, either expanding or established, and has enabled creativity to flourish in their cities through their support of the arts. These cities understand our ethos, are aligned with our key values, and have shown us interesting possibilities for partnership with our festival -- for our artists, audiences, and all who want to be a part of the Sundance Film Festival -- and that makes us want to see more.\"\n\nAs part of today's reveal, the Sundance Institute distributed statements from a leader representing each city. Those statements are below.\n\n\"Atlanta is a diverse and inclusive city of creatives, thinkers, artists and storytellers who are aligned with the core values of the Sundance Film Festival and who want to see Atlanta add to the legacy of Sundance,\" said Mayor Andre Dickens. \"As we move through this process, we will continue to shine a light on the art, culture and unique attributes of Atlanta in hopes of winning the opportunity to engage and inspire the next generation of Sundance filmmakers and attendees.\" -- Mayor Andre Dickens\n\n\"I am so excited that Colorado is a finalist to host the Sundance Film Festival. With the beautiful backdrop of the Flatirons, Boulder's historical ties to the Redford Family, and the capacity to support a growing, inclusive festival, we are confident that Boulder, Colorado is the right home for the Sundance Film Festival. I am thrilled the Sundance Institute recognizes the potential in relocating to my hometown and look forward to the many benefits this would bring to the entire state, as well as to the Festival.\"\n\n- Governor Jared Polis\n\n\"For over a generation, with consistent support from the City of Cincinnati, Film Cincinnati has positioned the Cincinnati region as a go-to community for movies,\" said Cincinnati Mayor Aftab Pureval. \"We know how to nurture creative talent and the skilled workers behind the scenes, and we know how to celebrate them when they are on the big screen.

Both Cincinnati and the Sundance Film Festival are on the precipice for great change and we look forward to partnering and evolving together.\" -- Mayor Aftab Pureval\n\n\"The City of Louisville and its diverse arts community is proud to be a finalist city for the Sundance Film Festival.

Of course, the list also includes Sundance's current home in Park City, Utah, but the decision to include Salt Lake City on the list echoes a recent report that Utah's plan was to spread the festival out across the two locations more than the festival does currently.\n\nAll six cities submitted proposals as part of Sundance's formal Request for Proposal (RFP) process, which began in May and closed on June 21. Many other cities participated in the Request for Information (RFI) process that preceded this stage, but only a handful were asked to give submissions formally. Several reports suggested 15 cities had advanced to the RFP stage, but it's unclear exactly how many submitted proposals and what other cities were included in that search.\n\nNext up, the selection committee, comprised of Sundance board members and other leaders, will visit each city to review logistics and discuss the proposals in detail. The timeline for when the final decision will be announced has not changed and will take place either later this year or early next year.\n\nAn individual with knowledge of the selection committee's thinking says the group chose these six locations because of their variety of cultures and backgrounds, each with an ecosystem that supports artists and creativity. Some, such as Santa Fe and Atlanta, have a buzzing film community and are big production hubs, while some are leaders in other arts.\n\nThe selection committee will visit each location and consider how the city captures Sundance's key values and ethos (of the six, only Boulder and Park City are still cozy mountain towns) and whether it is a welcoming community in terms of values and the array of potential attendees.\n\nThe committee will evaluate the hotel options in the area to see if they can accommodate people of all demographic backgrounds. It will look at the city's footprint, its proximity to airports, natural spaces in the area that can be utilized and highlighted, how sustainable the cities can be, what infrastructure they already have in place in terms of venues, and other logistics that will shape everything a festival needs. And finally, they're looking for a city that can partner with the Sundance Institute in the long run.\n\nPricing and accessibility are expected key issues for Sundance, as IndieWire has reported about how expensive Park City and Telluride for its own festival have become in recent years, not just for guests but also filmmakers and other talent.\n\n\"For over 40 years, Sundance has supported, sustained, and helped shine an essential spotlight on independent filmmakers and their work. As we very carefully consider this important decision for our Festival, we believe these six finalists allow us the best opportunity to not only secure a sustainable future for our Festival, but also to build upon its legacy while continuing to support the next generation of storytellers and highlight bold new works of art,\" said Ebs Burnough, Sundance Institute's board chair, and Amanda Kelso, Sundance Institute's acting CEO. \"We are grateful to all the communities who have expressed interest and been a part of the process, and we have valued the opportunity to learn about the uniqueness of each location. We look forward to the site visits in each of the finalist cities.\"\n\n\"Throughout this process, we engaged in thoughtful, lively, creative, and supportive conversations with Governors, Mayors, arts advocates, film commissioners, and other local leaders from locations across the country. We've been buoyed by the tremendous enthusiasm and submissions from cities around the country and deeply appreciate the energy that went into each proposal,\" said Eugene Hernandez, Sundance's festival director and director of public programming. \"Getting to six finalists was a difficult decision. Each of these cities has a vibrant creative ecosystem, either expanding or established, and has enabled creativity to flourish in their cities through their support of the arts. These cities understand our ethos, are aligned with our key values, and have shown us interesting possibilities for partnership with our Festival -- for our artists, audiences, and all who want to be a part of the Sundance Film Festival -- and that makes us want to see more.\"\n\nFor now, the 2025 and 2026 Sundance will remain in Park City. Sundance's choice to explore a move coincides with the Slamdance Film Festival's recent decision to relocate from Park City to Los Angeles for its 2025 edition.\n\nBelow are some statements from public officials for each of the six bidding host cities as provided to IndieWire.\n\nAtlanta, GA statement from Mayor Andre Dickens:\n\n\"Atlanta is a diverse and inclusive city of creatives, thinkers, artists and storytellers who are aligned with the core values of the Sundance Film Festival and who want to see Atlanta add to the legacy of Sundance.

These cities understand our ethos, are aligned with our key values, and have shown us interesting possibilities for partnership with our festival -- for our artists, audiences, and all who want to be a part of the Sundance Film Festival -- and that makes us want to see more,\" Eugene Hernandez, festival director and director of public programming, said in a statement.\n\nThe festival will remain in Park City and Salt Lake City in 2025 and 2026.\n\nThe selection committee plans to visit each of the finalist cities in the coming weeks to further explore the possibilities. Though cities such as Cincinnati might not seem like obvious choices, the institute noted that city's strong independent film culture. Louisville, meanwhile, offers a longstanding arts and culture emphasis with a very diverse community. Santa Fe has a thriving film community and arts focus in a historic tourism location, while Boulder's focus on sustainability was also key to its selection. Atlanta scores high on the equity index and is a large film production hub with a skilled industry workforce. Organizers also noted that Salt Lake City and Park City have a thriving economy, a growing population and increasing diversity.\n\n\"For over 40 years, Sundance has supported, sustained, and helped shine an essential spotlight on independent filmmakers and their work. As we very carefully consider this important decision for our Festival, we believe these six finalists allow us the best opportunity to not only secure a sustainable future for our Festival, but also to build upon its legacy while continuing to support the next generation of storytellers and highlight bold new works of art,\" said Ebs Burnough, Sundance Institute Board Chair, and Amanda Kelso, Sundance Institute Acting CEO.\n\nHernandez continued, \"Throughout this process, we engaged in thoughtful, lively, creative, and supportive conversations with governors, Mayors, arts advocates, film commissioners, and other local leaders from locations across the country. We've been buoyed by the tremendous enthusiasm and submissions from cities around the country and deeply appreciate the energy that went into each proposal.\n\nElected officials also made the cases for Sundance to choose their regions. Atlanta Mayor Andre Dickens said, \"Atlanta is a diverse and inclusive city of creatives, thinkers, artists and storytellers who are aligned with the core values of the Sundance Film Festival and who want to see Atlanta add to the legacy of Sundance. As we move through this process, we will continue to shine a light on the art, culture and unique attributes of Atlanta in hopes of winning the opportunity to engage and inspire the next generation of Sundance filmmakers and attendees.\"\n\nColorado Governor Jared Polis said, \"I am so excited that Colorado is a finalist to host the Sundance Film Festival. With the beautiful backdrop of the Flatirons, Boulder's historical ties to the Redford Family, and the capacity to support a growing, inclusive festival, we are confident that Boulder, Colorado is the right home for the Sundance Film Festival. I am thrilled the Sundance Institute recognizes the potential in relocating to my hometown and look forward to the many benefits this would bring to the entire state, as well as to the Festival.\"\n\nCincinnati Mayor Aftab Pureval said, \"For over a generation, with consistent support from the city of Cincinnati, Film Cincinnati has positioned the Cincinnati region as a go-to community for movies,\" said Cincinnati Mayor Aftab Pureval. \"We know how to nurture creative talent and the skilled workers behind the scenes, and we know how to celebrate them when they are on the big screen. Easily accessible to so much of the U.S. population, the Queen City is also a big league city for broader tourism, handling major events with professionalism and capacity. Both Cincinnati and the Sundance Film Festival are on the precipice for great change and we look forward to partnering and evolving together.\"\n\nLouisville Mayor Craig Greenberg said, \"The City of Louisville and its diverse arts community is proud to be a finalist city for the Sundance Film Festival. Our rich history hosting world-class events, growing film industry, and commitment to sustainability position us as a perfect stage for the Festival's future. We are home to the greatest two minutes in sports and we are ready to host the greatest 10 days in film.\"\n\nPark City Mayor Nann Worel and Salt Lake City Mayor Erin Mendenhall and Salt Lake County's Jenny Wilson said in a joint statement, \"We've been fortunate to host the Sundance Film Festival and witness some of the greatest films made over the past 40 years. And now, we are committed to working in partnership on a new vision of 'Two Cities, One Experience' with a shared goal of reinvigorating the Festival with an even greater tradition for storytelling over the next 40 years. At the heart of our proposal is a commitment to ensuring it remains an inspiring showcase of independent film, bringing together audiences and creators from all walks of life.\"\n\nSanta Fe Mayor Alan Webber: \"Santa Fe and the Sundance Film Festival are a natural fit. Our shared values of inclusion, sustainability, and diversity have long been hallmarks of both our community and the Festival's independent spirit. Santa Fe will provide an authentic, unique, and inspiring home for storytellers of all kinds. Sundance's sense of purpose and Santa Fe's sense of place make this a partnership waiting to happen.\"\n\nBest of Variety\n\nNew Movies Out Now in Theaters: What to See This Week\n\nAwards Season Calendar (2024-2025): Key Dates and Timeline for Oscars, Emmys, Golden Globes, Grammys, SAG and More\n\nHere's Where To Buy Retro Arcade1Up Cabinets To Re-Live Your Childhood Online\n\nSign up for Variety's Newsletter.

Last month, after we unveiled the 15 cities that had summited proposals, Georgia Senator Raphael Warnock exclusively spoke with Deadline about his desire that \"the folks at Sundance have the clarity of perspective to recognize that it would be in their best interest to bring the festival to Georgia.\"\n\nOf course, even with the obvious need for Park City to grow to meet the evolving needs of a 21st century Sundance, the Hollywood South of Atlanta and the other four candidates still have to overcome the possible hometown advantage of Utah. Coming in with a self titled unified \"Two Cities, One Experience\" bid, the Beehive State has been widely seen as the one to beat almost ever since Sundance announced back in April that it was taking proposals on a move after a rocky last few years.\n\n\"'Two Cities, One Experience' leverages what has worked for the last 40 years with our dedicated funding assistance, our amazing volunteers, and of course this world-class venue we call home,\" Park City Mayor Nann Worel told Deadline today. \"From the beginning, this has been an all-hands-on-deck approach to keep Sundance in Utah and that is reflected in this exciting new vision,\" the mayor added.\n\nSeeing a bit of drop from previous pre-pandemic years, the 2023 SFF brought in more than $118 million to Utah's GNP, according to the most recent data. Getting more specific, and not counting the prestige and massive media presence, Sundance delivered $12.3 million in tax revenue to the state coffers, $96 million in spending by out-of-state visitors, and $63 million in wages.\n\nWhile the likes of Boulder have said that they would inject $2 million into the fest if they were to win the bid, the Utah effort is based to some degree on the long established tax breaks and infrastructure the state has provided Sundance for decades. Looking for maximum bang for their bucks, the new Utah bid also offers what officials are terming a \"restructuring\" of their present investment of the $4 million the festival receives directly from government sources and the $2 million \"in cash and in-kind support\" that comes from donors, both individual and corporate.\n\nWith all that in mind, the Sundance Institute selection committee is planning site visits to all the contenders in the \"coming weeks to further explore the possibilities of hosting the Festival,\" according to organizers. A bit of a state secret, that committee is said to include Sundance board member Amy Redford, recently installed CEO Amanda Kelso and the Festival Director and Director of Public Programming Eugene Hernandez.\n\n\"Getting to six finalists was a difficult decision,\" stated Sundance's Hernandez Friday\n\n\"Each of these cities has a vibrant creative ecosystem, either expanding or established, and has enabled creativity to flourish in their cities through their support of the arts,\" the Festival Director added \"These cities understand our ethos, are aligned with our key values, and have shown us interesting possibilities for partnership with our Festival -- for our artists, audiences, and all who want to be a part of the Sundance Film Festival -- and that makes us want to see more.\"\n\nStill, plan to book your tickets for Utah for next year as the 2025 Sundance Film Festival will be lighting u screens in Park City and SLC from January 23 - February 2, 2025.", "source":

Easily accessible to so much of the US population, the Queen City is also a big league city for broader tourism, handling major events with professionalism and capacity. Both Cincinnati and the Sundance Film Festival are on the precipice for great change and we look forward to partnering and evolving together.\"\n\nThe Sundance Film Festival is part of the Sundance Institute, which was founded by Robert Redford in 1981 to support, sustain and discover independent filmmakers and storytellers. The festival just celebrated its 40th year in 2023. The festival took over what was then known as the Utah/U.S. Film Festival.\n\nThe Sundance Film Festival is typically held each year in January. The festival has featured films and episodic works like Won't You Be My Neighbor?, Little Miss Sunshine, Reservoir Dogs, Hereditary and more.\n\nThe impact of movies filmed in Cincinnati area grows

The snowy mountain town, along with Salt Lake City, will still be home to the 2025 and 2026 festivals, and the Utah cities are one of the six options for future festivals.\n\nThe other five finalists are Atlanta; Cincinnati; Boulder, Colorado; Louisville, Kentucky, and Santa Fe, New Mexico. These cities are moving along in the selection process after a competitive request for proposal phase that started in May and saw submissions from across the country.\n\nThe potential host cities were selected for their ability to support the film festival\u00b4s growth and they will continue to be evaluated on each city\u00b4s infrastructure, accessibility, event venues and logistical capabilities, as well as their alignment with Sundance\u00b4s values.\n\n\"As we very carefully consider this important decision for our Festival, we believe these six finalists allow us the best opportunity to not only secure a sustainable future for our Festival, but also to build upon its legacy while continuing to support the next generation of storytellers and highlight bold new works of art,\" said Ebs Burnough, Sundance Institute board chair, and Amanda Kelso, Sundance Institute acting CEO, in a joint statement.\n\n\"We are grateful to all the communities who have expressed interest and been a part of the process, and we have valued the opportunity to learn about the uniqueness of each location,\" the statement continued. \"We look forward to the site visits in each of the finalist cities.\"\n\nFILE - The marquee of the Egyptian Theatre appears during the Sundance Film Festival, Jan. 28, 2020, in Park City, Utah. (Photo by Arthur Mola/Invision/AP, File)\n\nSundance has long been a launching pad for independent filmmakers and has supported the early careers of Christopher Nolan, Quentin Tarantino and more. Festival winners often become some of the year\u00b4s most acclaimed films. Last year\u00b4s festival produced Celine Song\u00b4s \"Past Lives,\" nominated for best picture and best screenplay. Other Sundance titles to reach the Oscars include 2022 best picture winner \"CODA,\" \"Summer Of Soul (...Or, When The Revolution Could Not Be Televised)\" and \"Minari.\"\n\nThe Sundance Institute noted that each of the finalist cities have strong arts communities with varied cultural backgrounds and potential for growth. The Robert Redford-founded festival has grown significantly since its inception.\n\nRedford, who stepped back from the Sundance spotlight years ago, expressed concern in 2016 that the festival as it existed might have outgrown Park City and was thinking about ways to evolve. He and his daughter, Amy Redford, who is on the board, have been involved in the process according to an April announcement about the location search.\n\nMayors and governors from each of the selected cities have issued statements expressing their enthusiasm for the festival to move to their town (or remain there). Mayors Nann Worel of Park City, Erin Mendenhall of Salt Lake City and Jenny Wilson of Salt Lake County issued a statement that emphasizes the dual city hosting model, likely in response to concerns that Park City was no longer suitable for the ever-expanding festival.\n\n\"We are committed to working in partnership on a new vision of 'Two Cities, One Experience\u00b4 with a shared goal of reinvigorating the Festival with an even greater tradition for storytelling over the next 40 years,\" the mayor said in their statement.\n\nMembers of the Sundance Institute selection committee will visit each of the finalist cities in the coming weeks and a final decision is expected in early 2025.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"},

Finalist were also \"required to demonstrate how they would welcome and continue to foster the diverse Sundance community and culture of independent creativity that is an integral part of the Institute and Festival experience.\"\n\nMembers of the selection committee will visit Boulder and each of the other finalist cities \"in the coming weeks\" for further evaluation.\n\nMore: The Lyric, Fort Collins' independent movie theater and arts space, is up for sale\n\nThe 2025 and 2026 Sundance Film Festivals will remain in Park City and Salt Lake City, Utah, under terms of an existing contract with Park City. Any move to a new location would not take effect until 2027, organizers said.\n\n\"For over 40 years, Sundance has supported, sustained, and helped shine an essential spotlight on independent filmmakers and their work,\" Sundance Institute Board of Directors chair Ebs Burnough and acting CEO Amanda Kelso said in the news release. \"As we very carefully consider this important decision for our Festival, we believe these six finalists allow us the best opportunity to not only secure a sustainable future for our Festival, but also to build upon its legacy while continuing to support the next generation of storytellers and highlight bold new works of art.\"\n\nThe nonprofit Sundance Institute, which now sponsors the festival that began in 1978 in Salt Lake City, was founded by actor and activist Robert Redford in 1981 \"to support, sustain and discover independent filmmakers and storytellers,\" the news release said. The film festival, which is the Sundance Institute's main event, missed a few years along the way but celebrated its 40 showing last year.\n\nA record 17,435 films, including 4,410 feature-length film, from 153 countries or territories were submitted for the 2024 show, according to a news release from the Sundance Institute. Of those, 82 were shown at the festival, which ran from Jan. 18-28.\n\nSome of the more notable films introduced at the festival over the years include: \"CODA,\" \"O.J: Made in America,\" \"Whiplash,\" \"Precious,\" \"Little Miss Sunshine,\" \"An Inconvenient Truth,\" \"Napoleon Dynamite,\" \"Reservoir Dogs\" and \"Sex, Lies and Videotape.\"\n\nBoulder's bid was supported by the Colorado Economic Development Commission, which approved a one-time $1.5 million incentive to supplement cash and in-kind contributions from the city of Boulder and a coalition of regional partners, according to a news release from the office of Colorado Gov. Jared Polis. The Colorado Office of Economic Development and International Trade also backed Boulder's bid with a pledge of $325,000, including $250,000 from the Colorado Office of Film Television and Media over five years and one-time contributions of $50,000 from the Colorado Tourism Office and $25,000 from Colorado Creative Industries.\n\n\"I am so excited that Colorado is a finalist to host the Sundance Film Festival,\" Polis said in the state's news release. \"With the beautiful backdrop of the Flatirons, Boulder's historical ties to the Redford Family, and the capacity to support a growing, inclusive festival, we are confident that Boulder, Colorado, is the right home for the Sundance Film Festival. I am thrilled the Sundance Institute recognizes the potential in relocating to my hometown and look forward to the many benefits this would bring to the entire state, as well as to the festival.\"\n\nContact reporter Kelly Lyell at KellyLyell@coloradoan.com.

Along with the united Utah bid of Park City and Salt Lake City, the other final contenders for a revitalized Sundance are Atlanta, GA, Boulder, CO, Cincinnati, OH, Louisville, KY, and Santa Fe, NM.\n\nA civic leader in one of the possible new homes for the festival told Deadline today that his city intends to \"blow Sundance's mind with what we have here, and why they should move here.\" As various jurisdictions in a divided America bring in restrictive laws and regulations during this election year, Sundance brass are putting a distinct emphasis on \"key values\" of inclusion, equity, caring for the environment and a commitment to culture and independent film in particular.\n\nA final decision on if Sundance will be moving after the 2026 festival is expected any time from the fall to the end of the 2025 shindig, I hear with some inside Sundance pushing to get the news out there sooner rather than later. Under the current contract Sundance has, the 2025 and 2026 festivals will be held in Park City, with screenings in SLC and other Utah locales.\n\nNews that the Peach State metropolis and New Mexico's capital could become Sundance's new stomping ground were exclusively reported by Deadline as far back as last summer. Last month, after we unveiled the 15 cities that had summited proposals, Georgia Senator Raphael Warnock exclusively spoke with Deadline about his desire that \"the folks at Sundance have the clarity of perspective to recognize that it would be in their best interest to bring the festival to Georgia.\"\n\nOf course, even with the obvious need for Park City to grow to meet the evolving needs of a 21st century Sundance, the Hollywood South of Atlanta and the other four candidates still have to overcome the possible hometown advantage of Utah. Coming in with a self titled unified \"Two Cities, One Experience\" bid, the Beehive State has been widely seen as the one to beat almost ever since Sundance announced back in April that it was taking proposals on a move after a rocky last few years.\n\n\"'Two Cities, One Experience' leverages what has worked for the last 40 years with our dedicated funding assistance, our amazing volunteers, and of course this world-class venue we call home,\" Park City Mayor Nann Worel told Deadline today. \"From the beginning, this has been an all-hands-on-deck approach to keep Sundance in Utah and that is reflected in this exciting new vision,\" the mayor added.\n\nSeeing a bit of drop from previous pre-pandemic years, the 2023 SFF brought in more than $118 million to Utah's GNP, according to the most recent data. Getting more specific, and not counting the prestige and massive media presence, Sundance delivered $12.3 million in tax revenue to the state coffers, $96 million in spending by out-of-state visitors, and $63 million in wages.\n\nWhile the likes of Boulder have said that they would inject $2 million into the fest if they were to win the bid, the Utah effort is based to some degree on the long established tax breaks and infrastructure the state has provided Sundance for decades. Looking for maximum bang for their bucks, the new Utah bid also offers what officials are terming a \"restructuring\" of their present investment of the $4 million the festival receives directly from government sources and the $2 million \"in cash and in-kind support\" that comes from donors, both individual and corporate.\n\nWith all that in mind, the Sundance Institute selection committee is planning site visits to all the contenders in the \"coming weeks to further explore the possibilities of hosting the Festival,\" according to organizers. A bit of a state secret, that committee is said to include Sundance board member Amy Redford, recently installed CEO Amanda Kelso and the Festival Director and Director of Public Programming Eugene Hernandez.\n\n\"Getting to six finalists was a difficult decision,\" stated Sundance's Hernandez Friday\n\n\"Each of these cities has a vibrant creative ecosystem, either expanding or established, and has enabled creativity to flourish in their cities through their support of the arts,\" the Festival Director added \"These cities understand our ethos, are aligned with our key values, and have shown us interesting possibilities for partnership with our Festival -- for our artists, audiences, and all who want to be a part of the Sundance Film Festival -- and that makes us want to see more.\"\n\nStill, plan to book your tickets for Utah for next year as the 2025 Sundance Film Festival will be lighting u screens in Park City and SLC from January 23 - February 2, 2025.", "source":

One Experience.\"\n\nIn past years, the contract between Park City and the institute required 70% of all festival screenings to take place in Park City; Salt Lake City venues have made up most of the rest. According to a news release issued Friday by the Utah Film Commission, \"while the Festival has always held screenings and events outside Park City, the committee's plan expands that experience.\"\n\nUtah's bid, the commission said, also \"offers new ways to secure and expand upon\" the approximately $4 million in financial assistance that government entities now give the festival, as well as the $2 million in cash and in-kind support from local, corporate, foundation and individual donors.\n\nOther cities bidding have offered financial incentives in their bids. Atlanta reportedly pledged $2 million in financial incentives from the city and its partners. Boulder's bid included $1.5 million in incentive money from the state of Colorado.\n\nThe Sundance Film Festival's predecessor, the Utah/US Film Festival, launched in Salt Lake City in 1978. In 1981, it moved to Park City. Robert Redford founded the Sundance Institute the same year, as an incubator for independent filmmakers -- and in 1985, the institute took over operations of the festival to showcase those works. The name officially changed to the Sundance Film Festival in 1991.\n\nThe institute's current contract with Park City continues through the 2026 festival. The next festival is scheduled for Jan. 23 to Feb. 2, 2025, primarily in Park City but also at venues in Salt Lake City.\n\nIn May, Sundance opened a two-part process to \"explore viable locations in the United States to host\" the festival. The institute invited cities to file for a Request for Information (RFI), and then sent 15 selected cities Request for Proposals (RFP).\n\nAmong the 15 cities that didn't make the finalist list are: San Francisco; Nashville; Athens, Georgia; Savannah, Georgia; Portland, Oregon; and Minneapolis.\n\nThe film commission's release included a joint statement by Park City Mayor Nann Worel, Salt Lake City Mayor Erin Mendenhall and Salt Lake County Mayor Jenny Wilson, which reads:\n\n\"We've been fortunate to host the Sundance Film Festival and witness some of the greatest films made over the past 40 years. And now, we are committed to working in partnership on a new vision of 'Two Cities, One Experience' with a shared goal of reinvigorating the Festival with an even greater tradition for storytelling over the next 40 years. At the heart of our proposal is a commitment to ensuring it remains an inspiring showcase of independent film, bringing together audiences and creators from all walks of life.\"", "source": {"uri":

The festival has called Park City home for its entire 39-year history.\n\nIn April, the Sundance Institute began a process to consider other host locations starting in 2027. Its current contract is up for renewal starting that year.\n\nIt fielded proposals between May 7 and June 21. The State of Colorado announced Boulder's bid, which included more than $3 million in combined contributions by the city and the state, on June 20.\n\nDenver7 went in-depth on Boulder's bid last month. Read a full recap here. Will the Sundance Film Festival move to Boulder in 2027?\n\n\"As part of a thorough evaluation of each potential location, the Sundance Institute assessed each city's infrastructure, ethos and equity values, event capabilities to host the Festival, and how each finalist could sustainably serve and support the ever-growing Sundance Film Festival community of independent artists and audiences,\" the Sundance Institute said in its Friday announcement.\n\nBoulder was confident it could lure the festival because of the city's proximity to the mountains and outdoors, its event spaces and its walkability.\n\nColorado also has close ties to the actor Robert Redford, who founded the Sundance Institute in 1981. Redford attended CU Boulder for one year in the 1950s - and launched his career at the Historic Elitch Gardens Theatre in Denver.\n\n\"I am so excited that Colorado is a finalist to host the Sundance Film Festival,\" read a statement by Colorado Gov. Jared Polis in response to Friday's announcement. \"With the beautiful backdrop of the Flatirons, Boulder's historical ties to the Redford Family, and the capacity to support a growing, inclusive festival, we are confident that Boulder, Colorado is the right home for the Sundance Film Festival. I am thrilled the Sundance Institute recognizes the potential in relocating to my hometown and look forward to the many benefits this would bring to the entire state, as well as to the Festival.\"\n\nPolis had previously said the film festival would bring an estimated 40,000 to 50,000 people to Colorado, with an economic benefit of more than $100 million, if the bid was successful.\n\nRepresentatives from the Sundance Institute will visit the finalist cities \"in the coming weeks\" as a next step in determining the festival's future host.\n\nDenver7's sister station in Salt Lake City covered Sundance's announcement that it would consider other hosts. Watch that story in the video player below:\n\nSundance Film Festival considers allowing other cities to host\n\nA decision could come later this year or in early 2025.

The snowy mountain town, along with Salt Lake City, will still be home to the 2025 and 2026 festivals, and the Utah cities are one of the six options for future festivals.\n\nThe other five finalists are Atlanta; Cincinnati; Boulder, Colorado; Louisville, Kentucky, and Santa Fe, New Mexico. These cities are moving along in the selection process after a competitive request for proposal phase that started in May and saw submissions from across the country.\n\nThe potential host cities were selected for their ability to support the film festival's growth and they will continue to be evaluated on each city's infrastructure, accessibility, event venues and logistical capabilities, as well as their alignment with Sundance's values.\n\n\"As we very carefully consider this important decision for our Festival, we believe these six finalists allow us the best opportunity to not only secure a sustainable future for our Festival, but also to build upon its legacy while continuing to support the next generation of storytellers and highlight bold new works of art,\" said Ebs Burnough, Sundance Institute board chair, and Amanda Kelso, Sundance Institute acting CEO, in a joint statement.\n\n\"We are grateful to all the communities who have expressed interest and been a part of the process, and we have valued the opportunity to learn about the uniqueness of each location,\" the statement continued. \"We look forward to the site visits in each of the finalist cities.\"\n\nSundance has long been a launching pad for independent filmmakers and has supported the early careers of Christopher Nolan, Quentin Tarantino and more. Festival winners often become some of the year's most acclaimed films. Last year's festival produced Celine Song's \"Past Lives,\" nominated for best picture and best screenplay. Other Sundance titles to reach the Oscars include 2022 best picture winner \"CODA,\" \"Summer Of Soul (...Or, When The Revolution Could Not Be Televised)\" and \"Minari.\"\n\nThe Sundance Institute noted that each of the finalist cities have strong arts communities with varied cultural backgrounds and potential for growth. The Robert Redford-founded festival has grown significantly since its inception.\n\nRedford, who stepped back from the Sundance spotlight years ago, expressed concern in 2016 that the festival as it existed might have outgrown Park City and was thinking about ways to evolve. He and his daughter, Amy Redford, who is on the board, have been involved in the process according to an April announcement about the location search.\n\nMayors and governors from each of the selected cities have issued statements expressing their enthusiasm for the festival to move to their town (or remain there). Mayors Nann Worel of Park City, Erin Mendenhall of Salt Lake City and Jenny Wilson of Salt Lake County issued a statement that emphasizes the dual city hosting model, likely in response to concerns that Park City was no longer suitable for the ever-expanding festival.\n\n\"We are committed to working in partnership on a new vision of 'Two Cities, One Experience' with a shared goal of reinvigorating the Festival with an even greater tradition for storytelling over the next 40 years,\" the mayor said in their statement.\n\nMembers of the Sundance Institute selection committee will visit each of the finalist cities in the coming weeks and a final decision is expected in early 2025.", "source": {"uri": "washingtontimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Times"},

The snowy mountain town, along with Salt Lake City, will still be home to the 2025 and 2026 festivals, and the Utah cities are one of the six options for future festivals.\n\nThe other five finalists are Atlanta; Cincinnati; Boulder, Colorado; Louisville, Kentucky and Santa Fe, New Mexico. These cities are moving along in the selection process after a competitive request for proposal phase that started in May and saw submissions from across the country.\n\nthe potential host cities were selected for their ability to support the film festival's growth and they will continue to be evaluated on each city's infrastructure, accessibility, event venues and logistical capabilities, as well as their alignment with Sundance's values.\n\n\"As we very carefully consider this important decision for our Festival, we believe these six finalists allow us the best opportunity to not only secure a sustainable future for our Festival, but also to build upon its legacy while continuing to support the next generation of storytellers and highlight bold new works of art,\" said Ebs Burnough, Sundance Institute board chair, and Amanda Kelso, Sundance Institute acting CEO, in a joint statement.\n\n\"We are grateful to all the communities who have expressed interest and been a part of the process, and we have valued the opportunity to learn about the uniqueness of each location,\" the statement continued. \"We look forward to the site visits in each of the finalist cities.\"\n\nThe Sundance Institute noted that each of the finalist cities have strong arts communities with varied cultural backgrounds and potential for growth. The Robert Redford-founded festival has grown significantly since its inception, and\n\nRedford, who stepped back from the Sundance spotlight years ago, expressed concern in 2016 that the festival as it existed might have outgrown Park City and was thinking about ways to evolve. He and his daughter, Amy Redford, who is on the board, have been involved in the process according to an April announcement about the location search.\n\nMayors and governors from each of the selected cities have issued statements expressing their enthusiasm for the festival to move to their town (or remain there). Mayors Nann Worel of Park City, Erin Mendenhall of Salt Lake City and Jenny Wilson of Salt Lake County issued a statement that emphasizes the dual city hosting model, likely in response to concerns that Park City was no longer suitable for the ever-expanding festival.\n\n\"We are committed to working in partnership on a new vision of 'Two Cities, One Experience' with a shared goal of reinvigorating the Festival with an even greater tradition for storytelling over the next 40 years,\" the mayor said in their statement.\n\nMembers of the Sundance Institute selection committee will visit each of the finalist cities in the coming weeks and a final decision is expected in early 2025.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

The snowy mountain town, along with Salt Lake City, will still be home to the 2025 and 2026 festivals.\n\nThe other five finalists announced by the Sundance Film Institure are Atlanta; Cincinnati; Louisville, Kentucky; Santa Fe, New Mexico and its current home in Park City/Salt Lake City, Utah.\n\nThese cities are moving along in the selection process after a competitive request for proposal phase that started in May and saw submissions from across the country.\n\nThe potential host cities were selected for their ability to support the film festival's growth and they will continue to be evaluated on each city's infrastructure, accessibility, event venues and logistical capabilities, as well as their alignment with Sundance's values.\n\n\"As we very carefully consider this important decision for our Festival, we believe these six finalists allow us the best opportunity to not only secure a sustainable future for our Festival, but also to build upon its legacy while continuing to support the next generation of storytellers and highlight bold new works of art,\" said Ebs Burnough, Sundance Institute board chair, and Amanda Kelso, Sundance Institute acting CEO, in a joint statement.\n\nColorado officials announced last month that Boulder was bidding for the festiva.\n\nColorado hopes winning the bid could add hundreds of jobs and attract thousands of out-of-state visitors to Boulder and boost tourism for the city during the winter.\n\n\"With the Rocky Mountains as a backdrop and our deep commitment to the arts, we can help the Festival achieve even greater success while preserving what makes it special -- building on Colorado's iconic creative brand and our strong arts community,\" Gov.

State officials considered the number significant, as Utah gave $1.3 million in taxpayer money to the festival last year.\n\n\"Events like this, from my perspective, are a once in a lifetime opportunity to really bring something to Colorado that can have a long, lasting legacy and impact for our communities,\" said Eve Lieberman, OEDIT's executive director.\n\nState officials also believe

This includes directly interviewing sources and analyzing primary source documents.\n\nBoulder is one of six finalists to host the Sundance Film Festival beginning in 2027.\n\nAfter asking potential host cities to submit proposals, the Sundance Institute on Friday announced six potential new locations for the 10-day festival, which has been held in Park City, Utah, since it was created in 1985 by Robert Redford as a venue for up-and-coming filmmakers.\n\nIn a statement, Colorado Gov. Jared Polis, a Boulder resident, said he was \"so excited\" that Boulder made the cut for final review.\n\n\"With the beautiful backdrop of the Flatirons, Boulder's historical ties to the Redford family, and the capacity to support a growing, inclusive festival, we are confident that Boulder, Colorado, is the right home for the Sundance Film Festival,\" Polis said. \"I am thrilled the Sundance Institute recognizes the potential in relocating to my hometown and look forward to the many benefits this would bring to the entire state, as well as to the festival.\"\n\nBoulder is competing against bids from Atlanta, Cincinnati, Louisville, Kentucky, and Santa Fe, and a combined proposal from Park City and Salt Lake City.\n\nEbs Burnough, the chair of the Sundance Institute board, and Amanda Kelso, the acting CEO of the institute, issued a statement saying the six finalists offer a sustainable future for the festival and \"build upon its legacy while continuing to support the next generation of storytellers and highlight bold new works of art.\"\n\n\"For over 40 years, Sundance has supported, sustained, and helped shine an essential spotlight on independent filmmakers and their work,\" reads the joint statement, which noted that Sundance organizers would soon visit each of the cities.\n\nThe Colorado Economic Development Commission last month gave Boulder organizers a $1.5 million grant to help lure the Sundance Festival for 10 years beginning in 2027. The Boulder coalition includes Visit Boulder, city officials, the Boulder Chamber, the University of Colorado and the yet-to-be-built Stanley Film Center at the Stanley Hotel in Estes Park.\n\nLast year, state economic boosters put up $300,000 to help the hotel and Estes Park land the Sundance Institute Directors Lab for the next two years.\n\nLast month, Polis said \"the evolution from Park City to Boulder is a logical one\" for the film festival, noting that Redford attended CU Boulder.\n\nFilm industry champions in Colorado say the Sundance Film Festival could bring 40,000 to 50,000 visitors to Boulder and Denver in the middle of the typically slow season of late January and early February. The event could generate $5 million in annual tax revenue for Boulder with economic impacts reaching $50 million a year as attendees explore Colorado's winter landscapes beyond the festival.\n\nThe Office of Economic Development and International Trade said that number could be closer to $100 million, based on economic reports from Park City.", "source": {"uri": "coloradosun.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Colorado Sun"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jason_blevins@coloradosun.com", "name": "Jason Blevins", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sundance_Institute", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sundance Institute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sundance_Film_Festival", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sundance Film Festival"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boulder,_Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boulder, Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boulder, Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jared_Polis", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jared Polis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Redford", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Robert Redford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Park_City,_Utah", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Park City, Utah"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Park City, Utah"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_Lake_City", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Salt Lake City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Salt Lake City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Fe,_New_Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Santa Fe, New Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Santa Fe, New Mexico"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisville,_Kentucky", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Louisville, Kentucky"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Louisville, Kentucky"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Office (American TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Colorado_Boulder", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "University of Colorado Boulder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Independent film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_festival", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Film festival"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estes_Park,_Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Estes Park, Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Estes Park, Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Film_Festivals", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Film Festivals", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Festivals", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Festivals", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 86}], "image": "https://newspack-coloradosun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/AP24022184528449.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9747704", "eventUri": "eng-9747704", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3568627450980393, "wgt": 182, "relevance": 1}

The snowy mountain town, along with Salt Lake City, will still be home to the 2025 and 2026 festivals, and the Utah cities are one of the six options for future festivals.\n\nThe other five finalists are Atlanta; Cincinnati; Boulder, Colorado; Louisville, Kentucky and Santa Fe, New Mexico. These cities are moving along in the selection process after a competitive request for proposal phase that started in May and saw submissions from across the country.\n\nPeople are also reading...

The Robert Redford-founded festival has grown significantly since its inception, and\n\nRedford, who stepped back from the Sundance spotlight years ago, expressed concern in 2016 that the festival as it existed might have outgrown Park City and was thinking about ways to evolve. He and his daughter, Amy Redford, who is on the board, have been involved in the process according to an April announcement about the location search.\n\nMayors and governors from each of the selected cities have issued statements expressing their enthusiasm for the festival to move to their town (or remain there). Mayors Nann Worel of Park City, Erin Mendenhall of Salt Lake City and Jenny Wilson of Salt Lake County issued a statement that emphasizes the dual city hosting model, likely in response to concerns that Park City was no longer suitable for the ever-expanding festival.\n\n\"We are committed to working in partnership on a new vision of 'Two Cities, One Experience' with a shared goal of reinvigorating the Festival with an even greater tradition for storytelling over the next 40 years,\" the mayor said in their statement.\n\nMembers of the Sundance Institute selection committee will visit each of the finalist cities in the coming weeks and a final decision is expected in early 2025.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

They pointed to the new jobs and big tourism boost that the festival would bring.\n\n\"I am thrilled the Sundance Institute recognizes the potential in relocating to my hometown and look forward to the many benefits this would bring to the entire state, as well as to the festival,\" said Polis, who grew up in the Boulder area.\n\nHoffman says she \"welcomes the opportunity to work with a collaborative partner like the Sundance Institute, which we believe shares our commitment to elevating the arts and supporting local communities.\"\n\nThe proposal Boulder submitted includes a one-time $1.5 million incentive from the Colorado Economic Development Commission. The commission's executive director, Eve Lieberman, said she thinks the festival would be a great fit with Boulder.", "source": {"uri": "cbsnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boulder,_Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boulder, Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boulder, Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_Lake_City", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Salt Lake City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Salt Lake City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Park_City,_Utah", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Park City, Utah"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Park City, Utah"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Feature film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sundance_Institute", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sundance Institute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sundance_Film_Festival", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sundance Film Festival"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utah", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Utah"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Utah"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jared_Polis", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jared Polis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Fe,_New_Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Santa Fe, New Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Santa Fe, New Mexico"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisville,_Kentucky", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Louisville, Kentucky"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Louisville, Kentucky"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Film_Festivals", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Film Festivals", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Festivals", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Festivals", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 52}], "image": "https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/07/19/be5cff6d-d63d-4a3f-825c-dc007f2a9eff/thumbnail/1200x630/1759c2b4a709806197c56d4521cb1a71/sundance.jpg?v=5710b2ed1cee1bdfd30cb9c02455b43d", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9747704", "eventUri": "eng-9747704", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3568627450980393, "wgt": 171, "relevance": 1}

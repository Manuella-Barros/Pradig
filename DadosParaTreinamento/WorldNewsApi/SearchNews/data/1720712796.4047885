The ITV This Morning host said Lickey Hills Country Park was her go-to spot during a chat with fans. The presenter, who recently fronted For the Love of Dogs, let her Instagram followers throw questions at her on Sunday, June 9 as she said: \"Ask me anything.\" When asked what it was like working with the dogs at Battersea Dogs Home, she replied: \"I absolutely love it.\" She also told fans her interview with Harrison Ford and Ryan Gosling was \"the best\" and let slip plans to holiday in Florida this year, which she described as one of her \"favourite places ever\". But when it comes to the Midlands, a 524-acre park has Alison's heart.

Birmingham City Council describe it as one of the city's \"most varied and treasured parks\" which is a place for \"family days out, to spot wildlife, for sport, school trips, or maybe just for the views and a cup of tea\". Over on TripAdvisor, many seemed to agree with Alison as the park has a 4.5 star rating, based on more than 657 reviews. In a list of 425 things to do in Birmingham, it has been ranked at 15 on the site. A visitor from Glasgow left a review last summer, which read: \"Went a stroll through this lovely country park while on a coach trip, I could only explore a small section of the park but even this small section of the park took an hour to explore! A lot of nature and wildlife to see and appreciate here.\" One Brummie who left a review in March said it was an \"excellent place to walk either alone or with company\", adding it was \"busier at weekends\" and he preferred to go on \"weekdays, whatever the weather.\" Another local said they went \"every day\" and it was \"gorgeous\", offering \"lovely views of the Clent Hills\".", "summary": "The ITV This Morning host said Lickey Hills Country Park was her 'favourite place'", "url": "https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/showbiz-tv/itv-mornings-alison-hammond-reveals-29322934", "image": "https://i2-prod.birminghammail.co.uk/incoming/article29073939.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_alison.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 17:12:35", "author": "Kelly Ashmore", "authors": ["Kelly Ashmore"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": 0.058}

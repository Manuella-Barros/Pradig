He defeated Leo Bjorg, son of Bjorn Bjorg in straight sets in the previous round.\n\nNadal will also be partnering Carlos Alcaraz in Paris, so he has also teamed up with Casper Ruud in the men's doubles category. Nadal and Ruud defeated Theo Arribage, Roman Safiullin in the quarter-final, sealing a 6-4 3-6 12-10 win.\n\nAfter the match, Ruud was asked a funny question during the on-court interview. The interviewer asked \"Carlos is playing the Olympics with Rafa later on. Has he called you yet to ask for some tips?\"\n\nRuud quipped, \"Carlos? He's busy probably partying after winning Wimbledon so he has all the rights to enjoy and take some rest. If he wants I'm available on the phone.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Nadal hailed Ruud for their good partnership. \"It was an emotional match. Not easy to be on court after losing singles, but Casper played so well. Well done for him. We had some fun. A good level of tennis. We enjoyed it. The crowd was amazing. Full crowd in a doubles match. That's fantastic,\" he said.\n\nRuud had lost to Thiago Monteiro in his Round of 16 clash before the doubles match, losing 3-6 3-6 against the Brazilian.\n\nThis is also probably going to be Nadal's final Olympics, with 2024 expected to be his swansong year. If he clinches gold in Paris, what will make it better that it is being held on the clay courts of Roland Garros, where he has won the French Open a record 14 times.

The Spaniard staged a remarkable comeback to defeat Duje Ajdukovic 4-6, 6-3, 6-4 on Saturday afternoon at the Nordea Open, advancing to his first tour-level final since the 2022 Roland Garros.\n\nAfter a grueling four-hour battle against Mariano Navone on Friday in Bastad, Nadal needed time to find his rhythm in his first-ever encounter with Croatian qualifier Ajdukovic. Despite dropping serve in the opening game of the second set, Nadal elevated his performance, breaking Ajdukovic's serve five times across the final two sets to secure a two-hour, 13-minute semi-final victory.\n\nNadal mirrored his previous match against Navone by sealing the win despite losing a double-break lead in the deciding set. Ajdukovic fought back from 0-3 to 3-3, but Nadal immediately broke serve again and maintained his composure to clinch the match.\n\nStarting slowly on Saturday, Nadal ultimately delivered a more consistent performance compared to his match against Navone. He was particularly effective on return, converting all six break points against Ajdukovic.\n\nWith an 11-8 record for the season, Nadal will face either seventh seed Nuno Borges or Thiago Agustin Tirante in Sunday's final in Sweden. The 38-year-old is currently on a nine-match winning streak in Bastad, where he last won the trophy in 2005.\n\nNadal said that it was a tough match for him and Ajdukovic came in with a lot of confidence.

But yeah, I found a way to survive and be through to the final after a long time without being in a final. So that's great news and I'm very happy with that.\"\n\nThe tennis great added: \"Always is a great feeling to be back in the final, I won four matches in a row -- something I was not able to make that happen, probably since two years ago.\n\n\"A lot of things happened, that's the truth. And still in this process of recovering a lot of things that I lost because I had a very important hip surgery one, almost one year ago. So things are not going that easy.\n\n\"But I am fighting, I fighted during the whole tournament to be where I am today and I think matches like yesterday, like today, helps to improve a lot of things on court. So happy with that and let's see if I'm able to play a little bit better tomorrow.\"", "source": {"uri": "tennis365.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Tennis365.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ewan_west@tennis365.com", "name": "Ewan West", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_of_Tennis_Professionals", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Association of Tennis Professionals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Nadal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swedish_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Swedish Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casper_Ruud", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Casper Ruud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B\u00e5stad", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "B\u00e5stad"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "B\u00e5stad"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croatia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Croatia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Croatia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuno_Borges_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nuno Borges (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thiago_Agust\u00edn_Tirante", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Thiago Agust\u00edn Tirante"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATP_Tour_250", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ATP Tour 250"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novak_Djokovic", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Novak Djokovic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backhand", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Backhand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auckland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Auckland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Auckland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Social", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Social", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Wheelchair", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Wheelchair", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://images.ps-aws.com/c?url=https%3A%2F%2Fd2me2qg8dfiw8u.cloudfront.net%2Fcontent%2Fuploads%2F2024%2F07%2F20144649%2FRafael-Nadal-celebrates.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9741412", "eventUri": "eng-9741412", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2004-01-", "textStart": 1639, "textEnd": 1651}], "sentiment": 0.223529411764706, "wgt": 199, "relevance": 1}

And exactly that happened as the 38-year-old Spaniard wants to try to recover for tomorrow's final against either Nuno Borges or Thiago Agustin Tirante.\n\nBefore the withdrawal, Nadal and Ruud beat Guido Andreozzi and Miguel Reyes-Varela in their first match as a doubles duo before saving a match point in a quarterfinal 6-4 3-6 12-10 win over Theo Arribage and Roman Safiullin.\n\nWhen Nadal returns to the court on Sunday, he will be playing his first singles final since the 2022 French Open.\n\n\"Always it is a great feeling to be back in a final.

Nadal, who is a 22-time Grand Slam champion, was tested by the world no. 130 Croatian, notably a day after his four-hour quarter-final victory. The Spaniard dropped the opening set but came from behind to prevail 4-6, 6-3, 6-4.\n\nWith the huge win, Nadal has returned to the final of a tournament that he has already won as a teenager back in 2005 which was his last appearance. The 38-year-old will be facing either Portugal's seventh seed Nuno Borges or Argentina's Thiago Agustin Tirante on Sunday as he looks forward to a 93rd singles title of his illustrious career. His latest triumph remains the 2022 French Open victory when he won the tournament for a record-extending 14th time.\n\nNadal was struggling early into the game against the 23-year-old Ajdukovic who got a 3-0 lead and handed the veteran a double breakdown in the opening set. Nadal, however, fought his way back, retelling he is still a force to be reckoned with. He, although got another poor start but got two breaks in the second set. He looked in complete control of the third set when he got 3-0 up only to end up losing his serve twice consecutively.\n\nThe former world number one broke again in the seventh game and then denied two more break points in the next as he eventually registered a win with an easy hold two games later.\n\nNadal is gearing up for the Paris Olympics 2024 and is using the Nordea Open as a preparatory event for the grand stage. The Paris Games will hold the tennis clashes at the Roland Garros' clay courts. He won the Olympic gold in the singles in Beijing in 2008 and gold in the doubles at Rio 2016.\n\nIt is highly noteworthy that Nadal only returned to action this week for the first time since the first-round loss at the French Open in late May. He was also due to play in the doubles later alongside Casper Ruud but pulled out as a precautionary measure in the tune-up to the final as he spent six hours on the court over his past two singles matches.", "source": {"uri": "news9live.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News9live"}, "authors": [{"uri": "amit_sharma@news9live.com", "name": "Amit Sharma", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Nadal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croatia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Croatia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Croatia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B\u00e5stad", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "B\u00e5stad"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "B\u00e5stad"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuno_Borges_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nuno Borges (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thiago_Agust\u00edn_Tirante", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Thiago Agust\u00edn Tirante"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portugal", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Portugal"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Portugal"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_WTA_number_1_ranked_singles_tennis_players", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "List of WTA number 1 ranked singles tennis players"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Clay court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casper_Ruud", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Casper Ruud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Tournaments", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Juniors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Juniors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://images.news9live.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Rafael-Nadal-Bastad-final.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9741412", "eventUri": "eng-9741412", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 196, "relevance": 1}

The 22-time Grand Slam champion won with scores of 6-7 (2/7), 7-5, 7-5, marking his first semifinal appearance in a tournament since Wimbledon two years ago.\n\nNadal faced a challenging start against the rising star Navone, who is now ranked 36th in the world after starting the year outside the top 100. Navone, who made history by being the first man in the Open era to be seeded in his debut Grand Slam at this year's French Open, broke Nadal's serve three times in a row early in the match.\n\nTrailing 4-1 and down a double break, Nadal fought back into the set, saving two set points in the 10th game before taking a 6-5 lead. Despite Nadal having two set points, Navone forced a tie-break, which he dominated to win the first set after Nadal missed a forehand.\n\nNadal quickly regrouped in the second set, racing to a 3-0 lead. Navone responded by winning four consecutive games, but Nadal stopped the streak and held his serve. With the pressure on, Nadal broke Navone's serve to gain a 6-5 edge and then sealed the set with a smash, celebrating with a fist pump.\n\nIn the third set, Navone initially led 2-0, but Nadal countered by winning five straight games. Although Navone managed to level the set at 5-5, Nadal broke again and secured victory after nearly four hours on court.\n\nNadal's next opponent is Croatian qualifier Duje Ajdukovic, ranked 130th in the world, who had only two tour-level match wins before this tournament. Nadal is using the Bastad Open as preparation for the Paris Olympics, where tennis will be held at Roland Garros. This week marks Nadal's return to competition since his first-round loss at the French Open in late May.\n\nAdditionally, Nadal remains active in the doubles competition in Sweden, partnering with Casper Ruud.

It was very difficult honestly, but I found a way to survive and be through to the final after a long time without being in a final, so that's great news and I'm very happy with that,\" said Nadal.\n\nThe 38-year-old will play Portuguese seventh seed Nuno Borges or Argentina's Thiago Agustin Tirante on Sunday as he goes in search of the 93rd singles title of his career.\n\nHis most recent triumph came two years ago at Roland Garros, when he won the tournament for a record-extending 14th time.\n\n\"It's always a great feeling to be back in the final. I won four matches in a row, something I wasn't able to make happen since two years ago,\" said Nadal, whose ranking has tumbled to 261 after a string of injuries.\n\n\"A lot of things happened... I'm still in this process of recovering a lot of things I lost because I had a very important hip surgery almost one year ago, so things are not going that easy.\n\n\"But I'm fighting. I've fought during the whole tournament to be where I am today. Matches like yesterday and today help to improve a lot of things on court, so I'm happy with that. Let's see if I'm able to play a little bit better tomorrow.\"\n\nNadal struggled early against the 23-year-old Ajdukovic as he fell 3-0 and a double break down in the opening set, but he fought his way back with two breaks in the second after another poor start.\n\nThe former world number one appeared in complete control in the third set when he surged 3-0 ahead only to lose his serve twice in succession, suffering a repeat of the stumble that nearly cost him on Friday.\n\nHe broke again in the seventh game and then resisted two more break points in the next, eventually securing victory with a comfortable hold two games later.\n\nNadal is using the event in Bastad as a tune-up for the Olympic Games, where the tennis will be played on the clay at Roland Garros. He won gold in the singles in Beijing in 2008 and gold in the doubles at Rio 2016.\n\nHe only returned to action this week for the first time since losing in the first round of the French Open in late May.\n\nNadal was also due to play in the doubles later on Saturday alongside Casper Ruud but announced he was pulling out as a precaution after spending six hours on court over his past two singles matches.", "source": {"uri": "urdupoint.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "UrduPoint"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Nadal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B\u00e5stad", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "B\u00e5stad"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "B\u00e5stad"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croatia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Croatia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Croatia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaniards", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spaniards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuno_Borges_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nuno Borges (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thiago_Agust\u00edn_Tirante", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Thiago Agust\u00edn Tirante"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portugal", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Portugal"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Portugal"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_WTA_number_1_ranked_singles_tennis_players", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "List of WTA number 1 ranked singles tennis players"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Clay court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casper_Ruud", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Casper Ruud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Tournaments", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://photo-cdn.urdupoint.com/media/2024/07/_2/740x404/pic_1721486523.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9741412", "eventUri": "eng-9741412", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.5607843137254902, "wgt": 185, "relevance": 1}

The 6-foot-1 southpaw ground out a victory that included three grueling sets, all of which ran over an hour. He's now heading to his first ATP Tour semifinal round since Wimbledon in 2022. During that tournament, Nadal had been playing through a torn abdominal muscle, which ultimately compelled him to withdraw after beating Taylor Fritz in the quarterfinal round. He has no such health restrictions this time.\n\nThis surprise victory arrives on the heels of another, more commanding win over a top-5-seeded opponent at the tournament. On Thursday, Nadal bested No. 5-seeded Cameron Norrie in straight sets, 6-4, 6-4.\n\nRead More: Rafael Nadal Upsets Top Seed, Advances to Nordea Open Quarterfinals\n\n\"I lost for some moments my concentration, but I was able to hold physically until the end,\" Nadal reflected during his postgame interview on the court, per ATPTour.com. \"That is so important for me. Let's see how I am tomorrow, but today I am alive and in the semi-finals, so that's very important.\"\n\nNadal is a former longtime world No. 1, generally considered one of the greatest players in the history of the men's game. He has won 22 Grand Slam titles (a record at the time he achieved that feat), including at least two of each major. His 14 French Open titles is an all-time record, and helped earn him the apt nickname \"King of Clay,\" a reference to his best court surface. After missing most of the 2023 season with a hip injury, Nadal fell out of the world top 10 rankings for the first time in 18 years, a new record.\n\nUpon returning to action early in 2024, Nadal struggled with a muscle injury, which compelled him to withdraw from the Australian Open. He had an uncharacteristically brisk run in this year's French Open, before skipping all of the grass court season.\n\nNow, that's suddenly looking like a wise decision, as he has a real opportunity to return to a final.\n\nDuring the third set of the quarterfinal match Friday, Nadal took what had looked like a commanding 5-2 lead, but Navone, ranked at No. 36 in the world, rallied back. Ultimately, Nadal did hold on to claim the final set and win the tournament.\n\nOn Saturday, at 4 a.m. PT/7 p.m. ET, Nadal will square off against 23-year-old Duje Ajdukovi\u0107, currently ranked an unintimidating No. 130 in the world.", "source": {"uri": "newsweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsweek"}, "authors": [{"uri": "alex_kirschenbaum@newsweek.com", "name": "Alex Kirschenbaum", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Nadal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wimbledon_Championships", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wimbledon Championships"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATP_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ATP Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Fritz", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Fritz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B\u00e5stad", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "B\u00e5stad"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "B\u00e5stad"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_WTA_number_1_ranked_singles_tennis_players", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "List of WTA number 1 ranked singles tennis players"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cameron_Norrie", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cameron Norrie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grass_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Grass court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Clay court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Australian Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Players", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Players", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Tournaments", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Wheelchair", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Wheelchair", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2433216/rafael-nadal-french-open.webp?w=1600&h=900&q=88&f=4a9e92ae474cd4173301a143c18988cb", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9741412", "eventUri": "eng-9741412", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.04313725490196074, "wgt": 182, "relevance": 1}

He converted the second to level the set 3-3.\n\nNadal had seen the double-break lead he was sitting on evaporate.\n\nBut the all-time great still managed to storm back, securing two break points of his own in the seventh game. He only needed the first and pumped his fist in delight when he took it to get back in front.\n\nHe had a struggle to hold serve to go 5-3 up, working the game back to deuce before getting himself to advantage and then scooping a forehand off the ground to put a return beyond the Croatian.\n\nWith Nadal serving for the match, Ajdukovic finally netted after a long rally and the Spaniard could celebrate his progression to the final.\n\n\"I had a very tough match, the opponent had one of the best backhands that I've played against.

The match lasted three hours and 59 minutes, with Nadal ultimately prevailing 6-7 (2/7), 7-5, 7-5.\n\nThis marks the first time the 22-time Grand Slam champion has reached the semi-finals of a tournament since his appearance at Wimbledon in 2021.\n\n\"It was very close, long and tiring,\" AFP quoted Nadal, whose near four-hour victory was the second longest three-set match of his career -- after the 2009 Madrid semi-final against Novak Djokovic, which lasted 4hr 3min.\n\nNadal, the fourth seed, faced a challenging start against the rapidly ascending Navone, who is now ranked 36th in the world despite starting the year outside the top 100.\n\nNadal lost serve three times consecutively against Navone, who made history at this year's French Open by becoming the first man in the Open era to be seeded in his debut Grand Slam appearance.\n\nDespite trailing 4-1 and facing a double break, Nadal fought his way back into the set, saving two set points in the 10th game before taking a 6-5 lead.\n\nNadal had two set points on Navone's serve, showcasing his resilience by pushing the set to a tie-break, where he claimed the first five points to gain control. However, Navone clinched the first set when Nadal hit a forehand wide.\n\nNadal quickly regained his composure and surged to a 3-0 lead in the second set. Navone, however, responded by winning four consecutive games before Nadal halted his momentum.\n\nNavone held serve, putting pressure on Nadal, the 2005 Bastad champion. The 38-year-old remained unfazed, holding his serve and then breaking for a 6-5 advantage. Nadal forced a deciding set by closing out the second set with a powerful smash, celebrating with an energetic fist pump.\n\nIn the third set, Navone took a 2-0 lead before Nadal mounted a strong comeback, reeling off five games in a row. However, a late stumble allowed Navone to level the score at 5-all. Undeterred, Nadal broke again and finally secured the victory after a grueling match that lasted nearly four hours.\n\nHe had to overcome a poor start against the fast-rising Navone, now ranked 36th in the world after beginning the year outside the top 100.\n\nNadal dropped serve three times in a row against an opponent who became the first man in the Open era to be seeded in his maiden Grand Slam appearance at this year's French Open.\n\nNadal's next opponent will be Croatian qualifier Duje Ajdukovic, ranked 130th in the world, who had only won two tour-level matches before this tournament. The 23-year-old Ajdukovic defeated Brazil's Thiago Monteiro in three sets in the quarter-finals.\n\nThe Spaniard trailed 4-1 and was down a double break but battled his way back into the set, saving two set points in the 10th game before eventually moving 6-5 ahead.\n\nNadal himself had two set points as Navone served to stay in it, the fourth seed showing his mettle to force a tie-break in which he won the first five points to take charge.\n\nNadal, who last won a singles title at the 2022 French Open, where he claimed a record-extending 14th Roland Garros crown, is using the Bastad event as preparation for the Paris Olympics.\n\nThe tennis competition at the Olympics will take place at Roland Garros. Nadal made his return to the court this week for the first time since his first-round loss at the French Open in late May.\n\nIn addition to his singles campaign, Nadal is also competing in the doubles event in Sweden, partnering with Casper Ruud. The duo is scheduled to play in the semi-finals on Saturday, following Nadal's singles match.\n\nThe TOI Sports Desk excels in a myriad of roles that capture the essence of live sporting events and deliver compelling content to readers worldwide.

This new \"bromance\" is being loved by fans and will be seen again in the semifinals. After their quarter-final win, Ruud showed how friendly he is with Carlos Alcaraz as well.\n\nIn the post-match interview, the Norwegian star was asked about Alcaraz and whether he has called him up to seek some advice on how to play with the Spanish legend at the Olympics 2024. Ruud had a witty response, which left Nadal smiling too.\n\nHere's how the conversation went:\n\nInterviewer: \"Carlos is playing the Olympics with Rafa later on. Has he called you yet to ask for some tips?\"\n\nRuud: \"Carlos? He's busy probably partying after winning Wimbledon so he has all the rights to enjoy and take some rest. If he wants, I'm available on the phone!\"\n\nIt seems rather selfless of Ruud to agree to give some tips to Alcaraz. It's because Ruud could potentially take on Nadal or/and Alcaraz in either singles or doubles at the Olympics, representing Norway.\n\nSo this proves just how friendly Ruud is with both Alcaraz and Nadal and knows how to be light-hearted off the court as serious he is on it.\n\nInterestingly, the man who Alcaraz defeated to win the first Grand Slam of his career, was Ruud. It was in the US Open 2022 final. Ruud also has an unwanted record of losing to another Spaniard, Nadal in a Grand Slam final, i.e. at the French Open in the same year.\n\nSo Ruud could not help but shower Alcaraz with a lot of praise and compare him to Nadal once.\n\n\"I think I've said it at least before, he's one of these few rare talents that comes up every now and then in sports.\"\n\n\"Rafa, when he was Carlos's age, he was also similar. He tracked down everything. Almost no one could hit a winner on him.\n\n\"Novak the same with his flexibility. Carlos has sort of a mixture of both. Speed, agility of the players I think are just improving,\" Ruud said in an interview with Tennis.com.\n\nRuud and Alcaraz have shared laughs and constantly laughed together before and after the 4 matches they have played so far. The last time they played each other was at the Beijing Open 2023 quarterfinals, in which Alcaraz prevailed in straight sets.\n\nInterestingly, Alcaraz has never lost to the 2-time Grand Slam finalist. To top it all, the reigning Wimbledon champion knows Nadal well too. So one wouldn't imagine the young Spaniard calling up Ruud for tips as it should be the other way round.\n\nBut a clash between the two emerging stars of tennis is on the cards soon and that could be at the Olympics as Ruud is a player to watch out for on clay.", "source": {"uri": "thesportsrush.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The SportsRush"}, "authors": [{"uri": "advait_jajodia@thesportsrush.com", "name": "Advait Jajodia", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Alcaraz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Alcaraz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Nadal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exhibition_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Exhibition game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Norway"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Norway"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swedish_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Swedish Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casper_Ruud", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Casper Ruud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B\u00e5stad", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "B\u00e5stad"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "B\u00e5stad"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wimbledon_Championships", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wimbledon Championships"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Open_(tennis)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "US Open (tennis)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tennis (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Clay court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Social", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Social", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Juniors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Juniors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://cdn-wp.thesportsrush.com/2024/07/948f7647-untitled-design-2024-07-19t003016.599.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9741412", "eventUri": "eng-9741412", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3647058823529412, "wgt": 171, "relevance": 1}

He came here with a lot of confidence. It was very difficult, but I found a way to survive and be through to the final after a long time without being in a final,\" Nadal said.\n\n\"It's always a great feeling to be in a final. I wasn't able to make that happen since two years ago. A lot of things happened. That's the truth. Still in this process of recovering a lot of things I lost because I had a very important hip surgery almost one year ago... so things aren't going that easy.\"\n\nA day after his four-hour quarter-final victory over Mariano Navone, he was again tested to the limit by Ajdukovic, the world No. 130 who had won just two tour-level matches before this week.\n\nNadal, now ranked 261st, rebounded from dropping the opening set to prevail 4-6, 6-3, 6-4, returning to the final of a tournament he won as a teenager in 2005.\n\nHe will play Portuguese seventh seed Nuno Borges or Argentina's Thiago Agustin Tirante on July 21 as he goes in search of the 93rd singles title of his career.\n\n\"I'm fighting. I fought the whole tournament to be where I am today. Let's see if I'm able to play a little better tomorrow,\" Nadal added, pleased with his comeback from his fitness issues.\n\nHe is using the event in Bastad as a tune-up for the Paris Olympics, where the tennis tournament will be played on the clay at his beloved Roland Garros.\n\nPrior to this week, Nadal had not played since losing in the first round of the French Open in late May.\n\nElsewhere in Hamburg, Alexander Zverev claimed a season-leading 43rd win on July 19 with a straight-sets victory over Zhang Zhizhen of China to edge closer to back-to-back titles at his hometown tournament.\n\nThe world No. 4 needed just 66 minutes to secure a 6-4, 6-3 win and reach the semi-finals for the fourth time.\n\nHis 43rd win of 2024 took him past the mark of world No. 1 Jannik Sinner.\n\n\"I'm extremely pleased with the level of tennis today,\" said Zverev, who showed no sign of the knee injury he suffered in his fourth round exit at Wimbledon earlier in July.\n\n\"I'm happy to be in the semi-finals, but I don't want to stop here, I want to continue and hopefully defend my title.\"\n\nThe German was up against Spain's Pedro Martinez in the last four on July 20 - the result of their clash was unavailable at press time.\n\nLike Nadal, French Open runner-up Zverev is playing his last tournament before heading back to Roland Garros to defend his Olympic title.

One fan screamed in game two, and that young spectator had their wish granted as Nadal hit back with an instant break to level it up at 1-1.\n\n'Let's go Rafa, let's go!' Was the following chant in game three as Nadal held to make it 2-1 and edge ahead for the first time in the second set after 14 minutes.\n\nNadal started to dominate and eventually raced into a 5-2 second-set lead, with Ajdukovic having one last hold in the tank before the Spaniard wrapped it up 6-3.\n\nThe former world No.1 looked strong at the start of the third and final set, racing into a 3-0 lead, although he was made to go up a level as Ajdukovic broke back.\n\nAjdukovic then dramatically made it a double break to level things up at 3-3 with Nadal left absolutely kicking himself as he risked throwing it all away.\n\nBut there is a reason why Nadal is among the greatest tennis players of all time and he turned things around to take the decider 6-4 and reach the final in Bastad.\n\nMORE : Rafael Nadal's epic comeback secures semi-final spot as Olympic Games loom\n\nMORE : Chelsea recall star from France Olympic squad ahead of potential transfer", "source": {"uri": "metro.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Metro"}, "authors": [{"uri": "liam_grace@metro.co.uk", "name": "Liam Grace", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Nadal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B\u00e5stad", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "B\u00e5stad"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "B\u00e5stad"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swedish_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Swedish Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuno_Borges_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nuno Borges (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thiago_Agust\u00edn_Tirante", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Thiago Agust\u00edn Tirante"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATP_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ATP Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cameron_Norrie", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cameron Norrie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bj\u00f6rn_Borg", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bj\u00f6rn Borg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Britain", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Great Britain"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croatia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Croatia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Croatia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelsea_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chelsea F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Adventure", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Adventure", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/SEI_213079110-e886_1721481798.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9741412", "eventUri": "eng-9741412", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 165, "relevance": 1}

Casper Ruud aims to become No 7", "body": "All eyes have been on one doubles pair at the Swedish Open in Bastad: 'Ruudal'.\n\nThe partnership between tennis icon Rafael Nadal and his mentee Casper Ruud has been a successful one so far, with the pair now into the semi-final.\n\nNadal and Ruud are potentially just two wins from victory, and triumph at the ATP 250 event would be a 12th ATP doubles crown for the Spaniard.\n\nAnd Ruud would join an exclusive club, becoming just the seventh man to partner the great Spaniard to a doubles triumph.\n\nA former world No 100 in singles and No 63 in doubles, Lopez Moron is not a name most will be familiar with - but he holds a special place in tennis history.\n\nIt was he who partnered with Nadal to win his first doubles title on the ATP Tour over two decades ago, at the 2003 Croatia Open in Umag.\n\nNadal and Lopez Moron downed Todd Perry and Thomas Shimada in straight sets for the title.\n\nOne of just two men to win multiple doubles titles with Nadal, Robredo was a semi-regular partner for his compatriot across parts of the 2000s.\n\nRobredo and Nadal first paired up to win the Maharashtra Open in 2004, beating Jonathan Erlich and Andy Ram in three sets.\n\nFour years later, they again combined to win a Masters 1000 title at the Monte Carlo Rolex Masters, defeating Mahesh Bhupathi and Mark Knowles.\n\nRafael Nadal storms into his first ATP Tour semi-final in two years ahead of Olympics bid\n\nRafael Nadal makes surprise US Open decision amid hectic summer\n\nA former Roland Garros champion much like his partner, Costa paired up with Nadal to win the Qatar Open title in 2005.\n\nThe Spaniards battled their way to victory in the final, fending off Andrei Pavel and Mikhail Youzhny in three sets.\n\nThe most successful partner of his career, Nadal won five titles with Lopez - who now supports the 22-time major champion in a coaching capacity.\n\nNadal and Lopez have twice won the Qatar Open, triumphing in 2009 and 2011, while also claiming two Indian Wells titles - in 2010 and 2012.\n\nHowever, there is no doubt their most notable success came at Rio 2016.\n\nThe Spanish pair struck Olympic Games gold eight years ago, defeating Florin Mergea and Horia Tecau in the final.\n\nRafael Nadal reveals 'huge honour' as he returns to action with a win against a famous name\n\nRafael Nadal makes huge Carlos Alcaraz prediction - 'I don't see a lot of players that can stop him'\n\nA former top-10 singles star, Argentine Monaco is the only non-Spanish player to win a doubles title with Nadal across his career.\n\nThe pair were beaten in the 2013 Chile Open final but defeated Julian Knowle and Philipp Oswald in straight sets to win the Qatar Open title in 2015 - Nadal's fourth doubles triumph at the event.\n\nNadal's last doubles crown came almost eight years ago, at the 2016 China Open alongside former US Open semi-finalist Carreno Busta.\n\nThe two Spaniards overcame Jack Sock and Bernard Tomic in a deciding 10-point tiebreak to claim victory, an 11th title in the discipline for the 38-year-old.", "source": {"uri": "tennis365.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Tennis365.com"}, "authors":

After losing the first set via tie-breaker, the 38-year-old had to use all his experience to eke out a 6(2)-7(7) 7-5 7-5 win.\n\nNadal missed most of 2023 and made his comeback at the Brisbane International in January. But an injury ruled him out of the Australian Open, and in his second comeback, he lost to Alexander Zverev in the first round at Roland Garros. Meanwhile, he skipped Wimbledon, so that he could prepare for the upcoming Paris Olympics.\n\nAfter his win on Friday, Nadal was asked if he would participate in the upcoming US Open, and he confirmed that he checked in for the entry list. \"I had to check in for the US Open entry list and give myself a chance to decide in the upcoming weeks,\" he said.\n\nNadal further revealed that he would confirm his US Open participation after the Olympics, and he has also suggested in the past that this could be his swansong year. Given his recent fitness and injury struggles, it won't be a surprise for fans if Nadal announces his retirement after clinching a medal in Paris.\n\n\"It's as simple as that. Nothing has changed in my schedule, and I will think about my next moves after the Olympic Games. I will compete at the Laver Cup, but I can not create false expectations about traveling to New York, as I'm not sure,\" he said.\n\nAgainst Navone, Nadal showed signs of exhaustion. He had a 5-2 lead in the third set before the Argentine broke his serve twice to tie the deciding set at 5-5. But the Spaniard managed to maintain his calm as he dropped only one point in the final two games to clinch the match. He last appeared in a semi-final at Wimbledon in 2022.

Ajdukovic managed to level from 0-3 to 3-3, but Nadal immediately broke back and then held his serve to secure the victory.\n\nDespite a slow start to the match on Saturday, Nadal's performance was more consistent than in his previous match against Navone. He was particularly effective on return, converting all six break points he faced against Ajdukovic, as per Infosys ATP Stats.\n\nWith an 11-8 record for the season, Nadal is set to face the seventh seed Nuno Borges, who overcame Thiago Agustin Tirante 6-3, 6-4 to make it to his first ATP Tour final, for the title in Sweden. The 38-year-old Nadal is riding a nine-match winning streak in Bastad, having won the title during his last visit in 2005.\n\nAlthough Ajdukovic was defeated, he can take pride in a remarkable week in Bastad, where he notched victories over Luca Van Assche, Pavel Kotov, and Thiago Monteiro to reach his first ATP Tour semi-final. The 23-year-old's performance has propelled him up 20 places to No. 110 in the PIF ATP Live Rankings, poised to reach a new career-high in the upcoming PIF ATP Rankings on Monday.", "source": {"uri": "pragativadi.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Pragativadi: Leading Odia Dailly"}, "authors": [{"uri": "yajati_keshari_rout@pragativadi.com", "name": "Yajati Keshari Rout", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Nadal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_of_Tennis_Professionals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Association of Tennis Professionals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B\u00e5stad", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "B\u00e5stad"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "B\u00e5stad"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croatia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Croatia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Croatia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luca_Van_Assche", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Luca Van Assche"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuno_Borges_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nuno Borges (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thiago_Agust\u00edn_Tirante", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Thiago Agust\u00edn Tirante"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pavel_Kotov_(tennis)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pavel Kotov (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATP_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ATP Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thiago_Monteiro_(tennis)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Thiago Monteiro (tennis)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Modeling_Compounds", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Modeling Compounds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Collecting", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Collecting", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 86}], "image": "https://pragativadi.com/core/uploads/2024/07/Rafael-Nadal.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9741412", "eventUri": "eng-9741412", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 161, "relevance": 1}

But while the 38-year-old Spaniard was able to play in Barcelona, Madrid and Rome, he clearly wasn't pushing his body to the fullest on the court until the French Open - where he lost in straight sets to Alexander Zverev in the first round.\n\nIn his post-match press conference, Nadal indicated that he would very likely miss the grass swing and instead stay on clay so he could practice there for a month before the Paris Olympics. And after doing some hard work on the practice court and training, Nadal resumed action at this week's ATP 250 in Bastad - which serves the Spaniard as his final preparation for the Olympics.\n\n\"I love playing tennis. After Roland Garros, it saddened me that I could only train for a week at the physical level I needed to give myself the chance to be competitive on the Tour. That's why I decided to keep training, to see how my body reacted with the Olympics in sight. Skipping the grass season was the right decision,\" Nadal said.\n\nOn Tuesday, Nadal played his first singles match on the clay courts of Bastad in 19 years. And it was a victorious return for the Spaniard, who beat Leo Borg 6-3 6-4.\n\n\"I'm happy to play on clay here in Bastad and look forward to being at Roland Garros in two weeks for the Olympics, which gives me extra motivation,\" Nadal noted.\n\nA day earlier, Nadal also started his Bastad doubles run with Casper Ruud and they won their opener in two sets but only after two rain delays. But against Borg, Nadal didn't have to deal with another rain delay - and that was something that made him happy.\n\n\"Great feelings. It's true that there have been some on and off conditions in terms of weather, but we are lucky that we have been able to play the whole match without rain today. I'm happy for that,\" Nadal said after his opening singles win in Bastad.\n\nAfter making it clear that he was thrilled to be back in Bastad, 2005 Bastad champion Nadal joked that he was \"the defending champion\" since this is his first appearance at the tournament since his win 19 years ago.\n\n\"I'm defending the title,\" Nadal joked.\n\n\"Playing in front of a full crowd like this means a lot to me. It gives me energy to keep practicing every day. Even in the tougher moments, I have been able to keep going with the help of the team. The fans have a huge impact on that. They give me an amazing energy. Today, I have to say thank you very much to the Spanish followers here, but especially the Swedish, since I haven't been able to play here since a long time ago.\"\n\nWhen the Bastad draw was released and it was revealed that Nadal would take on Bjorg Borg's son, the matchup instantly drew major attention - not because it was expected to be a showdown but more because 21-year-old Leo is the son of one of the best players in tennis history and he was taking on home soil against Nadal, who is also widely regarded as one of the greatest players ever.\n\nAnd while Borg lost in straight sets, he was competitive - didn't embarrass himself - and later earned praise from the 22-time Grand Slam champion.\n\n\"It's a huge honor to play against the son of one of the biggest legends in the history of our sport,\" Nadal said after beating Borg.\n\nAlso, Nadal acknowledged Carlos Alcaraz's impressive Wimbledon and the 21-year-old Spaniard getting to four Grand Slam titles. When asked about Alcaraz, Nadal tipped the 21-year-old to be \"one of the best in history.\"\n\n\"My impression is that we are talking about a player who is going to be one of the best in history. That is my feeling. He is a player with great potential. Life can change quickly, that's the truth. You never know what can happen in the future. But today if we have to predict what is happening in his career, we predict incredible things,\" Nadal said of Alcaraz.", "source": {"uri": "tennisworldusa.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Tennis World USA"}, "authors": [{"uri": "dzevad_mesic@tennisworldusa.org", "name": "Dzevad Mesic", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grass_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Grass court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Clay court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Nadal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B\u00e5stad", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "B\u00e5stad"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "B\u00e5stad"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bj\u00f6rn_Borg", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bj\u00f6rn Borg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wimbledon_Championships", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wimbledon Championships"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATP_Tour_250", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ATP Tour 250"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Zverev", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alexander Zverev"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casper_Ruud", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Casper Ruud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Alcaraz", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Alcaraz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://www.tennisworldusa.org/world/media/image151534.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9741412", "eventUri": "eng-9741412", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.09019607843137256, "wgt": 161, "relevance": 1}

Mandatory Credit: Susan Mullane-USA TODAY Sports\n\nNetizens appeared divided on Rafael Nadal's new nickname with Casper Ruud. Nadal has partnered with Ruud in the ongoing Swedish Open 2024 in preparation for the Olympics doubles event. Following their success in booking a spot in the semifinals of the ATP 250 event, the two Europeans have received a nickname from tennis enthusiasts. Moreover, upon hearing the moniker, Rafa acknowledged the iconic nickname given to him and Roger Federer.\n\nThe Nadal-Ruud pairing was given a run for their money by Theo Arribage and Roman Safiullin. However, the star-studded team handled business and clinched a 6-4, 3-6, 12-10 victory. After winning the quarterfinal contest at Bastad, the interviewer revealed that Ruud and Nadal were being referred to as \"Ruudal\".\n\nAt first, the Spaniard didn't seem to comprehend what was being said. However, once he finally understood, the former World No.1 also referenced the popular nickname that he shared with his long-time rival Roger Federer - \"Fedal\".\n\nInterviewer: \"There are signs saying your new nickname - Ruudal - what do you think of it?\"\n\nAs soon as this interaction went viral on social media, tennis fans poured in with their reactions. While some fans didn't want \"Fedal\" to be switched with \"Ruudal\", a large group appreciated the new nickname for the duo.\n\nThe nickname with Ruud also got certain fans wondering what Nadal's nickname would be with Carlos Alcaraz during the upcoming Olympics campaign.\n\nAs for now, the 22-time Grand Slam winner will concentrate on his performances at Bastad. While he has to face Cameron Norrie in the pre-quarterfinals stage of the singles event, Nadal and Ruud will also play their semifinal bout against the winner of the Kotov & Matuszewski vs Luz & Matos contest.", "source": {"uri": "thesportsrush.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The SportsRush"}, "authors": [{"uri": "advait_jajodia@thesportsrush.com", "name": "Advait Jajodia", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Nadal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casper_Ruud", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Casper Ruud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATP_Tour_250", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ATP Tour 250"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stade_Roland_Garros", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stade Roland Garros"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swedish_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Swedish Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Federer", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Roger Federer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Safiullin", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Roman Safiullin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B\u00e5stad", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "B\u00e5stad"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "B\u00e5stad"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_WTA_number_1_ranked_singles_tennis_players", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "List of WTA number 1 ranked singles tennis players"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Alcaraz", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Alcaraz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cameron_Norrie", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cameron Norrie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Players", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Players", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://cdn-wp.thesportsrush.com/2024/07/bc8111f9-casper-ruud-rafael-nadal.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9741412", "eventUri": "eng-9741412", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2313725490196079, "wgt": 160, "relevance": 1}

Down 4-1, Nadal fought back in typical fiery fashion as he clinched five consecutive games to close out the match.\n\nProving that he is not done with tennis just yet, he has now reached his first clay quarter-final since Roland Garros in 2022, and will next take on Argentina's Mariano Navone.\n\n\"Great feelings. It's been a while without playing on tour... since Roland Garros,\" Nadal said.\n\n\"To have the chance to compete well against a great player like Cameron, these are great feelings. I played for moments (in this match) good tennis. I needed to play more aggressive.\n\n\"I haven't been competing very often. Matches and victories like today help to be in rhythm and put the pressure on the opponent during the whole match. That's something I need to improve today. Because I haven't played enough.\"\n\nThe Spaniard is also playing in the doubles in Bastad, Sweden, as he prepares to get up to speed in time for the Paris Olympics next week.\n\nOn July 17, he and Casper Ruud saved a match point in the deciding set tie-break to reach the semi-finals, hours after the Norwegian was knocked out of the singles.\n\nThe duo squeezed past France's Theo Arribage and Roman Safiullin of Russia 6-4, 3-6, 12-10 to advance to the last four, winning the final three points of the match after being on the brink of defeat.\n\n\"I think we had some fun.

Full crowd in a doubles match, that's fantastic.\"\n\nElsewhere in the German city of Hamburg, top seed Alexander Zverev shrugged off a knee issue to ease past Jesper de Jong in straight sets and into the round of 16 at his home tournament.\n\nThe defending champion hurt his left knee in a fall at Wimbledon - where he lost in the last 16 - but advanced 6-2, 6-2 past 114th-ranked Dutchman de Jong to set up a meeting with France's Hugo Gaston.

After taking the only break of a tight first set, Nadal came back from 1-4 down in the second set to survive a tough second-round test on the ATP 250 clay court.\n\nGreat feelings. I haven't played on tour for a while, since Roland Garros. To have the chance to compete well with a great player like Cameron is a great feeling, Nadal said in his on-court interview. I think in some moments I played good tennis, in other moments I need to be a bit more aggressive, but that's part of the journey today.\n\nI haven't played that much, so games and victories like today help. Staying in rhythm the whole game and keeping the pressure on the opponent the whole game, that's something I have to improve, because I haven't played enough.\n\nWhile the Spaniard had shown glimpses of his imperious best in his previous 13 tour-level matches in 2024, Thursday's match against left-hander Norrie was perhaps his most consistent performance. A rock-solid Nadal demolished the Briton, himself one of the hardest grinders on tour, to complete an hour and 43-minute triumph.\n\nNadal took control after a thrilling opening few games by winning three straight games from 2-3. He held off two break points at 5-4 before holding serve to win a high-quality first set, then recovered in style from a slight drop in form early in the second set. Nadal won 14 straight points from 1-4, 0/15, and eventually won the last five games of the match to extend his lead in the Lexus ATP Head2Head series against Norrie to 5-1.\n\nI feel like he was a little bit better than me in some way at the beginning of the match, because he won his serve quite easily, and my serve was a little bit more of a problem for me, Nadal said. But I was the player who got the break. Then at the beginning of the second set I played better than him. I had break points and I had more control, but I played a bad game and he played a good game and he broke me.\n\nSo I said to myself, okay, it's 1-4, but it could also be 4-1 for me, so I just have to keep doing what I'm doing. I probably played a little bit more aggressive with my backhand, which I think worked a little bit better towards the end of the match. That makes the difference. With the forehand I'm very happy, and with the serve as well.\n\nNadal hit the ball cleanly from both wings throughout the match and held back no matter what in chasing balls to both corners of the court. He won 74 percent (32/43) of points behind his first delivery, according to Infosys ATP Stats, a solid foundation that allowed him to win many easy points on his serve with some trademark second-strike winners.\n\nThe only physical concern for the 38-year-old Nadal came when he fell over his left leg while trying to slide for a ball on 40/Ad in the first game of the second set. He called a physiotherapist to the court at the end of the game to treat the bleeding on his leg and elbow.\n\nNadal is now 9-5 this season and will face fourth-seeded Mariano Navone in the quarterfinals, hoping to add another title to the one he won in 2005. Navone previously defeated Sumit Nagal 6-4, 6-2.\n\nHe is a player who is playing so well this year, winning a lot of matches, especially on clay, Nadal said of the world number 36, Navone. It is the quarterfinals of a historic event on the tour like Bastad. You can't expect an easy opponent. I'm just focusing on getting better every day, trying to play every day. I know it's going to be tough, but I really hope to play good tennis and give myself a chance.\n\nQualifier Timofey Skatov also booked his last eight spot in Bastad on Thursday. The Kazakhstani surprised third seed Tallon Griekspoor 1-6, 6-3, 6-4 to reach his first quarter-final on the ATP Tour. The 23-year-old Skatov, who is number 223 in the PIF ATP Rankings, will now face seventh seed Nuno Borges after the Portuguese defeated his #NextGenATP compatriot Henrique Rocha 1-6, 6-4, 6-0.", "source": {"uri": "exbulletin.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ExBulletin"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Nadal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_of_Tennis_Professionals", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Association of Tennis Professionals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B\u00e5stad", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "B\u00e5stad"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "B\u00e5stad"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATP_Tour_250", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ATP Tour 250"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cameron_Norrie", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cameron Norrie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Clay court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATP_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ATP Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henrique_Rocha", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Henrique Rocha"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuno_Borges_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nuno Borges (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timofey_Skatov", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Timofey Skatov"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sumit_Nagal", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sumit Nagal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tallon_Griekspoor", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tallon Griekspoor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forehand", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Forehand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portugal", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Portugal"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Portugal"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kazakhstan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kazakhstan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Kazakhstan"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Paper_and_Pencil/Tic-Tac-Toe", "label": "dmoz/Games/Paper and Pencil/Tic-Tac-Toe", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://www.atptour.com/-/media/images/news/2024/07/18/15/02/nadal-bastad-2024-thursday.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9741412", "eventUri": "eng-9741412", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2018-07-", "textStart": 125, "textEnd": 132}], "sentiment": 0.2, "wgt": 152, "relevance": 1}

prediction, head-to-head, tournament so far", "body": "Finally an ATP Tour semi-finalist again after two gruelling years, Rafael Nadal battles Croatia's Duje Ajdukovic on Saturday lunchtime for a spot in the Swedish Open final in Bastad.\n\nThe Spanish wildcard defeated Mariano Navone in a four-hour epic in Friday's quarter-final, while his unfancied foe also broke new ground by seeing off Thiago Monteiro in three sets.\n\nMatch preview\n\nMany wondered how Nadal's 38-year-old legs would fare in a three-set spectacular with Argentinian fourth seed Navone, who gave the 22-time Grand Slam winner an excellent run for his money and would ostensibly have the fitness edge the longer the match wore on.\n\nNadal was facing an opponent who has been on a meteoric rise over the past several months - especially on clay - but the Spaniard left the Bastad crowd bewildered with an extraordinary 6-7[2] 7-5 7-5 victory to progress to his first ATP Tour semi-final of the 2024 season.\n\nIn a back-and-forth quarter-final of breaks galore, Nadal blinked first in the deciding set before establishing a seemingly unassailable 5-2 lead, but there was plenty of fight left in Navone's heart, as he miraculously earned two breaks back to level at 5-5.\n\nHowever, the Argentine fatally lost serve for the 10th time in the match to hand Nadal the opportunity to serve out the match, which he did as Navone sent a tired forehand into the net, allowing the 14-time Roland-Garros winner to raise his arms aloft in both elation and relief.\n\nWhile admitting that his mental strength escaped him at various points during the contest, Nadal's ageing body served him incredibly well throughout the titanic tie, but the 38-year-old also has the small matter of a doubles semi-final with Casper Ruud in the diary for Saturday too.\n\nBefore thoughts turn to that four-man matchup, Nadal seeks to avoid a Scandinavian upset against Croatian qualifier Ajdukovic, who toppled both Luca Van Assche and Pavel Kotov en route to a quarter-final against Brazil's Thiago Monteiro, which also went the distance on Centre Court.\n\nDespite failing to see out the contest in two sets as Monteiro threatened a fightback, the world number 130 responded in perfect fashion with a break straight away in the decider, which his South American foe could not recover from as Ajdukovic prevailed 6-2 4-6 6-4 in two hours and nine minutes.\n\nWhile Nadal has ended a two-year exile from ATP Tour semi-final territory, his Croatian opponent will compete in the semis of a top-level tournament for the very first time this weekend on his favoured surface, having already reached 11 World Tennis Tour and Challenger championship matches on clay.\n\nThe 23-year-old utilised a high-risk, high-reward game on Friday, committing 23 unforced errors and counteracting them with 28 winners, while also winning 75% of his points at the net and winning 79% of points on his first serve.\n\nAjdukovic will no doubt have to harness every inch of his athletic ability if he is to quell the Nadal juggernaut, and a shot at glory against either Nuno Borges or Thiago Agustin Tirante will await the victor of Saturday's headline encounter.\n\nTournament so far\n\nRafael Nadal:\n\nFirst round: vs. Leo Borg 6-3 6-4\n\nSecond round: vs. Cameron Norrie 6-4 6-4\n\nQuarter-final: vs. Mariano Navone 6-7[2] 7-5 7-5\n\nDuje Ajdukovic:\n\nFirst round: vs. Luca Van Assche 6-3 6-3\n\nSecond round: vs. Pavel Kotov 7-6[7] 3-6 6-3\n\nQuarter-final: vs. Thiago Monteiro 6-2 4-6 6-4\n\nHead To Head\n\nAs Ajdukovic is still learning his trade on the ATP Tour, it comes as no surprise to learn that Saturday's semi-final will be the first-ever showdown between the Croatian and Nadal at the top level.\n\nThe 23-year-old has one inch on Nadal height-wise and plays right-handed, throwing up an intriguing battle between himself and the Spanish leftie.\n\nWe say: Nadal to win in two sets\n\nSaturday's semi-final sees two clay aficionados go head-to-head, and one cannot help but wonder how Nadal's body is holding up after Friday's marathon battle, but there is seemingly no cause for concern at the minute.\n\nAs a result, the 22-time major winner has our vote to see off the inexperienced Ajdukovic - who is prone to making mistakes - and moving one step closer to ending his silverware drought.\n\nbody check tags ::\n\nPreviews by email\n\nClick here to get Sports Mole's daily email of previews and predictions for every major game!", "source": {"uri": "amp.sportsmole.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "amp.sportsmole.co.uk"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ben_knapton@amp.sportsmole.co.uk", "name": "Ben Knapton", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATP_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "ATP Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Nadal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thiago_Monteiro_(tennis)", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Thiago Monteiro (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B\u00e5stad", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "B\u00e5stad"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "B\u00e5stad"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croatia", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Croatia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Croatia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swedish_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Swedish Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Clay court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_card_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wild card (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luca_Van_Assche", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Luca Van Assche"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pavel_Kotov_(tennis)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pavel Kotov (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forehand", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Forehand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Types_of_tennis_match", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Types of tennis match"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centre_Court", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Centre Court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casper_Ruud", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Casper Ruud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cl\u00e1udia_Monteiro", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cl\u00e1udia Monteiro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo_Borg", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Leo Borg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuno_Borges_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nuno Borges (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thiago_Agust\u00edn_Tirante", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Thiago Agust\u00edn Tirante"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cameron_Norrie", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cameron Norrie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATP_Challenger_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ATP Challenger Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Lotteries", "label": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Lotteries", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Fitness/Advice_and_Guides", "label": "dmoz/Health/Fitness/Advice and Guides", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Volleyball/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Volleyball/Tournaments", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://sm.imgix.net/24/29/rafael-nadal.jpg?w=300&h=225&auto=compress,format&fit=clip", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9741412", "eventUri": "eng-9741412", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.03529411764705892, "wgt": 149, "relevance": 1}

Yet he raised his level in time to recover after dropping serve in the opening game of the second set, going on to break his opponent's serve five times across the second and third sets en route to a two-hour, 13-minute semi-final triumph.\n\nJust as he had against Navone, Nadal sealed victory despite letting slip a double-break lead in the deciding set. After Ajdukovic rallied from 0-3 to 3-3, the former No. 1 in the PIF ATP Rankings immediately broke through on return again before holding firm behind his serve to clinch the win.\n\nAlthough he made a relatively slow start to Saturday's match, Nadal delivered a more consistent performance overall than he had against Navone. He was particularly clinical on return, and converted all six break points he earned against Ajdukovic, according to Infosys ATP Stats.\n\nNow 11-8 for the season, Nadal will take on seventh seed Nuno Borges or Thiago Agustin Tirante in Sunday's final in Sweden.

The former world number 1 - who suffered several injuries in the recent period, is not going to give up without a fight.\n\nThe Spanish veteran defeated Argentine Navone in the quarterfinals of Bastad and qualified for the semi-finals. The 22-time Grand Slam champion showed all that grit that allowed him to become an icon of modern sport and one of the greatest tennis players of all time. Rafa knows that his career is near the end and has confessed that his post-Olympic schedule is still unclear. Although his name appears on the US Open entry list - the last Slam of the season at Flushing Meadows in late August - his participation is uncertain.\n\nNadal will be one of the great protagonists of the Paris Olympics, which will begin in about a week on the red clay of the French Open. Rafa will play in singles and doubles with his young compatriot Carlos Alcaraz, who has just won the French Open and Wimbledon becoming the youngest ever to achieve this feat in the same year.\n\nThe Spaniard was hoping to play one last great French Open, but the draw was not favorable for him. The 14-time champion of the French tournament expressed good tennis against Sascha Zverev on the Philippe Chatrier but had to surrender with honor. Rafa Nadal is doing his best to be ready for the Paris Olympics, with the risk of suffering new injuries. Renowned journalist Carole Bouchard was impressed by Rafa's 4-hour battle against Navone in Bastad. \"Rafa battling for 4h in Bastad... That was nuts. Gosh I hope he will not pay this later. What a freaking competitor\" - she wrote on X.\n\nNadal has made tennis history alongside his eternal rivals Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic. The 3 have broken every record of the men's tour and have had very long careers. In a long interview with Tennis Magazin, former ATP star Marc Rosset reflected on the GOAT debate: \"It all depends on what it means to be the best. If we look at the Grand Slam numbers won, then Nadal and Djokovic are better. If we look at the player who has the most influence in this sport, it's Roger for me. Much of what constitutes this sport today, such as attention or cash prizes, we owe to him. Basketball was a before and after with Michael Jordan. People who love Federer say he's the GOAT, but the ones who go crazy for Novak will tell you that Nole is the best. Then there are the supporters of Rafa: they say directly that he won everything.\"\n\nTalking about the new generation, one of the athletes seen with particular attention by the 53-year-old from Geneva is Alexander Zverev: \"When Sascha plays aggressively, for me he is the most dominant tennis player. If he plays like he did against Nadal at Roland Garros, he can beat any player. He defeated Roger and Novak in major tournaments, hits missiles, can move along the bottom line and accelerate the ball at any time. He also covers the field like Djokovic and if he plays aggressively the game is in his hands. I love this guy, he moves incredibly despite his size\".\n\nThanks to the semi-final in Bastad, Nadal made his return to the ATP Top 200 on the eve of the Paris Olympics. \"A lot of changing dynamics in every single set, for moments he was in control and for moments I was in control,\" the Spanish legend said after the match against Navone. \"But in the end, no one was in control. I was able to hold physically and that's so important for me, let's see how I am tomorrow. Today, I am alive and I am in the semi-finals. I know I'm experiencing too many disconnects, but I consider it normal coming from where I come from. It is not easy for me to accept because throughout my career, I have been able to play very focused. However, little by little, I am regaining that. Playing matches and winning these types of duels will help me change that\" - the former World No.1 added.\n\nThe 22-time Grand Slam champion will not be underestimated at the Paris Olympics, which are played on his favorite surface. Rafa has a crazy record on the red clay of the French Open and will give his best to try to win a medal before retiring.

The veteran will defend the Spanish national colors at Roland Garros at the Olympic Games in a couple of weeks.\n\nRafa will think about his schedule after Paris, confirming only the Laver Cup in Berlin in September.\n\nThe 38-year-old has been dealing with injuries for years, although he overcame them in the first part of 2022.\n\nEverything went wrong for Rafa at Wimbledon that year, and things worsened at the Australian Open next January. Nadal suffered a career-threatening hip injury in Melbourne, missing the rest of the season and embracing the most extended break of his career.\n\nRafa returned to action in January this year in Brisbane, reaching the quarter-final before feeling the pain around his hip again following a marathon duel versus Jordan Thompson. The Spaniard skipped the Australian Open and experienced another setback in February, hurting his abdomen and withdrawing from Doha, Indian Wells and Monte Carlo.\n\nNadal played his first matches in over three months in Barcelona, losing in the second round and embracing a better run in Madrid, beating three rivals for the first time since US Open 2022.\n\nThe king of clay struggled in Rome and did not have luck in the draw at Roland Garros. World no. 4 Alexander Zverev ousted Nadal in the first round, delivering his earliest Roland Garros exit. Rafa did not feel well physically, skipping the grass swing and entering Bastad as the final preparation for the Olympic Games.\n\nNadal defeated Leo Borg and Cameron Norrie for a place in the quarter-final and prevailed over Mariano Navone in a four-hour thriller, moving into his first ATP semi-final in two years.\n\n\"I had to check in for the US Open entry list and give myself a chance to decide in the upcoming weeks.\n\nIt's as simple as that. Nothing has changed in my schedule, and I will think about my next moves after the Olympic Games. I will compete at the Laver Cup, but I can not create false expectations about traveling to New York, as I'm not sure,\" Rafael Nadal said.", "source": {"uri": "tennisworldusa.org", "dataType":

Nadal grinds down Navone in Bastad QF marathon\n\nRafael Nadal passed a stern physical test from Mariano Navone with the help of some trademark mental strength on Friday at the Nordea Open in Bastad.\n\nThe former No. 1 in the PIF ATP Rankings battled to a 6-7(2), 7-5, 7-5 triumph against Navone in an absorbing four-hour quarter-final at the clay-court ATP 250. Nadal struggled to maintain his best level for long periods in the match but dug in superbly after letting slip a 5-2 lead in the deciding set to reach his first tour-level semi-final since Wimbledon 2022.\n\nNadal and Navone played out three topsy-turvy sets, all of which lasted more than an hour, in their maiden Lexus ATP Head2Head meeting. In the first, Nadal rallied from a double-break down at 1-4 to force a tie-break, which Navone composed himself to clinch in style. In the second, it was Navone's turn to recover a double-break deficit from 0-3, but he was unable to stop Nadal from clinching his third, decisive break of the set in the 11th game.\n\nThe World No. 36 Navone appeared to have taken control again early in the third set, when he broke Nadal's serve in the second game for a 2-0 lead. Then came the Nadal charge, as the 92-time tour-level champion reeled off five straight games, before Navone again recovered from a double break down to level at 5-5. Finally, after notching his 10th break of Navone's serve in the match in the 11th game, Nadal held firm behind his delivery to snatch his 10th tour-level victory of 2024.\n\nNadal is this week competing in his first tour-level event since his first-round defeat to Alexander Zverev at Roland Garros in May. The 38-year-old is now on an eight-match winning streak in Bastad, where he won the title on his previous appearance in 2005.

Read more Nadal now leads the former world number eight Briton 5-1 in their head-to-head record.\n\nNadal showed few signs of rustiness from the get-go against fifth-seed Norrie, clipping a superb forehand winner down the line after taking it on the half-volley behind his own baseline in the very first game.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe decisive moment of the first set came at 3-3 when the Spaniard converted his third break point to get the edge on the Briton, before holding off a late challenge by his opponent to serve out the set.\n\nNadal then took a tumble on his backhand side in the first game of the second set and required brief medical attention on his left elbow at the change of ends.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe 2005 Bastad champion made a quick recovery, holding serve. But Norrie inflicted the first damage of the second set by chasing down a short ball and playing a delicate drop-shot return to set up two break points, converting the second after Nadal overhit a forehand.\n\nNorrie confirmed the break by winning a fantastic game point at 40-15 with a cross-court backhand on the run away from the net to take a 4-1 lead.\n\nNadal soon showed his pedigree on the clay to break back in style, taking Norrie's serve to love and signing off the game with a thumping doublehanded-backhand passing shot.\n\nThe 22-time Grand Slam champion was unstoppable as he ground his opponent down with powerful, topspin-heavy ground strokes. He broke Norrie again and served out to love, having won five games in a row to take the match in straight sets.\n\nNadal will next face Mariano Navone in the quarter-final, after the fourth-seed Argentinian earlier overcame India's Sumit Nagal in straight sets.\n\nThe 23-year-old world number 36 is the highest seed left in the draw after Dutch third seed Tallon Griekspoor was earlier eliminated by Kazakh qualifier Timofey Skatov.\n\nStay up-to-date by following Daily Express's Telegram channel.\n\nDaily Express Malaysia\n\n* Follow us on Instagram and join our Telegram and/or WhatsApp channel(s) for the latest news you don't want to miss.\n\n* Do you have access to the Daily Express e-paper and online exclusive news?

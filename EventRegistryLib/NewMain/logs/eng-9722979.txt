After a lengthy delay, the VAR team recommended referee Zwayer to review his decision and the German official opted to award Gareth Southgate's side a penalty.\n\nKane stepped up to score from the spot to pull England level, leaving the Netherlands players and coaching staff furious with the call.\n\nSpeaking shortly after his side's defeat, Van Dijk claimed that Zwayer immediately left the pitch and says the German official's reaction after the full-time whistle 'says it all'.\n\nWhen asked about the performance of Zwayer, Van Dijk told Dutch broadcaster NOS: 'It says it all that the referee went inside so quickly.\n\n'But to blame it on that, I don't want to do that either. I just don't know what to say. It hurts a lot.'\n\nVan Dijk also rued the Netherlands' inability to punish England as they looked stronger as the second half progressed.\n\n'If you concede it so late in the match, then that is of course terrible,' Van Dijk said.\n\n'You put everything into it, everyone gives everything, and then when it falls like that in the last minute... that just sucks, sorry to say it like that.\n\n'You have more possession and want to punish the little moments that you get. It felt like we could make it 2-1. But that didn't happen and now we're standing here empty-handed.'\n\nMeanwhile, former Netherlands striker, Pierre van Hooijdonk, has called for Zwayer to be stood down by UEFA after his nation's Euro 2024 exit.\n\n'They can thank Felix Zwayer. He really needs to be blacklisted,' Van Hooijdonk said. \"Terrible.\n\n'Also in the second half. A duel with Cody Gakpo where he simply blew his whistle again, ten meters from the linesman. Those are moments that were crucial in this match.'\n\n'We can talk about it at length, but if you're going to award a penalty for this. Then you could end up with eight of them on the spot in the final.

Ollie Watkins scored a dramatic last-gasp winner for the Three Lions, but the Netherlands were not happy with Harry Kane's equaliser from the penalty spot.\n\nShortly after Xavi Simons gave Ronald Koeman's side the lead with a brilliant strike, England were awarded a penalty after clash between Kane and Denzel Dumfries.

However, the match saw multiple decisions going against the Netherlands, when the replays for the same told an altogether different picture.\n\n\"The referee ran back inside straight after the FT whistle, that says a lot...I have no words. To concede so late, that is terrible. This hurts so much. I have to stand here, but I don't even know what to say. This hurts so much,\" van Dijk said post match.\n\nFirst and foremost came the much controversial penalty call given to England, which then saw Harry Kane bring the scores level to 1-1 after the Dutch had taken an early lead from Xavi Simons' screamer. The penalty can easily be argued as a soft-call as Harry Kane's feet, while in motion to take a shot, went on and hit the blocking boot of Denzel Dumfries. Zawyer even took the assistance of the Video Assistant Referee (VAR) and then came to his decision, much to the complete frustration of the Dutch fans and players.\n\nThen came the easiest of the lot, a clear corner call after the ball went skimming the head of John Stones. Surprisingly, Zwayer gave England a goal-kick for the same. This call completely brought on the wrath of Virgil van Dijk, and even resulted in the Ducth skipper getting booked for dissent. Even ahead of the match, UEFA's decision to let Zwayer officiate such a high-value fixture was questioned by fans and former players alike, specifically due to the German referee's history of being banned for accepting a bribe back in 2005.", "source": {"uri": "indiatoday.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "India Today"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felix_Zwayer", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Felix Zwayer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virgil_van_Dijk", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virgil van Dijk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referee_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Referee (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westfalenstadion", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Westfalenstadion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dortmund", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dortmund"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dortmund"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Kane", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Harry Kane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gareth_Southgate", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gareth Southgate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_European_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "UEFA European Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Koeman", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ronald Koeman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_assistant_referee", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Video assistant referee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ollie_Watkins", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ollie Watkins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xavi_Simons", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Xavi Simons"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denzel_Dumfries", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Denzel Dumfries"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Stones", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "John Stones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "UEFA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Work-Life_Balance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Work-Life Balance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Trucks,_Vans,_and_Sport_Utility", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Trucks, Vans, and Sport Utility", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Officiating", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Officiating", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/202407/virgil-van-dijk-105450828-16x9_0.jpg?VersionId=roIJkNjA2MMs4d_brY3qrAtaW4KhdXv1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9722979", "eventUri": "eng-9722979", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-11", "textStart": 327, "textEnd": 334}], "sentiment": -0.2705882352941177, "wgt": 199, "relevance": 1}

He really needs to be blacklisted.\n\n\"Terrible. Also in the second half.

I think that might be something.\"\n\nMeanwhile Dumfries has apologised over his foul, as he stated: \"I take all responsibility for the penalty moment. I didn't do it on purpose. I just wanted to block the shot.\"\n\nHolland boss Ronald Koeman also slammed the Zwayer in his post-match press conference over his decision to award England the spot-kick.\n\nHe said: \"This is not a penalty.

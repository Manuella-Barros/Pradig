{"id": 231352744, "title": "Live updates: T20 Cricket World Cup, Australia vs England at Kensington Oval in Bridgetown", "text": "Perhaps a surprise, but Moeen Ali will have the first use of the ball. David Warner is out there, it could be the last time Warner ever faces England in a competitive match, so he'll want to make his mark. Bu it's Travis Head who is on strike. A dot ball first up, then Head punches a drive into long off for a quickly-run couple. Head fends away the next ball. This is a bold but good move from England - Australia's openers like pace on the ball. TURN AND BOUNCE! Head is lucky there, the ball just going past the off stump. Head fends square to point - no run. Now head just dabs a single to mid on using his feet. Great first over from Moeen Ali - Australia 0-3.", "summary": "Australia, holders of the ODI World Cup and England, defending T20 World Cup champions, are set to lock horns at the historic Kensington Oval in Bridgetown, Barbados.

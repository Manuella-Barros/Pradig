Please use a supported version for the best MSN experience.\n\nSouth Africa A bowled India A out for just 120 to get into a commanding position on the second day of the first four-day game in Pretoria.\n\nAfter posting 346 in their first innings, South Africa skittled out India in just 39 overs to take a lead of 226 runs with Beuran Hendricks, the left-arm pacer, and Dane Piedt, the offspinner, picking up three wickets each.\n\nBy stumps on Sunday (August 13), they had stretched that to 292, going into stumps at 66 for no loss. Stephen Cook (32) and Aiden Markram (34), the captain, were in the middle.\n\nIndia's response started on the worst note possible when they lost R Samarth to a run out off the very first ball. Two balls later, Hendricks had Ishan Kishan as both openers fell without scoring, leaving India reeling at 1 for 2.\n\nShreyas Iyer tried to counter-attack and played a few shots to break the shackles. It resulted in a quick 31 comprising five fours and a six, but Hendricks had the last laugh when he induced a return catch in the ninth over. In the very next over, Junior Dala had Sudip Chatterjee, the No. 3, as India slipped to 37 for 4.\n\nThat would then become 42 for 5 with Hendricks dismissing Ankit Bawne before passing on the baton to Piedt, the offspinner. Much depended on Karun Nair for India but the captain managed just 15 as the rest of the innings too followed the one-way traffic. And to make matters worse, Vijay Shankar too was forced to retire hurt after resisting for a 63-ball 26 which meant India were shot out for a paltry total.\n\nSouth Africa's openers then batted out 20 overs without any hiccups to ensure they finished the day strongly.\n\nEarlier, India did well to restrict South Africa to 346 after the home side started the day on 274 for 4. Hendricks and Khaya Zondo, the overnight batsmen, were run out by Bawne in successive overs before Mohammed Siraj and Shahbaz Nadeem ran through the tail to end with four wickets apiece.\n\nBrief scores:South Africa A 346 (Stephen Cook 120, Aiden Markram 22, Rudi Second 32, David Miller 78, Khaya Zondo 24, Heinrich Klaasen 29; Mohammad Siraj 4-61, Shahbaz Nadeem 4-117) & 66/0 (Cook 32 n.o., Markram 34 n.o.) lead India A 120 (Shreyas Iyer 31, Vijay Shankar 26, Shahbaz Nadeem 21; Beuran Hendricks 3-23, Dane Piedt 3-32) by 292 runs.", "timeCrawl": "17:02:00", "sim": 0.8705882430076599, "extractedDates": [{"textStart": 487, "date": "2017-08-13", "imp": true, "amb": false, "textEnd": 496}], "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-13", "id": "8944029", "categories": [], "details": {}}

While Hendricks and Zondo ran themselves out, Phehlukwayo was removed by left-arm spinner Shahbaz Nadeem, who picked up his third wicket of the innings.\n\nWicketkeeper-batsman Heinrich Klaasen did well to bide his time at the crease and added 29 runs which included five boundaries, helping the hosts to 346 before India A polished off the tail without much trouble. Mohammed Siraj and Nadeem ended with four wickets apiece.\n\nIndia A's reply was apologetic as both openers Ravikumar Samarth and Ishan Kishan fell in the opening over to let the hosts barge in early. Middle-order mainstays Shreyas Iyer and Sudip Chatterjee departed with the score reading 37, and Ankit Bawne followed them back soon after. As Iyer employed his usual attacking approach to race away to a 31-ball 32, Hendricks caught him off his own bowling to pull the curtains down on a counterattacking knock.\n\nSkipper Karun Nair couldn't hold his end for too long as the visitors were reduced to 74 for 6 in just over 20 overs of play. Vijay Shankar and Nadeem were in the middle of a steady partnership before the Tamil Nadu batsman had to retire hurt. The wheels came off completely as South Africa A managed to bowl their opponents out for just 120 on the board.\n\nWith a first-innings lead of 226 runs, South Africa A decided to bat again and their openers Stephen Cook and Aiden Markram put together their second fifty-plus partnership of the game. With Cook and Markram unbeaten on 32 and 34 respectively, South Africa A would look to set a target in excess of 400 before exposing the diffident India batting line-up again.\n\nBrief Scores: South Africa A 346 & 66/0 (Stephen Cook 32*, Aiden Markram 34*) lead India A 120 (Shreyas Iyer 31; Beuran Hendricks 3-23, Dane Piedt 3-32) by 292 runs.", "timeCrawl": "16:56:00", "sim": 0.8549019694328308, "extractedDates": null, "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-13", "id": "8943402", "categories": [], "details": {}}

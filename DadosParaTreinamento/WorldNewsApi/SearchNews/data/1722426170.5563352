He was 86. The San Francisco Giants and his family announced the death Friday night and a moment of silence was held on the scoreboard at Oracle Park midway through a game against the Los Angeles Dodgers. \u201cOur beloved Orlando passed away peacefully at home this evening, listening to his favorite music and surrounded by his loved ones,\u201d his wife, Nydia, said in a statement released through the team. \u201cWe take comfort that he is at peace.\u201d Cepeda was a regular at Giants home games through the 2017 season until he dealt with some health challenges. He was hospitalized in the Bay Area in February 2018 following a cardiac event. One of the first Puerto Rican stars in the majors but limited by knee issues, he became Boston\u2019s first designated hitter and credits his time as a DH for getting him enshrined into the Hall of Fame in 1999 as selected by the Veteran\u2019s Committee. When the Red Sox called Cepeda in December 1972 to inquire whether he\u2019d like to be their first designated hitter, the unemployed player accepted on the spot.", "url": "https://chicago.suntimes.com/mlb/2024/06/29/orlando-cepeda-dead-hall-of-fame-mlb-obituary", "image": "https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/7a3bb10/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2398x1369+0+221/resize/1461x834!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F57%2F1d%2Fabd034334a43abe4aeb02045c1a0%2Fap62", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 04:03:25", "author": "Associated Press", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "language": "en", "catgory": "entertainment", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": 0.43}

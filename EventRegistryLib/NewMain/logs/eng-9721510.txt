But Russia has increasingly found ways around those limits, raising pressure on the Biden administration to tighten its enforcement efforts.\n\nTreasury officials want to do that, in part, by targeting a so-called shadow fleet of oil tankers allowing Russia to sell oil above a $60-per-barrel price cap that the United States and its allies imposed in 2022.\n\nThat cap was intended to restrict Moscow's ability to profit from its energy exports while allowing its oil to continue flowing on international markets to prevent a global price shock. But Russia has largely circumvented the cap, allowing it to reap huge profits to fund its war efforts.\n\nWhile Treasury officials want to knock Russian tankers out of commission, economic advisers inside the White House worry that would risk inflaming oil prices this summer and push up U.S. gasoline prices, which could hurt Biden's reelection campaign. They have not signed off on the proposals, even as current and former Treasury officials present them with analyses suggesting the risks of a major effect on the oil market are low.\n\nThe debate reflects a tension that has always been at the core of the administration's novel effort to restrict Russian oil sales: How to weaken the Moscow war machine without the political backlash that could come from inflicting pain on American drivers.\n\nThe dispute is a rare public instance of internal administration disagreement over inflation and Ukraine policy. It pits Treasury officials against aides on the White House National Economic Council, which is led by Lael Brainard.\n\nWhite House officials privately describe the process as routine and stress that no decisions have been made. But the delays have confounded officials elsewhere in the administration, who have been unable to get a straight answer from Brainard and her team about what is holding up the proposed action.\n\nFor now, according to multiple people familiar with the discussions, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly, the proposed penalties on the Russian shadow fleet remain under review, and are not imminent.\n\nBrainard declined to speak on the record about the process. White House officials refused to answer direct questions about oil-price concerns and the Treasury proposal.\n\nInstead, the White House issued a statement from Amos Hochstein, a senior adviser to Biden.\n\n\"Our actions to enforce energy sanctions are focused on exacting a price on Russia, Iran and other bad actors while preventing a spike in the price of energy, which would not only hurt American consumers but increase the revenues of the same bad actors we are trying to hold accountable,\" he said.\n\nThe White House is under pressure from inside and outside the administration to do more to enforce the oil price cap, which Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and her team drew up two years ago in the months after Russia invaded Ukraine.\n\nAfter the invasion, the United States and Europe moved to ban imports of Russian oil, in an effort to reduce revenues for one of the world's largest oil producers. But Yellen and other leaders of wealthy democracies against Russia's invasion realized that the European ban, when fully implemented, risked knocking millions of barrels of oil off the global market -- and triggering a price shock that could send gasoline as high as $7 per gallon in the United States.\n\nTheir alternative plan was to use the maritime industry, including shipping companies and insurance carriers, to effectively allow Russia to only sell oil at a discount: $60 per barrel, which is about $25 a barrel less than the price on the global market.\n\nThe so-called price cap proved successfully initially, but Russia soon found workarounds -- including delivering oil to buyers via a group of aging Sovcomflot tankers, operating without western insurance, that has come to be known as the shadow fleet.\n\nThe fleet of tankers along with alternative forms of maritime insurance have allowed the Kremlin to continue generating robust revenues from oil exports, helping it to finance its war against Ukraine.\n\nCritics of the price cap have argued that the $60 per barrel limit is too high and that the Biden administration has been too lenient in certain aspects of enforcing the cap. Some have called for the Treasury Department to impose more stringent oil sanctions on Russia akin to those on Iran's oil sector.\n\nIn an interview with The New York Times last month, Yellen defended the price cap, arguing that Russia's work to circumvent it still imposed costs and made it harder for Russia to sell oil.\n\n\"We've made it very expensive for Russia to ship this oil to China and India in terms of acquiring a shadow fleet and providing insurance,\" Yellen said. \"We still think it's working.\"\n\nStill, current and former Treasury officials want the administration to go further, and target the shadow fleet tankers with specific penalties that could restrict their sales or force them out of commission. European officials moved last month to penalize Russian ships evading sanctions by carrying liquefied natural gas to market, an effort that could be complemented by Treasury's proposal for oil tankers.\n\nTreasury officials have privately produced and circulated an economic analysis that contends, based on a history of enforcement actions under the price cap, that the proposed shadow-fleet penalties would be unlikely to knock Russian oil off the market, and would instead force Moscow back to selling much of its oil for lower prices under the cap.\n\nRobin Brooks, a senior fellow in the Global Economy and Development program at the Brookings Institution, and former top Treasury official, Ben Harris, who is now vice president and director of the Economic Studies Program at Brookings, released a similar analysis publicly late last month. It argues that historical evidence suggests efforts to shut down shadow-fleet tankers are \"unlikely to have even a modest impact on global oil prices.\"\n\nTwenty shadow-fleet tankers are under sanction, out of a fleet of about 120. Brooks and Harris write that the administration could penalize the additional 100 tankers in waves, in order to minimize price disruptions. They chart evidence from previous enforcement actions to show none of them have had large impacts on the oil market.\n\n\"While this is far from causal, we think it validates the notion that further sanctions on the Sovcomflot fleet are unlikely to cause oil price spikes,\" Brooks and Harris write.\n\nWhite House officials have recently argued that the price cap -- and related enforcement measures -- has thus far hurt Russia, but not American drivers.\n\n\"Energy analysts -- and even Russian officials themselves -- have linked our increased enforcement activities to the increased discount on Russian oil. At the same time, Russian export volumes have remained high, avoiding the price spike that many feared in 2022,\" Daleep Singh, a deputy national security adviser for international economics, said at Brookings in late May.", "source": {"uri": "spokesman.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Spokesman Review"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lael_Brainard",

Increased export volumes and the active use of the shadow fleet did not compensate for the lower oil prices.\n\nRussian seaborne oil exports increased by 4%, driven by a 17% MoMw rise in oil products exports after refineries have been restored from Ukrainian drone attacks in January-April. Only 12% of crude and 62% of oil products were shipped with IG P&I insurance. In May 2024, IG-insured tankers shipped no crude from Pacific Ocean ports for the first time.\n\nFor other shipments, Russia actively uses the shadow fleet. KSE Institute estimates that 220 loaded Russian shadow fleet tankers left Russian ports, with 3 involved in STS transfers in May 2024. Notably, 83% of these vessels were over 15 years old. Using these aging vessels not only allows Russia to exceed the oil price cap and increase profits but also poses a significant environmental risk in the event of an oil spill at sea.\n\nIndia, China, and Turkey made up 95% of Russian crude oil exports in May, supporting demand for Russian oil. India, the largest importer, cut seaborne crude imports by 13% to 1,812 kb/d. Turkey, the top oil product buyer, saw an 11% MoM drop in imports. However, it remained the third-largest crude importer, with an increase of 42% or 120 kb/d MoM.\n\nThe US Treasury's designation of individual vessels has removed most shadow tankers from regular commercial service. As of June 12, 2024, out of 41 sanctioned vessels, 34 remained idle with no scheduled voyages. The remaining vessels completed or partially completed voyages with Russian or non-Russian oil, showing Russia's efforts to bring OFAC-sanctioned tankers back into commercial use. Lifting the commercial cargo by sanctioned vessels may undermine the overall effectiveness of the US Treasury designations, if secondary sanctions are not imposed on all participants touching Russian oil shipped by these tankers.\n\nDespite EU/G7 sanctions, new tankers come to Russia monthly for oil exports. In May, 14 new tankers that had not shipped Russian oil from January 2023 to April 2024 were loaded in Russian ports. Six are part of the shadow fleet, with 2 transporting Venezuelan oil in 2022-2023. The other 8 belong to the legitimate fleet: 5 managed by EU/G7 companies and 3 by non-EU/G7 companies but with IG P&I insurance.\n\nMoreover, Russia employs strategies to bypass sanctions, such as Ship-to-Ship (STS) transfers to conceal the origin of its oil, utilizing Very Large Crude Carriers (VLCCs). Between December 2023 and May 2024, Russia used 14 VLCC-class tankers for STS operations; 13 carried Iranian or Venezuelan crude in 2022-2024, with only 2 having IG P&I insurance. In June, Russia used 2 Emirates and 1 Chinese tanker without IG P&I insurance to transship oil to the Vietnamese VLCC tanker Rolin, also without IG P&I insurance.\n\nThe active use of a shadow fleet and sanctions evasion allows Russia to bypass oil price caps. In May 2024, Urals FOB Primorsk and Novorossiysk prices fell by $7.6/bbl but remained ~$5/bbl above the cap. The Urals discount to Brent narrowed by $0.5/bbl, and ESPO by $2.6/bbl from the previous month.\n\nKSE Institute projects Russian oil revenues to reach $177bn and $141bn in 2024 and 2025 under the base case with current oil price caps and stronger sanctions enforcement. However, if sanctions enforcement is weak, Russian oil revenues could increase, reaching $198bn in 2024 and $186bn in 2025.\n\nWe propose three measures to address Russian evasion of oil export sanctions:\n\n1. G7/EU should ensure price cap compliance by using financial institutions' transaction knowledge, requiring reputable attestations, and increasing documentary evidence requirements.\n\n2. EU coastal states should use geographical \"choke points\" to limit Russia's shadow fleet by requiring proper spill insurance for tankers in their waters.\n\n3. Price cap coalition countries should increase penalties for violations, with tougher fines and longer lockouts for G7/EU companies, and direct or secondary sanctions for third-country actors.\n\nRussian seaborne crude & oil products exports KSE\n\nRussian seaborne crude & oil product exports by countries KSE", "source": {"uri": "intellinews.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Most importantly, shadow tankers do not carry oil spill insurance by the International Group.\n\nRussia's reliance on the shadow fleet has grown considerably; in April 2024, 83% of crude oil and 46% of petroleum products were shipped on shadow tankers. This represents a major challenge for two reasons:\n\n(1) The shrinking role of the mainstream fleet fundamentally undermines the leverage of the price cap.\n\n(2) The shadow fleet largely consists of aging and un-/underinsured vessels which pose a significant and rising threat to the environment.\n\nThe report investigates the origins of Russia's shadow fleet, its current size and operations, position within the global shadow oil trade, Russia's needs to fully bypass sanctions, its ability to counteract vessel designations, as well as prospects for the fleet's future expansion. The report also offers detailed policy recommendations to rein in the shadow fleet.\n\nThe key findings from the analysis are as follows:\n\n1. As of the first quarter 2024, 435 vessels are part of the Russian shadow fleet - they are not owned, managed, or insured by an entity in the sanctions coalition and, thus, the price cap does not apply to them. 185 are transporting crude oil and 250 products.\n\n2. The Russian shadow fleet can cover ~60% of total crude and ~45% of total products exports independent of restricted maritime services. Despite a concerted and costly effort, Russia still falls short of its ultimate objective with regard to sanctions evasion.\n\n3. To establish its shadow fleet, Russia used three key channels: (1) transfer of tankers previously owned by Russian entities to new managers; (2) 15+ year old vessels from the white fleet, i.e., with IG P&I insurance; and (3) very old vessels (20+ years) from the shadow/white fleets, which would have otherwise been decommissioned.\n\n4. Only a small share of the current Russian shadow fleet was built by transferring vessels from other segments of the global shadow oil trade (e.g., Iran, Venezuela).\n\n5. We estimate that ~500 Aframax equivalent crude oil tankers - mostly from the white fleet - are potentially available for expansion. For oil products, we assess that ~1,200 Seawaymax equivalent vessels are available for further growth.\n\n6. This assessment only reflects the theoretical availability of vessels and does not reflect specific challenges Russia may face, for two reasons: (1) Russia has already spent ~$8.5bn on the shadow fleet and additional financing may be hard to secure; (2) the EU has recently introduced legislation aimed at cracking down on the sale of mainstream tankers into the Russian shadow trade.\n\nTo address the existing Russian shadow fleet, KSE Institute recommends:\n\n1. Continue and expand vessel designation campaign, which has proven to be extremely successful. Authorities should prioritize the vessels most-heavily used for the export of Russian crude oil from Baltic and Black Sea ports to India and China.\n\n2. Make shadow fleet operations difficult and costly by requiring all vessels entering coalition ports to disclose information about their mandatory oil spill (P&I) insurance and by banning the sale of spare parts for use by shadow fleet tankers.\n\n3. Enforce existing oil spill insurance requirements to address the significant and rising environmental threat stemming from aging and uninsured shadow fleet tankers without removing transport capacity and, in turn, affecting global oil supply.\n\n4. Step up investigations and impose significant fines to alter risk perceptions by all actors involved in shadow fleet operations and thereby drive up costs for Russia. Focus on opaque ownership structures and STS operations.\n\nTo limit the future expansion of the shadow fleet, KSE Institute recommends:\n\n1. Broaden and enforce restrictions on vessel sales to limit Russia's ability to acquire tankers. Regulations such as the EU's authorization requirement should be adopted across coalition countries and applied strictly.\n\n2. Designate vessels acquired from third countries, including those from the white fleet where sales restrictions did not apply or were violated, as well as vessels transferred from other parts of the shadow fleet and/or from Russia's partners.\n\nThe study underscores the need for rigorous international measures to mitigate the risks posed by Russia's shadow fleet and to ensure the leverage and effectiveness of sanctions.", "source": {"uri": "intellinews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Intellinews                        "}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_sanctions", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Economic sanctions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanker_(ship)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tanker (ship)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Petroleum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Insurance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oil_spill", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oil spill"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seawaymax", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Seawaymax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aframax", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aframax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oil_tanker", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oil tanker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalition_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coalition government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leverage_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Leverage (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venezuela", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Venezuela"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Venezuela"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Iran"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replenishment_oiler", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Replenishment oiler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltic_Sea", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Baltic Sea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Sea", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Black Sea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Transportation_and_Logistics/Maritime", "label": "dmoz/Business/Transportation and Logistics/Maritime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Specialty_Travel", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Specialty Travel", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Transportation_and_Logistics/Fleet_Maintenance", "label": "dmoz/Business/Transportation and Logistics/Fleet Maintenance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 61}], "image": "https://d39raawggeifpx.cloudfront.net/styles/16_9_desktop/s3/articleimages/bneGeneric_Russia_shadow_fleet_oil_tankers_wiith_Russian_flag_AI_1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9721510", "eventUri": "eng-9721510", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 177, "relevance": 1}

The dispute is a rare public example of internal administration disagreements over inflation and Ukraine policy. It pits Treasury officials against aides at the White House National Economic Council, headed by Lael Brainard,\" the report said.\n\n\"White House officials privately describe the process as routine and tense, with no decision made. But the delay has confused officials elsewhere in the administration, who have not been able to get a straight answer from Ms. Brainard and her team about what is holding up the proposed action,\" the article added.\n\nWestern countries and their allies have launched a sanctions campaign against Russia, targeting the country's economy, energy, and banking services, among other areas, after Moscow launched a special military operation in Ukraine in February 2022. Despite the Western campaign, Russia says that sanctions against the country have failed and that the costs for Kiev's financiers have been greater than for the Russian economy, which is booming.\n\nDespite the sanctions, the World Bank has upgraded Russia from an \"upper-middle-income\" to a \"high-income\" country with a per-capita gross national income (GNI) of $14,250 in 2023.\n\n\"Economic activity in Russia was influenced by a large increase in military-related activity in 2023,\" the international financial institution said on July 1.\n\nAccording to the U.S.-based institution, Russia's upgrade was also boosted by growth in trade (+6.8%), the financial sector (+8.7%), and construction (+6.6%) and \"these factors led to increases in both real (3.6%) and nominal (10.9%) GDP, and Russia's Atlas GNI per capita grew by 11.2.\"\n\nEvidently, the sanctions have undoubtedly impacted the Russian economy, but they have not prevented significant growth, unlike the struggling Western economies, which have suffered from the boomerang effect of sanctions.\n\nAs the New York Times noted,\n\n\"the United States and Europe banned imports of Russian oil, in an attempt to reduce revenues for one of the world's largest oil producers,\" but as Yellen and other Western leaders realised, \"the European embargo, when fully implemented, threatened to knock millions of barrels of oil off the global market -- and trigger a price shock that could send gasoline as high as $7 a gallon in America.\"\n\nA recent Harris poll for the Guardian found that nearly three in five Americans believe the US is in an economic recession, and the majority blame the Biden administration. In the poll, 70% of Americans said their biggest economic concern was the cost of living, and 68% said that inflation was the top concern. Although the US has not been in recession since 2020, during the pandemic, the majority believe that there is a recession, which reflects the cost-of-living crisis that has seen many in the middle class enter poverty and those already poor struggling even more.\n\nAs each day passes towards the US presidential election on November 5, it is becoming increasingly likely that Donald Trump will replace Joe Biden in the White House. Instigating an oil price hike will all but end Biden's reelection campaign since Americans are already struggling with a cost-of-living crisis spurred on by the current president's policies.\n\nFor this reason, Washington will likely hold off on expanding sanctions on alleged tankers used to transport Russian energy until after the presidential elections, and only if Biden is reelected. If Trump is to be elected, it is unlikely he will introduce more sanctions on Russia that will directly hurt ordinary Americans, something Biden will have no inhibitions of doing after the election.\n\n*\n\nNote to readers: Please click the share button above.

In doing so, Western policymakers should remain clear-eyed about potential risks and side effects.\n\nTwo and a half years ago, in the run-up to Russia's full-fledged war against Ukraine, Moscow was promised \"sanctions from hell.\" It was widely expected that these sanctions would crush the Russian economy. That did not happen, and one of the reasons was that Russia managed to maintain its oil exports' prewar volume and revenues. It was clear from the outset that it would be next to impossible to completely eliminate Russian oil from the global markets, but there were strong hopes that the price cap mechanism would at least put pressure on the price and put the cash flows under control of the Western coalition, which might eventually drastically reduce the resources available for the Russian military effort.\n\nRussia, for its part, was determined to keep its oil trade outside of the Western-controlled system -- and has succeeded. Initially, Russian crude prices fell significantly, and Moscow had to spend money building up a shadow fleet of tankers, since Western-owned ones were no longer available to it, but the discounts are much smaller now, and oil revenues are higher than pre-COVID and prewar levels. So far, the price cap mechanism has been ineffective.\n\nThe price cap mechanism was built on a belief that the West has a monopoly on the services needed to move oil from Russian ports to Asian refineries: that Russia would not be able to manage without Western-owned tankers, insurance underwritten by Western-led P&I clubs, or bank transactions in Western currencies passing through Western banks. That belief turned out to be incorrect. Russia managed to organize a parallel system to handle its oil trade by amassing a shadow fleet and finding alternative insurance providers.\n\nThis is a deeply unsatisfying state of affairs for Western policymakers, from both a reputational and practical point of view. First, it undermines the authority of the Western coalition and the effectiveness of future sanctions, since they are dependent on the willingness of potential sanctions violators and violation abettors to take risks, having weighed up the likely losses and rewards. Second, the failure of the price cap keeps Russian coffers full and the war machine running. Accordingly, Western governments are looking for more radical solutions and fixes.\n\nDanish and Finnish officials have announced that they are looking for legal ways to deny passage to ships carrying Russian crude and diesel through marine chokepoints such as the Danish straits, the entrance to the Gulf of Finland, and the English Channel if they are not operating in accordance with the price cap mechanism. In all these cases, the ships would have to pass within 12 nautical miles of Danish, Finnish or Estonian, or English or French shores.\n\nThe ships in question often belong to non-Russian owners, sail under non-Russian flags, and carry cargo owned by non-Russian traders. They might have insurance certificates issued by Russian insurers that don't belong to international insurance clubs, but those insurers had a substantial share of the oil cargo business before the war.\n\nThe 1982 UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), which governs international marine traffic, cites the right of peaceful passage as a fundamental legal principle. In some cases, free passage is governed by much older treaties, such as the 1857 Copenhagen Convention for the Danish straits. Naval blockades have been tools of war and casus belli many times in history. UNCLOS was drafted and signed with the idea of eliminating this source of tensions and lowering the chances of war. As a result, it left very little room for littoral states to hinder the free passage of commercial vessels.\n\nThe challenge European policymakers are facing now, therefore, is how to make a blockade -- an act often used during hostilities -- look like a justified peacetime measure within the framework of conventions written to avoid hostilities. In other words, how to conduct an act of war while technically not conducting an act of war.\n\nFinnish Foreign Minister Elina Valtonen has said: \"It's just not very easy because international maritime law is basically geared towards opening navigation and making it very difficult for any country to intervene with free traffic. The law was built for a completely different world than what we are now looking at.\"\n\nIt is understandable that the West prefers to take a measured approach in its conflict with Russia, sticking to commercial issues and avoiding any show of physical force. As tempting as it is to use technicalities to pursue strategic goals and justify a forceful course of action in the confrontation between Russia and the West, stopping tankers carrying Russian crude in the Danish straits could prompt an escalation on Russia's part, such as an armed naval escort.\n\nThis approach also erodes trust and respect for the rules-based international order. Rules are commitment devices: their true value is demonstrated when they are applied against the current interests of their authors and proponents. If the conventions signed in the Cold War era are of no use today, then what is? Russia has long accused the West of hypocrisy and has justified its actions by citing double standards and manipulation of the rules to the advantage of the United States and EU. The use of UNCLOS to exercise a naval blockade against Russia will only provide Moscow with another story to tell the Global South.\n\nThe West still has the means to enforce the price cap more strictly and more broadly by going after profit-seekers who are willing to help move Russian oil for a fee and turn a blind eye to phony price cap compliance attestation. The West could also threaten secondary sanctions against Chinese and Indian buyers -- if it has the will to expend political capital on the issue. But attempts to stop the physical flow of Russian oil through international straits would amount to a blockade, and will be seen as such.\n\nThat's not to say that it's not the right thing to do -- but it should be done with a full and clear understanding of the significance of the act and possible consequences, rather than naively sleepwalking into the next level of conflict.", "source":

At the same time, a \"shadow fleet\" has gradually built up.\n\nThe fleet, willing to take the risk of shipping Russian oil despite sanctions, comprises ageing tankers often managed by little-known companies based in Dubai and China, carrying flags of African countries.\n\nIndia, which has become the largest buyer of Urals oil grade since 2022, is the main destination for tankers leaving Russian ports with oil onboard.\n\nThe cost of transporting Urals from the Black Sea's Novorossiisk port to India for Suezmax tankers, which can hold 140,000 metric tons, fell to around $4.3-4.5 million for a one-way trip, having dropped by about $1.5-$2 million since the beginning of June, the sources said.\n\n\"Freight rates for Suezmax tankers (on routes from Novorossiisk to ports in western India) have fallen dramatically over the past month.

In early June the cost of such a voyage exceeded $6 million.\n\nThe fall in freight rates in the Russian oil transportation market supports Urals prices on a FOB basis, and has taken them further above the price cap limit of $60 per barrel, Reuters data shows.\n\nOne of the sources, who is involved in trading Urals, said Greek-managed vessels were the most expensive of those providing shipments from the Baltic to India, adding even these rates are no higher than $5.1 million.", "source": {"uri": "marinelink.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MarineLink"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_sanctions_during_the_Russo-Ukrainian_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "International sanctions during the Russo-Ukrainian War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanker_(ship)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tanker (ship)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Petroleum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oil_refinery", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oil refinery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suezmax", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Suezmax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novorossiysk", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Novorossiysk"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Novorossiysk"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urals_oil", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Urals oil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ural_Mountains", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ural Mountains"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Port"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonne", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tonne"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Sea", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Black Sea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dubai", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dubai"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dubai"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Arab Emirates"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltic_Sea", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Baltic Sea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barrel", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Barrel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primorsk,_Leningrad_Oblast", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Primorsk, Leningrad Oblast"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Primorsk, Leningrad Oblast"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ust-Luga", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ust-Luga"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ust-Luga"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Oil_and_Gas", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Oil and Gas", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Food_and_Related_Products/Fats_and_Oils", "label": "dmoz/Business/Food and Related Products/Fats and Oils", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Transportation_and_Logistics/Maritime", "label": "dmoz/Business/Transportation and Logistics/Maritime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Consulting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Consulting", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://images.marinelink.com/images/maritime/w800/au-usanakul-adobe-stock-151575.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9721510", "eventUri": "eng-9721510", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1607843137254902, "wgt": 160, "relevance": 1}

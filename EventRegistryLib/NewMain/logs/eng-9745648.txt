The high on Sunday in Yakima could reach 107.\n\nThough Monday's high is predicted to reach 102, Tuesday's high is predicted to be 93 degrees.\n\nThe extreme heat will significantly increase the risk of heat-related illnesses for many, especially people who are heat-sensitive and those without effective cooling or adequate hydration. People should drink plenty of fluids, stay in an air-conditioned area and out of the sun. They should also check on relatives and neighbors, forecasters said.\n\nNever leave young children and pets unattended in vehicles under any circumstances.\n\nThose who work or spend time outside should take extra precautions. Reschedule strenuous activities to early morning or evening if possible. Wear lightweight and loose-fitting clothing. To reduce risk during outdoor work, take frequent rest breaks in shaded or air conditioned environments.\n\nKnow the signs and symptoms of heat exhaustion and heat stroke. Anyone overcome by heat should be moved to a cool and shaded location. Heat stroke is an emergency; call 911.\n\nFor sheltering information and other human services, call 211 during business hours or visit wa211.org for Washington or 211info.org for Oregon.\n\nCampfire ban\n\nStarting July 20, campfires are banned across the Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest due to continuing hot, dry weather and worsening fire danger conditions. The ban includes developed campgrounds and designated Wilderness areas.\n\nUse of wood and charcoal campfires is banned, but people will still be able to use pressurized or bottled liquid fuel stoves, lanterns, campfires or heating devices if no flammable material is present within three feet of the device. Devices must have an on-off switch or valve that can immediately extinguish the flame.\n\nThe Bureau of Land Management, which has recreation land in the Yakima River Canyon, also banned campfires starting Friday, including charcoal briquette fires.", "source": {"uri": "yakimaherald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yakima Herald-Republic"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yakima,_Washington", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Yakima, Washington"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Yakima, Washington"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Weather_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Weather Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_wave", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Heat wave"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_conditioning", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Air conditioning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kittitas_County,_Washington", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kittitas County, Washington"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kittitas County, Washington"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_stroke", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Heat stroke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dehydration", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dehydration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fluid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campfire", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Campfire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okanogan\u2013Wenatchee_National_Forest", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Okanogan\u2013Wenatchee National Forest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umtanum_Ridge_Water_Gap", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Umtanum Ridge Water Gap"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_exhaustion", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Heat exhaustion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Briquette", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Briquette"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lantern", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lantern"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valve", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Valve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charcoal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Charcoal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bureau_of_Land_Management", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bureau of Land Management"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campsite", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Campsite"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilderness", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wilderness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oregon"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oregon"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Electronics_and_Electrical/Heating_and_Cooling", "label": "dmoz/Business/Electronics and Electrical/Heating and Cooling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Home_and_Garden/Climate_Control", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Home and Garden/Climate Control", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement/Climate_Control", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement/Climate Control", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement/Plumbing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement/Plumbing", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/yakimaherald.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/b/5b/b5bcf4f4-45f9-11ef-9fcd-2f93a503cf2a/669aca4cca3b9.preview.jpg?crop=1764%2C926%2C0%2C123&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9745648", "eventUri": "eng-9745648", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-20", "textStart": 1644, "textEnd": 1651}], "sentiment": -0.1686274509803921, "wgt": 147, "relevance": 1}

Call 9 1 1.\n\nThis Morning: Patchy low clouds & fog around the bay and perhaps into nearby valleys at times. Expect lows in the low to mid 50s on the and lower elevation valleys with 50s-60s in higher valleys and 60s-70s up in the hills. Breezy up-valley winds slowly tapering off past midnight.\n\nFriday: Becoming mostly sunny with a few low clouds on the coast and a mid level cloud or two moving in from the south, especially in the east. Warmer, with coastal highs in the upper 60s to low 80s -- warmest on the north side of the bay -- and 80s to around 106\u00baF for inland valleys. Windy out of the northwest on the coast at times and then up-valleys late in the day.\n\nSaturday: Cooler with lingering low clouds on the south side of the bay. Some drizzle possible on the S/E sides of the bay early and then again late. Still seasonable on the coast, however, with highs in the 60s-70s and cooler, but still warm inland with 80s-90s for most areas. Windy out of the northwest on the coast at times and then up-valleys late in the day.\n\nExtended: Another round of coastal drizzle possible Sunday, but we're trending warmer on the coast Sunday into next week with highs seasonable to slightly above. Inland areas will warm as well in response to the strengthening ridge over the area with widespread 90s-100s expected. Monsoonal moisture will increase the high cloudcover during the period, but at this moment we look to remain dry and lightning chances look\n\n*Note: Any alerts from the National Weather Service in Monterey will be noted in italics above.

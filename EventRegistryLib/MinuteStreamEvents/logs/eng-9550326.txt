Harry did not have the support from the Royal Family at Wednesday's as they did not show up. Instead, King Charles III was joined by a large group of royals in a show of unity at the Buckingham Palace garden party.\n\nRather than be joined by the Royal Family to show their support, the late Princess Diana's siblings made sure to attend.\n\nFor all the latest on news, politics, sports, and showbiz from the USA, go to The Mirror US.\n\nREAD MORE: Harry puts on brave face for thronging crowds as Royals snub Invictus service\n\nREAD MORE: Harry and Charles 'won't have an easy journey' if they want to end their feud\n\nPrince Harry was not alone when attending the service at St. Paul's Cathedral Princess Diana's siblings went to support Harry on Wednesday\n\nHarry's late mother's brother, Earl Charles Spencer, and sister, Lady Jane Fellowes, attended the Service on Wednesday.

The Duke's \"second dad,\" former Army officer, Mark Dyer, was at the service as well.\n\nHarry was alone as he walked up the steps to the entrance. The garden party was only two kilometres from St. Paul' and it's said Harry had hoped to see his father during his stay in the UK, but a spokesperson for Harry revealed earlier in the week that wouldn't happen.\n\nThe Royal Family did not attend\n\nIn a statement, Harry's spokesperson said: \"In response to the many inquiries and continued speculation on whether or not the duke will meet with his father while in the UK this week, it unfortunately will not be possible due to His Majesty's full programme.

Harry last saw the King in February when he dashed from the US after Charles' cancer diagnosis. His spokesman said earlier this week: \"In response to the many inquiries on whether or not the Duke will meet with his father while in the UK, it \u00adunfortunately will not be possible due to His Majesty's full programme. The Duke of course is understanding of his father's diary of commitments and various other priorities and hopes to see him soon.\"\n\nThe Duke of Sussex left London and will travel to Nigeria\n\nRoyal commentator Richard Fitzwilliams said: \"It's a very difficult situation at the moment and it's completely unprecedented. I think people thought Harry and the King would have found the time to meet each other. I think what's developing here is something that had not been expected but there is logic to it. I think that this and the appointment of William as Colonel-in-Chief of the Army Air Corps is about timing.\" Mr Fitzwilliams added: \"The only way for the rift to be healed is in private.\"\n\nHarry wore his military medals for the service at St Paul's\n\nAt yesterday's event at St Paul's, no other member of the Royal Family joined Harry at his Invictus event. Harry's appearance yesterday was in stark contrast to 2014 when he launched the Games, accompanied by Charles, Camilla and William. His relationship with the family has grown increasingly fractured since he and Meghan quit as working royals in 2020 and moved to California with their children Archie, five, and two-year-old Lilibet.\n\nPrince Harry has now left the UK\n\nHarry was joined at the 10th anniversary by his mum Diana's brother Charles Spencer and her sister Lady Jane Fellows. The Duke's cousins George McCorquodale, 39, and Louis and Lara Spencer, 30 and 18, also sat close and supported him. Harry was cheered by hundreds of people outside the cathedral who waited to see him.\n\nCrowds had gathered around crash barriers to see the duke's car pull up, and there was a large number of journalists, photographers, and cameramen covering his every move. Harry acknowledged them with a wave as he strode up St Paul's steps and was warmly greeted warmly greeted by the Dean of St Paul's, the Very Reverend Andrew Tremlett.\n\nHarry greeted wellwishers who had turned out to see him\n\nWhen the duke left he went on a brief walkabout, shaking hands with some of the well-wishers who had waited to catch a glimpse of him.", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk",

The first Invictus Games were held in September 2014 at London's Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park.\n\nMeanwhile, Charles and senior royal family members attended a garden party at Buckingham Palace two miles away after it was announced that the monarch would not be able to meet with his son while Harry is in the U.K.\n\nPRINCE HARRY WON'T MEET WITH KING CHARLES DURING TRIP TO UK FOR INVICTUS GAMES ANNIVERSARY\n\nAt Buckingham's first garden party of the season, Charles was joined by Queen Camilla; Anne, Princess Royal; Prince Edward, Duke of Edinburgh; Sophie, Duchess of Edinburgh; Birgitte, Duchess of Gloucester; and Prince Richard, Duke of Gloucester. Ahead of the garden party, Charles held his weekly audience with U.K. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak.\n\nCharles' son Prince William and his wife Kate Middleton did not attend the garden party. The Prince of Wales, 40, conducted an investiture ceremony at Windsor earlier on Wednesday while the Princess of Wales, 41, is taking time off from official royal duties while she undergoes cancer treatment.\n\nHowever, Harry's uncle, Charles Spencer, the 9th Earl Spencer and Diana's younger brother, attended the Invictus Games' anniversary service in support of his nephew.\n\nAt the service, Harry read a passage from the Bible, and \"Homeland\" star Damien Lewis recited William Ernest Henley's \"Invictus\" poem, per the BBC. The service was led by the Dean of St. Paul's, The Very Reverend Andrew Tremlett.\n\nThe Duke of Sussex will attend multiple events while in London to commemorate the Invictus Games' 10th anniversary.\n\nOn Tuesday, Harry was part of an onstage panel during The Invictus Games Foundation Conversation titled \"Realising a Global Community\" at the Honourable Artillery Company.\n\nHarry will be in the U.K. for three days before being joined by his wife Meghan Markle for a trip to Nigeria after the couple were invited to visit the African country by its Chief of Defense Staff.\n\nOn Tuesday, a representative for Harry confirmed to Fox News Digital that Charles wouldn't be able to meet his son during his U.K. trip.\n\n\"In response to the many inquiries and continued speculation on whether or not The Duke will meet with his father while in the UK this week, it unfortunately will not be possible due to His Majesty's full programme,\" the spokesperson said.\n\n\"The Duke of course is understanding of his father's diary of commitments and various other priorities and hopes to see him soon.\"\n\nKing Charles recently returned to public duties amid his cancer battle.\n\nShortly after Charles' cancer diagnosis was announced in February, Prince Harry flew over 5,000 miles from California to the U.K. to visit his father.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER\n\nHowever, Prince Harry's trip to England at that time was short, according to royal experts. The Duke of Sussex reportedly only stayed in the U.K. for 24 hours, during which he met with Charles for 45 minutes at Clarence House. The Duke of Sussex didn't meet with William during the trip.\n\n\"I spoke to him,\" Harry later told \"Good Morning America\" about his meeting with Charles. \"I jumped on a plane and went to go see him as soon as I could.\"\n\n\"Look, I love my family,\" he added. \"The fact that I was able to get on a plane and go and see him and spend any time with him, I'm grateful for that.\"", "source":

Prince Harry has returned to the UK to attend a service of thanksgiving at St. Paul's Cathedral to mark the tenth anniversary of the Invictus Games. The Invictus Games were founded as a sporting event for injured military personnel and veterans. This will be the first major event he has attended in the UK for some time. A spokesperson for the Duke of Sussex claimed that it is \"not possible\" for him to see his father due to the king's \"full\" schedule. In response to the many inquiries and continued speculation on whether or not the Duke will meet with his father while in the UK this week, it, unfortunately, will not be possible due to His Majesty's full program, Prince Harry's Spokesperson. The duke, of course, is understanding of his father's diary of commitments and various other priorities and hopes to see him soon, Prince Harry's Spokesperson. Meghan Markle recently came under fire for opting not to join Harry on his trip to the UK for the anniversary of the games. A spokesperson confirmed that the Duchess of Sussex was not planning to travel to the UK. However, Meghan will fly from the US to Nigeria to meet her husband immediately afterward. Markle has only briefly visited the UK three times since she and Prince Harry officially left the royal family in 2020. Prince Harry has since made a few solo trips, including to see King Charles following his cancer diagnosis in February. Prior to the trip, Rumors had been circulating that King Charles was hoping to play the \"peacemaker\" between Prince Harry and Prince William. Royal butler Grant Harrold, who worked closely with Charles for years, believed it \"very likely\" the brothers would reconnect over the event. However, reconciliation seems evermore unlikely . Buckingham Palace announced Charles will be handing Harry's role as Colonel-in-Chief of the Army Air Corps to Prince William. Sources have revealed to Page Six that Harry had extended invitations to the event to his family as an olive branch. However, none of the senior royals are expected to attend.

Prince Harry's Invictus-focused solo trip was a full-circle moment, as he hosted the first iteration of international adaptive sports tournament for wounded, injured and sick service personnel and veterans in London in 2014.\n\nThe Duke of Sussex, 39, was supported at the St. Paul's service by several members from Princess Diana's side of the family -- his aunt Lady Jane Fellowes, his uncle Charles Spencer and his cousin Louis Spencer. Prince Harry was in good spirits as he arrived, happily greeting well-wishers outside of the historic church when the service concluded.\n\nPrincess Kate, 42, has been out of the public eye since Christmas, following her abdominal surgery in January, private recovery and the announcement of her cancer diagnosis on March 22. The Princess of Wales said in her self-written speech announcing her diagnosis that she looked forward to returning to work \"when I am able,\" though Kensington Palace outlined that any initial public events won't necessarily signal a formal return to a regular schedule.\n\nPrince William, 41, conducted investitures at Windsor Castle on the same day as Prince Harry's Invictus Games service. The duty included awarding an MBE to Claire van Straubenzee for the Henry van Straubenzee Memorial Fund, an educational non-profit focused on Uganda named after Claire and Alex van Straubenzee's son Henry, who died in a car crash in 2002 just before he was due to go to the African country to work in a school.\n\nHenry's brothers, Thomas and Charlie, are very close friends of Prince William and Prince Harry, who backed the charity as the only patronage they shared.\n\nA few miles from St. Paul's Cathedral, King Charles, 75, hosted the first garden party of the season at Buckingham Palace. The royal family has organized garden parties have been held since the 1860s as a way for the monarch to recognize community members for their public service. The festive event was attended by Queen Camilla, Princess Anne, Prince Edward, Sophie, the Duchess of Edinburgh, Prince Richard and Birgitte, the Duchess of Gloucester.\n\nPEOPLE confirmed earlier this week that Prince Harry would not be able to meet with his father the King Charles during his U.K. stay due to the sovereign's \"full\" schedule.\n\n\"In response to the many inquiries and continued speculation on whether or not The Duke will meet with his father while in the U.K. this week, it unfortunately will not be possible due to His Majesty's full program. The Duke of course is understanding of his father's diary of commitments and various other priorities and hopes to see him soon,\" a spokesperson for the Duke of Sussex said.\n\nThe King recently resumed public-facing duties while receiving cancer treatment, and Prince Harry was last in the U.K. in February to visit his father following Buckingham Palace's announcement of the sovereign's cancer diagnosis.\n\nThe Duke of Sussex then traveled to Canada for the Invictus Games Vancouver Whistler 2025's One Year to Go celebration with his wife Meghan Markle, and revealed in an interview there that he hoped to see his father as much as possible.\n\nCan't get enough of PEOPLE's Royals coverage? Sign up for our free Royals newsletter to get the latest updates on Kate Middleton, Meghan Markle and more!\n\nWhen Good Morning America's Will Reeve asked Harry about how he first learned of his father's cancer diagnosis, Harry replied, \"I spoke to him. I jumped on a plane and went to go see him as soon as I could.\"\n\n\"Look, I love my family. The fact that I was able to get on a plane and go and see him and spend any time with him, I'm grateful for that,\" he continued.\n\nAs for whether King Charles' diagnosis could have a \"reunifying effect\" on the royal family, Harry, who spent time with Invictus Games competitors and their families at the countdown kickoff, said: \"Absolutely. Yeah, I'm sure. Throughout all these families, I see it on a day-to-day basis, the strength of the family unit coming together.\"\n\nThe Duke and Duchess of Sussex relocated to her home state of California after stepping back as working members of the royal family in 2020. Though Prince Harry has returned to the U.K. on several occasions, including for charity events and court cases he's pursuing, he rarely reunites with King Charles or other family members.\n\nFollowing his latest U.K. stay, U.K., Prince Harry and Meghan, 42, will visit Nigeria at the of the Chief of Defense Staff, the country's highest-ranking military official.", "source":

Just as the Duke of Sussex arrived in the U.K., it was announced the king had a \"full\" schedule. The same can reportedly be said for Harry's brother, the Prince of Wales, and why he won't be at St. Paul's Cathedral for an anniversary service.\n\nHarry's back in the U.K. He returned to England to celebrate 10 years of the Invictus Games, the adaptive sporting competition he launched in 2014. So far, he's celebrated the milestone with many people, but no one in his family.\n\nFollowing much speculation as to whether or not Harry might get together with King Charles during his visit, the 39-year-old's attending a special service at St. Paul's Cathedral honoring the Invictus Games alone. As in, no William, King Charles, or any other senior royals.\n\nSimilar to the king, William's reason for not supporting Harry -- aside from their years-long rift -- is that the 41-year-old future king is too busy.\n\n\"William is a hop, skip, and a jump from the throne,\" an insider told Express in the days before the Invictus anniversary service. \"With an ill wife and three young children -- he has plenty on his plate.\"\n\nKate Middleton, 42, is undergoing cancer treatment after announcing her diagnosis via video in March 2024. As for William's schedule, it's taking him out of London to Cornwall, England, and then the Isles of Scilly l on May 9.\n\nMeanwhile, Harry's expected to be on his way to Nigeria to meet Meghan Markle for a joint trip.\n\nAs some reports have previously claimed, it seems King Charles is too busy to meet Harry while he's in London. \"It unfortunately will not be possible due to His Majesty's full program,\" a spokesperson for Harry said (via BBC).\n\nThe king, who recently returned to public duties approximately 11 weeks after starting cancer treatment, has a weekly meeting with Britain's Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and a Buckingham Palace garden party. (At the time of writing, the monarch is two miles away from Harry and the Invictus Games anniversary service.)\n\nHarry, the spokesperson added, is \"understanding\" of his father's busy schedule. \"The Duke, of course, is understanding of his father's diary of commitments and various other priorities and hopes to see him soon.\"\n\nHarry last saw King Charles in February 2024 when he flew to England shortly after the monarch's cancer diagnosis had been announced. (The king is still undergoing treatment for an undisclosed type of cancer.) Reports estimated they spent under an hour together at Clarence House.\n\nThere's no telling when Harry may next see his father or brother. At the time of writing, the Duke of Sussex hasn't announced any more U.K. trips to come for 2024.\n\nOr, for that matter, any opportunities where he might stop in to see King Charles or, on the off chance, William. Harry may have more U.K. visits planned, but he has yet to reveal them publicly. Although it's important to note it's all speculation, a question mark.\n\nCould it be a special trip in November for King Charles's birthday? Perhaps. Or maybe a stopover on the way somewhere else, like Harry's done in the past.\n\nHe hasn't been in the same room with William since 2023 when the two attended their father's coronation. Prior to that, the brothers appeared together at Queen Elizabeth II's 2022 funeral.\n\nTrooping the Colour is unlikely to count Harry and Meghan as guests (they haven't attended since Platinum Jubilee weekend.)\n\nHarry previously teased more royal reunions in February 2024, with the Invictus anniversary understood to be among them.\n\nFor now, a potential trip to Balmoral, the royal family's estate in Scotland, seems to be the likeliest scenario as King Charles could reportedly extend an \"olive branch\" invite to the Sussex family, which they're said to be eager and downright \"ready\" to accept.", "source": {"uri": "cheatsheet.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Showbiz Cheat Sheet"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mandi_kerr@cheatsheet.com", "name": "Mandi Kerr", "type": "author",

Harry warmly greeted his uncle and aunt with a hug at the start of the service.\n\nOther extended relatives who were there to show their support included Harry's cousins George McCorquodale, Ned Spencer, and Louis Spencer, Viscount Althorp.\n\nHarry's cousin Zara Tindall\n\nBut members of the royal family were noticeably absent from the high-profile event.\n\nHarry's cousin, Zara Tindall, who he is incredibly close to, was busy competing at the Badminton Horse Trials, miles away in south Gloucestershire. She was seen running with her horse Class Affair during the inspection on day one of the trials.\n\nWearing a white top and trousers combo paired with a navy blazer, and accessorizing with sunglasses, the Olympic medallist looked in her element.\n\nKing Charles' 'full programme'\n\nAhead of Harry's trip, there was much speculation about a potential meeting between him and his father King Charles, but this time around, schedules did not align.\n\nHarry's spokesperson confirmed that the King, who has only just returned to public-facing duties amid his cancer battle, was too busy to see his California-based son.\n\nThe spokesperson said: \"In response to the many inquiries and continued speculation on whether or not the Duke will meet with his father while in the UK this week, it unfortunately will not be possible due to His Majesty's full programme. The Duke of course is understanding of his father's diary of commitments and various other priorities and hopes to see him soon.\"\n\nWhile Harry was attending the Invictus Games service, just a few miles down the road, the King, 75, was hosting his first garden party of the year at Buckingham Palace. Charles appeared in good spirits, laughing and making jokes with guests and telling one well-wisher: \"I'm not doing badly.\"\n\nDozens of people asked after his health and told him how good it was to see him back in public again.\n\nOn his last visit to the UK, Harry met with King Charles for only 45 minutes, having rushed to fly over following his father's cancer diagnosis. Harry went straight to Clarence House, the monarch having delayed his journey to Sandringham in order to see his youngest son.\n\nWhat other royals were doing during Harry's fleeting visit\n\nMembers of the royal family were out in force to support the King at the garden party. As well as his wife Queen Camilla, the Princess Royal, the Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh, and the Duke and Duchess of Gloucester were also in attendance.\n\nDuchess Sophie looked pretty in pink, while Princess Anne was her typically stylish self in a floral-printed blue ensemble.\n\nPrince William's relationship with Harry\n\nPrince William and Prince Harry did not meet either, as the brothers are sadly estranged following the publication of Prince Harry's memoir Spare, and a reconciliation is unlikely at the present time.\n\nThe next-in-line was busy giving out investitures at Windsor Castle on the day that Harry was in London for the Invictus Games event, and the following day on Thursday, he travelled to Nansleden, Newquay to visit the site where the Duchy of Cornwall's first homeless housing project will be built.\n\nWilliam also stopped by Fistral beach, where he met organisations who take care of it.\n\nWhere were Meghan Markle and the children?\n\nMeghan stayed behind in the couple's Montecito home with Prince Archie, four, and Princess Lillibet, two.\n\nOn the latest episode of HELLO!'s A Right Royal Podcast, The Telegraph's Royal Editor Hannah Furness spoke about why Meghan is unlikely to return to the UK anytime soon.\n\n\"There is quite a heavy narrative that Meghan and the children won't be coming back until they can resolve this security issue to their liking,\" she said. \"But he [Harry] will certainly be coming and going.\"\n\nHowever, the Duchess of Sussex will join her husband on the couple's upcoming trip to Nigeria.\n\nIt's a trip that also has connections to the Invictus Games, with the couple being invited by the Chief of Defence Staff, the highest-ranking military official in Nigeria who met Prince Harry at the event in Dusseldorf last year.\n\nThe African country also has personal connections for Meghan. In her former podcast, Archetypes, she said: \"I just had my genealogy done a couple years ago... [and I'm] Forty-three percent Nigerian.\"\n\nNo doubt Meghan is looking forward to the trip, especially since she got on so well with the Nigerian team at the 2023 Invictus Games.", "source": {"uri": "hellomagazine.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "HELLO!"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ainhoa_barcelona@hellomagazine.com", "name": "Ainhoa Barcelona", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "millie_jackson@hellomagazine.com", "name": "Millie Jackson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William,_Prince_of_Wales", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "William, Prince of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Harry,_Duke_of_Sussex", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zara_Tindall", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Zara Tindall"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_I_of_England", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Charles I of England"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invictus_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Invictus Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Spencer,_Viscount_Althorp", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Louis Spencer, Viscount Althorp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_royal_family", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "British royal family"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Spencer,_9th_Earl_Spencer", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Charles Spencer, 9th Earl Spencer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Badminton_Horse_Trials", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Badminton Horse Trials"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_Jane_Grey", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lady Jane Grey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diana,_Princess_of_Wales", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Diana, Princess of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anne,_Princess_Royal", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anne, Princess Royal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Paul's_Cathedral", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "St Paul's Cathedral"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gloucestershire", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gloucestershire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gloucestershire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandringham_House", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sandringham House"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarence_House", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Clarence House"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarchy_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Monarchy of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckingham_Palace", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Buckingham Palace"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Archie_of_Sussex", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prince Archie of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophie,_Duchess_of_Edinburgh", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sophie, Duchess of Edinburgh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_Camilla", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Queen Camilla"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meghan,_Duchess_of_Sussex", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Meghan, Duchess of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duchy_of_Cornwall", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Duchy of Cornwall"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_of_the_Defence_Staff_(United_Kingdom)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief of the Defence Staff (United Kingdom)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duke_of_Gloucester", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Duke of Gloucester"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windsor_Castle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Windsor Castle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investiture", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Investiture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hello!_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hello!

This comes after the Duke of Sussex allegedly made \"difficult demands\" about the conditions of their meeting, according to Royal expert Charlotte Griffiths. \"I think the reason was because Harry made certain demands about who could be in the room and who couldn't. Although on the surface it looks like a snub, Harry made it very difficult for his father.\"\n\nWhen asked to elaborate on the demands, Griffiths said \"other forces\" could've influenced the king's decision. \"Maybe other forces were driving Charles' position on this,\" she said. \"William may have had a thought about how this meeting should be conducted or whether it should be conducted at all.\"\n\nPrince Harry returned to the UK on Tuesday amidst speculation that he would reunite with his father, reports the Mirror. However, a spokesperson has confirmed that this will not be happening.\n\nRoyal editor Chris Ship took to social media to announce that Prince Harry had arrived in the UK. He informed that Harry had landed in the UK ahead of his St Paul's Cathedral service on May 8 and would be \"doing some Invictus related events\".\n\n\"Prince Harry travelled to the UK alone - without Meghan or the children Archie and Lilibet.\n\nMeghan will not accompany Harry to the St Paul's Cathedral in London tomorrow.

Therefore, she doesn't want King Charles to meet his son alone. According to Royal commentator Angela Levin, Camilla fears that, given the monarch's vulnerable condition during cancer treatment, he could give his son inside information.\n\n\"Nobody really wants to see him (Harry).

As Harry mingled with the crowd outside the cathedral, cheers and shouts of \"we love you Harry\" echoed.\n\nAfter interacting with his fans, Harry was escorted to his car to depart from the event. This warm reception followed the Royal Family's decision to skip the event at St Paul's Cathedral.\n\nWhile Harry was at the Invictus Games event, King Charles was accompanied by a large group of royals showing unity at the Buckingham Palace garden party held just two miles away from St Paul's, reports the Mirror.\n\nHowever, Harry wasn't alone at the service a his uncle Earl Charles Spencer and aunt Lady Jane Fellowes, both siblings of the late Princess Diana, were present. Also in attendance were Harry's cousin Louis Spencer, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's wife Akshata Murty, his lawyer David Sherbourne, and former Army officer Mark Dyer, who has been like a \"second dad\" to Harry.\n\nThe atmosphere at St Paul's Cathedral was thick with anticipation as Royal supporters were delighted to see Harry, dispelling concerns about any potential boos for the Duke.

I think that this and the appointment of William as Colonel-in-Chief of the Army Air Corps is about timing.\"\n\nHe further noted: \"The only way for the rift to be healed is in private.\"\n\nAt the recent St Paul's event, Prince Harry was noticeably without any other Royal Family members at his Invictus Games celebration.\n\nThis marked a significant change from 2014 when he launched the Games with the support of Prince Charles, Camilla, and Prince William.\n\nSince stepping back as senior royals in 2020 and relocating to California with their children Archie and Lilibet, Harry's relationship with his family has become visibly strained.\n\nDuring the 10th-anniversary celebrations, Harry was accompanied by his mother Princess Diana's siblings Charles Spencer and Lady Jane Fellows.\n\nHis cousins George McCorquodale, Louis Spencer, and Lara Spencer were also present, offering their support.\n\nHundreds of supporters gathered outside St Paul's Cathedral, awaiting a glimpse of the Duke and greeting him with cheers.\n\nSpectators had assembled around the crash barriers to witness the duke's arrival, with a throng of journalists, photographers, and cameramen documenting his every move.\n\nHarry greeted them with a wave as he ascended the steps of St Paul's and received a warm welcome from the Dean of St Paul's, the Very Reverend Andrew Tremlett.\n\nUpon his departure, the duke briefly mingled with the crowd, extending handshakes to some of the fans who had patiently awaited his appearance.\n\nGet the latest celebrity gossip and telly news sent straight to your inbox.

You can opt-out at any time.\n\nThe royal family was noticeably absent from a ceremony celebrating the Invictus Games.\n\nThe Invictus Games, a worldwide sporting competition for injured veterans, marked 10 years since its creation on Wednesday.\n\nPrince Harry serves as the founding patron of the organization, creating it after working directly with injured soldiers during his time in the military.\n\nThe organization has seen steady growth in recent years, increasing its annual income from about $1.2 million to $2.5 million from 2018 to 2022, according to the Charity Commission for England and Wales.\n\nAs part of the anniversary celebrations, The Invictus Games Foundation hosted a Service of Thanksgiving at St Paul's Cathedral in London.\n\nHarry traveled to the UK to attend the ceremony and other events marking the anniversary.\n\nHarry was the only member of the monarchy to attend the Service of Thanksgiving, though royals have supported him at Invictus Games events in years past.\n\nKing Charles III, who returned to public duty at the end of April, was in London during the event, hosting an annual garden party at Buckingham Palace with Queen Camilla on Wednesday instead of attending the service.\n\nThough his royal family wasn't at the event, Harry reunited with Diana's siblings, Earl Charles Spencer and Lady Jane Fellowes, at the Service of Thanksgiving.\n\nThe Daily Mail published video footage of Harry hugging his Spencer relatives inside the event.\n\nHarry's relationship with the royal family has been strained since he and Meghan Markle stepped back as senior royals in January 2020.\n\nHowever, Harry has supported Charles over the past year, attending his coronation in May 2023 and visiting him amid his cancer diagnosis. He met with the king and Queen Camilla for about 45 minutes shortly after the monarch announced his diagnosis to the public, the BBC reported.\n\nIn an interview with Good Morning America following the visit, Harry said he was \"grateful\" he could see the king after his diagnosis, adding that he planned to \"stop in and see my family as much as I can.\"\n\nHowever, a spokesperson for Harry and Meghan said in a statement to Reuters that the Duke of Sussex would not be able to see the king during his latest visit to the UK because of the monarch's schedule.\n\n\"In response to the many inquiries and continued speculation on whether or not the duke will meet with his father while in the UK this week, it unfortunately will not be possible due to His Majesty's full programme,\" the statement said, according to Reuters. \"The duke of course is understanding of his father's diary of commitments and various other priorities and hopes to see him soon.\"\n\nBuckingham Palace and the Sussex team did not respond to a request for comment from BI.\n\nPrince William did not attend the Service of Thanksgiving either, nor did he and Harry see each other during the Duke of Sussex's visit in February.\n\nThe brothers have reportedly had a rift for years, particularly since Harry discussed their relationship in his Netflix series \"Harry & Meghan\" in December 2022 and his memoir \"Spare\" in January 2023.\n\nHarry and Meghan released a statement to the BBC following Kate Middleton's announcement that she was undergoing \"preventative chemotherapy,\" saying, \"We wish health and healing for Kate and the family, and hope they are able to do so privately and in peace.\"\n\nThe duke and duchess have not publicly connected with the Prince and Princess of Wales since Kate's

Charles himself held the role for 31 years.\n\nBut it was Harry, who served multiple tours in Afghanistan, who actually served in the very unit that William will be in charge of, leading many to believe that Harry would have taken on this title had he remained a working senior royal.\n\nIn 2020, Harry and his wife, Meghan Markle, announced their intention to step down as senior members of the royal family. They relocated to California with their son, Archie, now 5, and later welcomed their daughter, Lilibet, almost 3.\n\nNot long after the couple made their decision in 2020, the palace released a statement regarding the couple's new titles. \"The Sussexes will not use their HRH titles as they are no longer working members of the Royal Family,\" read the statement.\n\nPrince Harry was also stripped of his honorary military titles.\n\nIn the 2020 book Finding Freedom: Harry and Meghan and the Making of the Modern Royal Family, royal reporters Omid Scobie and Carolyn Durand wrote that the loss of Harry's honorary military appointments hit him the hardest.\n\n\"That's been a tough pill to swallow, and one that has been the most painful for Meghan to witness him go through,\" a source close to the couple says in the book. \"It's the one that made Harry emotional.\"\n\nThese titles included Captain General of the Royal Marines, Honorary Air Force Commandant of the Royal Air Force Base Honington, and honorary Commodore-in-Chief of the Royal Navy's Small Ships and Diving Operations.\n\nHarry and his brother, William, have remained estranged in recent years following the Sussexes' exit from royal life and subsequent Netflix docuseries, Harry & Meghan, followed closely by Harry's tell-all memoir, Spare.\n\nWilliam has been taking on more than his fair share of royal responsibilities as both his father, Charles, and wife, Kate Middleton, deal with their own private cancer battles.\n\nHarry is currently in the United Kingdom celebrating the 10th anniversary of the Invictus Games, the event he helped found for wounded veterans.\n\nAfter news broke that his father was undergoing cancer treatment, ET confirmed that Charles' younger son had rapidly flown to the U.K. to visit with his father, albeit for a brief period of time -- reportedly just a few hours.\n\nOn Tuesday, a rep for the Duke of Sussex shared with ET that despite their proximity to each other, Prince Harry would not be visiting his father on this trip due to his packed schedule for the Invictus Games.\n\nA spokesperson for Prince Harry told ET, \"In response to the many inquiries and continued speculation on whether or not the duke will meet with his father while in the U.K. this week, it, unfortunately, will not be possible due to His Majesty's full program.\"\n\nThe rep added, \"The duke, of course, is understanding of his father's diary of commitments and various other priorities and hopes to see him soon.\"\n\nIt's another case of \"so close but so far\" with his immediate family in England after Harry and Prince William both attended a memorial event for their mom -- Harry virtually and William in person -- and narrowly avoided each other. The royal rift seems to be worse than ever for the brothers a full year after barely acknowledging each other during their father's coronation.\n\nThe ice may be thawing, however, as ET learned back in March that Meghan, 42, and Harry privately reached out to Prince William, 41, and the Princess of Wales, 42, following her cancer diagnosis.", "source": {"uri": "etonline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Entertainment Tonight"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Harry,_Duke_of_Sussex", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_royal_family", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "British royal family"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_III_of_Spain", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Charles III of Spain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invictus_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Invictus Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princess_Lilibet_of_Sussex", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Princess Lilibet of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William,_Prince_of_Wales", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "William, Prince of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meghan,_Duchess_of_Sussex", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Meghan, Duchess of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Army_Air_Corps_(United_Kingdom)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Army Air Corps (United Kingdom)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonel-in-chief", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Colonel-in-chief"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Afghanistan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Afghanistan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_&_Meghan", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Harry & Meghan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omid_Scobie", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Omid Scobie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore-in-Chief", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Commodore-in-Chief"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAF_Honington", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "RAF Honington"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_general", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Captain general"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Marines", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Royal Marines"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Navy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Royal Navy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Air_Force", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Royal Air Force"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Air_Force", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Air Force"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catherine,_Princess_of_Wales", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Catherine, Princess of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diana,_Princess_of_Wales", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Diana, Princess of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coronation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Genealogy/Royalty", "label": "dmoz/Society/Genealogy/Royalty", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Monarchy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Monarchy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 74}], "image": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2024-02/GettyImages-666488550.jpg?h=92306eb3", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550326", "eventUri": "eng-9550326", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.03529411764705892, "wgt": 186, "relevance": 1}

But the King was said to be too busy to see his son, confirming a statement earlier this week that revealed the pair would not meet because the monarch had a\n\nbusy programme of \u00adofficial duties.\n\nThe Duke, 39, did not meet up with 41-year-old brother Prince William, either. Harry last saw the King in February when he dashed from the US after Charles's cancer diagnosis. He arrived in the UK on Tuesday and is flying to Nigeria today to meet up with wife Meghan, 42, for a tour linked to the Invictus Games for injured and sick military personnel.\n\nKing Charles III and Queen Camilla walk down the steps to meet guests attending the Royal Garden Party\n\nAs Harry prepared to fly in this week, his spokesman said: \"In response to the many inquiries on whether or not the Duke will meet with his father while in the UK, it \u00adunfortunately will not be possible due to His Majesty's full programme. The Duke of course is understanding of his father's diary of commitments and various other priorities and hopes to see him soon.\"\n\nPrince Harry was seen arriving at the service in the sunshine\n\nRoyal commentator Richard Fitzwilliams said: \"It's a very difficult situation at the moment and it's completely unprecedented. I think people thought Harry and the King would have found the time to meet each other. I think what's developing here is something that had not been expected but there is logic to it. I think that this and the appointment of William as Colonel-in-Chief of the Army Air Corps is about timing.\" Mr Fitzwilliams added: \"The only way for the rift to be healed is in private.\"\n\nThe Princess Royal with the Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh\n\nNo other member of the Royal Family joined Harry at his Invictus event. Harry's appearance yesterday was in stark contrast to 2014 when he launched the Games, accompanied by Charles, Camilla and William. His relationship with the family has grown increasingly fractured since he and Meghan quit as working royals in 2020 and moved to California with their children Archie, five, and two-year-old Lilibet.\n\nHarry was joined at the 10th anniversary by his mum Diana's brother Charles Spencer and her sister Lady Jane Fellows. The Duke's cousins George McCorquodale, 39, and Louis and Lara Spencer, 30 and 18, also sat close and supported him. Harry was cheered by hundreds of people outside the cathedral who waited to see him.\n\nThe King was said to be too busy to see his son\n\nAbsent from the medals the former soldier and helicopter pilot wore was one given to him and others involved in the King's formal ascension to the throne last May. The service was led by Dean of St Paul's the Very Reverend Andrew Tremlett, who praised the \"vision and compassion\" that formed the Games. An emotional poem was read by former Invictus Games Team UK \u00ad vice captain Michelle Turner, her daughter Maya and husband John.\n\nMichelle has a heart problem she \u00addeveloped during her 21 years of service with the RAF that makes it randomly beat too fast. She told how when she was discharged she was \"consumed with insecurities\" and ended the poem: \"Thank you Invictus, for giving me my life back.\" Harry led a standing ovation to Michelle and her family. Rishi Sunak's wife Akshata Murty was also there.\n\nNot far away, the King was seen laughing and joking with guests at the garden party, who included Princess Anne, Sophie Duchess of Edinburgh and the Duke and Duchess of Gloucester. Around 8,000 people attended the palace event. The King also had his weekly audience with the Prime Minister yesterday. Charles returned to public duties last week as he continued having treatment for a type of cancer.", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri":

But the King was said to be too busy to see his son, as confirmed in a statement earlier this week that revealed the pair would not meet because the monarch had a busy programme of \u00adofficial duties.\n\nThe Duke, 39, did not meet up with his 41-year-old brother Prince William, either. Harry last saw the King in February when he dashed from the US after Charles' cancer diagnosis.\n\nREAD MORE: Prince Harry's uncle still sees Royal Family as 'the enemy' and thinks Diana's son was 'hard done by'\n\nHis spokesman said earlier this week: \"In response to the many inquiries on whether or not the Duke will meet with his father while in the UK, it \u00adunfortunately will not be possible due to His Majesty's full programme. The Duke of course is understanding of his father's diary of commitments and various other priorities and hopes to see him soon.\"\n\nRoyal commentator Richard Fitzwilliams said: \"It's a very difficult situation at the moment and it's completely unprecedented. I think people thought Harry and the King would have found the time to meet each other.\n\n\"I think what's developing here is something that had not been expected but there is logic to it. I think that this and the appointment of William as Colonel-in-Chief of the Army Air Corps is about timing.\" Mr Fitzwilliams added: \"The only way for the rift to be healed is in private.\"\n\nAt Wednesday's Invictus event at St Paul's, no other member of the Royal Family joined Harry. Harry's appearance was in stark contrast to 2014 when he launched the Games accompanied by Charles, Camilla and William. His relationship with the family has grown increasingly fractured since he and Meghan quit as working royals in 2020 and moved to California with their children Archie, five, and two-year-old Lilibet.\n\nHarry was joined at the 10th anniversary by his mum Diana's brother Charles Spencer and her sister Lady Jane Fellows. The Duke's cousins George McCorquodale, 39, and Louis and Lara Spencer, 30 and 18, also sat close and supported him. Harry was cheered by hundreds of people outside the cathedral who waited to see him.\n\nCrowds had gathered around crash barriers to see the Duke's car pull up, and there was a large number of journalists, photographers, and cameramen covering his every move. Harry acknowledged them with a wave as he strode up St Paul's steps and was warmly greeted by the Dean of St Paul's, the Very Reverend Andrew Tremlett.\n\nWhen the Duke left he went on a brief walkabout, shaking hands with some of the well-wishers who had waited to catch a glimpse of him.\n\nJoin the Irish Mirror's breaking news service on WhatsApp. Click this link to receive breaking news and the latest headlines direct to your phone.

"title": "'Game plan for royal redemption': Harry and Meghan's calculated royal comeback following 'snub' from monarch", "body": "Prince Harry and Meghan Markle have a premeditated \"game plan for Royal redemption\" hinging on a strategy to navigate a scathing \"setback\" after the Duke of Sussex was twice snubbed by his father King Charles in London this week.\n\nThe Duke of Sussex landed in the UK on Monday to celebrate ten years of the Invictus Games ceremony amid rumours of a possible royal rendezvous with his father the monarch.\n\nHarry helped set up Invictus in 2014 as an Olympics-style international sporting event for injured and wounded service men and women across the globe.\n\nHowever, there was no family rekindling with King's packed schedule blamed for the missed father and son reunion at the star-studded event in St Paul's cathedral on Wednesday.\n\nIn a double blow for Harry, Buckingham Palace confirmed on Wednesday King Charles will attend a special ceremony next Monday to confirm Prince William as Colonel-in-Chief of Harry's former regiment the Army Air Corps.\n\nThe event will take place in front of an Apache, the same type of helicopter Harry operated when serving in Afghanistan.\n\nWilliam, who flew with the Air Ambulance during his active service as an RAF search-and-rescue pilot, will also take to the skies in the chopper.\n\nRoyal expert Richard Fitzwilliams said Charles' absence at his youngest son's events was certainty a \"snub\" but the Sussexes had a strategy to navigate the expected \"setback\".\n\nMeghan and Harry are currently on their way to Nigeria for an unofficial royal tour at the invitation of the country's defence ministry.\n\nThe couple plans to engage with Service members and immerse themselves in local cultural events in the African country on the Gulf of Guinea.\n\n\"Meghan has wisely decided that a hostile press and public would prefer her to stay away from the Service at St Paul's to commemorate a decade of Invictus,\" Mr Fitzwilliams told the UK's mirror on Thursday.\n\n\"Their visit to Nigeria is a cover for what is a setback,\" he said.\n\nAnd Mr Fitzwilliams believed there was pathway to redemption for Harry and Meghan.\n\n\"If they were to mention the Commonwealth... in a favourable light in a speech, this would be positive,\" he said.\n\nIt comes after Harry and Meghan \"trashed\" the institution in their Netflix documentary, and it was \"not received well\".\n\nThey have also lobbed multiple grenades at the royal family during an exclusive tell-all interview with Oprah Winfrey in 2021.\n\nWhen Harry arrived at the cathedral on Wednesday, the Prince was met by his aunt and uncle on Diana's side.\n\nCharles Spencer and Lady Jane Fellowes embraced Harry inside the anniversary event.\n\nHarry was not joined by any senior members of the Royal Family for the service as King Charles held a garden party nearby.\n\nThe King was accompanied by Camilla, Prince Edward, Sophie Wessex and Princess Anne for the event at Buckingham Palace.\n\nSpeculation about the state of Prince Harry's father-son relationship has escalated since it was revealed the King was too busy to meet with his son.\n\nDespite a comeback \"plan\", Mr Fitzwilliams said Harry was still reeling from the sting of being snubbed by his father.\n\n\"There is little doubt that this was not arranged as it should have been as King Charles has always made it clear that his door is open to Harry,\" he said.\n\nHarry and Charles last saw each other in February when the Duke of Sussex hastily flew to his home country merely hours after his father announced he was diagnosed with cancer.\n\nAlthough there is little known about the brief encounter or how successful it was, the commentator said.\n\n\"If the royal rift is ever to be healed it will be when matters are less public and can be considered privately and less stressfully,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "skynews.com.au", "dataType": "news",

From what we can see, Harry wants to do the right thing. He's displaying signals that tell us he wants to make people proud.\n\n\"It's also suggesting he's feeling confident being back in the UK for the Invictus Games. He isn't displaying signs of nervousness or unease. He's feeling comfortable and strong being back on his home soil.\"\n\nHarry was all smiles as he was greeted by a crowd of well-wishers outside St Paul's Cathedral in London following a service to mark the 10th anniversary of the Invictus Games yesterday, Wednesday 8 May.\n\nThe Prince was spotted in high spirits on a walkabout after the service, beaming and shaking hands with fans who chanted 'we love you'.\n\nDarren continued to say: \"When we see Harry interacting with the public, it's telling us he's in a place of comfort, resilience and strength. He isn't fazed by anything else going on. He was present in the moment and focused all his attention on them. This demonstrates he is in a great place with himself.\n\n\"He is seen shaking hands, smiling and engaging in conversation just as he would with someone he's good friends with. This shows how approachable Harry is as he has embraced this visit in high spirits and with open arms.\"\n\nAfter interacting with royal fans, Harry was escorted to his car to depart from the event, which was not attended by any other members of the Royal Family. King Charles was instead accompanied by a large group of royals showing unity at the Buckingham Palace garden party - held just two miles away from St Paul's.\n\nHowever, Harry's uncle Earl Charles Spencer and aunt Lady Jane Fellowes, both siblings of the late Princess Diana, were present at the service. Also in attendance were Harry's cousin Louis Spencer, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's wife Akshata Murty, his lawyer David Sherbourne, and former Army officer Mark Dyer, who has been like a \"second dad\" to Harry.\n\nSoon after Harry touched down in the UK, it was confirmed that King Charles and his son would not be meeting due to the King's \"full programme\".\n\nA spokesperson for Harry said: \"In response to the many inquiries and continued speculation on whether or not the Duke will meet with his father while in the UK this week, it unfortunately will not be possible due to His Majesty's full programme.\n\n\"The Duke of course is understanding of his father's diary of commitments and various other priorities and hopes to see him soon.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Prince William carried out an investiture ceremony at Windsor Castle on Wednesday before travelling to Cornwall today for more royal engagements - with the Prince Of Wales also not meeting with his brother during his trip.", "source": {"uri": "ok.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "ok"}, "authors": [{"uri": "catriona_rigney@ok.co.uk", "name": "Catriona Rigney", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Harry,_Duke_of_Sussex", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invictus_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Invictus Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Paul's_Cathedral", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "St Paul's Cathedral"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Spencer,_9th_Earl_Spencer", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Charles Spencer, 9th Earl Spencer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_I_of_England", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Charles I of England"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_(musician)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prince (musician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akshata_Murty", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Akshata Murty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jane_Fellowes,_Lady_Fellowes", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jane Fellowes, Lady Fellowes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William,_Prince_of_Wales", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "William, Prince of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_royal_family", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "British royal family"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rishi_Sunak", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rishi Sunak"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windsor_Castle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Windsor Castle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investiture", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Investiture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "British Army"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diana,_Princess_of_Wales", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Diana, Princess of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckingham_Palace", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Buckingham Palace"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornwall", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cornwall"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cornwall"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wales", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wales"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wales"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/General_Merchandise/O", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/General Merchandise/O", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 76}], "image": "https://i2-prod.ok.co.uk/incoming/article32771711.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_SOCIAL-TEMPLATE.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550326", "eventUri": "eng-9550326", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-08", "textStart": 1081, "textEnd": 1086}], "sentiment": 0.3254901960784313, "wgt": 184, "relevance": 1}

As the Duke of Sussex returned to the UK this week for celebrations surrounding the 10th anniversary of the Invictus Games, the trip could serve as an \"olive branch\" amid the years-long rift in their relationship, according to one insider, who said the royal brothers may be open to meeting.\n\nHarry and William's relationship has grabbed headlines in recent years following Harry and his wife Meghan Markle's decision to retire as working royal in 2020. The friction between the pair worsened following Harry and Meghan's tell-all interview with Oprah Winfrey and Harry's 2023 memoir, Spare, in which he claimed he got a physical fight with William over Meghan. But it seems the two brothers are ready to put the years-long rift behind them, an insider telling Us Weekly that while the Harry and William \"haven't had a real conversation in months,\" they are open to reuniting.\n\n\"The brothers haven't spoken [but] there is potential for that. [Harry] would be more than happy [to],\" another source said, even claiming that prior to his trip home, Harry contacted his family and invited them to the Invictus Games. The first source added that both Harry and William \"are open\" to seeing each other, and that William and his wife, Kate Middleton, are \"ready to call a truce.\" Kate, who is currently undergoing treatment for cancer, is \"done with all the bad blood,\" and she and her husband \"want a relationship with Meghan and Harry, and they don't want the acrimony to carry over to the next generation... they want to mend fences with them for the kids' sake.\"\n\nA reunion for the two brothers has not been confirmed, with Us Weekly's source stating that such plans were \"up in the air.\" Harry traveled to the UK this week for the Invictus Games ceremony. The 10th anniversary of the games was marked with a panel on Tuesday and a service at St. Paul's Cathedral on Wednesday, PEOPLE reported. It is unclear how long Harry will remain in his home country before returning to California, where he resides with his wife Meghan Markle and their two children, 5-year-old son Prince Archie and 2-year-old daughter Princess Lilibet.\n\nWhile it's possible that Harry and William, and possibly Kate, will meet with one another during Harry's brief trip, there is one person Harry will not be reuniting with: his father, King Charles III. A spokesperson for the Duke and Duchess of Sussex confirmed in a May 7 statement, \"in response to the many inquiries and continued speculation on whether or not The Duke will meet with his father while in the U.K. this week, it unfortunately will not be possible due to His Majesty's full program.\" The spokesperson added that Harry \"is understanding of his father's diary of commitments and various other priorities and hopes to see him soon.\"\n\n0comments", "source": {"uri": "popculture.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Celebrity"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William,_Prince_of_Wales", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "William, Prince of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Harry,_Duke_of_Sussex", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invictus_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Invictus Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meghan,_Duchess_of_Sussex", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Meghan, Duchess of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wales", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wales"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wales"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catherine,_Princess_of_Wales", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Catherine, Princess of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oprah_Winfrey", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oprah Winfrey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Us_Weekly", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Us Weekly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Archie_of_Sussex", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prince Archie of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princess_Lilibet_of_Sussex", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Princess Lilibet of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duke_of_Sussex", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Duke of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_III_of_Spain", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Charles III of Spain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Paul's_Cathedral", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "St Paul's Cathedral"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/General_Merchandise/O", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/General Merchandise/O", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/2023/12/01/4b5f6a3a-cc72-4d95-b81e-d33d0ec2561f/prince-harry-prince-william.jpg?width=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550326", "eventUri": "eng-9550326", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-07", "textStart": 2614, "textEnd": 2619}], "sentiment": 0.1058823529411765, "wgt": 183, "relevance": 1}

Last night, however, Palace sources suggested no formal requests for a meeting had been made.\n\nKing Charles, who was invited to attend the service in central London, held the first garden party of the season at Buckingham Palace.\n\nThe monarch was joined by Queen Camilla, the Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh, the Princess Royal and the Duke and Duchess of Gloucester for the first of the summer festivities.\n\nThe only senior royals missing were the Prince and Princess of Wales.

even before Prince William.\n\nThroughout his bombshell memoir Spare, he gave a 'stand out thanks' to Lady Jane, her elder sister Lady Sarah McCorquodale and Earl Spencer but failed to mention the late Queen, King Charles or his brother.\n\nIt is therefore little surprise that two of the siblings turned out at yesterday's ceremony to give support to Diana's youngest child.\n\nAs well as his aunt and uncle, Harry was surrounded by a number of dignitaries, politicians and close friends.\n\nHis lawyer David Sherbourne was in attendance while former army officer Mark Dyer -

Arriving from California Tuesday, Harry had some meetings, then arrived at St Paul's Cathedral Wednesday for the Invictus Games anniversary.\n\nMeanwhile on Wednesday, Charles hosted a garden party at Buckingham Palace, then was scheduled to have an audience with Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and a Privy Council meeting. He's also had hospital appointments for his ongoing treatment for cancer.\n\nIn a statement, Harry's spokesperson said that a meeting between the two was \"unfortunately ... not possible due to His Majesty's full program,\" The Telegraph reported. The spokesman also said that Harry is \"understanding of his father's diary of commitments and various other priorities and hopes to see him soon.\"\n\nWhether Harry really is \"understanding\" may never be known -- until anonymous \"insider\" sources from either his camp or from Buckingham Palace leak behind-the-scenes observations to the media. But royal watchers definitely opined Wednesday that Harry was \"snubbed\" and that his father was sending him an \"ominous\" message.\n\nCharles' unwillingness to schedule even 15 minutes to see his estranged son this week, after Harry traveled all the way from California, is an indication that \"the palace gates remain firmly closed,\" said journalist and author Richard Kay. The relationship between Harry and with his father and the rest of the royal family appears to be \"more broken than ever,\" Kay also said.\n\nRoyal expert Michael Cole agreed, telling the Daily Mail: \"It is quite a snub. For the king to not see his younger son, although the two men will be only two miles apart (Wednesday), gives an indication of the depth of the divide.\"\n\n\"The prodigal son is not welcome -- not for the present, anyway,\" Cole continued. \"In royal terms, this is big medicine. Prince Harry is bound to see it for what it is, the clearest possible indication of the hurt that has been caused.\"\n\nPiers Morgan, a fierce critic of Harry and his wife, Meghan Markle, was even more blunt about \"the snub,\" writing in The Sun: \"Let's be honest: if Charles had really wanted to see him, he'd have made the time. That's the whole point of being a king, you get to do what the hell you like.\"\n\nBut Morgan said it's clear from the statements about \"scheduling\" issues that \"Charles would rather impale himself on a rusty sword than meet up with someone who has wrought such vengeful misery on the royal family for so many years now.\"\n\nThe New York Post also reported that \"negotiations\" for a meeting between Harry and his father this week broke down over certain unnamed \"demands\" by the duke, possibly over who could be in the room with them. \"Although on the surface it looks like a snub, Harry made it very difficult for his father,\" royal commentator Charlotte Griffiths said on GB News.\n\nBut before Harry traveled to London from his home in Montecito, he had made no secret of his desire to see his father again, as the king undergoes treatment for an undisclosed form cancer, The Telegraph reported. In February, Harry told ABC News how he jumped on a plane, \"as soon as I could,\" to fly to London to see his father, after his father publicly disclosed that he had cancer.\n\n\"Look, I love my family,\" Harry insisted. \"The fact that I was able to get on a plane and go and see him and spend any time with him, I'm grateful for that.\"\n\nBefore this week, royal observers thought that Harry might use his time in London to spend some time with Charles, marking another step towards a reconciliation.\n\nHarry has been on the outs from his family ever since he and Meghan, his American wife, stepped away from royal duties in 2020 and moved to her home state of California. The estrangement grew as Harry and Meghan, via interviews, a Netflix series and Harry's memoir \"Spare,\" publicly criticized the monarchy and alleged that certain family members were cruel, guilty of racism -- or of \"unconscious bias\" as Harry preferred to put it. Harry also accused family members, particularly his father's wife, Queen Camilla, of leaking negative news about them to favorite tabloid journalists.\n\nBut Harry has since tried to convey the message that he hopes to heal the rift with his family and move past their differences -- especially after learning that both his father and Kate Middleton, the wife of his brother, Prince William, have been diagnosed with cancer.\n\nIn his interview with ABC News, Harry spoke about how an illness like cancer can bring families together. He also vowed to visit his father in the near future. \"I've got other trips planned that would take me through the UK or back to the UK, so I'll stop in and see my family as much as I can,\" he said.\n\nStill, as much as Harry tried to portray his \"dash\" to London in February as a positive step towards reconciliation, The Telegraph noted that his trip still faced challenges. Harry's sudden arrival in London reportedly forced Charles to change his plans at the last minute, and Harry wasn't invited to travel to his country estate with his father as he had hoped.\n\nWriting in the Daily Mail, Kay suggested that Charles' cancer diagnosis may have had the opposite effect on his relationship with his son. \"The illness has, if anything, added to their estrangement,\" Kay said.\n\nThe snub narrative has been amplified this week by the announcement that Charles would officially hand over a key ceremonial role in the British military to William, the Prince of Wales and his direct heir. The king will name William as colonel-in-chief of the Army Air Corps.\n\nThe Telegraph reported that Charles probably would have handed the colonelcy to Harry, an Army veteran who had flown Apache helicopters in Afghanistan. But the late Queen Elizabeth II removed Harry's military titles when he stepped away from royal duties.\n\nAt this point, the king may find that encounters with Harry have become more of \"a burden than a a pleasure,\" especially as he battles cancer, Kay wrote. Two people important to him also may have a problem with welcoming Harry back into the royal fold. These two people are Camilla, who has been the subject of Harry's \"lacerating attacks,\" and William, Kay added. Harry has portrayed William as having anger management issues, while William may never forgive his brother for hurtful comments he made in \"Spare\" about Kate.\n\n\"The opposition of Camilla and William would be formidable to Charles,\" Kay quoted a courtier as saying. \"For all his affection for Harry -- which remains -- and sadness at the deep rift that has developed, his ties with his wife and older son are far deeper.\"", "source": {"uri": "mercurynews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "San Jose Mercury News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "martha_ross@mercurynews.com", "name": "Martha Ross",

After the event, Harry met with fans outside as they shouted: \"We love you Harry\".\n\nHundreds of people had lined the street to try and catch a glimpse of the Prince. Harry was seen chatting with fans before being escorted to his car and lip reader Jeremy Freeman has now revealed what Harry said as he walked away from the crowd.\n\nFor all the latest on news, politics, sports, and showbiz from the USA, go to The Mirror US.\n\nREAD MORE: Prince Harry felt a sense of 'wariness and anxiety' as he met with crowds after Royal Family snub\n\nHundreds of people waited for a glimpse of Prince Harry\n\nTurning to his car, Jeremy revealed Harry said: \"Ok thank you, bye bye, thank you guys.\" Elsewhere on the walkabout, Harry said: \"Hi...hi...hi there...nice to meet you...great to see you...\"\n\nWhen someone tried to engage in a conversation with Harry, he replied: \"Pardon...oh really.\" Then, trying to shake hands with a fan, Harry said: \"Hey...hey... Here we go,\" having finally managed to reach.\n\nHarry's warm reception at his walkabout comes after the Royal Family decided not to turn up to the Invictus Games event at St Paul's. Instead, King Charles was joined by a huge contingent of royals in a show of unity at this afternoon's Buckingham Palace garden party. The party took place just two miles away from St Paul's.\n\nThe Duke of Sussex waved to crowds\n\nMeghan Markle was also absent from the event as she decided not to join her husband for his return trip to the UK. However, Harry wasn't alone at the service.\n\nFamily members who did join were his uncle Earl Charles Spencer and his aunt Lady Jane Fellowes, both siblings of the late Princess Diana. Harry's cousin Louis Spencer, the Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's wife Akshata Murty and his lawyer David Sherbourne also attended. Former Army officer Mark Dyer, who has acted as a \"second dad\" to Harry, was at the service as well.\n\n* Follow Mirror Celebs on TikTok, Snapchat, Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, YouTube and Threads.", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri": "scarlett_o_toole@mirror.co.uk", "name": "Scarlett O'Toole", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Harry,_Duke_of_Sussex", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Paul's_Cathedral", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "St Paul's Cathedral"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_royal_family", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "British royal family"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invictus_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Invictus Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_(musician)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prince (musician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Mirror", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Daily Mirror"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akshata_Murty", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Akshata Murty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "TikTok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meghan,_Duchess_of_Sussex", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Meghan, Duchess of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rishi_Sunak", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rishi Sunak"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Spencer,_9th_Earl_Spencer", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Charles Spencer, 9th Earl Spencer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_I_of_England", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Charles I of England"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "British Army"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diana,_Princess_of_Wales", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Diana, Princess of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckingham_Palace", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Buckingham Palace"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snapchat", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Snapchat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/General_Merchandise/O", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/General Merchandise/O", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article32767770.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_harryfansexcl.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550326", "eventUri": "eng-9550326", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 181, "relevance": 1}

The late Princess of Wales' younger brother, Earl Spencer, and elder sister, Lady Jane Fellowes, walked in side-by-side before embracing the duke.\n\nHarry founded the Invictus Games in 2014, giving wounded, injured and sick service people a chance to showcase their sporting talents. His event last night marked the progress of the games over the past decade and saw the actor Damian Lewis deliver an impassioned recitation of William Earnest Henley's poem, from which the games takes its name.\n\nMeanwhile, his father, the King, held a garden party in Buckingham Palace celebrating people who have made notable contributions in their local communities.\n\nCharles was joined at this event by Queen Camilla, the Princess Royal and various other members of the Windsor family.\n\nThe Invictus Games ceremony began at 5pm yesterday and the King's garden party reportedly wrapped up at 6pm.\n\nMeghan and Harry's children, Prince Archie and Princess Lilibet, were not present at the ceremony, but the Duchess of Sussex is set to join Harry in the coming days for further Invictus events in Nigeria.\n\nHopes of reconciliation were dealt a blow early into Harry's return to the UK on Monday (7 May) when a spokesperson confirmed he would not be seeing his father due to the King's busy schedule.\n\nA spokesperson for the Duke said: \"In response to the many inquiries and continued speculation on whether or not the duke will meet with his father while in the UK this week, it unfortunately will not be possible due to His Majesty's full programme.\n\n\"The duke of course is understanding of his father's diary of commitments and various other priorities and hopes to see him soon.\"\n\nPrior to arriving back in the UK, Harry, who returned to England after learning of his father's cancer diagnosis in February, said he was \"very keen\" to see the King.\n\nThe monarch returned to work last week after medics concluded that he had made sufficient progress in his cancer treatment.\n\nHe did so with a visit to a cancer treatment centre, designed to highlight the impact the disease can have on patients and their families, as well as the importance of early detection.\n\nThe King's failure to meet Harry was one of two apparent snubs on his current visit to the UK.\n\nThe duke also had to face the news that his brother and heir to the throne, Prince William, is being made colonel-in-chief of his old military regiment next week.", "source": {"uri":

William was handing out awards in Windsor, while Kate is still undergoing treatment for cancer.\n\nPrince Harry's spokesperson had claimed on Tuesday the King had been too busy to see his youngest son during his fleeting visit to the UK.\n\nLast night, however, Palace sources suggested no formal requests for a meeting had been made.\n\nPrincess Diana 's siblings were quick to show their support for Prince Harry yesterday during the Invictus Games anniversary service yesterday.

He then attended his weekly audience with the Prime Minister in the evening followed by a Privy Council meeting.\n\nThe Duke of Sussex has flown into London for the Invictus engagements and there were hopes that he would see the King.

Actor Damian Lewis, 53, meanwhile read out the Invictus poem with the service being conducted by William Ernest Henley.\n\nAn emotional reading was also given by Michelle Turner who is the UK Invictus Games Team vice-captain. She read a personal poem about how the games had helped her recovery and impacted her family.\n\nOther stars among the crowd included former Olympic champion triple jumper Jonathan Edwards\n\nMembers of the public wait to see Britain's Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex arrive to attend the ceremony\n\nAt the end of the reading she tearfully said: 'Thank you Invictus, for giving me my life back.'\n\nAs he left the cathedral on a balmy evening in the capital, the Californian-based royal greeted large crowds.\n\nHe was heard asking two fans from New York what had brought them to the UK. When they responded they were here for a wedding, the Prince jokingly asked it was 'in there?' referring to St Paul's Cathedral.\n\nThe Duke joked around with one enthusiastic royal fan who had her arms outstretched with two phones to try and get the best shot of Harry.\n\n'Why have you got 2 phones?' he laughed, 'it doesn't make sense!'\n\nHundreds of people had joined the crowd that was tightly guarded by police officers.\n\nShouts of 'we love you Harry' could be heard as the Prince did his walkabout, while others screamed with excitement until Harry got into a Land Rover and drove

flying to Nigeria where he will meet up with Meghan for a quasi-royal tour that is also expected to highlight the Invictus Games.\n\nHarry spent Tuesday in the capital attending a summit that reflected on the 10th anniversary of the Invictus Games, which stages sporting events for wounded, sick or injured veterans or serving military to aid their recovery.\n\nHe told delegates at the event, held at the Honourable Artillery Company's headquarters on the edge of the City of London: 'Sometimes you... look back and go 'Look at what we've done'.\n\n'But also given the state of the

further official engagements - and the King will meet staff and families of the 3 Royal School of Military Engineering in Surrey.\n\nThen on Monday there will be a rare joint visit for Charles and

father in person for 17 months, and they had a half-hour meeting before Charles left London to recuperate at Sandringham following treatment.\n\nBut this time, a spokesman for Harry said: 'In response

being planned for the 75-year-old monarch in the coming months after his doctors gave him the all-clear to undertake more public work once again while continuing his cancer treatment.\n\nOn Monday,

But a spokesman for Harry said yesterday that the monarch's 'full programme' meant the get-together would not happen.\n\nDuring the service at St Paul's today, Harry will give a reading and actor Damian Lewis will recite the Invictus poem.\n\nHarry is also not expected to see his estranged brother Prince William who held an investiture ceremony at Windsor Castle this morning. William continues to balance work with looking after his three children while his wife Kate undergoes preventative chemotherapy for cancer and recovers from serious abdominal surgery in

Straubenzee family shows, you never know when you might lose a child... or anyone you love, writes ANGELA MOLLARD\n\nTomorrow, William will fly to Cornwall for further official engagements - and the King will meet staff and families of the 3 Royal School of Military Engineering in Surrey.\n\nThen on Monday there will be a rare joint visit for Charles and William, as the King officially hands over the role of Colonel-in-Chief of the Army Air Corps to William at the Army Aviation Centre in Middle Wallop, where Harry previously learnt to fly.\n\nHarry has travelled to the UK to commemorate the Invictus Games milestone with those who have been involved with the paralympic-style tournament and mark the decade-long support competitors have received.\n\nCharles and Harry last met soon after the King announced his cancer diagnosis in February and his son rushed from America to see his father.\n\nThat was the first time Harry had seen his father in person for 17 months, and they had a half-hour meeting before Charles left London to recuperate at Sandringham following treatment.\n\nBut this time, a spokesman for Harry said: 'In response to the many inquiries and continued speculation on whether or not the duke will meet with his father while in the UK this week, it unfortunately will not be possible due to His Majesty's full programme.\n\n'The duke of course is understanding of his father's diary of commitments and various other priorities and hopes to see him soon.'\n\nJust hours after Harry's statement, palace officials announced a new joint engagement for Charles and William.\n\nIt is one of dozens of official engagements being planned for the 75-year-old monarch in the coming months after his doctors gave him the all-clear to undertake more public work once again while continuing his cancer treatment.\n\nYesterday, Charles met the prime minister of the Republic of Fiji at Buckingham Palace, before retiring to Clarence House - three miles away from Harry's event.\n\nHarry now lives with his wife Meghan Markle and children Archie, who turned five on Monday, and Lilibet in a \u00a312million mansion in Montecito, California.", "source":

He's also had hospital appointments for his ongoing treatment for cancer.\n\nIn a statement, Harry's spokesperson said that a meeting between the two was \"unfortunately ... not possible due to His Majesty's full program,\" The Telegraph reported. The spokesman also said that Harry is \"understanding of his father's diary of commitments and various other priorities and hopes to see him soon.\"\n\nWhether Harry really is \"understanding\" may never be known -- until anonymous \"insider\" sources from either his camp or from Buckingham Palace leak behind-the-scenes observations to the media. But royal watchers definitely opined Wednesday that Harry was \"snubbed\" and that his father was sending him an \"ominous\" message.\n\nCharles' unwillingness to schedule even 15 minutes to see his estranged son this week, after Harry traveled all the way from California, is an indication that \"the palace gates remain firmly closed,\" said journalist and author Richard Kay. The relationship between Harry and with his father and the rest of the royal family appears to be \"more broken than ever,\" Kay also said.\n\nRoyal expert Michael Cole agreed, telling the Daily Mail: \"It is quite a snub. For the king to not see his younger son, although the two men will be only two miles apart (Wednesday), gives an indication of the depth of the divide.\"\n\n\"The prodigal son is not welcome -- not for the present, anyway,\" Cole continued. \"In royal terms, this is big medicine. Prince Harry is bound to see it for what it is, the clearest possible indication of the hurt that has been caused.\"\n\nPiers Morgan, a fierce critic of Harry and his wife, Meghan Markle, was even more blunt about \"the snub,\" writing in The Sun: \"Let's be honest: if Charles had really wanted to see him, he'd have made the time. That's the whole point of being a king, you get to do what the hell you like.\"\n\nBut Morgan said it's clear from the statements about \"scheduling\" issues that \"Charles would rather impale himself on a rusty sword than meet up with someone who has wrought such vengeful misery on the royal family for so many years now.\"\n\nThe New York Post also reported that \"negotiations\" for a meeting between Harry and his father this week broke down over certain unnamed \"demands\" by the duke, possibly over who could be in the room with them. \"Although on the surface it looks like a snub, Harry made it very difficult for his father,\" royal commentator Charlotte Griffiths said on GB News.\n\nBut before Harry traveled to London from his home in Montecito, he had made no secret of his desire to see his father again, as the king undergoes treatment for an undisclosed form cancer, The Telegraph reported. In February, Harry told ABC News how he jumped on a plane, \"as soon as I could,\" to fly to London to see his father, after his father publicly disclosed that he had cancer.\n\n\"Look, I love my family,\" Harry insisted. \"The fact that I was able to get on a plane and go and see him and spend any time with him, I'm grateful for that.\"\n\nBefore this week, royal observers thought that Harry might use his time in London to spend some time with Charles, marking another step towards a reconciliation.\n\nHarry has been on the outs from his family ever since he and Meghan, his American wife, stepped away from royal duties in 2020 and moved to her home state of California. The estrangement grew as Harry and Meghan, via interviews, a Netflix series and Harry's memoir \"Spare,\" publicly criticized the monarchy and alleged that certain family members were cruel, guilty of racism -- or of \"unconscious bias\" as Harry preferred to put it. Harry also accused family members, particularly his father's wife, Queen Camilla, of leaking negative news about them to favorite tabloid journalists.\n\nBut Harry has since tried to convey the message that he hopes to heal the rift with his family and move past their differences -- especially after learning that both his father and Kate Middleton, the wife of his brother, Prince William, have been diagnosed with cancer.\n\nIn his interview with ABC News, Harry spoke about how an illness like cancer can bring families together. He also vowed to visit his father in the near future. \"I've got other trips planned that would take me through the UK or back to the UK, so I'll stop in and see my family as much as I can,\" he said.\n\nStill, as much as Harry tried to portray his \"dash\" to London in February as a positive step towards reconciliation, The Telegraph noted that his trip still faced challenges. Harry's sudden arrival in London reportedly forced Charles to change his plans at the last minute, and Harry wasn't invited to travel to his country estate with his father as he had hoped.\n\nWriting in the Daily Mail, Kay suggested that Charles' cancer diagnosis may have had the opposite effect on his relationship with his son. \"The illness has, if anything, added to their estrangement,\" Kay said.\n\nThe snub narrative has been amplified this week by the announcement that Charles would officially hand over a key ceremonial role in the British military to William, the Prince of Wales and his direct heir. The king will name William as colonel-in-chief of the Army Air Corps.\n\nThe Telegraph reported that Charles probably would have handed the colonelcy to Harry, an Army veteran who had flown Apache helicopters in Afghanistan. But the late Queen Elizabeth II removed Harry's military titles when he stepped away from royal duties.\n\nAt this point, the king may find that encounters with Harry have become more of \"a burden than a a pleasure,\" especially as he battles cancer, Kay wrote. Two people important to him also may have a problem with welcoming Harry back into the royal fold. These two people are Camilla, who has been the subject of Harry's \"lacerating attacks,\" and William, Kay added. Harry has portrayed William as having anger management issues, while William may never forgive his brother for hurtful comments he made in \"Spare\" about Kate.\n\n\"The opposition of Camilla and William would be formidable to Charles,\" Kay quoted a courtier as saying. \"For all his affection for Harry -- which remains -- and sadness at the deep rift that has developed, his ties with his wife and older son are far deeper.\"", "source": {"uri": "sentinelandenterprise.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sentinel and Enterprise"}, "authors": [{"uri": "martha_ross@sentinelandenterprise.com",

Without his wife Meghan by his side and with no members of the royal family understood to be attending, the Duke will no doubt reflect on how much things have changed in recent years.\n\nAnd according to one royal expert, Harry's isolation from the monarchy has been further 'compounded' by the fact that his father King Charles does not have time to see his youngest son during his time in London. Other commitments come first for the monarch, leaving Harry at the 'bottom of the list'.\n\nIt was also confirmed on Tuesday that Charles has given Prince William the role of Colonel-in-Chief of the Army Air Corps - Harry's old regiment.\n\nAccording to royal historian and expert Tessa Dunlop, Harry will be keenly aware of his position as he steps inside St Paul's - also the site of Charles and Diana's ill-fated wedding.\n\n\"Today, every step of the way, he will shadow box his former life, trapped in the web of monarchy that is apparently impossible to escape, only now he is outside the institution, looking in,\" Tessa told The Mirror.\n\nShe continued: \"The King doesn't have time to fit the Duke of Sussex into his schedule. Oof. What a gut punch for Prince Harry. Charles - still receiving treatment for cancer and having recently returned to limited public duties - has numerous legitimate excuses that exempt him from a rendezvous.\n\n\"Meanwhile Harry's spokesperson insisted the Duke 'is of course understanding of his father's diary of commitments and various other priorities.' But for the Prince the rebuff will feel all too familiar. Lest we forget, Harry grew up in boarding school with warring parents and a father who all too often had 'other priorities'.\n\n\"Before the King's cancer diagnosis the Duke of Sussex admitted in Spare that Charles wasn't cut out to be a single parent - distracted as he was with royal duties and other relationships...\n\n\"Compounding the Duke's displacement came news yesterday that Prince William has been handed the role of colonel-in-chief of the Army Air Corps when it was Harry who flew with them in Afghanistan. Ouch. Many will say the Prince brought all this on himself. Why should the frail King prioritise his youngest son? Certainly the Sussexes' tell-all publications and broadcasts went well outside acceptable royal and familial lines. But if not redemption now, then when?\"\n\nThe last time Harry met with his father in person was in February when the Prince briefly returned to London following the King's cancer diagnosis,\n\n\"It was a glimmer of hope for a more amicable future and many presumed a further meeting would be forthcoming in the wake of today's Invictus Games anniversary celebration,\" according to Tessa.\n\n\"Instead the Duke will give a reading in St Paul's Cathedral, the epic venue of his parents' fated wedding, with no significant members of the royal family by his side. It is painfully ironic that Harry is back in London, working for a good cause, in a venue intrinsically associated with the British royal family.\n\n\"Meanwhile the Prince's father will be down the road, blocked by ill health, and what a Sussex spokesperson described as a 'full programme'.\n\n\"Here's hoping the King manages to find time to at least watch his son on television. There he will see that beyond all the mistakes and pain, Harry, in his capacity as Invictus founder and inspiration, continues to change lives for the better.

Also there were his cousins Louis and Lara Spencer, as well as George McCorquodale.\n\nHarry waves as he arrives at St Paul's Princess Diana's siblings Charles Spencer and Lady Jane Fellowes\n\nThe show of unity from the Spencers came after it was revealed Harry would not be meeting up with his father King Charles during his trip to the UK. A spokesperson for the duke said: \"In response to the many inquiries and continued speculation on whether or not the duke will meet with his father while in the UK this week, it unfortunately will not be possible due to His Majesty's full programme.\n\n\"The duke of course is understanding of his father's diary of commitments and various other priorities and hopes to see him soon.\"\n\nAnd according to royal expert and biographer Ingrid Seward, it shows how the Spencers have \"laid claim\" to Harry once again. She told The Sun: \"They are very supportive of Harry and always have been. It sends a clear signal to the Royal Family and to Harry that Diana's family are there for him.\n\nWilliam and Harry with Diana's siblings in 2021\n\n\"At his address at Diana's funeral, Charles Spencer said he would look out for William and Harry in her place. He said 'we your blood family will do all we can to continue the imaginative way in which you were steering these two exceptional young men so that their souls are not simply immersed by duty and tradition but can sing openly as you had planned'.\n\n\"Charles Spencer wanted the Spencer family to be prominent above all others, but the boys were sucked up by the Royal Family. Now that Harry has left the Royal Family, the Spencers have laid claim to him again.\"\n\nThe service at St Paul's came as just two miles away at Buckingham Palace, Charles was holding a garden party for 8,000 guests. The Duke, 39, did not meet up with his 41-year-old brother Prince William, either. Harry last saw the King in February when he dashed from the US after Charles's cancer diagnosis. He arrived in the UK on Tuesday and is flying to Nigeria today to meet up with wife Meghan, 42, for a tour linked to the Invictus Games for injured and sick military personnel.\n\nHarry was inspired to found the global tournament after attending the Warrior Games in Colorado in 2013 and seeing how injured American military personnel thrived on the challenge of taking part in competitive sports that aided their recovery.\n\nHe went on to stage the inaugural games in London's Olympic Park in 2014 and the tournament has been held across the globe from Orlando and Sydney to Dusseldorf in 2023, with the 2025 event being hosted in Vancouver and Whistler.", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jennifer_newton@mirror.co.uk", "name":

Shortly after touching down in London, it was revealed that King Charles was too busy to meet with his son, despite weeks of speculation that they could be meeting.\n\nAnd then, just mere hours after it was confirmed that King Charles would not be meeting with Prince Harry, Buckingham Palace announced that the King would hand the Prince of Wales a military honour long thought to be destined for the Duke of Sussex. Prince William is now colonel-in-chief of the Army Air Corp - the regiment Prince Harry served with in Afghanistan.\n\nFor all the latest on news, politics, sports, and showbiz from the USA, go to The Mirror US.\n\nREAD MORE: Prince Harry and Meghan Markle to have bombshells exposed in upcoming German documentary\n\nPrince Harry is back in the UK for a short trip from the States\n\nRoyal expert and author Tom Quinn exclusively told The Mirror: \"King Charles' announcement that Prince Harry is being stripped of his role as Colonel-in-Chief of the Army Air Corps is a real kick in the teeth for the son who always felt marginalised and underrated. What makes it much worse is that the role is being given to the very man who Harry sees as the cause of so many of his problems - his brother. And the announcement was deliberately made during Harry's brief visit to the UK to have maximum impact - it shows Harry that he really is no longer welcome.\"\n\nMr Quinn claimed that the senior royals \"knew\" that the announcement would \"really hurt\" Harry, before revealing that \"he is said to have been in tears when he heard\". He added: \"But they have decided the gloves are off and that Harry needs to realise that when you betray the family, you don't just escape the things you hated doing as a working royal. You also lose the things you loved.\"\n\n\"Being Colonel-in-Chief of the Army Air Corps was something Harry really did enjoy and of which he was very proud,\" Mr Quinn went on. \"There is a rushed feel to the whole thing too as if they can't wait to be rid of this troublesome prince - which is why Harry's role will be transferred to William in just a few days' time, on 13 May.\n\n\"Harry feels his time in the military was a rare happy time in his life when he was judged on his merits as a man not on his merits as a member of the Royal Family.\"\n\nConcluding his thoughts on the situation, Mr Quinn added: \"Having always hated being the spare in terms of the succession he now finds that one of the few important roles he had as the younger brother has now been handed over to the person Harry himself described as his nemesis. Harry cannot fail to get the message - his last few ties to his old life are being cut and he is being set adrift, permanently.\"\n\nFollow Mirror Celebs on TikTok , Snapchat , Instagram , Twitter , Facebook , YouTube and Threads .", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jessica_gibb@mirror.co.uk", "name": "Jessica Gibb", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "mollie_quirk@mirror.co.uk", "name": "Mollie Quirk", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Harry,_Duke_of_Sussex", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_I_of_England", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Charles I of England"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William,_Prince_of_Wales", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "William, Prince of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonel-in-chief", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Colonel-in-chief"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_VIII", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Edward VIII"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invictus_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Invictus Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "British Army"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regiment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Regiment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Mirror", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Daily Mirror"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckingham_Palace", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Buckingham Palace"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meghan,_Duchess_of_Sussex", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Meghan, Duchess of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Army_Air_Corps_(United_Kingdom)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Army Air Corps (United Kingdom)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Afghanistan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Afghanistan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "TikTok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_royal_family", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "British royal family"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snapchat", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Snapchat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Genealogy/Royalty", "label": "dmoz/Society/Genealogy/Royalty", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Monarchy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Monarchy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 76}], "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article32769538.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_harrywilliamexcl.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550326", "eventUri": "eng-9550326", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-13", "textStart": 2314, "textEnd": 2320}], "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "wgt": 180, "relevance": 1}

King Charles postponed public-facing duties and continued to work behind the scenes after he started receiving treatment, which the palace said coincided with its Feb. 5 announcement about his health. King Charles resumed forward-facing duties on April 30, and Queen Camilla later said she thought her husband was \"really thrilled to be out.\"\n\nPrince Harry's February trip to the U.K. did not involve meeting with his brother, Prince William, or his sister-in-law, Princess Kate. A royal source said at the time there were \"no plans\" for the brothers to get together.\n\nIn March, the Princess of Wales, 42, announced that she was undergoing treatment for cancer following abdominal surgery in January. PEOPLE understands that Prince Harry and Meghan Markle privately reached out to the Prince and Princess of Wales amid Kate's diagnosis.\n\nThe Duke and Duchess of Sussex also shared their support by releasing a statement after Princess Kate announced the news about her health.\n\n\"We wish health and healing for Kate and the family, and hope they are able to do so privately and in peace,\" the Duke and Duchess of Sussex said in a statement shared with PEOPLE on March 22, the day of Princess Kate's announcement.\n\nRelated: Meghan Markle and Prince Harry to Visit Nigeria in May for a Special Reason\n\nBefore the Princess of Wales announced that she had cancer, a family source told PEOPLE that Prince Harry and Meghan were in the dark about her abdominal surgery and recovery.\n\n\"They are aware of everything that goes on back in England, but are being left out of any details regarding Kate,\" the source told PEOPLE. \"There is clearly no trust.\"\n\nThe itinerary for Prince Harry's Invictus-focused trip also included a panel discussion, and the Duke of Sussex delivered a reading at St. Paul's Cathedral during the Service of Thanksgiving.\n\nHomeland actor Damian Lewis recited the poem \"Invictus,\" which inspired the competition's motto, and the ceremony was attended by representatives from across the participating nations of the Invictus Games, including members of the wounded, injured and sick service personnel and veteran community.

PEOPLE confirmed that the Duke and Duchess of Sussex will travel to Nigeria later this week upon the invitation on behalf of the Chief of Defense Staff, the country's highest-ranking military official.\n\nDuring their visit, Prince Harry and Meghan will meet with service members and participate in a variety of cultural activities in a visit highlighting the Invictus Games. Nigeria made its event debut at the sixth cycle of the adaptive sports tournament in D\u00fcsseldorf, Germany in September 2023, and the Duke and Duchess of Sussex spent time with the team and fans in the stands.\n\nPrince Harry joked that his wife was rooting for the squad at the opening ceremony after discovering that she has Nigerian heritage, a revelation made on her Archetypes podcast in 2022. Nigerian Minister of Defense Alhaji Mohammed Abubakar Badaru also attended the competition in Germany, and has expressed interest in hosting the Invictus Games in the future, should the country be granted the opportunity.\n\nWhile plans are in motion for the next Invictus Games in Vancouver and Whistler, Canada, in February 2025, the eighth iteration of the Invictus Games might take it back to the United States. On May 1, the Invictus Games Foundation revealed the shortlist of cities hoping to host the 2027 Invictus Games, with just two contenders: Washington, D.C. and Birmingham, U.K.\n\nThe 2027 cycle will be the eighth Invictus Games, following the competitions in London (2014), Orlando (2016), Toronto (2017), Sydney (2018), The Hague (2022, bumped from 2020 due to the pandemic) and D\u00fcsseldorf in

Across town shortly afterwards, the Duke of Sussex took his place at St Paul's Cathedral for a service celebrating 10 years of the Invictus Games.\n\nFather and son were less than three miles away from one another, but have never seemed further apart.\n\nAt the side of the King was a Royal family out in force: the Queen, the Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh, the Princess Royal and the Duke and Duchess of Gloucester all taking their place for the national anthem.\n\nThe Duke of Sussex arrived at his event alone.\n\nHowever, inside St Paul's Prince Harry had a team of his own in the shape of his maternal family. His uncle and aunt, Earl Spencer and Lady Jane Fellowes, there in support, greeted with emotional hugs.\n\nThey were joined by Mark Dyer, a former Army officer often described as a \"father figure\", Jamie Lowther-Pinkerton, a former private secretary to both Prince William and Prince Harry, and - in a sign of the times - David Sherborne, the Duke's barrister.\n\nOutside St Paul's, a crowd waited for a Prince Harry walkabout, taking selfies and clasping his hand as he made his way along.\n\nThe Prince of Wales did not attend either event, spending the morning holding a Windsor Castle investiture before returning home to his own family.\n\nThe separate outings show the state of the Royal family as it stands: Team Windsor on duty and an emerging Team Sussex elsewhere.\n\nIt was all a long way from scenes a decade ago, when Princes Charles, William and Harry celebrated the first Invictus Games in London with public appearances that saw them laughing, kissing on the cheek and sharing a joke looking at a phone screen.\n\nAt the 10th anniversary service on Wednesday, Prince Harry read 1 Corinthians 12: 4-11, to speak of \"service\" and the \"common good\".\n\nThe dean, the Very Rev Andrew Tremlett, gave a welcome hailing the tremendous achievements of the sick and injured military personnel from 23 nations who compete in the Games. Actor Damian Lewis, 53, recited the Invictus poem by William Henley.\n\nPrince Harry, who beamed and waved as he entered St Paul's, later joined Invictus competitors and staff for a reception in the cathedral's crypt. He spent the rest of the day in meetings with his remaining UK patronages.\n\nAt Buckingham Palace, in overlapping events, the King led the Royal family in the annual celebration of community service, his first garden party since his cancer diagnosis.\n\nAs he stood on the terrace with the Queen he heard a loud cheer at the end of the national anthem and waved his black top hat to acknowledge the crowd with thanks.\n\nWalking across the lawn, he shook hand after hand and answered the questions about his health repeatedly.\n\nOne guest told him he was \"looking so much better\". The King replied: \"I'm not doing badly.\"\n\n\"How are you feeling, Sir?\" one man asked, with the King saying \"Not too bad\" in response.\n\nThe King, wearing sunscreen in the heat, occasionally dabbed his nose with a handkerchief, but was described by an onlooker as seeming in excellent spirits, peppering guests with questions about where they had come from and what they did.\n\nIt is his next step towards resuming a regular programme of public activity, even as he continues his cancer treatment.\n\nAs such, the garden party, just like the Invictus service, should have been celebratory. Instead, the day was overshadowed somewhat by the rumbling question of the King and his younger son meeting. In the end, sources said, they did not.\n\nThe Duke had hoped for a meeting with his father before his trip to Britain, it is said, though recollections seem to vary once again as to whether a formal, timely request was made.\n\nEventually, as he landed on Tuesday morning, Harry's spokeswoman issued a written statement confirming that the King would be too busy to see his younger son. \"The Duke of course is understanding of his father's diary of commitments and various other priorities and hopes to see him soon,\" she said.\n\nA spokesman for the King said nothing.\n\nThose within the palace have privately raised the issue of trust, pointing to a King who has a lot on his plate.\n\nThe last time Prince Harry visited, for a 30-minute meeting shortly after the King was diagnosed with cancer, it was swiftly followed by an interview on US breakfast television.\n\nAt the time his actual words were received calmly back in Britain, but that he was open to being asked about it on Good Morning America did nothing to restore trust for future visits.\n\nThis week, within days, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex will arrive in Nigeria for a tour with all the attendant press and publicity that entails.\n\nThey are there in part to promote Invictus, in a country the Duchess has recently claimed a personal link to. She is, she said in a 2022 podcast, 43 per cent Nigerian according to a genealogy test.\n\nThe King, who is Head of Commonwealth but has not been able to travel overseas in 2024, will be kept informed of their activities.\n\nPerhaps on a different visit to the UK, when the Duke is not about to fly immediately into a high-profile, headline-grabbing Commonwealth tour, there will be time for father and son to talk quietly.\n\nThe palace way is formal\n\nThose who know Prince Harry say he simply wants to see his father.\n\nThe explanation of being \"too busy\", volunteered by the Sussexes rather than the palace, has inevitably raised eyebrows. The King is busy, there is no doubting that, particularly as he navigates his return to public duty. The palace way of arranging meetings is formal, the lines of communication with the Sussexes limited. But where there's a will there's a way.\n\nIn February 2024, after his last visit to Britain, when asked whether it was possible that his father's illness would have a \"galvanising and sort of reunifying effect\" for his family, Prince Harry said: \"I'm sure.\"\n\nThree months on, another flying visit under his belt, and that dream is no closer to reality.\n\nThe gulf between Prince Harry and the King, in communication and expectation, seems no closer to being bridged.\n\nIt was not so long ago that another father and son had their differences aired; a young Prince Charles cast in the public imagination as the overly emotional son with a father who did not understand him.\n\n\"He's a romantic and I'm a pragmatist,\" Prince Philip once said of his eldest. \"That means we do see things differently.\"\n\nNo one would call the current King \"unfeeling\", as was said of his own late father. But perhaps, in all of this upset, he has found his inner pragmatist too.", "source": {"uri": "telegraph.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Telegraph"}, "authors": [{"uri":

You also lose the things you loved.\"\n\nThe Duke of Sussex was in London yesterday for a service of thanksgiving at St Paul's Cathedral to mark the 10th anniversary of the Invictus Games.\n\nOn Thursday, his brother William was seen smiling as he smiled as he visited sunny Cornwall for two royal engagements in Newquay and the Isles of Scilly.\n\nQueen Camilla meanwhile met with former TV newsreader Angela Rippon at Buckingham Palace to mark the 90th anniversary of Brooke, a charity dedicated to improving the lives of working horses, donkeys, and mules.\n\nYesterday, she and\u2002King Charles seemed in good spirits as they hosted guests\u2002at Buckingham Palace garden party. Fellow working royals also turned out for the afternoon including Princess Anne, the Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh, Edward and Sophie, as well as the Duke and Duchess of Gloucester.\n\nIt comes after commentator Michael Cole gave insights in to the new development citing divisions between the Prince Harry and the Royal Family are now \"very, very deep\".\n\nHe told GB News: \"The fact that the King has not found time during the three days that his younger son has been in London to see him is a definite right royal flea in the ear for Prince Harry.\n\n\"The division between the California hilltop Camelot and the British Royal Family, getting on with the job, is now very, very deep.

They're human beings, they must not be judged,\" Welby, 68, said during a Thursday, May 9, appearance on ITV's Good Morning Britain when asked about Prince Harry's estrangement from the rest of the royal family. \"They need to be prayed for and supported.\"\n\nThe archbishop's comments come one day after Harry, 39, attended a service at St. Paul's Cathedral in London marking the 10th anniversary of the Invictus Games. The Duke of Sussex was met by a crowd of what appeared to be thousands of people as he left the church. He beamed as he shook hands and chatted with several of them.\n\nMeanwhile, Harry's father, King Charles III, was at a Buckingham Palace garden party with other senior royals just two miles away. A spokesperson for Harry confirmed to Us Weekly on Tuesday, May 7, that the father-son duo would not be able to connect during Harry's trip across the pond.\n\nPrince Harry's Ups and Downs With the Royal Family Over the Years\n\n\"In response to the many inquiries and continued speculation on whether or not The Duke will meet with his father while in the UK this week, it unfortunately will not be possible due to His Majesty's full program,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nAlthough Charles, 75, and other members of Harry's family weren't able to attend the anniversary celebrations, a source exclusively told Us earlier this month that Harry had attempted to contact his family and invite them to the Games.\n\nThe insider added that Harry and his brother, Prince William, \"haven't had a real conversation in months,\" although Harry \"would be more than happy\" to reconnect.\n\nHarry's tension with his father and brother goes back to 2020 when he and his wife, Meghan Markle, stepped down as working senior royals and moved to the United States with their son Archie, now 5. They went on to welcome daughter Lilibet, 2.\n\nPrince Harry's Ups and Downs With the Royal Family Over the Years\n\nThe rift deepened when Harry made several claims about the royal family in his 2023 memoir Spare, including an allegation that he once got into a physical fight with William, 41, over Meghan, 42.\n\nThere may be renewed hope for the brothers' reconciliation as William's wife, Princess Kate Middleton, battles cancer, a second source told Us.\n\nKate, 42, who confirmed her diagnosis in March, is \"willing\" to talk to Harry and is \"done with all the bad blood,\" the insider said.\n\n\"They want a relationship with Meghan and Harry, and they don't want the acrimony to carry over to the next generation,\" the source continued, explaining that William and Kate want their three children, Prince George, 10, Princess Charlotte, 8, and Prince Louis, 6, to form a bond with Harry's kids.\n\nThe Royal Family: Get to Know the Next Generation\n\nCharles, meanwhile, is battling a cancer diagnosis of his own. After Buckingham Palace announced the news in February, Harry flew from Los Angeles to London to see his father.\n\n\"I love my family,\" Harry said during an appearance on Good Morning America later that month. \"I jumped on a plane and went to see him as soon as I could.\"\n\nThe prince added that he had \"other trip plans\" lined up to visit the U.K. and would \"stop in and see my family as much as I can.\"", "source": {"uri": "newsobserver.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The News&Observer"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sara_donnellan@newsobserver.com", "name": "Sara Donnellan", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Harry,_Duke_of_Sussex", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_royal_family", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "British royal family"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archbishop_of_Canterbury", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Archbishop of Canterbury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William,_Prince_of_Wales", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "William, Prince of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_III_of_Spain", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Charles III of Spain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invictus_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Invictus Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Paul's_Cathedral", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "St Paul's Cathedral"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITV_(TV_network)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ITV (TV network)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meghan,_Duchess_of_Sussex", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Meghan, Duchess of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Us_Weekly", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Us Weekly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckingham_Palace", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Buckingham Palace"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Louis_of_Wales", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prince Louis of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princess_Charlotte_of_Wales_(born_2015)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Princess Charlotte of Wales (born 2015)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princess_Lilibet_of_Sussex", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Princess Lilibet of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catherine,_Princess_of_Wales", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Catherine, Princess of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_George,_Duke_of_Kent", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prince George, Duke of Kent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Morning_America", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Good Morning America"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Genealogy/Royalty", "label": "dmoz/Society/Genealogy/Royalty", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Monarchy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Monarchy", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Large_Families", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Large Families", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Publications", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Publications", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Family_Resources_and_Support", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Family Resources and Support", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.mcclatchy-wires.com/incoming/mqnb9r/picture288437403/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/523e5d7d-e06f-4c31-8b9c-3d217b2332b8", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550326", "eventUri": "eng-9550326", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-09", "textStart": 199, "textEnd": 204}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-07", "textStart": 891, "textEnd": 896}], "sentiment": 0.1058823529411765, "wgt": 178, "relevance": 1}

But royal watchers definitely opined Wednesday that Harry was \"snubbed\" and that his father was sending him an \"ominous\" message.\n\nCharles' unwillingness to schedule even 15 minutes to see his estranged son this week, after Harry traveled all the way from California, is an indication that \"the palace gates remain firmly closed,\" said journalist and author Richard Kay. The relationship between Harry and with his father and the rest of the royal family appears to be \"more broken than ever,\" Kay also said.\n\nRoyal expert Michael Cole agreed, telling the Daily Mail: \"It is quite a snub. For the king to not see his younger son, although the two men will be only two miles apart (Wednesday), gives an indication of the depth of the divide.\"\n\n\"The prodigal son is not welcome -- not for the present, anyway,\" Cole continued. \"In royal terms, this is big medicine. Prince Harry is bound to see it for what it is, the clearest possible indication of the hurt that has been caused.\"\n\nPiers Morgan, a fierce critic of Harry and his wife, Meghan Markle, was even more blunt about \"the snub,\" writing in The Sun: \"Let's be honest: if Charles had really wanted to see him, he'd have made the time. That's the whole point of being a king, you get to do what the hell you like.\"\n\nBut Morgan said it's clear from the statements about \"scheduling\" issues that \"Charles would rather impale himself on a rusty sword than meet up with someone who has wrought such vengeful misery on the royal family for so many years now.\"\n\nBefore Harry traveled to London from his home in Montecito, he had made no secret of his desire to see his father again, as the king undergoes treatment for an undisclosed form cancer, The Telegraph reported. In February, Harry told ABC News how he jumped on a plane, \"as soon as I could,\" to fly to London to see his father, after his father publicly disclosed that he had cancer.\n\n\"Look, I love my family,\" Harry insisted. \"The fact that I was able to get on a plane and go and see him and spend any time with him, I'm grateful for that.\"\n\nBefore this week, royal observers thought that Harry might use his time in London to spend some time with Charles, marking another step towards a reconciliation.\n\nHarry has been on the outs from his family ever since he and Meghan, his American wife, stepped away from royal duties in 2020 and moved to her home state of California. The estrangement grew as Harry and Meghan, via interviews, a Netflix series and Harry's memoir \"Spare,\" publicly criticized the monarchy and alleged that certain family members were cruel, guilty of racism -- or of \"unconscious bias\" as Harry preferred to put it. Harry also accused family members, particularly his father's wife, Queen Camilla, of leaking negative news about them to favorite tabloid journalists.\n\nBut Harry has since tried to convey the message that he hopes to heal the rift with his family and move past their differences -- especially after learning that both his father and Kate Middleton, the wife of his brother, Prince William, have been diagnosed with cancer.\n\nIn his interview with ABC News, Harry spoke about how an illness like cancer can bring families together. He also vowed to visit his father in the near future. \"I've got other trips planned that would take me through the UK or back to the UK, so I'll stop in and see my family as much as I can,\" he said.\n\nStill, as much as Harry tried to portray his \"dash\" to London in February as a positive step towards reconciliation, The Telegraph noted that his trip still faced challenges. Harry's sudden arrival in London reportedly forced Charles to change his plans at the last minute, and Harry wasn't invited to travel with his father to his country estate.\n\nWriting in the Daily Mail, Kay suggested that Charles' cancer diagnosis may have had the opposite effect on his relationship with his son. \"The illness has, if anything, added to their estrangement,\" Kay said.\n\nThe snub narrative has been amplified this week by the announcement that Charles would officially hand over a key ceremonial role in the British military to William, the Prince of Wales and his direct heir. The king will name William as colonel-in-chief of the Army Air Corps.\n\nThe Telegraph reported that Charles probably would have handed the colonelcy to Harry, an Army veteran who had flown Apache helicopters in Afghanistan. But the late Queen Elizabeth II removed Harry's military titles when he stepped away from royal duties.\n\nAt this point, the king may find that encounters with Harry have become more of \"a burden than a a pleasure,\" especially as he battles cancer, Kay wrote. Two people important to him also may have a problem with welcoming Harry back into the royal fold. These two people are Camilla, who has been the subject of Harry's \"lacerating attacks,\" and William, Kay added. Harry has portrayed William as having anger management issues, while William may never forgive his brother for hurtful comments he made in \"Spare\" about Kate.\n\n\"The opposition of Camilla and William would be formidable to Charles,\" Kay quoted a courtier as saying. \"For all his affection for Harry -- which remains -- and sadness at the deep rift that has developed, his ties with his wife and older son are far deeper.\"", "source": {"uri": "mercurynews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "San Jose Mercury News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "martha_ross@mercurynews.com", "name": "Martha Ross",

That's the whole point of being a king, you get to do what the hell you like.\"\n\nBut Morgan said it's clear from the statements about \"scheduling\" issues that \"Charles would rather impale himself on a rusty sword than meet up with someone who has wrought such vengeful misery on the royal family for so many years now.\"\n\nBefore Harry traveled to London from his home in Montecito, he had made no secret of his desire to see his father again, as the king undergoes treatment for an undisclosed form cancer, The Telegraph reported. In February, Harry told ABC News how he jumped on a plane, \"as soon as I could,\" to fly to London to see his father, after his father publicly disclosed that he had cancer.\n\n\"Look, I love my family,\" Harry insisted. \"The fact that I was able to get on a plane and go and see him and spend any time with him, I'm grateful for that.\"\n\nBefore this week, royal observers thought that Harry might use his time in London to spend some time with Charles, marking another step towards a reconciliation.\n\nHarry has been on the outs from his family ever since he and Meghan, his American wife, stepped away from royal duties in 2020 and moved to her home state of California. The estrangement grew as Harry and Meghan, via interviews, a Netflix series and Harry's memoir \"Spare,\" publicly criticized the monarchy and alleged that certain family members were cruel, guilty of racism -- or of \"unconscious bias\" as Harry preferred to put it. Harry also accused family members, particularly his father's wife, Queen Camilla, of leaking negative news about them to favorite tabloid journalists.\n\nBut Harry has since tried to convey the message that he hopes to heal the rift with his family and move past their differences -- especially after learning that both his father and Kate Middleton, the wife of his brother, Prince William, have been diagnosed with cancer.\n\nIn his interview with ABC News, Harry spoke about how an illness like cancer can bring families together. He also vowed to visit his father in the near future. \"I've got other trips planned that would take me through the UK or back to the UK, so I'll stop in and see my family as much as I can,\" he said.\n\nStill, as much as Harry tried to portray his \"dash\" to London in February as a positive step towards reconciliation, The Telegraph noted that his trip still faced challenges. Harry's sudden arrival in London reportedly forced Charles to change his plans at the last minute, and Harry wasn't invited to travel with his father to his country estate.\n\nWriting in the Daily Mail, Kay suggested that Charles' cancer diagnosis may have had the opposite effect on his relationship with his son. \"The illness has, if anything, added to their estrangement,\" Kay said.\n\nThe snub narrative has been amplified this week by the announcement that Charles would officially hand over a key ceremonial role in the British military to William, the Prince of Wales and his direct heir. The king will name William as colonel-in-chief of the Army Air Corps.\n\nThe Telegraph reported that Charles probably would have handed the colonelcy to Harry, an Army veteran who had flown Apache helicopters in Afghanistan. But the late Queen Elizabeth II removed Harry's military titles when he stepped away from royal duties.\n\nAt this point, the king may find that encounters with Harry have become more of \"a burden than a a pleasure,\" especially as he battles cancer, Kay wrote. Two people important to him also may have a problem with welcoming Harry back into the royal fold. These two people are Camilla, who has been the subject of Harry's \"lacerating attacks,\" and William, Kay added. Harry has portrayed William as having anger management issues, while William may never forgive his brother for hurtful comments he made in \"Spare\" about Kate.\n\n\"The opposition of Camilla and William would be formidable to Charles,\" Kay quoted a courtier as saying. \"For all his affection for Harry -- which remains -- and sadness at the deep rift that has developed, his ties with his wife and older son are far deeper.\"", "source": {"uri": "eastbaytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "East Bay Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "martha_ross@eastbaytimes.com", "name": "Martha Ross",

The Prince of Wales is succeeding King Charles III as head of the regiment.\n\nThe U.K.'s Independent noted that it's likely the honor would have been given to Harry, if he hadn't stepped down as a senior member of the royal family, because he served with the unit in Afghanistan. A spokesperson for Buckingham Palace didn't immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.\n\nPRINCE HARRY 'HIT HARD' BY KATE MIDDLETON CANCER BATTLE, BUT PRINCE WILLIAM WON'T LET HIM 'NEAR' WIFE: EXPERT\n\n\"It is one slap in the face after another for Harry,\" royal expert Ian Pelham Turner told Fox News Digital about the announcement, which some U.K. outlets have described as another \"snub\" for the prince.\n\n\"I think this is a mistake,\" said Pelham Turner about the king not choosing to meet with his son ahead of the bombshell news. \"Patronizing reasons like Harry might spill the beans on a conversation in any future book ... are not justified and will only add petrol to the flames. Charles ... [was] touchy feeling, holding hands with cancer victims but cannot stretch out to his son.\"\n\nREAD ON THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"Taking away another military regiment ... means nothing to the British public,\" Pelham Turner said. \"But it does to Harry. [It's] the regiment he served in until 2014. Giving it to William will only further highlight the churlish divisions and not show a forgiving nature. ... On a day when Harry is at an event to celebrate the Invictus Games ... I wonder what the recipients ... think of the betrayal.\"\n\nHarry, 39, arrived in London without his wife, Meghan Markle, by his side. The prince joined a panel on Tuesday for the 10th anniversary of the Invictus Games. The discussion, \"The IGF Conversation: Realizing a Global Community,\" aimed to highlight service personnel and their families.\n\nThen on Wednesday, the Duke of Sussex appeared at St. Paul's Cathedral for a service commemorating the 10th anniversary of the Invictus Games.\n\nOn that same day, Charles and his wife, Queen Camilla, welcomed thousands of guests to Buckingham Palace for the first garden party of 2024. The festivities are a longstanding tradition that dates to the 1860s. Other members of the royal family, including Princess Anne, Prince Edward, Sophie, the Duchess of Edinburgh, and the Duke and Duchess of Gloucester, were in attendance.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER\n\nA spokesperson for the Duke of Sussex previously confirmed to Fox News Digital that the prince wouldn't be meeting with his father.\n\n\"In response to the many inquiries and continued speculation on whether or not The Duke will meet with his father while in the UK this week, it, unfortunately, will not be possible due to His Majesty's full programme,\" the statement said.\n\n\"The Duke, of course, is understanding of his father's diary of commitments and various other priorities and hopes to see him soon.\"\n\nHarry's sister-in-law, Princess Kate Middleton, has been keeping a low profile as she seeks treatment for cancer. The king, 75, who was also diagnosed with cancer, has returned to public-facing duties as he continues his recovery.\n\nChristopher Andersen, author of \"The King,\" told Fox News Digital that the king and the Prince of Wales, 41, sent a clear message to Harry.\n\n\"If there were any doubts that Harry is dead to his father and brother, then this one-two punch from King Charles should dispel them once and for all,\" Andersen said. \"By announcing that he was too busy to see Harry, even though the two men are just two miles apart, and then officially giving Harry's colonel in chief of the Army Air Corps title to William - one of the honorary military titles Harry cherished most - the king is slamming the door in Harry's face.\"\n\n\"This was a calculated, even cruel snub,\" Andersen said. \"Under other circumstances, I would have chalked it up to the fatal tone-deafness that the palace is so famous for. But the king could easily have carved out time to see Harry, and the announcement giving Harry's old title to William didn't have to happen just as Harry arrived in London. This was all very deliberate and very petty - and very personal.\"\n\nAndersen said Harry has \"put up a good front\" as he remained dedicated to highlighting his passion project.\n\n\"Having to put up with so much emotional turmoil throughout his entire life, he has learned to compartmentalize,\" Andersen said. \"He certainly gave no indication that anything was wrong during the Invictus ceremonies. That doesn't mean that Harry isn't frustrated and, frankly, deeply wounded by the royals' continued intransigence.\"\n\n\"It's also very sad that the king and other senior royals have made no effort to embrace the Invictus Games,\" Andersen continued. \"Queen Elizabeth was a huge booster of Invictus and, in 2016, even did a memorable TV commercial for the games with Harry and Barack and Michelle Obama.\n\n\"You would think otherwise, given the king's health problems, not to mention Princess Kate's. This would be the perfect time for Charles to seize the olive branch being extended repeatedly by Harry. But the king and Prince William are not in a forgiving mood.\"\n\nHarry has had a troubled relationship with the royal family since he quit royal duties. According to the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, the unbearable intrusions and racist attitudes of the British media prompted the move to California in 2020.\n\nLIKE WHAT YOU'RE READING? CLICK HERE FOR MORE ENTERTAINMENT NEWS\n\nAfter their departure, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex aired their grievances about life as royals. In 2021, they sat down with Oprah Winfrey for an interview that was viewed by 50 million people globally. Following the release of a six-part docuseries on Netflix in 2022, Harry's memoir, \"Spare,\" hit bookshelves in 2023, quickly becoming a bestseller.\n\nBritish royal expert Hilary Fordwich told Fox News Digital that the king's seemingly too-busy schedule and William's new role are no accidents.\n\n\"One of the many ways we know how much the military has always meant to Prince Harry is that he wore his Blues and Royals military uniform when he wed Meghan ... back when he was Captain General of the Marines,\" Fordwich said. \"He has lost other military honorary titles: his Honorary Air Commandant of RAF Honington and Commodore in Chief, Small Ships and Diving, Royal Naval Command.\"\n\n\"Nothing the royal family does is either spur of the moment or by accident,\" she said. \"Nor do they act in isolation. ... What is so sad for Harry is that he was viewed by both the public and military as a rather courageous soldier. He didn't have to serve in Afghanistan.

The Prince of Wales is succeeding King Charles III as head of the regiment.\n\nThe U.K.'s Independent noted that it's likely the honor would have been given to Harry, if he hadn't stepped down as a senior member of the royal family, because he served with the unit in Afghanistan. A spokesperson for Buckingham Palace didn't immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.\n\nPRINCE HARRY 'HIT HARD' BY KATE MIDDLETON CANCER BATTLE, BUT PRINCE WILLIAM WON'T LET HIM 'NEAR' WIFE: EXPERT\n\n\"It is one slap in the face after another for Harry,\" royal expert Ian Pelham Turner told Fox News Digital about the announcement, which some U.K. outlets have described as another \"snub\" for the prince.\n\n\"I think this is a mistake,\" said Pelham Turner about the king not choosing to meet with his son ahead of the bombshell news. \"Patronizing reasons like Harry might spill the beans on a conversation in any future book ... are not justified and will only add petrol to the flames. Charles ... [was] touchy feeling, holding hands with cancer victims but cannot stretch out to his son.\"\n\n\"Taking away another military regiment ... means nothing to the British public,\" Pelham Turner said. \"But it does to Harry. [It's] the regiment he served in until 2014. Giving it to William will only further highlight the churlish divisions and not show a forgiving nature. ... On a day when Harry is at an event to celebrate the Invictus Games ... I wonder what the recipients ... think of the betrayal.\"\n\nHarry, 39, arrived in London without his wife, Meghan Markle, by his side. The prince joined a panel on Tuesday for the 10th anniversary of the Invictus Games. The discussion, \"The IGF Conversation: Realizing a Global Community,\" aimed to highlight service personnel and their families.\n\nThen on Wednesday, the Duke of Sussex appeared at St. Paul's Cathedral for a service commemorating the 10th anniversary of the Invictus Games.\n\nOn that same day, Charles and his wife, Queen Camilla, welcomed thousands of guests to Buckingham Palace for the first garden party of 2024. The festivities are a longstanding tradition that dates to the 1860s. Other members of the royal family, including Princess Anne, Prince Edward, Sophie, the Duchess of Edinburgh, and the Duke and Duchess of Gloucester, were in attendance.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER\n\nA spokesperson for the Duke of Sussex previously confirmed to Fox News Digital that the prince wouldn't be meeting with his father.\n\n\"In response to the many inquiries and continued speculation on whether or not The Duke will meet with his father while in the UK this week, it, unfortunately, will not be possible due to His Majesty's full programme,\" the statement said.\n\n\"The Duke, of course, is understanding of his father's diary of commitments and various other priorities and hopes to see him soon.\"\n\nHarry's sister-in-law, Princess Kate Middleton, has been keeping a low profile as she seeks treatment for cancer. The king, 75, who was also diagnosed with cancer, has returned to public-facing duties as he continues his recovery.\n\nChristopher Andersen, author of \"The King,\" told Fox News Digital that the king and the Prince of Wales, 41, sent a clear message to Harry.\n\n\"If there were any doubts that Harry is dead to his father and brother, then this one-two punch from King Charles should dispel them once and for all,\" Andersen said. \"By announcing that he was too busy to see Harry, even though the two men are just two miles apart, and then officially giving Harry's colonel in chief of the Army Air Corps title to William - one of the honorary military titles Harry cherished most - the king is slamming the door in Harry's face.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"This was a calculated, even cruel snub,\" Andersen said. \"Under other circumstances, I would have chalked it up to the fatal tone-deafness that the palace is so famous for. But the king could easily have carved out time to see Harry, and the announcement giving Harry's old title to William didn't have to happen just as Harry arrived in London. This was all very deliberate and very petty - and very personal.\"\n\nAndersen said Harry has \"put up a good front\" as he remained dedicated to highlighting his passion project.\n\n\"Having to put up with so much emotional turmoil throughout his entire life, he has learned to compartmentalize,\" Andersen said. \"He certainly gave no indication that anything was wrong during the Invictus ceremonies. That doesn't mean that Harry isn't frustrated and, frankly, deeply wounded by the royals' continued intransigence.\"\n\n\"It's also very sad that the king and other senior royals have made no effort to embrace the Invictus Games,\" Andersen continued. \"Queen Elizabeth was a huge booster of Invictus and, in 2016, even did a memorable TV commercial for the games with Harry and Barack and Michelle Obama.\n\n\"You would think otherwise, given the king's health problems, not to mention Princess Kate's. This would be the perfect time for Charles to seize the olive branch being extended repeatedly by Harry. But the king and Prince William are not in a forgiving mood.\"\n\nHarry has had a troubled relationship with the royal family since he quit royal duties. According to the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, the unbearable intrusions and racist attitudes of the British media prompted the move to California in 2020.\n\nLIKE WHAT YOU'RE READING? CLICK HERE FOR MORE ENTERTAINMENT NEWS\n\nAfter their departure, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex aired their grievances about life as royals. In 2021, they sat down with Oprah Winfrey for an interview that was viewed by 50 million people globally. Following the release of a six-part docuseries on Netflix in 2022, Harry's memoir, \"Spare,\" hit bookshelves in 2023, quickly becoming a bestseller.\n\nBritish royal expert Hilary Fordwich told Fox News Digital that the king's seemingly too-busy schedule and William's new role are no accidents.\n\n\"One of the many ways we know how much the military has always meant to Prince Harry is that he wore his Blues and Royals military uniform when he wed Meghan ... back when he was Captain General of the Marines,\" Fordwich said. \"He has lost other military honorary titles: his Honorary Air Commandant of RAF Honington and Commodore in Chief, Small Ships and Diving, Royal Naval Command.\"\n\n\"Nothing the royal family does is either spur of the moment or by accident,\" she said. \"Nor do they act in isolation. ... What is so sad for Harry is that he was viewed by both the public and military as a rather courageous soldier. He didn't have to serve in Afghanistan. He had to fight government policy to be allowed to serve. ... It was considered too much of a security risk for him to see active duty.\"\n\n\"His reputation was further enhanced with his founding of the Invictus Games,\" Fordwich continued. \"But now his reputation is permanently tarnished.\"\n\n\"It's hard to imagine when a true reconciliation will ever occur,\" Andersen said, referring to Harry's strained relationship with his family.\n\nPRINCE HARRY WON'T MEET WITH KING CHARLES DURING TRIP TO UK FOR INVICTUS GAMES ANNIVERSARY\n\nModeled after the Warrior Games in the United States, Harry founded the Invictus Games in 2014 as a Paralympic-style event designed to inspire military veterans around the world as they work to overcome battlefield injuries.

reflected on the 10th anniversary of the Invictus Games, which stages sporting events for wounded, sick or injured veterans or serving military to aid their recovery.\n\nHe told delegates at the event, held at the Honourable Artillery Company's headquarters on the edge of the City of London: 'Sometimes you... look back and go 'Look at what we've done'.\n\n'But also given the state of the world, there is so much more to do and I think a lot of uncertainty - but what we've created is a global community.'\n\nKing Charles III (centre) and Queen Camilla walk out to join the crowds at the

looking after his three children while his wife Kate undergoes preventative chemotherapy for cancer and recovers from serious abdominal surgery in January.\n\nToday William will fly to Cornwall for further official engagements - and the King will meet staff and families of the 3 Royal School of Military Engineering in Surrey.\n\nThen on Monday there will be a rare joint visit for Charles and William, as the King officially hands over the role of Colonel-in-Chief of the Army Air Corps to William at the Army Aviation Centre in Middle Wallop, where Harry previously learnt to fly.\n\nHarry has travelled to the UK to commemorate the Invictus Games milestone with those who have been involved with the paralympic-style tournament and mark the decade-long support competitors have received.\n\nCharles and Harry last met soon after the King announced his cancer diagnosis in February and his son rushed from America to see his father.\n\nThat was the first time Harry had seen his father in person for 17 months, and they had a half-hour meeting before Charles left London to recuperate at Sandringham following treatment.\n\nBut this time, a spokesman for Harry said: 'In response to the many inquiries and continued speculation on whether or not the duke will meet with his father while in the UK this week, it unfortunately will not be possible due to His Majesty's full programme.\n\nThe Duke was warmly greeted by the Dean of St Paul's, the Very Reverend Andrew Tremlett, before being escorted to his seat under the cathedral's great dome\n\nMark Dyer during The

priorities and hopes to see him soon.'\n\nJust hours after Harry's statement, palace officials announced a new joint engagement for Charles and William.\n\nIt is one of dozens of official engagements being planned for the 75-year-old monarch in the coming months after his doctors gave him the all-clear to undertake more public work once again while continuing his cancer treatment.\n\nOn Monday, Charles met the prime minister of the Republic of Fiji at Buckingham Palace, before retiring to Clarence House - three miles away from Harry's event.\n\nHarry now lives with his wife Meghan Markle and children Archie, who turned five on Monday, and Lilibet in a \u00a312million mansion in Montecito, California.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"},

Along with Charles and Queen Camilla, the garden party was also attended by royal family members Princess Anne, Prince Edward and his wife Sophie, Duchess of Edinburgh and the Duke and Duchess of Gloucester.\n\n\"In response to the many inquiries and continued speculation on whether or not The Duke will meet with his father while in the U.K. this week, it unfortunately will not be possible due to His Majesty's full program. The Duke of course is understanding of his father's diary of commitments and various other priorities and hopes to see him soon,\" a spokesperson for the Duke of Sussex said on May 7.\n\nThe Duke of Sussex also traveled to the U.K. in February to privately visit his father the King after Buckingham Palace announced the monarch's cancer diagnosis. King Charles postponed public-facing duties and continued to work behind the scenes after he started receiving treatment, which the palace said coincided with its Feb. 5 announcement about his health. King Charles resumed forward-facing duties on April 30, and Queen Camilla later said she thought her husband was \"really thrilled to be out.\"\n\nPrince Harry's February trip to the U.K. did not involve meeting with his brother, Prince William, or his sister-in-law, Princess Kate. A royal source said at the time there were \"no plans\" for the brothers to get together.\n\nIn March, the Princess of Wales, 42, announced that she was undergoing treatment for cancer following abdominal surgery in January. PEOPLE understands that Prince Harry and Meghan Markle privately reached out to the Prince and Princess of Wales amid Kate's diagnosis.\n\nThe Duke and Duchess of Sussex also shared their support by releasing a statement after Princess Kate announced the news about her health.\n\n\"We wish health and healing for Kate and the family, and hope they are able to do so privately and in peace,\" the Duke and Duchess of Sussex said in a statement shared with PEOPLE on March 22, the day of Princess Kate's announcement.\n\nBefore the Princess of Wales announced that she had cancer, a family source told PEOPLE that Prince Harry and Meghan were in the dark about her abdominal surgery and recovery.\n\n\"They are aware of everything that goes on back in England, but are being left out of any details regarding Kate,\" the source told PEOPLE. \"There is clearly no trust.\"\n\nThe itinerary for Prince Harry's Invictus-focused trip also included a panel discussion, and the Duke of Sussex delivered a reading at St. Paul's Cathedral during the Service of Thanksgiving.\n\nHomeland actor Damian Lewis recited the poem \"Invictus,\" which inspired the competition's motto, and the ceremony was attended by representatives from across the participating nations of the Invictus Games, including members of the wounded, injured and sick service personnel and veteran community. Community members, supporters and beneficiaries also gave readings in the service led by The Very Reverend Andrew Tremlett, Dean of St. Paul's.\n\nCan't get enough of PEOPLE's Royals coverage?

PEOPLE confirmed that the Duke and Duchess of Sussex will travel to Nigeria later this week upon the invitation on behalf of the Chief of Defense Staff, the country's highest-ranking military official.\n\nDuring their visit, Prince Harry and Meghan will meet with service members and participate in a variety of cultural activities in a visit highlighting the Invictus Games. Nigeria made its event debut at the sixth cycle of the adaptive sports tournament in D\u00fcsseldorf, Germany in September 2023, and the Duke and Duchess of Sussex spent time with the team and fans in the stands.\n\nPrince Harry joked that his wife was rooting for the squad at the opening ceremony after discovering that she has Nigerian heritage, a revelation made on her Archetypes podcast in 2022. Nigerian Minister of Defense Alhaji Mohammed Abubakar Badaru also attended the competition in Germany, and has expressed interest in hosting the Invictus Games in the future, should the country be granted the opportunity.\n\nWhile plans are in motion for the next Invictus Games in Vancouver and Whistler, Canada, in February 2025, the eighth iteration of the Invictus Games might take it back to the United States. On May 1, the Invictus Games Foundation revealed the shortlist of cities hoping to host the 2027 Invictus Games, with just two contenders: Washington, D.C. and Birmingham, U.K.\n\nThe 2027 cycle will be the eighth Invictus Games, following the competitions in London (2014), Orlando (2016), Toronto (2017), Sydney (2018), The Hague (2022, bumped from 2020 due to the pandemic) and D\u00fcsseldorf in

For weeks, talks of a father-son reunion between the British monarch and his estranged son have flooded the media. In fact, the only uncertainty surrounding the visit was whether or not the Duke of Sussex would bring his wife Meghan Markle, and kids along for the family rendezvous. It turns out that not only did the rest of the Sussexes fail to tag along for the UK visit, but Prince Harry's reunion with his dad never happened.\n\nEarlier, a spokesperson for Prince Harry confirmed that the meeting between the prince and King Charles would not be possible. They attributed the shocking turn of events to \"His Majesty's full program.\" On Harry's part, the prince took the situation well, with the rep explaining how much he understood \"his father's diary of commitments and various other priorities.\"\n\nDespite the royals' claims of having too many commitments, royal expert Charlotte Griffiths had a different theory. According to her, King Charles declined to see his son Harry because the Prince made certain unattainable demands. She divulged,\n\n\"I think the reason was because Harry made certain demands about who could be in the room and who couldn't. Although on the surface it looks like a snub, Harry made it very difficult for his father.\"\n\nExplaining further, Charlotte noted that other forces may have influenced King Charles' decision to snub Prince Harry during his latest UK visit. She added,\n\n\"William may have had a thought about how this meeting should be conducted or whether it should be conducted at all.\"\n\nWhile Prince Harry couldn't get the chance to reunite with his dad, brother or other British royals, he enjoyed the support of his mom Princess Diana's family at the Invictus Games event. As the royals attended the season's first garden party at Buckingham Palace, Harry's maternal family including Princess Diana's siblings Earl Spencer and Lady Jane Fellowes joined him at the service at St. Paul's Cathedral.

He was heard saying: \"I'm not doing badly\". Asked 'How are you feeling?', he replied: \"Not too bad.\"\n\nHe chatted with Royal Commonwealth Society members plus Team GB's synchronised swimming team -- promising to watch them at the Paris Olympics.\n\nIn all, he spent around an hour with guests despite doctors \"calibrating\" his engagements.\n\nThis morning he will meet the 3 Royal School of Military Engineering (3RSME) at Gibraltar Barracks in Surrey.\n\nHe and Harry have not seen each other since February when the US-based Duke flew 5,000 miles following his father's diagnosis.\n\nThe pair then spoke for just 30 minutes.

Last night, however, Palace sources suggested no formal requests for a meeting had been made.\n\nKing Charles, who was invited to attend the service in central London, held the first garden party of the season at Buckingham Palace.\n\nThe monarch was joined by Queen Camilla, the Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh, the Princess Royal and the Duke and Duchess of Gloucester for the first of the summer festivities.\n\nThe only senior royals missing were the Prince and Princess of Wales. William was handing out awards in Windsor, while Kate is still undergoing treatment for cancer.\n\nPrincess Diana 's siblings were quick to show their support for Prince Harry yesterday during the Invictus Games anniversary service yesterday.

particularly Lady Jane.\n\nLady Jane, the middle of the three sisters, four years older than Diana, has long been seen as a confidante and a steadying influence in his life.\n\nShe was asked to give a reading during Harry's wedding to Meghan in 2018 and was one of the first members to be invited to meet their infant son Archie - even before Prince William.\n\nThroughout his bombshell memoir Spare, he gave a 'stand out thanks' to Lady Jane, her elder sister Lady Sarah McCorquodale and Earl Spencer but failed to mention the late Queen, King Charles or his brother.\n\nIt is therefore little surprise that two of the siblings turned out at yesterday's ceremony to give support to Diana's youngest child.\n\nAs well as his aunt and uncle, Harry was surrounded by a number of dignitaries, politicians and close friends.\n\nHis lawyer David Sherbourne was in attendance while former army officer Mark Dyer - who helped mentor Harry particularly after his mother's death - was also in the congregation.\n\nPrince Harry is expected to fly back to the US today.", "source": {"uri": "expressdigest.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "expressdigest.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Harry,_Duke_of_Sussex", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_I_of_England", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Charles I of England"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Paul's_Cathedral", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "St Paul's Cathedral"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diana,_Princess_of_Wales", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Diana, Princess of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earl_Spencer_(peerage)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Earl Spencer (peerage)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_Jane_Grey", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lady Jane Grey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invictus_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Invictus Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anne,_Princess_Royal", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anne, Princess Royal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minister_of_State_for_Veterans'_Affairs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Minister of State for Veterans' Affairs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akshata_Murty", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Akshata Murty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophie,_Duchess_of_Edinburgh", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sophie, Duchess of Edinburgh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William,_Prince_of_Wales", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "William, Prince of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_Camilla", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Queen Camilla"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meghan,_Duchess_of_Sussex", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Meghan, Duchess of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rishi_Sunak", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rishi Sunak"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnny_Mercer", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Johnny Mercer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarchy_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Monarchy of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_London", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Central London"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckingham_Palace", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Buckingham Palace"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_Sarah_McCorquodale", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lady Sarah McCorquodale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duke_of_Gloucester", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Duke of Gloucester"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_Sarah_Chatto", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lady Sarah Chatto"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_VII", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Edward VII"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windsor,_Berkshire", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Windsor, Berkshire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Windsor, Berkshire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Weddings", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Weddings", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Genealogy/Royalty", "label": "dmoz/Society/Genealogy/Royalty", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 68}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550326", "eventUri": "eng-9550326", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3254901960784313, "wgt": 175, "relevance": 1}

Meghan did not join Harry at the event, with the Royal Family also deciding against attending, despite getting invited.\n\nHowever, Earl Charles Spencer and Lady Jane Fellowes, both siblings of the late Princess Diana, Harry's mother, turned up to support their nephew at St Paul's last night. And Harry gave his aunt and uncle warm hugs as they attended the event, with them looking content in each other's company.\n\nFor all the latest on news, politics, sports, and showbiz from the USA, go to The Mirror US.\n\nREAD MORE: Prince Harry and Meghan Markle to have bombshells exposed in upcoming German documentary\n\nHarry was supported by his aunt and uncle at the event Earl Spencer has long been close with Harry\n\nDespite the ongoing royal rift with the Windsors, Prince Harry has remained close to his mother's side of the family. The Duke of Sussex is quite close to his aunt Lady Jane, who is the middle of the three sisters.\n\nLady Jane is four years older than Diana and has long been seen as a confidante and a steadying influence in Prince Harry's life. And the Duke is also close to his other aunt, Lady Sarah McCorquodale, by all accounts.\n\n\"He clearly has quite a good relationship with Charles Spencer, Jane and Sarah on the maternal side,\" historian Tessa Dunlop revealed previously in an interview with OK! from June 2023. She also added: \"That side of the family seems to be better relations,\" which alluded to how his relationship with the Spencers is better than his relationship with King Charles and Prince William at the moment.\n\nPrincess Diana's sisters, Lady Jane and Lady Sarah, have remained close to Harry\n\nThe royal historian also pointed out that the idea that Harry has no family isn't true. She said: \"While all the focus is on Harry and Meghan not having any family or relations, he clearly does have relations with the Spencers. And in Spare he talks about his two aunts and uncle being there when he and Meghan visited Diana's grave.\"\n\nThis comes after it was announced that King Charles is too busy to reunite with his son during Harry's brief trip to the UK. Soon after Harry touched down in London on Tuesday, a spokesperson for the Duke said: \"It, unfortunately, will not be possible due to His Majesty's full programme. The Duke of course is understanding of his father's diary of commitments and various other priorities and hopes to see him soon.\"\n\nFollow Mirror Celebs on TikTok , Snapchat , Instagram , Twitter , Facebook , YouTube and Threads .", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mollie_quirk@mirror.co.uk", "name": "Mollie Quirk", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Harry,_Duke_of_Sussex", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Spencer,_9th_Earl_Spencer", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Charles Spencer, 9th Earl Spencer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_Sarah_McCorquodale", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lady Sarah McCorquodale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invictus_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Invictus Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diana,_Princess_of_Wales", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Diana, Princess of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meghan,_Duchess_of_Sussex", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Meghan, Duchess of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_royal_family", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "British royal family"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Paul's_Cathedral", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "St Paul's Cathedral"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William,_Prince_of_Wales", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "William, Prince of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Mirror", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Daily Mirror"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Documentary_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Documentary film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "TikTok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_I_of_England", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Charles I of England"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OK!", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "OK!"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snapchat", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Snapchat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Genealogy/Royalty", "label": "dmoz/Society/Genealogy/Royalty", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/General_Merchandise/O", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/General Merchandise/O", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article32767754.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_harryspencersplit.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550326", "eventUri": "eng-9550326", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 175, "relevance": 1}

They're human beings, they must not be judged,\" Welby, 68, said during a Thursday, May 9, appearance on ITV's Good Morning Britain when asked about Prince Harry's estrangement from the rest of the royal family. \"They need to be prayed for and supported.\"\n\nThe archbishop's comments come one day after Harry, 39, attended a service at St. Paul's Cathedral in London marking the 10th anniversary of the Invictus Games. The Duke of Sussex was met by a crowd of what appeared to be thousands of people as he left the church. He beamed as he shook hands and chatted with several of them.\n\n\"In response to the many inquiries and continued speculation on whether or not The Duke will meet with his father while in the UK this week, it unfortunately will not be possible due to His Majesty's full program,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nAlthough Charles, 75, and other members of Harry's family weren't able to attend the anniversary celebrations, a source exclusively told Us earlier this month that Harry had attempted to contact his family and invite them to the Games.\n\nThe insider added that Harry and his brother, Prince William, \"haven't had a real conversation in months,\" although Harry \"would be more than happy\" to reconnect.\n\nHarry's tension with his father and brother goes back to 2020 when he and his wife, Meghan Markle, stepped down as working senior royals and moved to the United States with their son Archie, now 5. They went on to welcome daughter Lilibet, 2.\n\nThe rift deepened when Harry made several claims about the royal family in his 2023 memoir Spare, including an allegation that he once got into a physical fight with William, 41, over Meghan, 42.\n\nThere may be renewed hope for the brothers' reconciliation as William's wife, Princess Kate Middleton, battles cancer, a second source told Us.\n\nKate, 42, who confirmed her diagnosis in March, is \"willing\" to talk to Harry and is \"done with all the bad blood,\" the insider said.\n\n\"They want a relationship with Meghan and Harry, and they don't want the acrimony to carry over to the next generation,\" the source continued, explaining that William and Kate want their three children, Prince George, 10, Princess Charlotte, 8, and Prince Louis, 6, to form a bond with Harry's kids.\n\nCharles, meanwhile, is battling a cancer diagnosis of his own. After Buckingham Palace announced the news in February, Harry flew from Los Angeles to London to see his father.\n\n\"I love my family,\" Harry said during an appearance on Good Morning America later that month. \"I jumped on a plane and went to see him as soon as I could.\"\n\nThe prince added that he had \"other trip plans\" lined up to visit the U.K. and would \"stop in and see my family as much as I can.\"", "source": {"uri": "usmagazine.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Us Weekly"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sara_donnellan@usmagazine.com", "name": "Sara Donnellan", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_royal_family", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "British royal family"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Harry,_Duke_of_Sussex", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William,_Prince_of_Wales", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "William, Prince of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invictus_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Invictus Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archbishop_of_Canterbury", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Archbishop of Canterbury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Paul's_Cathedral", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "St Paul's Cathedral"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITV_(TV_network)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ITV (TV network)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meghan,_Duchess_of_Sussex", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Meghan, Duchess of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Louis_of_Wales", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prince Louis of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_George_of_Wales", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prince George of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princess_Charlotte_of_Wales_(born_2015)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Princess Charlotte of Wales (born 2015)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princess_Lilibet_of_Sussex", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Princess Lilibet of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catherine,_Princess_of_Wales", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Catherine, Princess of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Morning_America", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Good Morning America"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckingham_Palace", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Buckingham Palace"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/The-Archbishop-of-Canterbury-Addresses-Royal-Family-Rift-916.jpg?crop=0px%2C20px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630&quality=86&strip=all", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550326", "eventUri": "eng-9550326", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-09", "textStart": 199, "textEnd": 204}], "sentiment": 0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 175, "relevance": 1}

Can't have it both ways,\" they said.\n\nBut one woman, who gave her name as Tracy, said she was a fan and suggested public opinion was being manipulated by the media against Harry.\n\n\"At the end of the day, we don't know if there's any truth in what they've been saying. But if there's any truth in it, I think it's sad,\" she said.\n\nThe lack of meeting - even for a short time - has been interpreted as a snub for Harry, compounded by an announcement that Charles will appoint his elder son and heir Prince William as colonel-in-chief of Harry's old regiment.\n\nFormer army captain Harry served as a helicopter pilot with the Army Air Corps in Afghanistan.\n\nNo meeting is planned either with William, who is due on a visit to Cornwall in southwest England, and the Isles of Scilly on Thursday and Friday.\n\nWilliam's wife Catherine is also undergoing cancer treatment and has not made any public appearance since December last year.\n\nThe brothers, once close, are reportedly no longer on speaking terms due to Harry's criticisms of royal life in a succession of high-profile interviews, TV documentaries and his autobiography.\n\nAfter Harry's three-day visit, he is due to join Meghan on a trip to Nigeria.\n\nREAD MORE | Harry and Meghan's Nigerian visit: Roots inspire royal visit and future Invictus Games glory\n\nHarry, 39, was characterised by the British media as a \"party prince\", who had none of the responsibilities of William, 41, who will become king after Charles.\n\nBut since marrying Meghan, an American former television actress, and quitting royal life, he has faced a sustained backlash in the UK, led by the tabloid press.\n\nFormer Daily Mirror editor and CNN host Piers Morgan, one of the most vocal critics of the couple, said Charles had given \"a big regal middle finger to his treacherous younger son\".\n\n\"It's clear from his 'scheduling issue' that Charles would rather impale himself on a rusty sword than meet up with someone who has wrought such vengeful misery on the royal family for so many years now,\" he wrote in The Sun.", "source": {"uri": "news24.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "news24"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer", "type":

Photos from the event showed Harry with a big smile as he waved at the crowds. He looked dapper in a navy blue suit adorned with medals.\n\nHello Magazine's royal reporters attended the service on Wednesday, and shared that royal watchers were \"eager\" to see the prince's prodigal return. Following Harry's reading within the church, actor Damian Lewis recited the poem, \"Invictus\" by William Ernest Henley.\n\nHarry cofounded the Invictus Games in 2014. Wounded, injured and sick military personnel compete in multiple sports at the event. The most recent Invictus Games were held in Germany in September 2023.\n\nFollowing the anniversary celebration, Harry is set to travel to Nigeria with wife Meghan Markle. The couple, who tied the knot in May 2018 and are parents of son Archie, 5, and daughter Lilibet, 2, were invited by Nigeria's chief of defense staff in an effort to highlight the Invictus Games. \"The visit is to consolidate Nigeria's strong hold at the game and the possibility of hosting the event in later years,\" according to Brigadier General Tukur Gusau, Nigeria's acting director of defense information.\n\nPrince Harry and Meghan Markle's Charitable Work Throughout the Years\n\nAhead of Harry's trip to London, royal watchers wondered whether he would reunite with his father, King Charles III, who is battling cancer.\n\n\"In response to the many inquiries and continued speculation on whether or not the duke will meet with his father while in the U.K. this week, it unfortunately will not be possible due to His Majesty's full program,\" Harry's spokesperson told Us Weekly in a statement on Tuesday, May 7.\n\nPrince Harry's Ups and Downs With the Royal Family Over the Years\n\nAfter Buckingham Palace confirmed Charles' diagnosis in February, Harry rushed to the U.K. to be by his father's side, though their visit lasted less than an hour.\n\n\"I jumped on a plane and went to go see him as soon as I could,\" Harry explained to Good Morning America at the time. \"I love my family. The fact that I was able to get on a plane and go and see him and spend any time with him, I'm grateful for that.\"\n\nIn February, Buckingham Palace announced that Charles, 75, had \"commenced a schedule of regular treatments\" for cancer, during which time he had been \"advised by doctors to postpone public-facing duties.\"\n\nWhere Do Harry and Meghan Stand With William and Kate Amid Her Cancer Battle?\n\nCharles resumed his responsibilities in April with a visit to a specialist cancer center in London. Ahead of the engagement, the palace noted that the king's medical team was very \"encouraged by the progress\" he has made and \"remain positive\" about his recovery.\n\nAmid Charles' health battle, Princess Kate Middleton revealed in March that she was also diagnosed with cancer. She has retreated from the spotlight while undergoing preventative chemotherapy for her condition. While Harry and Meghan, 42, sent their well-wishes in a public statement at the time of Kate's announcement, the tension among the family still appears to be high.\n\n\"The Duke and Duchess [of Sussex] want to be super respectful and don't want to add stress to the situation,\" a source exclusively told Us Weekly earlier this month. \"If Will and Kate want their space, Meghan and Harry will give it to them.\"", "source": {"uri": "miamiherald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Miami Herald"}, "authors": [{"uri": "erin_crabtree@miamiherald.com", "name": "Erin Crabtree", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Harry,_Duke_of_Sussex", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invictus_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Invictus Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meghan,_Duchess_of_Sussex", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Meghan, Duchess of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Ernest_Henley", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "William Ernest Henley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_III_of_Spain", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Charles III of Spain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hello!_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hello!

Ahead, what would happen between Harry and his dad \"in a sensible world.\" Plus, how there's been a complete role reversal.\n\nHarry touched down in London, England, to mark 10 years of the Invictus Games with a bang. A rep for the Duke of Sussex confirmed on May 7, 2024, that Harry and his father would have no U.K. meeting.\n\n\"It, unfortunately, will not be possible due to His Majesty's full programme,\" Harry's spokesperson said (via ABC News). \"The Duke, of course, is understanding of his father's diary of commitments and various other priorities and hopes to see him soon.\"\n\nSo, what did the king have going on? A weekly audience with Britain's Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and Buckingham Palace's first garden party of the season.\n\nHarry traveled to London for the anniversary of the Invictus Games after celebrating his son Prince Archie's birthday. He then made the rounds at various events before attending a service at St. Paul's Cathedral on May 8, 2024.\n\nWhile Harry's statement had a dignified tone, \"we can deduce that their relationship is terminally damaged,\" Jennie Bond, a royal expert and former BBC commentator, said (via Express).\n\n\"In a sensible world, Harry would stay with his dad at Clarence House,\" she continued. \"They could have cozy chats in perfect privacy and with all the security Harry wants.\"\n\nAs for things between Harry and his older brother, Prince William, 41, it \"does appear to be a terminally damaged relationship.\"\n\n\"In a way, it seems the boot is now very much on the other foot,\" she said. \"Previously, it was Harry who was the 'victim' looking for an apology for all his perceived grievances. Now, those grievances must seem utterly trivial, even to Harry, in the face of a very real problem: cancer.\"\n\nThe king's been undergoing treatment since being diagnosed with an undisclosed type of cancer in February 2024. A month later, Kate announced she, too, had been diagnosed with an undisclosed form of cancer, for which she's getting preventative chemotherapy treatment.\n\n\"Kate and William are involved in a frightening fight.

I know you would have expected nothing less from us.\"\n\nAs King Charles attended a garden party roughly three miles away this evening, his younger son, Prince Harry, was at St. Paul's Cathedral -- interestingly, the location of Charles and Diana's wedding in 1981 -- to celebrate 10 years of the Invictus Games, Harry's passion project and the work of his life. The King turned down the opportunity to meet with Harry while his son was in the U.K., citing a busy schedule, Harry's spokesperson confirmed yesterday; no members of the royal family turned up to Harry's Service of Thanksgiving.\n\nBut then, the Spencer family swooped in. Diana was one of four Spencer siblings -- she had two older sisters, Sarah and Jane, and a younger brother, Charles. Hello reports that Jane (now Lady Jane Fellowes) and Charles (more formally, Earl Charles Spencer) were in attendance at Harry's service, and arrived together \"with the pair sharing a smile,\" the outlet reports. Sarah (now Lady Sarah McCorquodale) was also in attendance, Hello reports.\n\nWhen Harry arrived at St. Paul's, he too was smiling and \"waving at cheering members of the crowd that had amassed,\" Hello reports. Inside, 1,000 people gathered for the ceremony, and \"Harry was clearly buoyed by the show of support from Charles, Lady Sarah, and Lady Jane,\" the publication added.\n\nSpeaking to Hello about Harry's attendance at the service, David Wiseman, a former competitor in the Games, said \"We wouldn't be here without Prince Harry, would we? We wouldn't be here without his initial vision, without his drive, without his influence, without his ability to convene this international community of those who have served and continue to serve. And he's so passionate about serving that community. He's one of us -- he's part of this community, and we're incredibly proud to have him as part of it. We're delighted he's here to help us celebrate the past 10 years, and to look forward to the next 10 years.\"\n\nHarry founded the Games in 2014 as a multi-sport event for injured or sick service personnel, both veterans and those still actively serving. With no members of the royal family there and his wife, Meghan Markle, back at home in the U.S., \"fans had been worried Harry would be at the service alone,\" The Mirror reports -- but should feel hopeful that Harry did, indeed, have family there, after all. (Somewhere, surely, Diana is smiling.)\n\nOf the Games, Harry said this week \"Sometimes you...look back and go, 'Look at what we've done,'\" he said. \"But also, given the state of the world, there is so much more to do, and I think a lot of uncertainty -- but what we've created is a global community.\" When asked about the future of the Games, Harry confirmed they would continue so long as they \"serve their purpose,\" he said.\n\nHarry will next join up with Meghan in Nigeria, where they will discuss possible future opportunities for the country to host a future iteration of the Games.", "source": {"uri": "marieclaire.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Marie Claire"}, "authors": [{"uri": "rachel_burchfield@marieclaire.com", "name": "Rachel Burchfield", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Harry,_Duke_of_Sussex", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Spencer,_9th_Earl_Spencer", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Charles Spencer, 9th Earl Spencer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_Sarah_McCorquodale", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lady Sarah McCorquodale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diana,_Princess_of_Wales", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Diana, Princess of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_I_of_England", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Charles I of England"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hello!_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hello!

The dad of two even stopped to shake hands and make jokes with some of the people. Harry's public appearance came after his father turned down an opportunity for the two of them to visit while Harry was in the United Kingdom.\n\n\"In response to the many inquiries and continued speculation on whether or not the Duke will meet with his father while in the U.K. this week, it unfortunately will not be possible due to His Majesty's full program,\" a spokesperson for Harry said in a statement obtained by Page Six on Tuesday, May 7.\n\nHowever, the spokesperson added that Harry was \"understanding of his father's diary of commitments and various other priorities and hopes to see him soon.\"\n\nCharles has only recently returned to his public-facing duties after being diagnosed with cancer in February. The return to work has likely resulted in a busy schedule that didn't allow him to meet with his youngest son.\n\n\"His Majesty The King will shortly return to public-facing duties after a period of treatment and recuperation following his recent cancer diagnosis,\" a statement shared on April 26 revealed. \"To help mark this milestone, The King and Queen will make a joint visit to a cancer treatment centre next Tuesday, where they will meet medical specialists and patients. This visit will be the first in a number of external engagements His Majesty will undertake in the weeks ahead.\"\n\nOn top of being turned down for a meeting with his father, Harry learned that his brother, Prince William, and Charles have plans to attend an engagement next week where William, 41, will be made Colonel-in-Chief of the Army Air Corps, which is Harry's old regiment. Harry reportedly discovered the news only hours after landing in London on Tuesday, May 7.\n\n\"At the Army Aviation Centre in Middle Wallop, His Majesty The King will officially hand over the role of Colonel-in-Chief of the Army Air Corps to His Royal Highness The Prince of Wales,\" the statement from Buckingham Palace read.\n\nTensions between the royal family and Harry have been strained since he and wife Meghan Markle decided to step back from their royal duties in January 2020.

playing into Charles, but when I saw Harry this morning, I was very moved by the service and that's when I felt like, oh, God, it'd be good if they got to see each other.\"", "source": {"uri":

Across town shortly afterwards, the Duke of Sussex took his place at St Paul's Cathedral for a service celebrating 10 years of the Invictus Games.\n\nFather and son were less than three miles away from one another, but have never seemed further apart.\n\nAt the side of the King was a Royal family out in force: the Queen, the Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh, the Princess Royal and the Duke and Duchess of Gloucester all taking their place for the national anthem.\n\nThe Duke of Sussex arrived at his event alone.\n\nHowever, inside St Paul's Prince Harry had a team of his own in the shape of his maternal family. His uncle and aunt, Earl Spencer and Lady Jane Fellowes, there in support, greeted with emotional hugs.\n\nThey were joined by Mark Dyer, a former Army officer often described as a \"father figure\", Jamie Lowther-Pinkerton, a former private secretary to both Prince William and Prince Harry, and - in a sign of the times - David Sherborne, the Duke's barrister.\n\nOutside St Paul's, a crowd waited for a Prince Harry walkabout, taking selfies and clasping his hand as he made his way along.\n\nThe Prince of Wales did not attend either event, spending the morning holding a Windsor Castle investiture before returning home to his own family.\n\nThe separate outings show the state of the Royal family as it stands: Team Windsor on duty and an emerging Team Sussex elsewhere.\n\nIt was all a long way from scenes a decade ago, when Princes Charles, William and Harry celebrated the first Invictus Games in London with public appearances that saw them laughing, kissing on the cheek and sharing a joke looking at a phone screen.\n\nAt the 10th anniversary service on Wednesday, Prince Harry read 1 Corinthians 12: 4-11, to speak of \"service\" and the \"common good\".\n\nThe dean, the Very Rev Andrew Tremlett, gave a welcome hailing the tremendous achievements of the sick and injured military personnel from 23 nations who compete in the Games. Actor Damian Lewis, 53, recited the Invictus poem by William Henley.\n\nPrince Harry, who beamed and waved as he entered St Paul's, later joined Invictus competitors and staff for a reception in the cathedral's crypt. He spent the rest of the day in meetings with his remaining UK patronages.\n\nAt Buckingham Palace, in overlapping events, the King led the Royal family in the annual celebration of community service, his first garden party since his cancer diagnosis.\n\nAs he stood on the terrace with the Queen he heard a loud cheer at the end of the national anthem and waved his black top hat to acknowledge the crowd with thanks.\n\nWalking across the lawn, he shook hand after hand and answered the questions about his health repeatedly.\n\nOne guest told him he was \"looking so much better\". The King replied: \"I'm not doing badly.\"\n\n\"How are you feeling, Sir?\" one man asked, with the King saying \"Not too bad\" in response.\n\nThe King, wearing sunscreen in the heat, occasionally dabbed his nose with a handkerchief, but was described by an onlooker as seeming in excellent spirits, peppering guests with questions about where they had come from and what they did.\n\nIt is his next step towards resuming a regular programme of public activity, even as he continues his cancer treatment.\n\nAs such, the garden party, just like the Invictus service, should have been celebratory. Instead, the day was overshadowed somewhat by the rumbling question of the King and his younger son meeting. In the end, sources said, they did not.\n\nThe Duke had hoped for a meeting with his father before his trip to Britain, it is said, though recollections seem to vary once again as to whether a formal, timely request was made.\n\nEventually, as he landed on Tuesday morning, Harry's spokeswoman issued a written statement confirming that the King would be too busy to see his younger son. \"The Duke of course is understanding of his father's diary of commitments and various other priorities and hopes to see him soon,\" she said.\n\nA spokesman for the King said nothing.\n\nThose within the palace have privately raised the issue of trust, pointing to a King who has a lot on his plate.\n\nThe last time Prince Harry visited, for a 30-minute meeting shortly after the King was diagnosed with cancer, it was swiftly followed by an interview on US breakfast television.\n\nAt the time his actual words were received calmly back in Britain, but that he was open to being asked about it on Good Morning America did nothing to restore trust for future visits.\n\nThis week, within days, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex will arrive in Nigeria for a tour with all the attendant press and publicity that entails.\n\nThey are there in part to promote Invictus, in a country the Duchess has recently claimed a personal link to. She is, she said in a 2022 podcast, 43 per cent Nigerian according to a genealogy test.\n\nThe King, who is Head of Commonwealth but has not been able to travel overseas in 2024, will be kept informed of their activities.\n\nPerhaps on a different visit to the UK, when the Duke is not about to fly immediately into a high-profile, headline-grabbing Commonwealth tour, there will be time for father and son to talk quietly.\n\nThe explanation of being \"too busy\", volunteered by the Sussexes rather than the palace, has inevitably raised eyebrows. The King is busy, there is no doubting that, particularly as he navigates his return to public duty. The palace way of arranging meetings is formal, the lines of communication with the Sussexes limited. But where there's a will there's a way.\n\nIn February 2024, after his last visit to Britain, when asked whether it was possible that his father's illness would have a \"galvanising and sort of reunifying effect\" for his family, Prince Harry said: \"I'm sure.\"\n\nThree months on, another flying visit under his belt, and that dream is no closer to reality.\n\nThe gulf between Prince Harry and the King, in communication and expectation, seems no closer to being bridged.\n\nIt was not so long ago that another father and son had their differences aired; a young Prince Charles cast in the public imagination as the overly emotional son with a father who did not understand him.\n\n\"He's a romantic and I'm a pragmatist,\" Prince Philip once said of his eldest. \"That means we do see things differently.\"\n\nNo one would call the current King \"unfeeling\", as was said of his own late father. But perhaps, in all of this upset, he has found his inner pragmatist too.", "source": {"uri": "ca.style.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Prince Harry, 39, founded the adaptive sports tournament for service personnel and veterans in 2014, and the inaugural Invictus Games were held in London in September 2014.\n\nThe Duke of Sussex's latest trip to the U.K. was announced on April 28. He is due to deliver a reading as part of the program, while Homeland actor Damian Lewis will recite the poem \"Invictus.\"\n\nNotably, no other royal family members were expected to attend the service. Earlier this week, it was revealed that Harry wouldn't meet with his father Charles during his visit to the U.K. due to the monarch's \"full\" schedule.\n\nThe Service of Thanksgiving also coincided with the first garden party of the season at Buckingham Palace, which was attended by King Charles, Queen Camilla, Princess Anne, Prince Richard, and Birgitte, the Duchess of Gloucester.\n\nRelated: Meghan Markle Won't Join Prince Harry in the U.K. Next Month Before Heading to Nigeria Together\n\nThe \"Invictus\" poem by William Ernest Henley set to be read is full of meaning for the Invictus Games community. Invictus means \"unconquered\" in Latin, and the competition's motto \"I am\" comes from the poem published in 1888; it memorably ends with the lines, \"I am the master of my fate, I am the captain of my soul.\"\n\n\"The poem is a reminder that you have the power to take control of your life,\" Prince Harry told PEOPLE in 2022.\n\nThere happens to be a bust of Henley in the Crypt of St. Paul's Cathedral, where the service will bring together representatives from across the competition's participating nations, including members of the wounded, injured and sick service personnel and veteran community. Community members, supporters and beneficiaries will also give readings and participate in the program led by the Dean of St. Paul's, The Very Reverend Andrew Tremlett.\n\nHarry made the Invictus-focused trip to the U.K. without his wife, Meghan Markle, who will join him for the second leg of a trip abroad from their California home where they live with their children, Prince Archie, 5, and Princess Lilibet, 2. PEOPLE confirmed that the Duke and Duchess of Sussex have accepted an invitation to visit Nigeria on behalf of its Chief of Defense Staff, the highest-ranking military official, and the couple's visit there will also spotlight the Invictus Games.\n\nRelated: Meghan Markle and Prince Harry to Visit Nigeria in May for a Special Reason\n\nNigeria made its event debut at the latest Invictus Games in D\u00fcsseldorf, Germany in September 2023, where Prince Harry revealed in his opening ceremony speech that his wife was rooting for the team after discovering her Nigerian heritage.\n\nThe country's Minister of Defense, Alhaji Mohammed Abubakar Badaru also attended the tournament in Germany and has expressed willingness to host the games should Nigeria be granted the opportunity.\n\nThe D\u00fcsseldorf games marked Invictus' sixth cycle, following competitions in London (2014), Orlando (2016), Toronto (2017), Sydney (2018) and The Hague (2022, bumped from 2020 due to the coronavirus pandemic). The next event is set for Vancouver and Whistler, Canada, in 2025, which will mark the debut of winter sports -- some of which the Duke of Sussex personally tried during the One Year to Go countdown event in Canada in February.\n\nCan't get enough of PEOPLE's Royals coverage? Sign up for our free Royals newsletter to get the latest updates on Kate Middleton, Meghan Markle and more!\n\nWhile speaking to PEOPLE in 2022, Prince Harry credited the Invictus community as \"a major part of my growth and learning.\"\n\n\"Creating the Games involved listening to military and veteran families -- and hearing directly from them about their lives -- and that offered so much perspective. It's been a lesson in serving a purpose greater than ourselves, and the benefit that comes from that extends to both the individual and the community\" the Duke of Sussex said at the thime. \"I truly believe that we are at our best when we're in service to others, and Invictus is all about upholding that value.\"\n\nFor more People news, make sure to sign up for our newsletter!\n\nRead the

Not a single senior member of the family attended a church service on Wednesday, at London's St. Paul's Cathedral, honoring the tenth anniversary of the Invictus Games, as the King was holding at the same time a palace garden party, which the senior royals - with the exception of Harry's brother, Prince William and his wife, Princess Katherine, who is being treated for cancer - were reportedly ordered to attend.\n\nThe lack of a meeting with King Charles, is \"quite a snub,\" a royal expert, Michael Cole, said per the Daily Mail.\n\n\"For the King to not see his younger son, Prince Harry, although the two men will be only two miles apart tomorrow afternoon, gives an indication of the depth of the divide,\" he said.\n\nThe King's non-meeting with Harry comes despite Charles undergoing treatments for an undisclosed form of cancer, and only recently resuming some public duties, amid reports that the cancer is serious and that the King's health is \"not good.\" At Wednesday's garden party, however, the King looked hale and happily greeted members of the public who'd been invited onto the palace grounds.\n\nThe royal snub is the latest setback for Prince Harry and his wife, Meghan Markle, the Duchess of Sussex, who for the last four years have been feuding bitterly with their family. Since January 2020, when they announced on Instagram that they are \"stepping back\" from their duties as senior royals and moving to North America, Meghan and Harry have lobbed bomb after bomb at the Windsors, in interviews, in books written by a sympathetic journalist, in documentaries and in Harry's biting bestselling memoir, \"Spare\".\n\nThe couple's face to face interactions with the other royals, necessitated by various must-attend events such as the funerals of Prince Philip and Queen Elizabeth, and Charles' coronation, have been limited and strained. On his current visit to London, Harry is not expected to see anyone from his family.\n\nThe Duke is staying at a hotel during his visit to London, having not been offered a place to stay at his family's many residences, according to GB News. According to the news outlet, he was refused a bed at Windsor Castle last September, with the palace citing \"lack of notice\" as a reason. Last year, the King asked Harry and Meghan to vacate Frogmore Cottage, their residence on the grounds of the Windsor Estate, which they'd previously been using as a place to stay during trips to England from their home in Montecito, California.\n\nPrince Harry's last trip to the UK was in February to see his father after the announcement of his cancer diagnosis. That whirlwind visit, as the Sun reported, had the royal rift on full display, as Prince Harry was only allowed to see his father for less than an hour, in the presence of his stepmother, Queen Consort Camilla, whom Harry had criticized in \"Spare\", accusing her of \"dangerous\" leaks to the media. Notably, Harry on that visit did not meet with his brother, the Prince of Wales, from whom he may be permanently estranged, according to People magazine.\n\nDuring Harry's current trip to London, Meghan is again staying home in Montecito with their two young children. The Duchess is said to be facing a \"tough\" challenge to sell her new lifestyle brand, American Riviera Orchard, to the British public.\n\nThe Duchess recently rolled out the business, which sells products meant to provide a taste of her luxurious Montecito lifestyle, by putting on the market high end jams that are supposed to reflect her sensibility and good taste. In recent weeks, she is reported to have sent jars of her new strawberry jam to celebrities including Kris Jenner, Chrissy Teigen, and Mindy Kaling in an aggressive marketing push.\n\nFor the UK rollout of American Riviera Orchard, Meghan has hired a new communications officer, according to The Telegraph. The public relations executive, The Telegraph reports, has the challenge of solving the problem of \"Meghan's appalling public image.\"\n\nThe challenge, PR expert Mark Borkowski told The Telegraph, is \"one of the most difficult jobs in PR.... second only perhaps to doing PR for Prince Andrew,\" the King's disgraced younger brother.\n\nHarry's current visit to London is expected to be a short one. He and Meghan are expected soon in Nigeria for an unofficial royal visit. On her podcast recently, Meghan said she is \"43 percent Nigerian.\"", "source": {"uri": "nysun.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Sun"}, "authors": [{"uri": "maggie_hroncich@nysun.com",

The official handover ceremony is slated for May 13 at the Army Aviation Centre in Middle Wallop.\n\nThe Palace's statement reads: \"His Majesty The King will officially pass on the role of Colonel-in-Chief of the Army Air Corps to His Royal Highness The Prince of Wales.\"\n\nIt continued: \"In August 2023, following His Majesty's Accession, the King was pleased to announce military appointments, including that the Prince of Wales would become Colonel-in-Chief of the Army Air Corps.

If it was handled in private without so much press speculation, it would have a better chance of being resolved.\"\n\nMichael Cole echoed this sentiment, describing it as \"quite a snub.\" He continued: \"For the King to not see his younger son, Prince Harry, although the two men will be only two miles apart tomorrow afternoon, indicates the depth of the divide.\"\n\nCole described it as a \"royal flea in the ear for the fifth in line to the throne,\" adding: \"Even Prince Harry, never the sharpest sword in the Household Cavalry, is bound to have got the message and many people will say, \"About time too.\"\n\nThe Waleses And The Sussexes Are Reportedly 'Open' To A 'Truce'\n\nWilliam and Kate have been at loggerheads with Harry and Meghan after they were left feeling \"betrayed\" by claims made in Harry's record-breaking memoir \"Spare.\"\n\nHowever, a source speaking to US Weekly revealed that the Prince and Princess of Wales want a \"truce\" and are \"open\" to reconciling with the Duke and Duchess of Sussex.\n\nThe source explained that William and Kate are considering mending their broken relationship with Harry and his wife because of their children, as they don't want their feud to be passed on to the next generation.\n\nThe source stated, \"They want a relationship with Meghan and Harry, and they don't want the acrimony to carry over to the next generation.\"\n\nThe insider added that Meghan and Harry feel the same way: \"Obviously, the Duke and Duchess want their kids to have a relationship with their cousins.\"", "source": {"uri":

Inside the event, Harry took his seat next to Mark, who has been very close to Harry following the tragic death of Princess Diana.\n\nAlso at the Invictus event were Diana's siblings Lady Jane Fellowes and Earl Spencer. Harry was greeted by the Dean of St Paul's as he made his way up the steps before being escorted to his seat. Mark's support of Harry comes after the Duke of Sussex was snubbed by his father King Charles.\n\nFor all the latest on news, politics, sports, and showbiz from the USA, go to The Mirror US.\n\nREAD MORE: Prince Harry wears medal 'awarded for service to the monarchy' after King Charles snub\n\nMark Dyer was seen arriving at St Paul's Cathedral He's been supporting Prince Harry\n\nHarry had hoped to visit Charles during his visit, but it was announced the monarch was too busy. A spokesperson for Harry said: \"In response to the many inquiries and continued speculation on whether or not the Duke will meet with his father while in the UK this week, it unfortunately will not be possible due to His Majesty's full programme. The Duke of course is understanding of his father's diary of commitments and various other priorities and hopes to see him soon.\"\n\nMark, nicknamed Marko, served Charles until the late 1990s, and acted as a mentor to Harry and his brother Prince William after their mother's death in 1997. Writing in his memoir Spare, Harry admitted he was initially mesmerised by Mark, who had the same ginger hair he did.\n\n\"I was a ginger, self-conscious about it, but Marko was an extreme ginger and owned it. I gawped at him and thought: teach me to be like that,\" he wrote.\n\nThe Duke of Sussex is very close with his 'second dad'\n\nHe also revealed in his memoir that Mark was there for the important moments in his life, and was even sent by Charles to speak to Harry about the negative headlines he racked up during his teenage years. The father-of-two recalled Mark met him in a caf\u00e9 to scold him over his drug-taking, and Mark took him to visit a residential centre for drug users in south London in an effort to make him see the error of his ways.\n\nIt was also Mark who warned Harry to never talk about his mother Diana in interviews, at the insistence of his father Charles. \"Pa was dead-set against me addressing that topic; he didn't want either of his sons speaking about Mummy, for fear it would cause a stir, distract from his work, and perhaps shine an unflattering light on Camilla,\" he wrote.\n\nAfter he left school, Harry and Mark embarked on a gap year together, travelling to Australia, Argentina and Lesotho, and the pair are said to still be close. Harry was an usher at Mark's wedding to Amanda Kline in 2010 in Wales, while Harry asked Mark to serve as an usher at his own wedding in 2018. Mark's son Jasper, who has the Duke as his godfather, also served as a page boy at the Duke and Duchess of Sussex's star-studded wedding in 2018. Mark was later asked by the couple to be godfather to their firstborn Archie in 2019.\n\n* Follow Mirror Celebs on TikTok, Snapchat, Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, YouTube and Threads.", "source":

Although the King's calendar was fully booked to set up a meeting with Prince Harry, a friend of the monarch has revealed the real reason why the father-son reunion didn't happen.\n\nA friend of King Charles told The Daily Beast that the king won't see Prince Harry due to his \"cruel\" remarks about Queen Camilla in his bombshell memoir, Spare. \"Harry has made things very difficult for himself by saying such cruel and hurtful things about Camilla,\" the friend revealed.\n\n\"Charles loves his sons, but he also loves his wife. The last few months have made it very clear how important she is; she has been the one propping up the whole edifice,\" the friend continued, adding, \"Harry has made it very clear, very publicly, that he despises her. He has forced Charles to choose, which was a very silly thing to do because Camilla and he both chose each other a long time ago.\"\n\n\"William had his reservations but he accepted his father's choice and got on with it.

at the cathedral on Wednesday, the Prince was met by his aunt and uncle on Diana's side.\n\nCharles Spencer and Lady Jane Fellowes embraced Harry inside the anniversary event.\n\nPrince Harry was reportedly hoping his American wife and the couple's two children would join him in the UK for the anniversary service, but Meghan Markle allegedly turned her husband down.\n\nRoyal expert Richard Fitzwilliams said the Duchess of Sussex made the right decision.\n\n\"Meghan has wisely decided that a hostile press and public would prefer her to stay away from the Service at St Paul's to

The King was spotted mingling with over 8,000 guests at the party, located just over two miles from where Harry was scheduled to attend a thanksgiving service marking the 10th anniversary of the Invictus Games at St Paul's Cathedral.\n\nQueen Camilla was by his side, and other working royals including Princess Anne, the Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh, Edward and Sophie, as well as the Duke and Duchess of Gloucester, were also present, making it a grand royal gathering. Interestingly, the only current working royal not present was Prince William, who was busy conducting an investiture ceremony at Windsor Castle earlier in the day.\n\nCharles, who donned a grey suit and light blue waistcoat, was seen smiling at the crowds as he entered the garden with the Queen. He removed his black top hat during the national anthem and the crowds in the Buckingham Palace garden erupted into cheers as the song concluded, prompting Charles to joyfully wave his hat, reports the Mirror.\n\nOn the same day, Harry attended St Paul's Cathedral for the Invictus Games service after it was confirmed he wouldn't be seeing his father during the flying UK visit. The father-son pair last met in February when Charles announced his cancer battle and Harry rushed home from California to see him.\n\nThere were high hopes of a reunion between the somewhat estranged pair during Harry's current jaunt across the pond but a spokesperson for our favourite Royal redhead was quick to nip that in the bud. They said in a statement: \"In response to the many inquiries and continued speculation on whether or not the duke will meet with his father while in the UK this week, it unfortunately will not be possible due to His Majesty's full programme.\n\n\"The duke of course is understanding of his father's diary of commitments and various other priorities and hopes to see him soon.\"\n\nCharle's and Harry's relationship has been known to be frosty since Harry gave up royal duties and moved stateside with his wife Meghan Markle and two children, Prince Archie and Princess Lilibet. However, during an interview with Good Morning America, Harry hinted at a possible thaw due to Charles' illness.\n\nWhen asked if family sickness could have a \"reunifying effect\", the Duke of Sussex replied: \"Yeah, I'm sure.\" Harry spent Tuesday, May 7 in London, attending a summit that marked the 10th anniversary of the Invictus Games, an event that organises sports competitions for wounded, sick or injured veterans and serving military personnel to aid their recovery.\n\nCharles' appearance at the Buckingham Palace garden party is a way of expressing gratitude to those who have served communities, charities, the military and other organisations. This comes after he resumed public duties last week following his cancer diagnosis earlier this year.\n\nJust last week, he expressed his 'shock' upon learning about his cancer diagnosis during a visit to a cancer centre. The King openly discussed his experience of being informed about his disease when he visited the University College Hospital Macmillan Cancer Centre in central London.\n\nHere, he learned about the latest treatments and had conversations with staff providing pioneering care. When asked about his health, he reassured everyone by saying: \"I'm well.\"\n\nThe King's schedule of events won't be as packed as a typical summer programme, and his attendance will be announced closer to the time and will be \"subject to doctors' advice\". Necessary adjustments will be made to minimise risk to the King's recovery.\n\nIt's believed that the warmer weather could facilitate outdoor events, reducing the risks that many cancer patients encounter from others. A palace spokesperson also shared: \"The pacing of the King's programme will be carefully calibrated as his recovery continues, in close consultation with his medical team.\"", "source": {"uri": "ok.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "ok"}, "authors": [{"uri": "amy_jones@ok.co.uk", "name": "Amy Jones", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "jennifer_newton@ok.co.uk", "name": "Jennifer Newton", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_I_of_England", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Charles I of England"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invictus_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Invictus Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckingham_Palace", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Buckingham Palace"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William,_Prince_of_Wales", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "William, Prince of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Paul's_Cathedral", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "St Paul's Cathedral"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophie,_Duchess_of_Edinburgh", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sophie, Duchess of Edinburgh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_Camilla", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Queen Camilla"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Harry,_Duke_of_Sussex", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_royal_family", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "British royal family"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duke_of_Gloucester", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Duke of Gloucester"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windsor_Castle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Windsor Castle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investiture", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Investiture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anne,_Princess_Royal", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anne, Princess Royal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_II", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Elizabeth II"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meghan,_Duchess_of_Sussex", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Meghan, Duchess of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_anthem", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National anthem"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Archie_of_Sussex", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prince Archie of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princess_Lilibet_of_Sussex", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Princess Lilibet of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_College_Hospital", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "University College Hospital"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_London", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Central London"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Morning_America", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Good Morning America"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Genealogy/Royalty", "label": "dmoz/Society/Genealogy/Royalty", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History/Historical_Personages", "label": "dmoz/Society/History/Historical Personages", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://i2-prod.ok.co.uk/incoming/article32765521.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_King-Charles-III-and-Queen-Camilla.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550326", "eventUri": "eng-9550326", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-08", "textStart": 133, "textEnd": 138}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-07", "textStart": 2542, "textEnd": 2547}], "sentiment": 0.3254901960784313, "wgt": 172, "relevance": 1}

The Games - for injured servicemen and women - was founded by Harry in 2014.\n\nHowever, Harry returned to Britain solo as his wife Meghan, 42, and two children - Archie, five, and Lilibet, two, - remained in the US.\n\nAccording to a body language expert though, Harry was \"loving\" being back on UK soil.\n\nSpeaking on behalf of Betfair Slots, body language expert Darren Stanton revealed to us: \"When Harry is attending an event alongside Meghan, he tends to go into protective mode.\n\n\"At times, he can get quite flustered because he's trying to make sure Meghan is ok. It comes from a place of care towards her. You'll see that he gets red and his breathing increases.\n\n\"However, when he's on his own, he's only got himself to worry about. He's a lot more relaxed, his breathing is a lot slower and his shoulders are down.\"\n\nDarren continued: \"Looking at the photos of him in London, Harry's face isn't flushed, his breathing is slower and he appears completely in control.\n\n\"I also didn't see any pacifying gestures, like putting his hands in his pocket or biting his lip. The Invictus Games is very much Harry's baby, so it's business as usual for him. He's there to promote the project and sees it as a really big occasion.\"\n\nHowever, when he's on his own, he's only got himself to worry about.\n\nThe expert said Harry was the \"centre of attention at the event, which he loved\". He added: \"Physically and psychologically, we don't see anything negative with Harry. He's loving being back in the UK and catching up with people, looking calm and relaxed.\"\n\nAs Harry arrived for the thanksgiving service on Wednesday, he was reportedly met with cheers from the crowd.\n\nAlthough Harry was back in his home country, the Duke of Sussex didn't meet with his father King Charles or brother Prince William.\n\nA rep for Harry said this was due to the monarch's busy schedule - and it was something the Duke of Sussex understood.\n\n\"The Duke of course is understanding of his father's diary of commitments and various other priorities and hopes to see him soon,\" said the rep.\n\nThis month will also see Harry and wife Meghan travel to Nigeria. In a statement, the country's acting director of defense information, Tukur Gusau, said: \"The Defense Headquarters has expressed its honour and delight for the acceptance of the Duke of Sussex, Prince Harry, and his wife, the Duchess of Sussex, Meghan, to visit Nigeria in May 2024.\n\n\"The visit is to consolidate Nigeria's stronghold at the Games and the possibility of hosting the event in later years.\"", "source": {"uri": "entertainmentdailyuk.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Entertainment Daily"}, "authors": [{"uri": "rebecca_carter@entertainmentdailyuk.com", "name": "Rebecca Carter", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Harry,_Duke_of_Sussex", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invictus_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Invictus Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princess_Lilibet_of_Sussex", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Princess Lilibet of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meghan,_Duchess_of_Sussex", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Meghan, Duchess of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Paul's_Cathedral", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "St Paul's Cathedral"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William,_Prince_of_Wales", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "William, Prince of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_I_of_England", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Charles I of England"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/General_Merchandise/O", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/General Merchandise/O", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://cdn.entertainmentdaily.com/2024/05/09142149/Harry-Meghan-2.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550326", "eventUri": "eng-9550326", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.03529411764705881, "wgt": 172, "relevance": 1}

He was joined at the St. Paul's Cathedral service of thanksgiving by Princess Diana's siblings, Charles Spencer and Lady Jane Fellowes, but there were no representatives of the Windsor side of his family, though Harry started the Games while he was still a full-time royal. Instead King Charles III opened the season's first Buckingham Palace garden party while Prince William hosted an investiture at Windsor Castle. People reported that Harry invited his father and brother but they declined to attend.\n\nThe magazine added that the brothers are still estranged, despite Kate Middleton's recent cancer diagnosis, and that William is leaning on Middleton's tight-knit family for support. Royal author Ingrid Seward told the magazine that Harry's absence has increased the pressure William was under while both his wife and father were ailing. \"William would have always imagined he would have Harry alongside him. Going forward, that puts responsibility more on William and his family,\" Seward said. \"There is no one else to take the slack.\"\n\nOne day after Charles publicly announced his diagnosis in February, Harry traveled to England for a short meeting with his father. Despite the visit, the Daily Mail's Richard Eden reports that there is a chill between the pair. \"He doesn't need the drama in his life,\" a friend of the king told Eden. \"Harry and Meghan have brought him, and the rest of the family, nothing but worries over the past few years.\"\n\nEarlier this week, a spokesperson for Harry announced that he wouldn't be visiting with his father during his trip to celebrate the Invictus Games' milestone. \"In response to the many inquiries and continued speculation on whether or not The Duke will meet with his father while in the U.K. this week, it unfortunately will not be possible due to His Majesty's full program,\" the spokesperson said. \"The Duke of course is understanding of his father's diary of commitments and various other priorities and hopes to see him soon.\"", "source": {"uri": "vanityfair.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Vanity Fair"}, "authors": [{"uri": "erin_vanderhoof@vanityfair.com", "name": "Erin Vanderhoof", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Harry,_Duke_of_Sussex", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invictus_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Invictus Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diana,_Princess_of_Wales", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Diana, Princess of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Paul's_Cathedral", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "St Paul's Cathedral"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William,_Prince_of_Wales", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "William, Prince of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windsor_Castle", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Windsor Castle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jane_Fellowes,_Lady_Fellowes", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jane Fellowes, Lady Fellowes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Spencer,_9th_Earl_Spencer", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Charles Spencer, 9th Earl Spencer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catherine,_Princess_of_Wales", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Catherine, Princess of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_III_of_Spain", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Charles III of Spain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Eden", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Eden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investiture", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Investiture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckingham_Palace", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Buckingham Palace"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Mail", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Daily Mail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Genealogy/Royalty", "label": "dmoz/Society/Genealogy/Royalty", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Large_Families", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Large Families", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Publications", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Publications", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Family_Resources_and_Support", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Family Resources and Support", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 49}], "image": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/663d0a31652243df3f9b613f/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/prince-harry-invictus-games.jpg?mbid=social_retweet", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550326", "eventUri": "eng-9550326", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.01960784313725483, "wgt": 171, "relevance": 1}

The event, held at London's St Paul's Cathedral, saw Harry, 39, make a rare public appearance in his home country. His strained relationship with his family garnered significant attention as he appeared alone at the event.\n\nThe younger son of King Charles, Harry currently resides in California with his wife Meghan and their two children.His recent memoir, interviews, and TV documentaries have contributed to his estrangement from other members of the royal family, as he openly criticized both them and the institution itself.\n\nDespite a brief reunion with his father, King Charles, following the announcement of the monarch's cancer diagnosis in February, there are no plans for the father and son to meet during Harry's latest trip to the UK. A spokesperson for Harry, the Duke of Sussex, cited the king's busy schedule as the reason for the missed opportunity, saying that Harry understands his father's commitments and priorities.\n\nWhile Harry attended the Invictus Games service at St Paul's Cathedral, King Charles hosted the first annual garden party at Buckingham Palace, accompanied by other senior royals. Additionally, the king was scheduled to carry out engagements at a military training base the following day.\n\nHarry's presence at the service marked the sole royal figure in attendance, highlighting his association with the international sporting event he founded in 2014 for wounded military personnel. He arrived at the cathedral alone, greeted by a crowd outside, and was scheduled to provide a reading during the service. Actor Damian Lewis also participated, reciting a poem to the congregation, which included veterans and wounded service personnel.\n\nFollowing his departure from Britain, Harry will be joined by Meghan for a visit to Nigeria. Meghan did not accompany Harry on his trip to London.\n\n(With agency inputs)\n\nAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

Upon his arrival in London, it became known that King Charles would not be able to meet with his son, despite speculation suggesting otherwise in preceding weeks.\n\nShortly thereafter, Buckingham Palace made public that the King would bestow a military honour upon the Prince of Wales, a recognition previously assumed to be destined for the Duke of Sussex.\n\nPrince William has been appointed as the colonel-in-chief of the Army Air Corp, the regiment with which Prince Harry served during his time in Afghanistan.\n\nRoyal expert and author Tom Quinn exclusively told The Mirror: \"King Charles' announcement that Prince Harry is being stripped of his role as Colonel-in-Chief of the Army Air Corps is a real kick in the teeth for the son who always felt marginalised and underrated.\n\n\"What makes it much worse is that the role is being given to the very man who Harry sees as the cause of so many of his problems - his brother. And the announcement was deliberately made during Harry's brief visit to the UK to have maximum impact - it shows Harry that he really is no longer welcome.\"\n\nMr Quinn claimed that the senior royals \"knew\" that the announcement would \"really hurt\" Harry, before revealing that \"he is said to have been in tears when he heard\".

On Wednesday, the Duke of Sussex attended the Invictus Games Foundation's 10th Anniversary celebration at St Paul's Cathedral in London. The event was similar to the Paralympics but catered toward wounded servicemen and women, as well as veterans. While many hoped the U.K. event would bring some royals out, outside of the Duke of Sussex, none were in attendance. He did, however, have support from Princess Diana's family.\n\nMany royal fans hoped for some kind of family reunion between Harry and his estranged brother, Prince William, and his father, King Charles, who is currently ill with cancer. While no senior royals appeared in support of Harry and the Invictus Games, he did have family members there for him.\n\nTwo of Princess Diana's siblings -- Charles Spencer and Lady Jane Fellowes -- attended, as well as three of Harry's cousins -- Lara Spencer, Louis Spencer, and George McCorquodale.\n\nThe family members could be seen greeting one another outside the church. Once inside, Harry sported a huge smile as he greeted his relatives, appearing comfortable and at ease.\n\nAhead of the trip, a spokesperson for Prince Harry confirmed to Huff Post that there would be no meeting between father and son.\n\nIn response to the many inquiries and continued speculation on whether or not The Duke will meet with his father while in the UK this week, it unfortunately will not be possible due to His Majesty's full programme. The Duke of course is understanding of his father's diary of commitments and various other priorities and hopes to see him soon.\n\nOf course, it's disappointing to see another opportunity where the family could, in theory, get together, but they have been unable to make it happen. It comes amid a difficult time for the royal family, both internally and on the world stage. It's hard to say what happens as time passes, but it's clear that many in the U.K. do wish for a moment of reconciliation and peace between members of the family.", "source": {"uri": "thenerdstash.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Nerd Stash"}, "authors": [{"uri": "angela_andaloro@thenerdstash.com", "name": "Angela Andaloro", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William,_Prince_of_Wales", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "William, Prince of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Harry,_Duke_of_Sussex", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_I_of_England", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Charles I of England"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invictus_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Invictus Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diana,_Princess_of_Wales", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Diana, Princess of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Paul's_Cathedral", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "St Paul's Cathedral"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sussex", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sussex"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Spencer,_9th_Earl_Spencer", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Charles Spencer, 9th Earl Spencer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_Jane_Grey", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lady Jane Grey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lara_Spencer", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lara Spencer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_royal_family", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "British royal family"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Genealogy/Royalty", "label": "dmoz/Society/Genealogy/Royalty", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Marriage", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Marriage", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Monarchy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Monarchy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 76}], "image": "https://media.thenerdstash.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Prince-Harry-Princess-Diana.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550326", "eventUri": "eng-9550326", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3019607843137255, "wgt": 171, "relevance": 1}

Instead of attending the Service of Thanksgiving at St. Paul's Cathedral, the King was a few miles away at a garden party, as royal experts say that, had he really wanted to, Charles could have made his busy schedule work to fit in time with Harry.\n\nAs with anything, it's more complicated than it seems, apparently. Marie Claire previously reported that the last time Harry was in the U.K. -- back in February, when he flew to London to see his father within hours of the King announcing he had been diagnosed with cancer on February 5 -- it was Queen Camilla, Harry's stepmother, who kept the visit so short while at Clarence House. Despite flying approximately 11,000 miles roundtrip from Los Angeles to London and back, Harry only spent about 30 minutes with his father at Charles and Camilla's home in London, as Charles had just started cancer treatment the day before.\n\n\"The Queen was with the King,\" royal biographer Robert Jobson said, per The Sun. \"Let's be honest -- he [Harry] wasn't too complimentary about Queen Camilla in his book, Spare. He wasn't very complimentary about her on Netflix [in his Harry & Meghan docuseries]. They don't get on.\" Jobson added, \"Second, there's not been a lot of contact. That brings its own level of complexity and drama which he [the King] doesn't need at the moment.\" The King \"gave him [Harry] long enough for a kiss and a hug and wished him all the best,\" Jobson said.\n\nThis week marks Harry's first time back in the U.K. since that quick trip in early February, and royal expert Charlotte Griffiths said on GB News that Charles' refusal to meet up with Harry was decided after Harry apparently made \"certain demands\" that couldn't be met, The Mirror reports. These \"difficult\" negotiations seem to surround who could be in the room for the father and son meeting -- namely Camilla, who Charles wanted in the room but Harry did not. \"We know that Charles likes to meet Harry with Camilla in the room, which isn't always a popular decision,\" Griffiths said. \"Harry was without his wife as well, so this was fraught with difficulty.\" (Meghan Markle isn't in the U.K. with Harry, but will meet up with him in Nigeria later on.)\n\nGriffiths also suggested on GB News that \"other forces\" may have driven Charles' decision about meeting up with Harry, including -- you guessed it -- Prince William. \"William may have had a thought about how this meeting should be conducted or whether it should be conducted at all,\" she said.\n\nA source told Russell Myers, royal editor of The Mirror, that when it comes to William and Harry, \"Their relationship remains extremely fractured,\" they said. \"Harry has privately expressed a wish to sit down with his brother, but now is not the time.\" It should be noted that this is Harry's first visit back to his home country since his sister-in-law, the Princess of Wales, announced publicly on March 22 that she too had been diagnosed with cancer; there are apparently no plans for the two, once so close, to meet.\n\nEarlier today, Harry was leaving an event in Central London and was headed for his car when a waiting cameraman asked him \"Are you happy to be home?\" Because of all of the above and so much more, it was about as loaded a question as it gets, and Harry's response is telling: per The Daily Express, he laughed and quickly replied \"Nice to see you\" before hopping into the back of his black Range Rover.", "source": {"uri": "marieclaire.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Marie

Really?", "body": "Father and son haven't seen each other in three months, but the prince's spokesperson says \"His Majesty's full program\" is keeping them apart.\n\nPrince Harry is back in London -- and, predictable as Big Ben tolling the hour, Royal Family drama has followed in his black Range Rover's wake.\n\nDid King Charles snub his son by refusing to see him? Is Harry manipulating the facts purely to make his family look bad, knowing they'll never exercise their public right of reply? And where on Earth is Meghan Markle?!\n\n\u00d7\n\nAlready a Subscriber? Sign in You are logged in Switch accounts\n\nThat last bit of the tittle-tattle kerfuffle is the easiest to answer: Meghan Markle is still in California, although she'll be joining Harry later this week in Nigeria, where the government has invited them on a series of private visits related to how the African country is using sport to aid their military with physical and emotional recovery. (This is in connection to the couple's work with Harry's Invictus Games and not, say, the \"pseudo royal tour\" their detractors have accused them of embarking on.)\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nAs for the rest of it, however, Harry's 48 hours in his home country have seemingly stirred up the waters of royal rancour once more, bringing the family's private chasm firmly back into the public conversation.\n\nWhether any of this is Harry's doing, of course, is up for debate. On one hand, he's in the U.K. in a capacity entirely unrelated to his family, attending a celebration marking 10 years of the Invictus Games, a charity he founded off the back of his own experiences as a soldier in his pre-working royal youth. (Yes, the founding money came from the Royal Foundation and the U.K. Defense Ministry, but the star power and clear commitment to his fellow veterans that have made this thing a success, even 10 years later, has to be credited to Harry.)\n\nOn the flip side, it was his spokesperson who took the speculation around whether Harry would meet with his father while in the country and put it into the official record.\n\n\"In response to the many inquiries and continued speculation on whether or not the Duke will meet with his father while in the U.K. this week, it unfortunately will not be possible due to His Majesty's full program,\" the Sussex spokesperson said. \"The Duke of course is understanding of his father's diary of commitments and various other priorities and hopes to see him soon.\"\n\nDid Harry really need to publicly address this? Could it not have been left as a private matter between family members, and the speculators left to wonder until they're blue in the face? It's hard to take this statement -- and the gracious light in which it seeks to paint Harry, the olive-branch-extending son rebuffed by his cold, work-obsessed father -- as anything other than point-scoring and hornets-nest poking.\n\nEqually, it could just be a bit of proactive, protective PR, a move to shut down all the speculation about this family, try to shift some of the focus onto the Invictus Games and head off the inevitable accusations of how dreadful, what an utter ingrate, he is when it emerges that he did not see his dad while he was in London.\n\nSimilarly, you could see his mention of his father's dedication to his duty as King, newly back in front of the public after being sidelined by cancer treatment, as an attempt to recast what seems to be Charles's very deliberate snub of his son in a kinder light.\n\nDoes the fact that Harry announced, on stage at an Invictus event on Tuesday, that he was having dinner with an old friend that evening have anything to do with this? Well, per some quarters, it was a desperate attempt to make sure nobody pictured him alone and pathetic in his hotel room, a man who'd been so terrible to his family that they couldn't even stomach dinner with him. Or, maybe, the friend in question was involved in the Invictus Games and the remark made sense in the context of the conversation.\n\nAnd then, a fourth data point equally open to interpretation: On the eve of Harry's visit, the palace announced a father-son engagement for Charles and William next week, a symbolic handing over of an honourary military title.\n\nBut wait, the plot thickened yesterday! The producers of The Crown couldn't have scripted it any better: At St Paul's Cathedral, we had Prince Harry, who arrived to cheering crowds outside the abbey where his parents were married, spotted warmly greeting his mother's brother and sister.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nWhile, just a few miles away at Buckingham Palace, we had the first garden party of the year, the King and Queen Camilla surrounded by most of the working royals -- like Princess Anne, fresh of a plane from a trip to British Columbia; Edward and Sophie; B-tier cousins the Gloucesters -- chatting to members of the public in the bright spring sunshine like there was nowhere they'd rather be.\n\nWhen you cut from one to the other, fascinating details emerge. There's Harry, for example, seen sporting his military medals, something that has been interpreted as a dig at his dad, who denied him the right to wear his military uniform to the coronation. Or, he's a military vet at a military event!\n\nThe strong showing from his mother's family can also be seen two ways: There's the crowd on the internet hailing them as Harry's \"true family,\" harking back to the blistering eulogy that his uncle gave at Diana's funeral, seeming to call out the royals for the way they treated her, and pledging to look after her sons on her behalf. Alternately, the Spencers and Harry arguably occupy similar places in the royal periphery now, benefitting from the attention their proximity to the Windsors gives them. See: Harry's uncle Charles Spencer, whose recent (very moving, very tough to read) memoir was widely publicized as \"Princess Diana's brother's book.\" Not his fault, necessarily, but it certainly didn't hurt. As, likewise, popping up into the public conscience as the family members who stood by Harry when even his own brother or father couldn't be bothered to come out and support him.\n\nThe other end of the narrative spectrum on this is that Charles has very deliberately made a public show of snubbing Harry, and has no problem if the world thinks that he is being unnecessarily cruel to his son.\n\n\"'He doesn't need the drama in his life,\" a \"friend\" of the King and queen told the Daily Mail. \"Harry and Meghan have brought him, and the rest of the family, nothing but worries over the past few years.\" Another of these pals told the tabloid, \"Frankly speaking, Harry and Meghan are a painful distraction that he could do without.\" (If it wasn't clear whose side the Mail is on, simply consider their body language analysis of the day: The King was \"delighted\" and \"playful\" while Harry -- despite the big smile on his face -- was apparently \"wary\" and filled with an \"inner anxiety\" that he gave away by doing up the button on his suit jacket.)\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nElsewhere in the realm of unnamed sources, the Daily Beast is claiming that Charles specifically ordered all of those senior royals to the garden party, ensuring that Harry looked like a loner. Or maybe he did it to save those other family members from being forced to choose?\n\nEither way, the truth in all of this is as murky as it's ever been -- and the family drama ever juicier...and sadder, really.", "source": {"uri": "thestar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Star"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sarah_laing@thestar.com", "name": "Sarah Laing", "type": "author", "isAgency":

Can't have it both ways,\" they said.\n\nBut one woman, who gave her name as Tracy, said she was a fan and suggested public opinion was being manipulated by the media against Harry.\n\n\"At the end of the day, we don't know if there's any truth in what they've been saying. But if there's any truth in it, I think it's sad,\" she said.\n\n- 'Regal middle finger' -\n\nThe lack of meeting -- even for a short time -- has been interpreted as a snub for Harry, compounded by an announcement that Charles will appoint his elder son and heir Prince William as colonel-in-chief of Harry's old regiment.\n\nFormer army captain Harry served as a helicopter pilot with the Army Air Corps in Afghanistan.\n\nNo meeting is planned either with William, who is due on a visit to Cornwall in southwest England, and the Isles of Scilly on Thursday and Friday.\n\nWilliam's wife Catherine is also undergoing cancer treatment and has not made any public appearance since December last year.\n\nThe brothers, once close, are reportedly no longer on speaking terms due to Harry's criticisms of royal life in a succession of high-profile interviews, TV documentaries and his autobiography.\n\nAfter Harry's three-day visit, he is due to join Meghan on a trip to Nigeria.\n\nHarry, 39, was characterised by the British media as a \"party prince\", who had none of the responsibilities of William, 41, who will become king after Charles.\n\nBut since marrying Meghan, an American former television actress, and quitting royal life, he has faced a sustained backlash in the UK, led by the tabloid press.\n\nFormer Daily Mirror editor and CNN host Piers Morgan, one of the most vocal critics of the couple, said Charles had given \"a big regal middle finger to his treacherous younger son\".\n\n\"It's clear from his 'scheduling issue' that Charles would rather impale himself on a rusty sword than meet up with someone who has wrought such vengeful misery on the Royal Family for so many years now,\" he wrote in The Sun.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news",

Photos from the event showed Harry with a big smile as he waved at the crowds. He looked dapper in a navy blue suit adorned with medals.\n\nHello Magazine's royal reporters attended the service on Wednesday, and shared that royal watchers were \"eager\" to see the prince's prodigal return. Following Harry's reading within the church, actor Damian Lewis recited the poem, \"Invictus\" by William Ernest Henley.\n\nHarry cofounded the Invictus Games in 2014. Wounded, injured and sick military personnel compete in multiple sports at the event. The most recent Invictus Games were held in Germany in September 2023.\n\nFollowing the anniversary celebration, Harry is set to travel to Nigeria with wife Meghan Markle. The couple, who tied the knot in May 2018 and are parents of son Archie, 5, and daughter Lilibet, 2, were invited by Nigeria's chief of defense staff in an effort to highlight the Invictus Games. \"The visit is to consolidate Nigeria's strong hold at the game and the possibility of hosting the event in later years,\" according to Brigadier General Tukur Gusau, Nigeria's acting director of defense information.\n\nAhead of Harry's trip to London, royal watchers wondered whether he would reunite with his father, King Charles III, who is battling cancer.\n\n\"In response to the many inquiries and continued speculation on whether or not the duke will meet with his father while in the U.K. this week, it unfortunately will not be possible due to His Majesty's full program,\" Harry's spokesperson told Us Weekly in a statement on Tuesday, May 7.\n\nAfter Buckingham Palace confirmed Charles' diagnosis in February, Harry rushed to the U.K. to be by his father's side, though their visit lasted less than an hour.\n\n\"I jumped on a plane and went to go see him as soon as I could,\" Harry explained to Good Morning America at the time. \"I love my family. The fact that I was able to get on a plane and go and see him and spend any time with him, I'm grateful for that.\"\n\nIn February, Buckingham Palace announced that Charles, 75, had \"commenced a schedule of regular treatments\" for cancer, during which time he had been \"advised by doctors to postpone public-facing duties.\"\n\nCharles resumed his responsibilities in April with a visit to a specialist cancer center in London.

Shortly after arriving in London, it was revealed that King Charles was too busy to meet with his son, despite weeks of speculation that they could be meeting.\n\nJust hours after it was confirmed that King Charles would not be meeting with Prince Harry, Buckingham Palace announced that the King would hand the Prince of Wales a military honour long thought to be destined for the Duke of Sussex.\n\nPrince William is now colonel-in-chief of the Army Air Corp - the regiment Prince Harry served with in Afghanistan.\n\nRoyal commentator Tom Quinn spoke to the Mirror, revealing: \"King Charles' announcement that Prince Harry is being stripped of his role as Colonel-in-Chief of the Army Air Corps is a real kick in the teeth for the son who always felt marginalised and underrated.\n\n\"What makes it much worse is that the role is being given to the very man who Harry sees as the cause of so many of his problems his brother. And the announcement was deliberately made during Harry's brief visit to the UK to have maximum impact it shows Harry that he really is no longer welcome.\"\n\nQuinn disclosed that the Royal family \"knew\" the timing of the announcement would \"really hurt\" Harry, and shared that \"he is said to have been in tears when he heard\".\n\nJoin the Daily Record's WhatsApp community here and get the latest news sent straight to your messages.\n\nHe continued: \"But they have decided the gloves are off and that Harry needs to realise that when you betray the family, you don't just escape the things you hated doing as a working royal. You also lose the things you loved.\"\n\n\"Being Colonel-in-Chief of the Army Air Corps was something Harry really did enjoy and of which he was very proud,\" added Quinn. \"There is a rushed feel to the whole thing too as if they can't wait to be rid of this troublesome prince which is why Harry's role will be transferred to William in just a few days' time, on 13 May.\"\n\nQuinn also mentioned: \"Harry feels his time in the military was a rare happy time in his life when he was judged on his merits as a man not on his merits as a member of the Royal Family.\"\n\nWrapping up his thoughts, Mr Quinn stated: \"Having always hated being the spare in terms of the succession he now finds that one of the few important roles he had as the younger brother has now been handed over to the person Harry himself described as his nemesis.

Rather, Harry attended a ceremony to honor his Invictus Games, but there was plenty of fanfare around the event for another reason. His father and brother, Prince William, did not attend.\n\nWhile it might seem like nobody from Harry's family supported him on this important day, that actually isn't true. Rather, it just wasn't the royals, like people were expecting.\n\nAlthough people would have liked to see Charles and William show support for Harry, that just wasn't the case. And while it seems clear that tensions are still high between Harry and his father and brother, there were other family members who stepped up to show support.\n\nHarry's cousin, George McCorquodale, was just one of several members of Princess Diana's family who attended the event. Harry's uncle, Earl Charles Spencer, the brother of Princess Diana, was also at the Invictus Games ceremony, as well as his wife and his children, Lady Karen Spencer, Lara Spencer, and Louis Spencer, according to Express. People might forget that Harry and William have another whole side of their family outside of cousins, aunts, and uncles on Charles' side. The Spencers have shown support to Harry through the years, and he has kept up a relationship with many of his cousins.\n\nHarry has also remained close with his cousins on his father's side, such as Princess Beatrice and Princess Eugenie, though it does not appear that anyone from Charles' side of the family attended the ceremony. Scheduling conflicts are not uncommon for the royals, and the lack of attendance from extended family doesn't necessarily mean anything is wrong. It certainly would have been nice for Charles and William to show support, though.\n\nThe Invictus Games ceremony has seemingly proven at least one thing: Harry's relationship with his father and brother is still quite tense. The Duke of Sussex did not see either of them during his quick trip, and the reality is that even though Harry wasn't in town for very long, if he had a good relationship with his immediate family, they all would have rearranged their schedules to see each other.\n\nIt's a bit sad, really; Harry and Meghan Markle, his wife, have completely distanced themselves from the royals. And while some might think they did this to themselves, if Charles and William wanted to each be the bigger person, then they could have been. At this point, it's hard to say if Harry will ever get back on track with the two of them, but it seems less and less likely with each passing day.", "source": {"uri": "cheatsheet.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Showbiz Cheat Sheet"}, "authors": [{"uri": "julia_mullaney@cheatsheet.com", "name": "Julia Mullaney", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invictus_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Invictus Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William,_Prince_of_Wales", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "William, Prince of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Harry,_Duke_of_Sussex", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_I_of_England", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Charles I of England"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diana,_Princess_of_Wales", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Diana, Princess of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Spencer,_9th_Earl_Spencer", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Charles Spencer, 9th Earl Spencer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lara_Spencer", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lara Spencer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princess_Beatrice", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Princess Beatrice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princess_Eugenie", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Princess Eugenie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meghan,_Duchess_of_Sussex", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Meghan, Duchess of Sussex"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/General_Merchandise/O", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/General Merchandise/O", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 61}], "image": "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Prince-Harry-royal-family-11.24.34\u202fPM.jpg?w=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550326", "eventUri": "eng-9550326", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2078431372549019, "wgt": 169, "relevance": 1}

With the tight-knit Invictus congregation seated in a circle, under the cathedral dome, it was almost literally his circle of trust.\n\nWith the traditional hymns and prayers, the ranks of clergy, and no gimmicks or modern twists, you could imagine his grandmother the late Queen Elizabeth II fitting in comfortably with such a service.\n\nWith the mellow late afternoon sunshine coming in through the long windows, it was a surprisingly intimate celebration of a decade of helping to give a sense of purpose to individuals and families under pressure.\n\nIt was also shaped like a royal event, complete with cameras and cheers outside and Prince Harry shaking a few excited hands as he was leaving.\n\nThere was plenty of support for him in this instant crowd of passers-by and tourists.\n\nHe has been in legal battles over security during visits to the UK, but there were lines of City of London police here seeing him safely away.\n\nHowever, there was also an inescapable sense of absence, with none of his royal relations there with him.\n\nThe headlines have become about who wasn't there, including his father and brother.\n\nThis felt very much like a solo mission.\n\nThe duke, who now lives in California, last saw the King in person shortly after his February announcement that he was being treated for an unspecified form of cancer.\n\nThe King has since returned to some public duties but is continuing to receive medical care.\n\nOn Wednesday he was seen removing his top hat and waving it in the air as a crowd greeted him by singing the national anthem at Buckingham Palace.\n\nPrince Harry is also not expected to meet the Prince or Princess of Wales - who is also being treated for cancer - while in the UK.\n\nOn Tuesday, a spokesperson for the duke said: \"In response to the many inquiries and continued speculation on whether or not the duke will meet with his father while in the UK this week, it unfortunately will not be possible due to His Majesty's full programme.\n\n\"The duke of course is understanding of his father's diary of commitments and various other priorities and hopes to see him soon.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, the duke attended an Invictus Games summit in London, where he told delegates: \"Sometimes you... look back and go 'Look at what we've done'.\n\n\"But also given the state of the world, there is so much more to do and I think a lot of uncertainty - but what we've created is a global community.\"\n\nPrince Harry is not being joined by the Duchess of Sussex for this visit, but his wife is scheduled to meet him in Nigeria, where he is due to travel after his stop in London.\n\nThe couple were invited by Nigeria's chief of defence staff after they met at the Invictus Games held last year in Germany.\n\nSign up here to get the latest royal stories and analysis straight to your inbox every week with our Royal Watch newsletter.

Harry had hoped he would be able to meet with his father, but the monarch was too busy to see him.\n\nRoyal author Tom Quinn has now claimed the King joked he would have to have someone search Harry to see if he was recording had he met with his son. Speaking exclusively to The Mirror, Tom said: \"When King Charles heard his son was planning to return for the Invictus Games, he joked that if he saw Harry he would have to have him searched first to see if he was taping their conversation!\n\nFor all the latest on news, politics, sports, and showbiz from the USA, go to The Mirror US.\n\nREAD MORE: Hidden meaning behind Prince Harry's bracelets on lonely trip without Meghan Markle\n\nKing Charles was at a garden party instead of meeting with his son\n\n\"And, of course, at many levels this is no joking matter.\" A spokesperson for Harry released a statement to confirm the Duke of Sussex would not be meeting with his father during his UK trip.\n\nThey said: \"In response to the many inquiries and continued speculation on whether or not the duke will meet with his father while in the UK this week, it unfortunately will not be possible due to His Majesty's full programme.

He explained: \"There was a sigh of relief at Kensington Palace and Clarence House that Harry appears to have scrapped the idea of a second book after his best-seller Spare, but the focus has now switched to Meghan.\n\nPrince Harry was at an Invictus Games service last night\n\n\"King Charles now fears that anything he says to his son may end up in a book written by Meghan.\" The royal expert suggested Meghan will release her memoir to tie in with her lifestyle business America Riviera Orchard.\n\nHe told us: \"For all her efforts to make a success of her new online business, America Riviera Orchard, Meghan knows that a personal memoir of her time in the UK as a working royal would sell millions of copies and make her the sort of money she craves.\n\n\"She is also acutely aware that such a book would only boost traffic to her new online business. All this fills King Charles with horror because Harry is bound to be a major contributor to the book.\"\n\n* Follow Mirror Celebs on TikTok, Snapchat, Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, YouTube and Threads.", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jessica_gibb@mirror.co.uk", "name": "Jessica Gibb", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "scarlett_o_toole@mirror.co.uk", "name": "Scarlett O'Toole", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Harry,_Duke_of_Sussex", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_I_of_England", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Charles I of England"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarch", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Monarch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invictus_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Invictus Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Mirror", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Daily Mirror"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meghan,_Duchess_of_Sussex", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Meghan, Duchess of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoir", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Memoir"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "TikTok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarence_House", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Clarence House"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kensington_Palace", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kensington Palace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snapchat", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Snapchat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article32767509.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_harrycharlesexcl.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550326", "eventUri": "eng-9550326", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.04313725490196085, "wgt": 167, "relevance": 1}

The Duke of Sussex was in the capital to attend a service marking the 10th anniversary of the Invictus Games.\n\nAs he left the event, he was greeted by shouts of \"We love you Harry\" from hundreds of fans who had gathered in hopes of catching a glimpse of the Royal. After a brief chat with some of the crowd, Harry was escorted to his car.\n\nLip reader Jeremy Freeman has now shed light on what the Prince said as he departed.

Here we go,\" finally managing to reach out.\n\nThe warm reception for Harry comes despite the Royal Family's decision not to attend the Invictus Games event at St Paul's.

He is sadly believed to be in the midst of an unresolved royal rift with his family.\n\nREAD MORE: William and Kate's 'frightening fight' means they won't 'deal with Harry Problem'\n\nPrince Harry appeared to have grown in confidence, according to one body language expert\n\nDarren Stanton, a body language expert with Betfair Slots, has revealed that Harry is clearly in \"very high spirits\" during his solo trip to the UK, despite being supposedly \"snubbed\" by his father. Harry, who has a busy schedule of activities lined up, was spotted at Armoury House in London on Tuesday, May 7, for an Invictus Games discussion titled 'Realising a Global Community'. This marks his first appearance since arriving in the UK.\n\nPrince Harry appears to be in 'very high spirits' during his trip to the UK\n\nThe prince flew in from his home in Montecito, California, to celebrate the tenth anniversary of the Invictus Games. However, it's been revealed that he won't be meeting with his father due to clashing schedules. Despite missing out on a reunion, the Duke doesn't seem to be showing any signs of disappointment. In fact, Darren suggests that Harry is feeling \"positive and proud.\"\n\nHarry even engaged with Pikemen and Musketeers\n\nDarren told OK!: \"Harry appears to be his most confident self during his return to the UK as he prepares for the Invictus Games. His body language suggests he's feeling strong, as we can't see him using self-reassurance gestures - which he often uses when feeling nervous. He is seen holding his head up high, with his shoulders back and displaying a bold grin. He's developed a lot in terms of his inner strength and confidence. It tells us he is feeling very positive and proud about where he is right now. He is in very high spirits.\"\n\nHarry was previously 'restricted and closed off'\n\nAs the Invictus Games, an organisation dear to Prince Harry, takes centre stage, Darren said the Prince is clearly offering his \"full attention and engagement\" to everyone he interacts with, indicating his boosted confidence. Harry's consistent use of eye contact and assertive gestures make him appear \"open and welcoming\", as opposed to \"restricted and closed off\", which has been the case in the past. \"He feels comfortable and at ease,\" Darren added.\n\nWhile Harry has so far travelled to the UK solo, his wife Meghan Markle is set to join him later in the week for a pre-scheduled trip to Nigeria. ITV news Royal editor Chris Ship revealed: \" Prince Harry travelled to the UK alone - without Meghan or the children Archie and Lilibet.\" He added: \"Meghan will not accompany Harry to the St Paul's Cathedral in London tomorrow.

Charles apparently ordered all working royals to attend a 5,000-person garden party at Buckingham Palace because nothing screams \"fun\" like a mandatory party. There, he and a snappy-looking top hat greeted Harry's aunt Princess Anne, his uncle Prince Edward, Edward's wife, Sophie, his cousin Prince Richard, and Richard's wife, Bridget. \"Working royals\" apparently did not include William and Kate, whom People claims Harry invited to the service along with Charles -- but William was busy with his own engagement on Wednesday, hosting an investiture for (among other people) director Ridley Scott at Windsor Castle.\n\nSo far, it's been a lonely London visit for Harry, who told outlets through a spokesperson that seeing his father while he's in town \"unfortunately will not be possible due to His Majesty's full program.\" One source told Vanity Fair that Charles being too busy to see his son \"feels very much like a snub.\" Meanwhile, alleged insiders told the Daily Beast that Charles won't see Harry because he still hasn't forgiven him for calling Camilla \"dangerous\" and a \"villain\" in his memoir.\n\nLuckily for Harry, one side of the family is far less estranged -- his late mother Diana's sister, brother, and cousin were all in attendance.

Although on the surface it looks like a snub, Harry made it very difficult for his father,\" Griffiths said, adding that \"other forces\" may have influenced the monarch.\n\n\"Maybe other forces were driving Charles' position on this,\" she said. \"William may have had a thought about how this meeting should be conducted or whether it should be conducted at all,\" Griffiths added.\n\n\"We know that Charles likes to meet Harry with Camilla in the room, which isn't always a popular decision,\" she continued. \"Harry was without his wife as well, so this was fraught with difficulty.\"\n\nHarry's reps claimed that a meeting between Harry and Charles \"will not be possible due to His Majesty's full program.\" \"The duke, of course, is understanding of his father's diary of commitments and various other priorities and hopes to see him soon,\" a spokesperson for the Duke said.\n\nA previous report claimed that Harry invited the royal family members to the Invictus Games' 10-year celebration ceremony in the UK, but \"received no response.\" It is unlikely that any senior members of the royal family will turn up at the event.", "source": {"uri": "hindustantimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hindustan Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Harry,_Duke_of_Sussex", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_I_of_England", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Charles I of England"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invictus_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Invictus Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Post", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GB_News", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "GB News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarch", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Monarch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William,_Prince_of_Wales", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "William, Prince of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_Camilla", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Queen Camilla"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_royal_family", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "British royal family"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Biology/History", "label": "dmoz/Science/Biology/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Genealogy/Royalty", "label": "dmoz/Society/Genealogy/Royalty", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 68}], "image": "https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2024/05/09/1600x900/Untitled_1707380599438_1715218125118.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550326", "eventUri": "eng-9550326", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.01960784313725483, "wgt": 165, "relevance": 1}

Sources denied that he had made any bizarre requests ahead of seeing Charles, calling it \"rubbish\".\n\nHarry has been open about the toll that losing his mother at such a young age took on him.\n\nIn his 2023 Netflix docuseries, \"Heart of Invictus\", Harry revealed, \"My tour of Afghanistan in 2012, flying Apaches, somewhere after that there was an unraveling and the trigger to me was actually returning from Afghanistan.\n\n\"But the stuff that was coming up was from 1997 from the age of 12, losing my mum at such a young age, the trauma that I had I was never really aware of, it was never discussed.\"\n\nHe continued, \"It was never discussed, I didn't really talk about it and I suppressed it like most youngsters would have done.\n\n\"But when it all came fizzing out, I was bouncing off the walls. I was like, 'What is going on here? I'm now feeling everything as opposed to being numb.'\n\n\"The biggest struggle for me was no-one around me really could help.\"\n\nEarl Spencer famously revealed the harsh divide between the Spencers and the royal family at Diana's funeral in September 1997 when he said that Diana's siblings would watch over Harry and William.\n\n\"I pledge that we, your blood family, will do all we can to continue the imaginative way in which you were steering these two exceptional young men so that their souls are not simply immersed by duty and tradition but can sing openly as you planned,\" he said.\n\n\"We fully respect the heritage into which they have both been born and will always respect and encourage them in their royal role but we, like you, recognize the need for them to experience as many different aspects of life as possible to arm them spiritually and emotionally for the years ahead.\n\n\"I know you would have expected nothing less from us.\"\n\nAnd Harry has remained close with the Spencer side of his family, despite moving to the US.\n\nDiana's sisters, Lady Jane and Lady Sarah McCorquodale, were photographed alongside Charles and Camilla, William and Kate Middleton at Prince Archie's christening in July 2019.\n\nThey were also believed to be in attendance at Princess Lilibet's christening in Montecito in May 2023.\n\nHarry and his wife Meghan Markle visited Althorp, Diana's childhood home, in September 2022 -- while they were in the UK following the death of Queen Elizabeth II.\n\nThere they spent time with his uncle and his aunts, and visited Diana's final resting place, which lies on an island at the estate.\n\nMeanwhile, Harry was also joined by a host of old friends at the Invictus event, including former army officer Mark Dyer, who has been a mentor to the Duke.\n\nThe fifth in line to the throne has not been in the UK since February when he met with Charles for barely 30 minutes following the monarch's cancer diagnosis. He will travel to Nigeria with his wife for their own version of a state visit, landing in the African country on Friday.", "source": {"uri": "pagesix.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Page Six"},

It would look nice if they met.\n\n\"He probably he doesn't want it to be used as a PR opportunity.\n\n\"Or maybe Harry's being the one being difficult and we we just don't know.\"\n\nAnd, in another snub, the King also revealed Prince William would next week be taking charge of Harry's former helicopter regiment.\n\nThe Monarch said his eldest son will be honoured as the Colonel-in-Chief of the Army Air Corps.\n\nThe event will take place in front of an Apache -- the type of helicopter Harry flew when serving in Afghanistan.\n\nRoyal expert Richard Fitzwilliams told The Sun: \"This timing is deliberate.\n\n\"It's to send a deliberate message to Harry that the Royal Family has not forgotten what has been happening over the last four years.\"\n\nHowever, the duke was backed by Princess Diana's siblings at the Invictus bash.\n\nEarl Spencer and Lady Jane Fellowes joined him at the star-studded event.\n\nHarry hugged his late mum's brother and sister outside St Paul's Cathedral ahead of the service.\n\nThree cousins -- George McCorquodale, 39, Louis Spencer, 30, and Lara Spencer, 18 -- sat in a row behind.\n\nIngrid Seward added: \"They are very supportive of Harry and always have been.\n\n\"It sends a clear signal to the Royal Family and to Harry that Diana's family are there for him.\n\n\"At his address at Diana's funeral, Charles Spencer said he would look out for William and Harry in her place.\"\n\nMeanwhile, King Charles and Queen Camilla mingled among 8,000 guests at their famous garden party.\n\nThe only working royals missing were the Prince and Princess of Wales.\n\nWilliam had conducted an investiture in Windsor earlier in the day, and Kate is not carrying out public duties due to her own cancer fight.", "source": {"uri": "thescottishsun.co.uk",

According to The Independent, had Harry not stepped back as a working member of the royal family (which he did alongside wife Meghan Markle in 2020), the role would have likely gone to Harry.\n\nThe timing of the announcement is iffy at best, and The Mirror reports that Harry got emotional and was \"in tears\" at hearing the news of William's appointment given by Charles -- no doubt exacerbated by Charles' apparent refusal to make time for his younger son while Harry was in the U.K. this week.\n\n\"King Charles' announcement that Prince Harry is being stripped of his role as Colonel-in-Chief of the Army Air Corps is a real kick in the teeth for the son who always felt marginalized and underrated,\" royal author Tom Quinn told The Mirror. \"What makes it much worse is that the role is being given to the very man who Harry sees as the cause of so many of his problems -- his brother. And the announcement was deliberately made during Harry's brief visit to the U.K. to have maximum impact -- it shows Harry that he really is no longer welcome.\"\n\nQuinn claimed that senior royals knew that the announcement would \"really hurt\" Harry: \"He is said to have been in tears when he heard,\" Quinn said. \"But they have decided the gloves are off and that Harry needs to realize that when you betray the family, you don't just escape the things you hated doing as a working royal. You also lose the things you loved.\"\n\nWilliam is expected to take over the role soon -- on May 13, this upcoming Monday.\n\nHarry remains extremely proud of his decade of service in the British Army, which included two tours in Afghanistan. Quinn added that \"Harry feels his time in the military was a rare happy time in his life when he was judged on his merits as a man, not on his merits as a member of the royal family,\" he said. \"Having always hated being the spare in terms of the succession, he now finds that one of the few important roles he had as the younger brother has now been handed over to the person Harry himself described as his nemesis. Harry cannot fail to get the message -- his last few ties to his old life are being cut, and he is being set adrift, permanently.\"\n\nReports have surfaced from royal experts Hugo Vickers and Arthur Edwards that the King could have made time to see Harry this week had he really wanted to, and from Charlotte Griffiths that William (as well as Queen Camilla) likely played a factor in Charles' ultimate decision not to see his younger son this week.", "source": {"uri": "marieclaire.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Marie Claire"}, "authors": [{"uri": "rachel_burchfield@marieclaire.com", "name": "Rachel Burchfield", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Army_Air_Corps_(United_Kingdom)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Army Air Corps (United Kingdom)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonel-in-chief", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Colonel-in-chief"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_I_of_England", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Charles I of England"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regiment", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Regiment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Harry,_Duke_of_Sussex", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William,_Prince_of_Wales", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "William, Prince of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_royal_family", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "British royal family"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_VIII", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Edward VIII"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majesty", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Majesty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marie_Claire", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marie Claire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Mirror", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Daily Mirror"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Highness", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Royal Highness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Independent", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Independent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckingham_Palace", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Buckingham Palace"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Afghanistan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Afghanistan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meghan,_Duchess_of_Sussex", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Meghan, Duchess of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_Camilla", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Queen Camilla"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugo_Vickers", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hugo Vickers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "British Army"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Genealogy/Royalty", "label": "dmoz/Society/Genealogy/Royalty", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/General_Merchandise/O", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/General Merchandise/O", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 48}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 47}], "image": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JccZ4zh4iCBp6bbwdbGg4G-1200-80.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550326", "eventUri": "eng-9550326", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-13", "textStart": 2147, "textEnd": 2153}], "sentiment": -0.01960784313725494, "wgt": 164, "relevance": 1}

And there was much speculation in the British media beforehand that the visit might offer an opportunity to see his father, who is being treated for cancer.\n\nHowever, Charles did not find time to meet his younger son over the two days, in part due to a garden party he was hosting at Buckingham Palace in London on Wednesday afternoon.\n\nNo royals attended the Service of Thanksgiving honoring Invictus at St. Paul's Cathedral, in London, which was the centerpiece of Harry's visit.\n\nHowever, Princess Diana's brother Charles Spencer and sister Jane Fellowes both attended and were seen hugging Harry in the pews at St. Paul's.\n\nThe post was viewed more than 273,000 times and liked over 8,300 times after it showed Prince Harry hugging uncle Spencer and aunt Fellowes.\n\nDuring the service, Harry gave a reading from Corinthians: \"Now there are varieties of gifts, with the same spirit and there are varieties of services, with the same lord, and there are varieties of activities, but it is the same god who activates all of them in everyone.\n\n\"To each is given the manifestation of the spirit of the common good.\"\n\nThe duke was flying solo at the service after Meghan Markle stayed home in California with their children, Prince Archie and Princess Lilibet.\n\nIt was always expected that no senior royals would turn up for the Invictus event, but many commentators had hoped to see Harry and Charles meet.\n\nBrand strategist and author Justine Castellon wrote on X: \"By snubbing the Invictus event, Charles and William inadvertently did Harry a favor. In their absence, Harry shines brighter, becoming the focal point of the news.\n\n\"It's heartwarming to see Earl Spencer demonstrate to the world that #PrinceHarry is still surrounded by family.\"\n\nAt Diana's funeral in 1997, Spencer addressed the princess during his eulogy to promise to look after Harry and Prince William: \"On behalf of your mother and sisters, I pledge that we, your blood family, will do all we can to continue the imaginative way in which you were steering these two exceptional young men so that their souls are not simply immersed by duty and tradition but can sing openly as you planned.\n\n\"We fully respect the heritage into which they have both been born and will always respect and encourage them in their royal role but we, like you, recognize the need for them to experience as many different aspects of life as possible to arm them spiritually and emotionally for the years ahead.

The 10th anniversary of the Duke of Sussex's passion project had thousands of fans lining up to greet the royal -- and Harry looked rather touched that so many people came to honor the games and give him a warm welcome.\n\nThe throngs of well-wishers were rewarded with an unexpected meet-and-greet with Prince Harry, who shook hands and turned on the charm for the crowds. Us Weekly described him as \"stunned but thrilled\" by the turnout, which is a sad reminder of the ongoing royal feud. The Duke of Sussex was there without Meghan Markle to celebrate because the security issues have not been resolved. The rest of his family, who were invited personally by Harry, decided that a garden party at Buckingham Palace just two miles away was far more important.\n\nIn a time of royal crisis with King Charles III and Kate Middleton battling cancer, a show of unity at Harry's Invictus Games event would not only have been a PR opportunity, but it might have also opened the lines of communication just a little bit more between Charles and his youngest son. It's hard to believe that we are four years into the rift, but no one wants to budge -- there seem to be too many restrictions for Prince Harry to even get some time alone with his dad.\n\nOn Wednesday, the public made it very clear that Harry's presence in the UK is something that they want more of. He and Meghan aren't returning to their senior roles, but public appearances tied to their philanthropic work are missed. Cele Otnes, co-author of Royal Fever: The British Monarchy in Consumer Culture, noted this back in 2022. She believed that the royals underestimated Harry and Meghan's global appeal and missed the mark when negotiating their exit. Referencing Tina Brown's new book, The Palace Papers, Otnes stated to the U.K.'s Express, \"There's a great quote where Tina says one of the big problems with Harry and Meghan leaving the brand is that now there is this 'charisma vacancy.' I love that.\"\n\nHarry had his day in the sun with the Invictus Games, but sadly, the rest of his family was not by his side.

It was speculated Harry would have to face the event alone, as the Royal Family decided not to attend the event.\n\nLuckily, Earl Spencer and Lady Jane Fellowes, both siblings of the late Princess Diana, turned up to support Harry. Royal expert Tom Quinn believes the show of solidarity \"speaks volumes about where their loyalties lie\".\n\nFor all the latest on news, politics, sports, and showbiz from the USA, go to The Mirror US.\n\nREAD MORE: Prince Harry sends signal to King Charles and William that 'he's not the bad boy they paint him to be'\n\nPrince Harry was seen chatting to his aunt and uncle\n\nSpeaking exclusively to The Mirror, he said: \"Harry may have cut a lonely figure at St Pauls, but he did have one other family supporting him - his mother's family. Diana's sister Lady Jane Fellowes was there as well as her brother, Earl Spencer\n\n\"The Spencer family have always felt uncomfortable with the Royal Family after the death of Harry and William's mother. Earl Spencer, Diana's brother, was openly critical of the way the Royal Family treated his sister and of course that criticism largely centred on Prince Charles (as he then was).\"\n\nPrincess Diana sadly died in August 1997 in a fatal car crash in Paris. Tom said there is \"still a lot of bitterness around\" and said the Spencers' decision to support Harry was significant.\n\nCharles Spencer was at the Invictus Games service He has a very close relationship with the Duke of Sussex\n\nThe expert told us: \"The fact that the Spencers were out in force for Harry on this visit speaks volumes about where their loyalties lie. Like Harry, the Spencers still see the Royal Family, to some extent, as the enemy.\n\n\"If anyone is taking sides, the Spencers will always take sides with Harry simply because they feel he was hard done by and Harry hugely appreciates their support.\"\n\nWhile Earl Charles Spencer and Lady Jane Fellowes attended the Invictus Games service, Harry was alone as he walked up the steps to the entrance of the cathedral. As the event took place, King Charles was flanked by a huge contingent of royals in a show of unity at this afternoon's Buckingham Palace garden party, which took place just two miles away.\n\n* Follow Mirror Celebs on TikTok, Snapchat, Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, YouTube and Threads.", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jessica_gibb@mirror.co.uk", "name": "Jessica Gibb", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "scarlett_o_toole@mirror.co.uk", "name": "Scarlett O'Toole", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Harry,_Duke_of_Sussex", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_royal_family", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "British royal family"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Spencer,_9th_Earl_Spencer", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Charles Spencer, 9th Earl Spencer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jane_Fellowes,_Lady_Fellowes", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jane Fellowes, Lady Fellowes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Paul's_Cathedral", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "St Paul's Cathedral"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Mirror", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Daily Mirror"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_I_of_England", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Charles I of England"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invictus_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Invictus Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diana,_Princess_of_Wales", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Diana, Princess of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spencer_family", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spencer family"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "TikTok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_Diana,_Princess_of_Wales", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Death of Diana, Princess of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckingham_Palace", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Buckingham Palace"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Genealogy/Royalty", "label": "dmoz/Society/Genealogy/Royalty", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/General_Merchandise/O", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/General Merchandise/O", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article32770932.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_harryearlexcl.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550326", "eventUri": "eng-9550326", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "1997-08-", "textStart": 1431, "textEnd": 1442}], "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 163, "relevance": 1}

In September 2022, when Harry and Meghan Markle were back in the UK for Queen Elizabeth's funeral, they took a trip to Althorp, Princess Diana's childhood home, spent time with his uncle and his aunts, and visited Diana's final resting place. Plus, in March 2023 Diana's sisters, Lady Jane and Lady Sarah McCorquodale, were reportedly in attendance at Princess Lilibet's christening.\n\nElsewhere in London, King Charles hosted the first Garden Party of the year at Buckingham Palace.

At the service at St. Paul's Cathedral today, he arrived to cheers from the gathered onlookers. Town & Country contributing editor Victoria Murphy was on the scene to capture the moment:\n\nWhile no members of the royal family will be joining Harry today, family members of his mother's, the late Princess Diana -- including her brother, Charles Spencer, and sister Lady Jane Fellowes -- were in attendance at the event. Harry's cousins Lara Spencer, Louis Spencer, and George McCorquodale were also spotted entering the cathedral.\n\nSince moving to the United States in 2020, Prince Harry has remained close with the Spencer side of his family. When Harry and his wife, Duchess Meghan, were back in the United Kingdom for Queen Elizabeth II's funeral in September 2022, they took a trip to Althorp, Diana's childhood home, spent time with his uncle and his aunts, and visited his mother's final resting place. And Diana's sisters, Lady Jane and Lady Sarah McCorquodale, were reportedly in attendance at the March 2023 christening of his daughter, Princess Lillibet.\n\nElsewhere in London today, King Charles III hosted the first Garden Party of the year at Buckingham Palace. He was joined by many other senior working royals, including Queen Camilla, Princess Anne, Prince Edward, and Sophie, Duchess of Edinburgh.\n\nA spokesperson for the Duke of Sussex told Harper's Bazaar that Harry will not see Charles while he's in town this week. \"It unfortunately will not be possible due to His Majesty's full program.

On an episode of Good Morning Britain, Andrew Pierce, who serves as a consultant editor for the Daily Mail, told the hosts: \"I've said it before and I will say it again - the King does not trust his son.\n\n\"Harry's laid it all bare, exposed everything - he doesn't trust him, nor does William, and no senior member of the royal family is going to see Harry [on this visit].\"\n\nSocial media users quickly shared their opinions on the matter, with one remarking: \"Who actually cares if Harry and the King meet each other?\", reports the Mirror.\n\nAnother criticised the episode on X, formerly known as Twitter, stating: \"Why randomly drag Harry and Meghan into it?

The way the Windsors behaved this week was ghastly, yet again. It's like they're escalating too - the less control they have over Harry, the more they \"punish\" him publicly. King Charles was so jealous of Harry's Invictus service that the king scheduled his garden party for the exact same time as the service AND the king ordered the other working royals to attend his garden party. Charles and his palace goons (Camilla included) have been on a briefing spree about Harry all week as well. The Windsors are the ones making this mind-numbingly toxic, all so the royal experts can say that \"Harry was snubbed and he was sad about it.\" Which brings me back to my hope that Harry is teflon at this point when dealing with all of this bullsh-t. Some highlights from Katie Nicholl's commentary to Entertainment Tonight:\n\nHarry genuinely hoped to see his father: \"He hasn't got many other plans. He was, of course, hoping to see his family. Possibly that's why the trip was three days... but as we now know, there will be no family meetings.\"\n\nNo Windsor support for the Invictus service: \"When you look at the inaugural Invictus Games back in 2014... he had support from his father and from Prince William... You could see that wonderful closeness between Charles and his sons, and you could see how happy Harry was to have the support of his older brother. When you consider that this is the 10th anniversary, this felt a little flat, I think it's fair to say. He certainly cut a pretty lonely figure... He looked very much an outsider over here in Britain.\"\n\nCharles still claims to be eager to reconcile with Harry: Nicholl's sources say \"that the king is very, very keen to get his relationship with his son back on track. He very much wants to be close to his son again and to see more of his grandchildren, who he's barely seen since they were born.\" Because of that, Nicholl said, \"There is a sense of surprise that he hasn't made time to see his son.\"\n\nTrust issues: The \"fundamental issue\" remains, however, as there's been \"this breakdown of trust between Harry and the family,\" according to Nicholl. \"Clearly, there are still some pretty major trust issues and concerns on Charles' part that any private meetings or conversations that he has with his son may not stay private for long,\" she said. \"I think Harry's going to have to work really quite hard to repair some of that trust before he's going to get a sort of privileged audience with his father.\"\n\nCharles handing off the Colonel-in-Chief of the Army Air Corps to Prince William: \"You know, the timing is curious. I think many people will see that as a bit of a snub, really, from the palace, and perhaps a little bit of a poke in the ribs to Prince Harry. Yes, he's over here part of the Invictus community celebrating 10 years, but he's been stripped of his right to wear his military uniform. And now his brother's taken over the role that I think Harry would have expected to have come to him, had he still been a working member of the royal family. So, yes, I think the timing does feel poignant. And, yes, I think it's probably another slap in the face for Prince Harry, and yet another reminder that he's very much out rather than in when it comes to the royal family.\"\n\n[From Entertainment Tonight]\n\n\"Clearly, there are still some pretty major trust issues and concerns on Charles' part that any private meetings or conversations that he has with his son may not stay private for long.\" How long will Charles ring this bell? How many times will Charles and Camilla go on blatant briefing sprees against Harry, with \"insiders\" claiming that C&C have zero trust that HARRY won't leak things. The palace leaks constantly. Harry says his sh-t with his whole chest, on the record or through his official spokesperson. Anyway, the slap in the face stuff, the Windsors' lack of support for Invictus, the pettiness for petty's sake... these people keep insisting that it's all bad news for Harry. But that palace-issued talking point is falling flat. Charles really misjudged the situation this week. Charles looked sick with jealousy, spiteful, petty and just mean.

At the end of the day, Harry's still having daddy issues, but his mother's family supports him with no questions asked,\" the source adds.\n\nEarl Spencer, 59, attended Harry's Invictus Games 10th anniversary service at London's St Paul's Cathedral on Wednesday, May 8, along with the prince's aunt, Lady Jane Fellowes. She has remained close to Harry, 39 as Princess Diana's older sister attended the christening of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex's son Archie in July 2018.\n\nNo members of the royal family were in attendance for Harry's Invictus anniversary commemoration.\n\nKing Charles, 75, had a prescheduled garden party at Buckingham Palace on the same day, which was attended by the majority of working royals. Queen Camilla, the Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh, Princess Anne and the Duke and Duchess of Gloucester were all on hand to help the monarch greet and thank community members for their public service in a tradition that dates back to the 1860s.\n\nHarry acknowledged before flying to England that he wouldn't be able to meet with his father, who, despite battling cancer, has returned to public-facing duties with a busy schedule.\n\n\"In response to the many inquiries and continued speculation on whether or not The Duke will meet with his father while in the UK this week, it, unfortunately, will not be possible due to His Majesty's full program,\" a statement from Harry's spokesperson read.\n\nIt continued, \"The Duke, of course, is understanding of his father's diary of commitments and various other priorities and hopes to see him soon.\"\n\nHarry briefly met with his father in February after flying from California to London after the king revealed his cancer diagnosis. The meeting at Clarence House was brief, with Charles and Camilla flying to Sandringham immediately afterward, while Harry flew home the next morning.\n\nThe duke has been estranged from William, 41, since 2018, when the pair separated their royal foundation amid tensions that arose following Harry's wedding to Meghan Markle. He went on to write about issues he had with William, including a physical fight, in his 2023 memoir, Spare.\n\nThe future monarch has been busy with his own royal duties while wife Kate, 42, has been battling cancer. She revealed her diagnosis on March 22, announcing she'd started chemotherapy treatment after the presence of the disease had been detected during a major abdominal operation in January.\n\nHarry and Meghan, 42, infamously announced they were stepping down as senior working royals in January 2020. The couple moved to Montecito, California, and landed deals with Netflix and Spotify, although the latter fell apart in 2023 with a senior executive calling them \"grifters.\" Meghan has since started a lifestyle brand, American Riviera Orchard, while Harry is the Chief Impact Officer for the life coaching company Better Up.", "source": {"uri": "intouchweekly.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "In

Later, he encouraged traditional architecture and became a passionate advocate of protecting the environment - just a few examples of his many interests.\n\n'In some ways, this might sound odd, but the cancer diagnosis has given His Majesty even more energy,' another friend tells me.\n\nCharles and Camilla are all smiles attending a Royal Garden Party at Buckingham Palace (above and below) on Wednesday - the same day Prince Harry was just two miles away at St Paul's Cathedral\n\nIt's been a bittersweet week for Harry, returning to the warmth of veterans at The Invictus Games Foundation's tenth Anniversary Service at St Paul's Cathedral - but given the cold shoulder by his own father and brother (below in 2014)\n\n'He spent decades waiting to be King, of course, and realises that his time might be very limited.'\n\n'So, he's determined to make as much difference as he can - as soon as he can.\n\n'Frankly speaking, Harry and Meghan are a painful distraction that he could do without.'\n\nThe King returned to his public engagements last week - with a visit to a cancer centre - even though he has not yet completed his own treatment.\n\nAnd the Queen gave an insight into her husband's sense of urgency when she told a guest at a Buckingham Palace reception: 'I think he was really thrilled to be out.'\n\nShe added, tellingly: 'I've been trying to hold him back.'\n\nIt is understood that the Sussexes are yet to make an apology for their highly personal and very public criticism of the Royal Family.\n\nIt is said that, in private, they continue to insist that they are the ones who deserve an apology.\n\nFrom everything I hear, there will be no rapprochement between the Sussexes and the royals until Harry and Meghan have said sorry for the distress that they have caused.\n\nMegan and Harry (seen here with Charles at Trooping The Colour in 2018) are now 'a painful distraction that he could do without'\n\nI understand that The King finds it particularly hard to forgive the comments Harry made in his explosive memoir, Spare - in which the Duke portrayed his step-mother, Queen Camilla, as a 'villain' who left him as a 'body in the street' in her desire to rehabilitate her own image.\n\nIt was no coincidence that one of the Queen's closest and most discreet confidantes, the Marchioness of Lansdowne, chose to speak last year about the pain that Harry's comments had caused.\n\n'Of course it bothers her, of course it hurts,' Lady Lansdowne said then.\n\n'Her [Camilla's] philosophy is always, \"Don't make a thing of it and it will settle down - least said, soonest mended\".'\n\nUntil Harry apologises for that hurt - at least in private, if not in public - meetings with his father might be hard to come by.\n\nSign up for Richard Eden's royal newsletter.

I know you would have expected nothing less from us.\"\n\nWhile Earl Spencer isn't often seen in public with his nephews, he's been there to support them during several events - namely involving those to commemorate his late sister.\n\nIn 2006, Charles joined Prince Harry and William during the unveiling of a memorial fountain dedicated to Diana at Hyde Park in London.\n\nThen, in 2021, they were all seen together in public as they unveiled a new statue of the Princess in the gardens of Buckingham Palace on what would have been her 60th birthday.\n\nEarl Spencer has also attended Kate Middleton and Prince William's wedding in April 2011, and was spotted again when Harry and Meghan Markle wed in 2018.\n\nEarl Spencer recently revealed how he underwent the same therapy for trauma as Prince Harry.\n\nIn his Memoir, A Very Private School, Charles explained how he's been treated for physical, sexual and emotional abuse he suffered while at Northamptonshire's Maidwell Hall boarding school between 1972 and 1977.\n\n\"I have EMDR, which is a form of therapy for PTSD,\" he said.\n\nIt comes after Prince Harry revealed in 2001 that he'd used the same form of PTSD treatment.\n\nSpeaking on an episode of his AppleTV series, The Me You Can't See, he noted how he was using EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitisation and Reprocessing) for four or five memories that he still found disturbing from his childhood.\n\nAlongside his therapist Sanja Oakley, he explained: \"EMDR is always something that I wanted to try and that was one of the varieties of different forms of healing or curing that I was willing to experiment with.\n\n\"I never would have been open to that had I not put in the work and the therapy that I've done over the years.\"", "source": {"uri":

Charles' private reason for avoiding Prince Harry during London return", "body": "King Charles avoided meeting up with Prince Harry during his two-day visit to London as he was hoping to avoid \"the drama\" associated with his son, it's been claimed.\n\nThere was plenty of speculation about whether or not the pair, whose relationship has been strained following the Duke of Sussex's public criticisms of his family, would get together while once again sharing the same city as he took part in Invictus Games events this week.\n\nIn response, Harry's spokesman released a statement confirming that Harry had put in a request for a meeting, but that it had been declined.\n\n\"In response to the many inquiries and continued speculation on whether or not the Duke will meet with his father while in the UK this week, it unfortunately will not be possible due to His Majesty's full program,\" the spokesman said.\n\n\"The Duke of course is understanding of his father's diary of commitments and various other priorities and hopes to see him soon.\"\n\n\"Harry and Meghan have brought him, and the rest of the family, nothing but worries over the past few years.\"\n\nThe journalist added that the divide between Harry and Meghan and the rest of his family is unlikely to be bridged until the Sussexes apologise for their repeated criticisms of the royal family.\n\nIn particular, the King is reportedly still particularly upset about his son's portrayal of his wife, Queen Camilla, including the allegation that she was \"dangerous\" in her bid to overhaul her public reputation.\n\nMeanwhile, Harry wrapped up his whirlwind return to the UK with an emotional Service of Thanksgiving for 10 years of the Invictus Games at St Paul's Cathedral on Wednesday.\n\nHe appeared to become overwhelmed during a testimony by the 2018 Team UK captain, Michelle Turner, along with her husband and daughter, as they described the profound impact the competition had had on their lives.\n\nAs a choked-up Ms Turner wrapped up by thanking \"Invictus for giving me my life back\", Harry stood up to lead the congregation in a standing ovation, before appearing to wipe away his own tears.\n\nHe later delivered a reading of a passage from Corinthians.\n\nThe duke is patron of the Games, which began in 2014 as a sporting competition for wounded, injured or sick ex-servicemen and women.\n\nIt followed his own decade of service in the military, which included two tours of Afghanistan.\n\nUnsurprisingly, given the rift currently dividing Harry and the royal family, none were in attendance at the high-profile event.", "source": {"uri": "news.com.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "News.com.au"}, "authors": [{"uri": "bronte_coy@news.com.au", "name": "Bronte

The Duke of Sussex has finally jetted back to British soil for an Invictus Games event, leaving Meghan Markle and their children, Archie and Lilibet, back in California.\n\nLanding on Tuesday, May 7, speculation was rife about whether Harry would catch up with King Charles. However, hopes for a father-son catch-up have been dashed. A spokesperson for Prince Harry has confirmed that there will be no meeting due to the King's packed schedule.\n\nThe statement from Harry's camp stated: \"It unfortunately will not be possible due to His Majesty's full programme. The Duke of course is understanding of his father's diary of commitments and various other priorities and hopes to see him soon.\"\n\nDespite expectations of a reunion, top Royal expert and former BBC roya editor Jennie Bond told OK! that the missed opportunity suggests a deep rift, saying, \"we can deduce that their relationship is terminally damaged\". Jennie also suggested: \"In a sensible world, Harry would stay with his dad at Clarence House - they could have cosy chats in perfect privacy and with all the security Harry wants.\"\n\nPrince Harry will not be seeing his father, King Charles during his UK visit, it has been confirmed\n\nDuring a previous visit to the UK, Harry visited his father following the news of the monarch's cancer diagnosis. This journey marks Harry's first trip back home since it was revealed that Kate Middleton, his sister-in-law, is undergoing cancer treatment after having surgery in January.\n\nJennie offered insights into Harry's relationship with his older brother Prince William, saying: \"As regards William, that does appear to be a terminally damaged relationship.\"\n\nThere has been a noticeable rift between Prince Harry and Prince William which doesn't appear to be getting resolved anytime soon\n\nShe then suggested a shift in their dynamic, saying: \"In a way, it seems the boot is now very much on the other foot. Previously it was Harry who was the 'victim' looking for an apology for all his perceived grievances. Now those grievances must seem utterly trivial (even to Harry) in the face of a very real problem: cancer.\"\n\nPointing out the gravity of the situation and its impact on family relations, she added: \"Kate and William are involved in a frightening fight and I don't think they have the will or the strength to confront someone, even a brother, who picked a fight over issues that seem pathetic by comparison.\"\n\nJennie summed up her thoughts by saying: \"William is doing everything he possibly can to protect his wife and I very much doubt that they want to deal with 'the Harry problem' right now, if ever.\"", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri": "joseph_wilkes@mirror.co.uk", "name": "Joseph Wilkes", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "rebecca_russell@mirror.co.uk", "name": "Rebecca Russell", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Harry,_Duke_of_Sussex", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_I_of_England", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Charles I of England"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jennie_Bond", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jennie Bond"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princess_Lilibet_of_Sussex", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Princess Lilibet of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William,_Prince_of_Wales", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "William, Prince of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meghan,_Duchess_of_Sussex", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Meghan, Duchess of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invictus_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Invictus Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarence_House", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Clarence House"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OK!", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "OK!"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "BBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catherine,_Princess_of_Wales", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Catherine, Princess of Wales"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/news/royals/article32767315.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/7_topshot-britain-royals-queen-death.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550326", "eventUri": "eng-9550326", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-07", "textStart": 362, "textEnd": 367}], "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 161, "relevance": 1}

But Harry released a statement saying Charles was too busy to see him, with the palace a couple of hours later saying Charles was making Prince William the head of Harry's old regiment. Harry's U.K. trip has fast become a snub pile-up.\n\nIn Spare, Harry said Camilla \"sacrificed me on her personal PR altar,\" and described her as \"dangerous.\"\n\nIn remarks to Anderson Cooper on the show 60 Minutes to promote the book, which is estimated to have made Harry some $27 million, Harry said: \"With a family built on hierarchy, and with her on the way to being queen consort, there was going to be people or bodies left in the street.\"\n\nHe also described his stepmother as a \"villain\" and the \"third person in the marriage,\" echoing his mother's controversial interview with Martin Bashir in 1995, when Diana said there were \"three of us in the marriage.\"\n\n\"Harry has made things very difficult for himself by saying such cruel and hurtful things about Camilla,\" the friend told The Daily Beast. \"Charles loves his sons, but he also loves his wife. The last few months have made it very clear how important she is; she has been the one propping up the whole edifice.\n\n\"Harry has made it very clear, very publicly, that he despises her. He has forced Charles to choose, which was a very silly thing to do because Camilla and he both chose each other a long time ago.\n\n\"William had his reservations but he accepted his father's choice and got on with it. Harry made a different decision, and one of the inevitable consequences of publicly calling your stepmother cruel names is that it becomes difficult for you to see your father.\"\n\nAnother source, a friend of William and Kate's, quipped: \"It is hardly surprising that Charles didn't invite Harry round for tea and a scone. He did, after all, portray his wife as an evil, calculating, bitch in the biggest selling book since the Bible.\" [In fact, Spare broke records for being the fastest-selling non-fiction book but it is not, yet at least, certified as the biggest selling non-fiction book of all time.]\n\nAnother source, a former Buckingham Palace staffer, said, \"As far as the palace is concerned, the further away that Harry and Meghan are from Buckingham Palace the better. Look how distracting Harry's visit has been this week. The media should be talking about the king's return to work, instead we are talking about a 39 year old man's daddy issues. If Harry thinks he can drop in for a cuppa at Clarence House whenever he happens to be changing planes in London, that would encourage him to come here more often, which is the exact opposite of what the institution typically wants from exiled family members. The whole point of being exiled is that you are out of sight and out of mind.\"\n\nThe courtier also said that Harry's statement saying his father had declined to meet him was \"childish.\"\n\nIn the statement, Harry's spokesperson said: \"In response to the many inquiries and continued speculation on whether or not the Duke will meet with his father while in the U.K. this week, it unfortunately will not be possible due to His Majesty's full program. The Duke of course is understanding of his father's diary of commitments and various other priorities and hopes to see him soon.\"\n\nThe source said, \"It was classic Harry -- childish and petulant foot-stamping. Everything is always someone else's fault. Even Harry must know the reason a meeting isn't happening is not due to Charles' 'full program' -- it's because Harry sold out his own family.\"\n\nRichard Kay, the well-connected Daily Mail journalist said that both Camilla and William \"would have viewed the prospect of a meeting between the king and Harry deeply troubling.\"\n\nAs The Daily Beast has reported, William has no interest in renewing his relationship with his brother.\n\nIn another clear expression of the different ways that the king's two sons are treated by their father, just hours after the revelation that Charles and Harry would not meet, Buckingham Palace announced a new military role for Prince William as Colonel-in-Chief of the Army Air Corps. The position will be bestowed on William during a rare joint engagement with his father next week.\n\nPrior to his departure from the royal family, the role had been earmarked for Harry, who was a member of the regiment.\n\nBuckingham Palace did not return a request for comment on whether Harry's remarks about Camilla were a factor in his father not meeting him this week.", "source": {"uri": "thedailybeast.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Daily Beast"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_Camilla", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Queen Camilla"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_I_of_England", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Charles I of England"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Daily_Beast", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "The Daily Beast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckingham_Palace", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Buckingham Palace"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William,_Prince_of_Wales", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "William, Prince of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Harry,_Duke_of_Sussex", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_consort", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Queen consort"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invictus_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Invictus Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anderson_Cooper", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anderson Cooper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoir", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Memoir"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/60_Minutes", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "60 Minutes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_relations", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Public relations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Bashir", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Martin Bashir"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diana,_Princess_of_Wales", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Diana, Princess of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regiment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Regiment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bible"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dog"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_royal_family", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "British royal family"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Army_Air_Corps_(United_Kingdom)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Army Air Corps (United Kingdom)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Courtier", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Courtier"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonel-in-chief", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Colonel-in-chief"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarence_House", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Clarence House"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Mail", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Daily Mail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journalist", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Journalist"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 85}], "image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1688,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1715183775/240508-camilla-harry-charles-hero_y4ivb2", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550326", "eventUri": "eng-9550326", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 161, "relevance": 1}

He has forced Charles to choose, which was a very silly thing to do because Camilla and he both chose each other a long time ago.\n\n\"William had his reservations but he accepted his father's choice and got on with it. Harry made a different decision, and one of the inevitable consequences of publicly calling your stepmother cruel names is that it becomes difficult for you to see your father.\"\n\nAnother source, a friend of William and Kate's, quipped: \"It is hardly surprising that Charles didn't invite Harry round for tea and a scone. He did, after all, portray his wife as an evil, calculating, bitch in the biggest selling book since the Bible.\" [In fact, Spare broke records for being the fastest-selling non-fiction book but it is not, yet at least, certified as the biggest selling non-fiction book of all time.]\n\nAnother source, a former Buckingham Palace staffer, said, \"As far as the palace is concerned, the further away that Harry and Meghan are from Buckingham Palace the better. Look how distracting Harry's visit has been this week. The media should be talking about the king's return to work, instead we are talking about a 39 year old man's daddy issues. If Harry thinks he can drop in for a cuppa at Clarence House whenever he happens to be changing planes in London, that would encourage him to come here more often, which is the exact opposite of what the institution typically wants from exiled family members. The whole point of being exiled is that you are out of sight and out of mind.\"\n\nThe courtier also said that Harry's statement saying his father had declined to meet him was \"childish.\"\n\nIn the statement, Harry's spokesperson said: \"In response to the many inquiries and continued speculation on whether or not the Duke will meet with his father while in the U.K. this week, it unfortunately will not be possible due to His Majesty's full program. The Duke of course is understanding of his father's diary of commitments and various other priorities and hopes to see him soon.\"\n\nThe source said, \"It was classic Harry -- childish and petulant foot-stamping. Everything is always someone else's fault. Even Harry must know the reason a meeting isn't happening is not due to Charles' 'full program' -- it's because Harry sold out his own family.\"\n\nRichard Kay, the well-connected Daily Mail journalist said that both Camilla and William \"would have viewed the prospect of a meeting between the king and Harry deeply troubling.\"\n\nAs The Daily Beast has reported, William has no interest in renewing his relationship with his brother.\n\nIn another clear expression of the different ways that the king's two sons are treated by their father, just hours after the revelation that Charles and Harry would not meet, Buckingham Palace announced a new military role for Prince William as Colonel-in-Chief of the Army Air Corps. The position will be bestowed on William during a rare joint engagement with his father next week.\n\nPrior to his departure from the royal family, the role had been earmarked for Harry, who was a member of the regiment.\n\nBuckingham Palace did not return a request for comment on whether Harry's remarks about Camilla were a factor in his father not meeting him this week.\n\nRead more at The Daily Beast.\n\nGet the Daily Beast's biggest scoops and scandals delivered right to your inbox.

Not only do Harry's previously aired grievances that sparked a rift with the royal family now seem \"utterly trivial\" by comparison, William and Kate's \"frightening fight\" means the future King and Queen are unlikely to have much desire for a confrontation with the estranged brother..\n\nHarry's relationship with his dad King Charles appears irreparably strained as he opts out of meeting his father during a brief visit to the UK. The Duke of Sussex, who landed in Britain for an Invictus Games event, has left Meghan and their kids back in the US.\n\nArriving on Tuesday, May 7, there was much speculation about whether Harry would see King Charles. However, any hopes of a father-son reunion were quickly squashed. Prince Harry's spokesperson confirmed that a meeting couldn't be arranged due to the King's busy schedule.

With a smile and a wave, he walked up the steps of St Paul's Cathedral as a lone figure, his staff and security making their way in slightly away from the cameras.\n\nREAD MORE: Prince Harry arrives to cheers for Invictus Games service\n\nInside, though, it was a different story: the Spencer family rode to the very public rescue.\n\nHis uncle Earl Spencer and aunt Lady Jane Fellowes were waiting with hugs, three of Prince Harry's Spencer cousins behind them.\n\n\"Thanks for coming,\" Prince Harry told the Earl, looking sincere as he pulled back from the maternal family embrace. He blew a kiss and waved at others.\n\nREAD MORE: Prince William's new title 'quite a snub' for Harry\n\nThe Invictus veterans and competitors always give the Prince a warm welcome, but the presence of some family members was a visible boost to his spirits.\n\nIt was enough to inspire The Sun front page to declare: \"Diana's Family Backs Harry.\"\n\n\"Now that Harry has left the Royal family, the Spencers have laid claim to him again,\" said Ingrid Seward, editor of Majesty magazine.\n\nThe invitation, and its acceptance, brought the rare spotlight onto the side of the Prince's family he has valued over the years, a quiet but constant part of his adult life.\n\nHe has mentioned them only occasionally, sparing them from the truth-telling pages of his memoir save for in the acknowledgements where he offered \"stand out thanks to my mother's siblings for their love, support, time and perspective\".\n\nHis paternal family - so well-covered throughout the book, his Netflix series, and his interviews - were not thanked.\n\nREAD MORE: Emirates pilot reveals amazing perks of the job\n\nThe King, it is claimed, was invited to the Invictus Games service. The Prince and Princess of Wales were sent invitations, but were not able to attend.\n\nThe King was at a garden party a few miles away, his first since his diagnosis with cancer. Prince William conducted an investiture in Windsor on the same day and the Princess, as is well known, is out of the public eye during a course of preventative chemotherapy.\n\nInside the cathedral, those watching Prince Harry noted his relatively newfound confidence in delivering his reading, and the animation with which he turned around in his seat to chat to the Spencers.\n\nThey have rarely appeared in public with him over the years, but have remained present - not least in their roles as the closest remaining link to his late mother.\n\nHis aunts in particular have been there in the shadows, should one care to look closely.\n\nIn a 2017 television interview to mark her engagement, Meghan Markle said: \"I think in being able to meet his aunts ... I'm able to, in some way, know a part of her [Diana] through them and, of course, through him. And it's incredibly special.\"\n\nLady Jane, the middle of the three sisters, gave a reading at Prince Harry and Meghan's wedding, and is said to have been one of the first people introduced to a newborn Prince Archie.\n\nBoth Lady Jane and Lady Sarah were included in the formal photographs from Prince Archie's christening.\n\nREAD MORE: The products a former beauty editor will buy again (and again)\n\nAt the Invictus Games service, Prince Harry was seen deep in conversation with both the Earl and Lady Jane, beaming at them as they waited for the service to start.\n\nThe venue, St Paul's, was evocative in itself, where Lady Diana Spencer's siblings watched in 1981 as she married Prince Charles and became the new Princess of Wales.\n\nSixteen years later, with the 12-year-old Prince Harry watching on, Earl Spencer rocked the establishment with a eulogy in which he called his sister the \"most hunted person of the modern age\".\n\nAddressing her \"beloved boys\", he said then: \"I pledge that we, your blood family, will do all we can to continue the imaginative and loving way in which you were steering these two exceptional young men, so that their souls are not simply immersed by duty and tradition, but can sing openly as you planned.\"\n\nHe has since passed occasional comment on the Royal family. In 2002, in an interview with The Guardian, he is quoted as remarking: \"What I can say is that they may not be encouraged to stay in touch with their mother's side of the family.\"\n\nIn 2017, on Radio 4, he claimed he had been \"lied to\" about Princes William and Harry \"wanting\" to walk behind their mother's coffin.\n\nThis time, his appearance was low-key. Before the service, it was rumoured that all three of Diana's siblings would attend, but Lady Sarah McCorquodale was not seen. Her son George, 39, was there along with Lady Lara and Louis Spencer, Viscount Althorp.\n\nThe Earl's only public comment was made afterwards on social media site X. \"I hope my father would have approved that I wore his Royal Scots Greys regimental cufflinks at \u2066the moving celebration of 10 years of \u2066@WeAreInvictus\u2069 at @StPaulsLondon\u2069 yesterday,\" he said.\n\nIngrid Seward, author of recent royal biography My Mother and I, notes that the late Diana, Princess of Wales was \"proud of her Spencer heritage as is Viscount Althorp and as is Harry\".\n\n\"He is close to what he calls his 'red aunts',\" she says, a reference to the family hair colour.\n\nThe Duke of Sussex, as he left St Paul's, had a spring in his step. Launching into a walkabout, he fell into the tried-and-tested pattern of handshakes and snippets of conversation: \"Very nice to meet you. How are you? Have you come on holiday?\"\n\nWhen one member of the public told him they were in London for a wedding, he turned to point at St Paul's and joked: \"Not in here?\"\n\nShown the two cameras held by another, he exclaimed: \"You've got two cameras? That doesn't even make sense!\"\n\nHe and the Duchess will fly to Nigeria for a three-day trip, also based around military veterans, arriving on Friday.\n\nThe image, as Harry leaves Britain once again, is still of a divided family.\n\nThe Royal family, as ever, will remain silent. The Spencers, by turning up, have said it all.\n\n\u00a9 Telegraph Media Group Limited 2024", "source": {"uri": "honey.nine.com.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "honey.nine.com.au"}, "authors": [],

Asked 'How are you feeling?', he replied: \"Not too bad.\"\n\nHe chatted with Royal Commonwealth Society members plus Team GB's synchronised swimming team -- promising to watch them at the Paris Olympics.\n\nIn all, he spent around an hour with guests despite doctors \"calibrating\" his engagements.\n\nThis morning he will meet the 3 Royal School of Military Engineering (3RSME) at Gibraltar Barracks in Surrey.\n\nHe and Harry have not seen each other since February when the US-based Duke flew 5,000 miles following his father's diagnosis.\n\nHarry wore four medals on his chest including one awarded from his gran, Queen Elizabeth II for services to the monarchy.\n\nBut for the second time in recent weeks he failed to wear his King's Coronation Medal.", "source": {"uri":

It featured a reading from the Duke of Sussex and actor Damian Lewis read a poem. Harry arrived at the Cathedral without any members of the Royal Family, following the announcement King Charles is too busy to reunite with his son. Harry also wasn't joined by his wife Meghan Markle as she decided to remain in America instead of returning to the UK.\n\nAs he got out of his car wearing a navy suit and his military medals, he smiled and waved as cheers rang out among wellwishers, who had been waiting to catch a glimpse of him.\n\nHis arrival came just minutes after King Charles was flanked by a huge contingent of royals in a show of unity at this afternoon's Buckingham Palace garden party, which took place just two miles away. However, despite his royal relatives not attending the service, family members who did join were his uncle Earl Charles Spencer and his aunt Lady Jane Fellowes, both siblings of the late Princess Diana.\n\nREAD MORE: Who is Bambie Thug? Ireland Eurovision hopeful's real name, family background and personal life\n\nOther notable guests at the service included his cousin Louis Spencer, the Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's wife Akshata Murty and his lawyer David Sherbourne. Also there was and former Army officer Mark Dyer, who acted as the duke's mentor, playing the role of a supportive big brother figure for Harry after Diana's death.\n\nThe duke was warmly greeted by the Dean of St Paul's, the Very Reverend Andrew Tremlett, before being escorted to his seat under the cathedral's great dome next to Mr Dyer and then chatted happily with his uncle and aunt who sat behind him and watched on with pride.\n\nThe service began with the hymn Praise My Soul The King Of Heaven The Dean of St Paul's told the congregation: \"We gather this evening to offer grateful thanksgiving to Almighty God for the work of the Invictus Games Foundation, and in this their 10th anniversary year, we celebrate the tremendous achievements of the numerous competitors across 23 nations. We give thanks for the inspiring vision and compassion that formed the foundation and, chiefly, for the resultant decade of profound and transformational work.\n\n\"We lament the pain, cost and indignity of war and terror, and pray for a world where justice shall reign and where the nations will find their longed for unity. We recall, with admiration, the skill and determination of those who seek to repair, rehabilitate, and reclaim the lives of those living with serious illness or injury: changing and saving lives.\"\n\nActor Damian Lewis read the Invictus poem by William Ernest Henley, whose bust resides in the St Paul's Crypt and then an emotional poem read by former Invictus Games Team UK vice-captain Michelle Turner, her daughter Maya and husband John was felt around the cathedral.\n\nThe poem outlined the impact of the Invictus Games on her recovery, and on the lives of her family members. Former RAF sergeant Michelle served for 21 years and has a heart condition that developed while on deployment. While a nasty bug left her with postural tachycardia syndrome (PoTS) which means her heart fires up randomly, causing her to regularly collapse without warning. On one occasion, her four-year-old daughter saved her life by dialling 999 when she collapsed at home.\n\nThrough fear of falling and injuring herself in public, she had confined herself to her home, until her husband John encouraged her to join Team UK - and everything changed. The training camps enabled her to reconnect with her military family, and find a new sport in swimming.\n\nThe poem recalled how Invictus athletes \"fought for our countries on deployments far and wide, devoted our years and served with pride...\" She told how after being discharged she was \"wounded, injured, sick and with no career, consumed with insecurities, the pain and the fear\", and how her little girl looked after her.\n\nHer daughter's section of the poem described how she \"felt like I was losing my mum, she was in hospital all the time\", while her husband told how he had longed for Michelle's smile to return, and how it did with Harry's Invictus, which arrived as a \"beacon of trust and hope\".\n\nHarry led a standing ovation as the reading ended with Michelle's tearful words: \"Thank you Invictus, for giving me my life back.\"\n\nDuring the service, Harry, who undertook two tours of Afghanistan during a 10-year military career, provided a reading from Corinthians 12. 4-11 ahead of a Sermon by The Dean of St Paul's. The Dean acknowledged those who have lost their lives in conflicts past and present, whilst a piper played Flowers of the Forest.\n\nAfter the service finished and he left the Cathedral, Harry greeted some of the fans who had gathered outside the venue before being whisked away in his car.\n\nThe Duke of Sussex landed in the UK on Tuesday. As part of his trip, he has so far taken part in The Invictus Games Foundation Conversation titled \"Realising a Global Community\" and met up with his millionaire pal Guy Monson.\n\nHarry had been hoping to see his father during his trip, but it has been revealed that won't be happening. A spokesperson for the Duke of Sussex said yesterday: \"In response to the many inquiries and continued speculation on whether or not the Duke will meet with his father while in the UK this week, it unfortunately will not be possible due to His Majesty's full programme.\n\n\"The Duke of course is understanding of his father's diary of commitments and various other priorities and hopes to see him soon.\" A source previously told The Mirror : \"Harry has kept in regular contact with his father on several occasions and made no secret of his desire to see him when he can.\"\n\nHarry is set to join Meghan in Nigeria tomorrow to take part in talks about the Invictus Games. It's believed Meghan and Harry will visit Camp Wu Bassey, an Army barracks in Abuja, during their trip. Here, they will be treated to a banquet with military officials.\n\nThe Sussexes have a large team who will no doubt be accompanying them to Nigeria. Miranda Barbot, a PR expert who previously worked with Barack Obama, has recently been promoted by Meghan and Harry to vice-president of programmes and media operations at Archewell. It's believed she will be helping to plan the couple's tour of Nigeria and will likely accompany them on the trip.\n\nHarry and Meghan are also set to meet with servicemen and their families while in Nigeria. The African country joined the Invictus Community of Nations in 2022 and became the first African country to join the Invictus movement.\n\nJoin the Irish Mirror's breaking news service on WhatsApp. Click this link to receive breaking news and the latest headlines direct to your phone.

The fact I was able to get on a plane and go and see him and spend any time with him? I'm grateful for that,\" the Duke of Sussex said.\n\nHe also indicated his intent to see his family as much as possible.\n\n\"I have got other trips planned that would take me through the U.K. or back to the U.K., so I will stop in and see my family as much as I can,\" Harry said.\n\nAccording to Bronte Coy of Australia's News.com.au, sources in Harry's camp indicated that he and his wife, Meghan, were looking toward healing their strained relationship with the king and other members of the British royal family, and even showed interest in resuming some of their royal duties.\n\nHowever, after Charles' response, it's unclear how receptive other members of the royal family have been to the idea.\n\nThe British royal family is notoriously tight-lipped, especially regarding matters of internal family conflict, so there's no real knowing the true state of the relationships between Harry and the other royals.\n\nHarry and Meghan stepped back from their royal duties in 2020 and moved to California, where they currently reside.\n\nThey also took shots at members of the royal family.\n\nIn their 2021 interview with Oprah Winfrey, Meghan claimed that a senior member of the royal family had made racially incentive remarks about the skin color of their then-unborn son.\n\nHarry also attacked both his father and his brother, Prince William, in his 2023 memoir, \"Spare.\"\n\nSo it's understandable that Charles and other royals might not be eager to welcome him back with open arms.\n\nRegardless of whether any of the accusations that Harry and Meghan hurled at the family are true, the issues should have been dealt with privately, not publicly.\n\nAnd so Harry is feeling the consequences of his actions.\n\nJust look at the current situation. Charles and his son have lived on different continents for four years. The king is suffering from cancer. They rarely get to see each other. Yet when they were in the same city on the same day, Charles still didn't seem to want to see Harry.\n\nHopefully, these relationships are not beyond repair.

The Monarch decided not to meet with Prince Harry during his London visit, with one Royal expert suggesting King Charles was worried about being recorded.\n\nThe Duke of Sussex, 39, returned to the UK earlier this week to take part in a number of Invictus Games engagements. Harry had hoped he would be able to meet with his father, but King Charles was too busy to see him.\n\nRoyal author Tom Quinn has now claimed the King joked he would have to have someone search Harry to see if he was recording had he met with his son. Speaking to The Mirror, Tom said: \"When King Charles heard his son was planning to return for the Invictus Games, he joked that if he saw Harry he would have to have him searched first to see if he was taping their conversation!\"\n\nA spokesperson for Harry released a statement to confirm the Duke of Sussex would not be meeting with his father during his UK trip. They said: \"In response to the many inquiries and continued speculation on whether or not the duke will meet with his father while in the UK this week, it unfortunately will not be possible due to His Majesty's full programme. The duke of course is understanding of his father's diary of commitments and various other priorities and hopes to see him soon.\n\n\"Tom also shared that Charles is concerned about the potential fallout if Meghan Markle were to pen a memoir. He said: \"There was a sigh of relief at Kensington Palace and Clarence House that Harry appears to have scrapped the idea of a second book after his best-seller Spare, but the focus has now switched to Meghan. King Charles now fears that anything he says to his son may end up in a book written by Meghan.\n\nThe Royal commentator hinted that Meghan might time the release of her memoir to coincide with her lifestyle brand America Riviera Orchard. He revealed to the Mirror: \"For all her efforts to make a success of her new online business, America Riviera Orchard, Meghan knows that a personal memoir of her time in the UK as a working Royal would sell millions of copies and make her the sort of money she craves. She is also acutely aware that such a book would only boost traffic to her new online business.\n\n\"All this fills King Charles with horror because Harry is bound to be a major contributor to the book.\"\n\nFollow OK! on Threads here: https://www.threads.net/@ok_mag", "source": {"uri": "ok.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "ok"}, "authors": [{"uri": "lauren_fletcher@ok.co.uk", "name": "Lauren Fletcher", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "scarlett_o_toole@ok.co.uk", "name": "Scarlett O'Toole", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "jessica_gibb@ok.co.uk", "name": "Jessica Gibb", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Harry,_Duke_of_Sussex", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_I_of_England", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Charles I of England"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invictus_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Invictus Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meghan,_Duchess_of_Sussex", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Meghan, Duchess of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarchy_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Monarchy of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Mirror", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Daily Mirror"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarence_House", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Clarence House"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kensington_Palace", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kensington Palace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OK!", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "OK!"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Riviera", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "French Riviera"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Biology/History", "label": "dmoz/Science/Biology/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 77}], "image": "https://i2-prod.ok.co.uk/incoming/article32754898.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_GettyImages-471082770.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550326", "eventUri": "eng-9550326", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 157, "relevance": 1}

With Kate, it's understandable -- she hasn't been seen publicly since her March 22 announcement that she is battling cancer. Yesterday William conducted investitures at Windsor Castle, and Charles hosted the first garden party of the season at Buckingham Palace, which was attended by Queen Camilla, Princess Anne, Prince Edward, Sophie, the Duchess of Edinburgh, Prince Richard, and Birgitte, the Duchess of Gloucester. (According to People, \"Garden parties have been held since the 1860s as a way for the monarch to recognize community members for their public service.\" Just in case you were wondering.) And apparently, according to Page Six, the King ordered all working royals to attend the party -- held just miles away from Harry's service.\n\n\"King Charles ordered all working royals -- including Princess Anne and Prince Edward, and excluding Prince William and Kate Middleton -- to attend a garden party for 5,000 people at Buckingham Palace taking place at the same time [as Harry's event],\" veteran royal correspondent Tom Sykes of The Daily Beast reported.\n\nOf the relationship between the King and Harry, \"Charles has made it quite clear he ready to be friendly and supportive to Harry in his capacity as a private person, as his dad, but he's not going to throw the weight of the institution behind Invictus again,\" a former courtier told Sykes. \"This all seems very logical inside the Palace bubble, butt he trouble is that people who don't particularly care about such things, who are dimly aware that the royals spend their days visiting community centers and opening supermarkets, are going to wonder why they are boycotting this terrific charity that is headed by the King's son.\"\n\nThe Invictus Games were founded in 2014 as an international multi-sport event for wounded, sick, and injured servicemen and servicewomen, both those still actively serving and veterans. Arguably, it has become the work of Harry's life and the project he is most passionate about outside of his family.\n\nThe former courtier said that many people think the royal family's absence from Harry's event is a \"classic example\" of them \"cutting off their nose to spite their face\": \"Invictus is clearly exactly the kind of organization the royal family should be supporting,\" they said. \"If a bridge is ever going to be built [between Harry and the royal family], Invictus is the bridgehead to build it from, and they should get on and do it.\"\n\nThough no members of the royal family were present at the Service of Thanksgiving (and Harry's wife, Meghan Markle, is also not in the U.K.), the siblings of Harry's mother, the late Princess Diana, came out last night to support their nephew and ensure that he would have family on site, after all.", "source": {"uri": "marieclaire.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Marie Claire"}, "authors": [{"uri":

It would look nice if they met.\n\n\"He probably he doesn't want it to be used as a PR opportunity.\n\n\"Or maybe Harry's being the one being difficult and we we just don't know.\"\n\nAnd, in another

Diana's siblings at the Invictus bash.\n\nEarl Spencer and Lady Jane Fellowes joined him at the star-studded event.\n\nHarry hugged his late mum's brother and sister outside St Paul's Cathedral ahead of the service.\n\nThree cousins -- George McCorquodale, 39, Louis Spencer, 30, and Lara Spencer, 18 -- sat in a row behind.\n\nIngrid Seward added: \"They are very supportive of Harry and always have been.\n\n\"It sends a clear signal to the Royal Family and to Harry that Diana's family are there for him.\n\nThe only working royals missing were the Prince and Princess of Wales.", "source": {"uri":

But behind the scenes, it's not all good in his old 'hood.\n\nAs we've been reporting, Meghan Markle's husband has not gotten an audience with his father King Charles III or his brother Prince William while he's been across the pond. The family rift runs deep, and their estrangement is so substantial hat Harry is all by himself for Invictus events despite being just a hop, skip, and a jump away from dad, big bro, and many other relatives. Oof.\n\nRelated: Meghan Told Harry The Ghost Of Princess Diana Appeared To Her 'During Yoga'?!\n\nWhat makes it even worse is Harry had been \"hoping\" to see both Charles and Wills while in London. And the fact that there's been no movement on that front is weighing heavily on him. On Wednesday afternoon, ET spoke to royal expert Katie Nicholl about that, and she said this about the Duke of Sussex's tempered England return:\n\n\"He hasn't got many other plans. He was, of course, hoping to see his family. Possibly that's why the trip was three days... but as we now know, there will be no family meetings.\"\n\nOuch!\n\nHe made extra time in his itinerary just to see his fam, and they shut him down? Devastating! Nicholl lamented how Harry's event had a far different, more family-oriented energy ten years ago when it first started:\n\n\"When you look at the inaugural Invictus Games back in 2014... he had support from his father and from Prince William. You could see that wonderful closeness between Charles and his sons, and you could see how happy Harry was to have the support of his older brother.\"\n\nBut this year, despite the iconic event's tenth anniversary celebration, Harry's return \"felt a little flat\" to the royal insider:\n\n\"When you consider that this is the tenth anniversary, this felt a little flat, I think it's fair to say. He certainly cut a pretty lonely figure... He looked very much an outsider over here in Britain.\"\n\nDouble ouch!!\n\nThe King is at the center of things, as far as Nicholl is concerned. See, it hurts even more that Harry and Charles were within \"spitting distance\" from each other at separate events this week, as the royal expert noted. And yet the king still didn't make the time to see his son, something that would have taken much less effort on his part:\n\n\"I think certainly the fact that time hasn't been made over these three days for father and son to have some sort of meeting -- when you consider their last meeting was just about 30 or 40 minutes when Harry flew all the way from California to see his father -- certainly fuels that narrative of a rift.\"\n\nOMG, she's right? Harry came 99% of the way, the least Charles could have done was meet him that measly one percent.\n\nBut there may be hope for the future?!?! Nicholl claimed to ET sources are still optimistic about the king and his second son figuring out a path to reconciliation. Apparently there are still motivating factors for His Majesty. That includes the monarch supposedly very badly wanting to see his grandchildren -- Harry and Meghan's kids Archie, 5, and Lilibet, 2 -- in the near future:\n\n\"The king is very, very keen to get his relationship with his son back on track. He very much wants to be close to his son again and to see more of his grandchildren, who he's barely seen since they were born.\"\n\nThat's a nice thought, of course. But actions speak louder than words! And the fact the king has decidedly not acted on the opportunity to easily see Harry during this Invictus turn says it all. Heck, he could have just carved out 10 minutes and had the Duke of Sussex come to him! Nicholl acknowledged that insiders are actually very surprised by the cold shoulder:\n\n\"There is a sense of surprise that he hasn't made time to see his son.\"\n\nBut as Nicholl notes, the \"fundamental issue\" remains obvious: there has been a \"breakdown of trust\" between the Spare author and the royal family. Uh, yeah. Ya think?! The royal soothsayer explained:\n\n\"Clearly, there are still some pretty major trust issues and concerns on Charles' part that any private meetings or conversations that he has with his son may not stay private for long. I think Harry's going to have to work really quite hard to repair some of that trust before he's going to get a sort of privileged audience with his father.\"\n\nAs far as Harry is concerned, Nicholl explained, it's less about PR and image and all of that nonsense. It's about the loss of his family For him the rift has morphed into feelings of \"disappointment\" and \"genuine sadness.\" Oof. She divulged:\n\n\"There is just a feeling of disappointment, certainly, on Harry's part, and genuine sadness that he hasn't got to see his father. When you take away the rift and who they are in terms of the royal family, they are a family, and Harry's gone through an awful lot since finding out his father's been diagnosed with cancer. He's all those miles away, understandably very worried about his papa, as he calls him, and he is here for three days. I think it was very much his hope that he'd get to see his father. I'm told he's rather hurt and quite disappointed that he hasn't had that opportunity.\"\n\nAnd the despair cuts even deeper! On Wednesday, King Charles officially appointed Harry's big bro, the Prince of Wales, to be the Colonel-in-Chief of the Army Air Corps. That was a role that the king himself had held for 31 years before ascending to the throne. But here's the rub: Harry served in that exact unit for ten years, including multiple tours of duty in Afghanistan. So he would have been poised to be active with it... had he stayed in the royal fam.\n\nRelated: Prince William Is 'Envious' Of Prince Harry For THIS Super Petty Reason!\n\nBut now it's under William's charge. Nicholl says that move has helped extend and deepen the family rift:\n\n\"I think many people will see that as a bit of a snub from the palace, and perhaps a little bit of a poke in the ribs to Prince Harry... He's been stripped of his right to wear his military uniform, and now his brother's taken over the role that... Harry certainly would have expected to come to him had he still been a working member of the royal family. I think the timing does feel poignant. I think it's probably another slap in the face for Prince Harry, and yet another reminder that he's very much out rather than in when it comes to the royal family.\"\n\nBad vibes like that will also likely once again keep Harry and Meghan far away from June's Trooping the Colour this year. Every year the royal fam gets together on the palace balcony, in full regalia, creating some of the best photo opportunities of the whole party together.\n\nBut are Harry and Meghan even part of the royal fam anymore? Well, not \"working members\" in any case. Calling a potential reunion at the annual event \"incredibly unlikely,\" Nicholl had this to say about the Duke and Duchess of Sussex's likely plans (er, non-plans) for that event:\n\n\"They are not working members of the royal family. I think for the king that prestigious spot up on Buckingham Palace's balcony is reserved for working family members. I'm sure people will read a lot into the family rift. We know there's great distance between Harry and his family, but in terms of whether he has a right to be on that palace balcony, he lost that right when he stepped down as a working member of the firm.\"\n\nTriple ouch!\n\nBut in the end, after all this unfortunate and unsettling insight, Nicholl has a surprising amount of hope for the situation. Really?! She believes that King Charles will make some kind of effort to meet with Harry and the Suits alum and their kids at some point later this year:\n\n\"Harry has said that he had hoped that, out of the adversity of his father's illness, he would reunify with the family. It's clearly very much his intention. My understanding is the king also wants to sort of rekindle his relationship with his son. He loves his son. He's a very forgiving man. I think he certainly wants to move on. While time hasn't been made available on this particular trip, it'll certainly be the king's hope that he will get to see Harry and his family at some point later this year.\"\n\nWow. Well, that would really be something. Seems like the father and son could have at least met this week with Harry in the area for the Invictus Games and all, but, OK. Thoughts, Perezcious readers??

After weeks of speculations about whether or not Harry would reconcile with the British monarch and his brother Prince William during his UK visit, the royals shocked the world with the revelation that the long-anticipated May 8 reunion would not happen. Although the royals attributed this to the king's \"full program,\" royal experts believe Harry's brother, William, influenced their dad's decision. King Charles' latest military appointment to Prince William during Prince Harry's UK visit further fueled this theory.\n\nOn Wednesday, May 8, King Charles appointed his older son as the Colonel-in-Chief of the Army Air Cops. According to royal expert Katie Nicholl, the military appointment to Prince William is a slap to Harry who would have otherwise earned the appointment if he had never stepped back from his royal duties.\n\nExplaining why the monarch's younger son would have been a deserving recipient of the said role, the royal expert cited his years of military experience, including serving two tours in Afghanistan. It appears the monarch knows this as well, opting to give William the role as a message to Harry. To further buttress this, he sought the perfect timing to ensure the prince knew he was being snubbed intentionally, as a consequence of his actions. Katie explained,\n\n\"You know, the timing is curious. I think many people will see that as a bit of a snub, really from the palace, and perhaps a little bit of a poke in the ribs to Prince Harry.\"\n\nInterestingly, the announcement of Prince William's new military appointment came just hours after Prince Harry arrived in the UK to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the Invictus Games. Despite championing the event that he founded for wounded military veterans, the prince could not wear his military uniform, having been stripped of his military titles in 2021. Katie added,\n\n\"It's probably another slap in the face for Prince Harry, and yet another reminder that he's very much out rather than in when it comes to the royal family.\"\n\nPrince Harry's military snub comes weeks after King Charles awarded several senior royals royal titles, including Prince William and his wife Kate Middleton. At the time, Kate, diagnosed with cancer earlier this year, became the first royal appointed to the order of Companions of Honour.

No, but probably because Harry is privy to nothing.\n\nThat didn't stop him from talking, or from presuming that such a catastrophic illness meant all would be forgiven.\n\n'I think any illness, any sickness, brings families together', Harry told ABC's Will Reeve days after that briefest of house calls.\n\n'I've got other trips planned that would take me through the UK or back to the UK,' Harry added, 'so I'll stop in and see my family as much as I can.'\n\nHow's that working out, Harry?\n\nKing Charles, currently battling cancer, was too 'busy' to carve out even a few moments for his son, instead hosting a garden party at Buckingham Palace.\n\nOf the 30,000 guests invited to that event, Harry did not make the list.\n\nRecall, too, that a well-sourced report in the UK press promptly speculated that Harry would step back in as a part-time working royal -- against the distinct orders of the late Queen -- to fill in for Charles and Kate.\n\nThat idea was quickly and unequivocally shot down.\n\nNo way back, well-placed sources told the Mail.\n\n'The terms of the [Sandringham] accord were very clear,' a highly-placed source said, 'and nothing that has happened recently, including the King's illness, has changed that.'\n\nNot a single royal -- not even his cousin Zara Tindall -- showed up to support Harry on Wednesday, or was seen with him during his very brief stint in London.\n\nHis wife stayed back in America.\n\nHe was not seen with a single friend. What a lonely existence Harry has conjured for himself, an existential hell of his own making.\n\nIn fact, the only relatives to support Harry this trip were his mother's siblings: Diana's sister Lady Jane Fellowes and her brother Charles -- he of the 'f-you' eulogy to the royals at Diana's funeral and currently peddling his memoir -- were present at St. Paul's on Wednesday.\n\nThis alliance can only further fracture Harry's position with the Palace. And without the Palace, he has nothing to offer.\n\nTo quote that legendary 'South Park' episode -- 'WAAAGH'!\n\nAnd what does this all mean for Meghan Markle?\n\nSurely she is drawing a ultra-fine, obscenely priced cashmere shawl by Loro Piana or the like over her shoulders, cradling a hot cuppa and wondering what this all bodes for #BrandSussex.\n\nHe was not seen with a single friend. What a lonely existence Harry has conjured for himself, an existential hell of his own making.\n\nSurely, Meghan is drawing a ultra-fine, obscenely priced cashmere shawl by Loro Piana or the like over her shoulders, cradling a hot cuppa and wondering what this all bodes for #BrandSussex.\n\nHow is one meant to merchandise sweetmeats and shower gels without the royal halo?\n\nTo credibly sell, as a friend told Meghan's mouthpiece Omid Scobie last year, 'Something rooted in her love of details, curating, hosting, life's simple pleasures, and family'?\n\nThe lack of self-awareness is jaw-dropping. It's terrifying, really, delusions that evoke Grand Guignol, the stuff of 'Sunset Boulevard' and 'Whatever Happened to Baby Jane'?\n\nSomeday in the not too-distant-future, Meghan risks finding herself rattling around in dilapidated grandeur, mistress of her own 'Grey Gardens', muttering about her former glories as a duchess, a basic cable star, and a suitcase girl who suffered on one of America's most popular game shows.\n\nPerhaps it's already begun. After all, where was our discount duchess at the Met Gala?\n\nIt's a problem when Lauren Sanchez is seen as classier than you. When Cardi B. is considered a glam addition to the red carpet. When Anna Wintour, a known monarchist, gives her assent to a pornified EmRata and all manner of greased-up, half-naked starlets but not you.\n\nIt's a problem when the majority of celebrities gifted your numbered jars of jam -- nestled among bruised lemons, stickers peeling -- apparently decline to acknowledge your wares on social media.\n\nBut then again, life's simple pleasures are hard to market when one is otherwise full of complaints and resentment.\n\nSomeday in the not too-distant-future, Meghan risks finding herself rattling around in dilapidated grandeur, mistress of her own 'Grey Gardens', muttering about her former glories as a duchess, a basic cable star, and a suitcase girl who suffered on one of America's most popular game shows. (Above) Meghan Markle's promotional photo from the TV Series 'Suits'\n\nIt's a problem when the majority of celebrities gifted your numbered jars of jam -- nestled among bruised lemons, stickers peeling -- apparently decline to acknowledge your wares on social media.\n\nAfter all, is there be a greater representative of family than Ms. Markle, who sat with Oprah -- Harry limply next to her -- and smugly implied that the royals were racists who didn't care that she was pregnant and suicidal?\n\nFear not, world, because delayed podcasts and dreams deferred will not keep Meghan Markle down!\n\nAfter Harry's ignominious visit to the UK, she is due to reunite with him in Nigeria on Friday, a three-day itinerary meant to evoke a royal tour.\n\nSurely, this is her moment.\n\nIndeed, after she married Harry -- per her claims of a 'Lion King' actor's praise for her -- people danced in the streets of South Africa, just as they did when Mandela was freed.\n\nWhat could possibly go

by siblings of his mother Princess Diana, took place just two miles away from Buckingham Palace, where King Charles was hosting a garden party.\n\nHowever, the father and son will not meet during the brief time the Duke of Sussex spends in the UK before heading home to California, with the monarch reportedly saying he is 'too busy'.\n\nA spokesperson for Harry said: 'The Duke of course is understanding of his father's diary of commitments and various other priorities and hopes to see him soon.'\n\nInstead, he has filled his time in the country with a packed programme of events celebrating ten years of his sports event for wounded servicemen and women.\n\nAfter arriving on Tuesday, the duke attended a summit at the headquarters of the Honourable Artillery Company near the City of London.\n\nAt this evening's service in St Paul's, he sat beside ex-Army officer Mark Daly, who acted as a mentor figure for the young prince after Diana died in a car crash in 1997.\n\nNobody from his father's side of the family was believed to be among the congregation of around a thousand in attendance.\n\nHarry is expected to read a passage from the Bible as part of the ceremony.\n\nThe Very Reverend Andrew Tremlett, Dean of St Paul's, told the congregation: 'We gather this evening to offer grateful thanksgiving to Almighty God for the work of the Invictus Games Foundation, and in this their 10th anniversary year, we celebrate the tremendous achievements of the numerous competitors across 23 nations.\n\n'We give thanks for the inspiring vision and compassion that formed the foundation and, chiefly, for the resultant decade of profound and transformational work.'\n\nThe first Buckingham Palace garden party of the year was the destination for most of the other senior members of the Royal Family today.\n\nKing Charles was joined by Queen Camilla, Princess Anne, and Edward and Sophie, the Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh at the palace.\n\nAround 8,000 other people were also in attendance at the event.\n\nMeanwhile, Prince William was rubbing shoulders with Hollywood and sporting legends at a Windsor Castle investiture ceremony.\n\nFilm director Sir Ridley Scott and England goalkeepers Peter Shilton CBE and Mary Earps MBE were among those formally receiving their honours from the Prince of Wales.\n\nMORE : King Charles gives Harry ultimate snub after son

The grand celebration took place merely two miles away from the Invictus Games' 10th anniversary celebration. The party marks King Charles' one of very few public engagements since his cancer diagnosis.\n\nWith more than 8,000 guests at the party, King Charles was joined by close relatives, including Anne, Princess Royal; the Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh, Prince Edward and Sophie; and the Duke and Duchess of Gloucester, Prince Richard and Birgitte. However, Prince William and Kate Middleton were nowhere to be seen, per Mirror. The outlet reveals that King Charles donned a grey suit and light blue waistcoat.\n\nAhead of Prince Harry's arrival in the UK, there were speculations about a potential father-son meeting. However, a spokesperson for the Duke confirmed that King Charles' \"full programme\" would render it impossible. \"In response to the many inquiries and continued speculation on whether or not the Duke will meet with his father while in the U.K. this week, it, unfortunately, will not be possible due to His Majesty's full program,\" the spokesperson told The Telegraph.\n\nAlthough his immediate relatives remained absent at the ceremony, Prince Harry was notably joined by his cousin Louis Spencer, uncle Earl Charles Spencer and aunt Lady Jane Fellowes, \"second dad\" Mark \"Marko\" Dyer, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's wife Akshata Murty and his lawyer David Sherbourne. The Duke of Sussex was received with a roar of cheers from the crowd outside St. Paul's upon his arrival.", "source": {"uri": "hindustantimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hindustan Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_I_of_England", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Charles I of England"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William,_Prince_of_Wales", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "William, Prince of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Harry,_Duke_of_Sussex", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invictus_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Invictus Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Edward,_Duke_of_Edinburgh", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prince Edward, Duke of Edinburgh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophie,_Duchess_of_Edinburgh", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sophie, Duchess of Edinburgh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catherine,_Princess_of_Wales", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Catherine, Princess of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Richard,_Duke_of_Gloucester", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prince Richard, Duke of Gloucester"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duke_of_Gloucester", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Duke of Gloucester"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anne,_Princess_Royal", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anne, Princess Royal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akshata_Murty", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Akshata Murty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jane_Fellowes,_Lady_Fellowes", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jane Fellowes, Lady Fellowes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rishi_Sunak", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rishi Sunak"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Spencer,_9th_Earl_Spencer", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Charles Spencer, 9th Earl Spencer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Daily_Telegraph", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Daily Telegraph"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Paul's_Cathedral", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "St Paul's Cathedral"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Genealogy/Royalty", "label": "dmoz/Society/Genealogy/Royalty", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Monarchy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Monarchy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History/Historical_Personages", "label": "dmoz/Society/History/Historical Personages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Tile_Games/Kings_Cribbage", "label": "dmoz/Games/Tile Games/Kings Cribbage", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 50}], "image": "https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2024/05/08/1600x900/2024-05-08T174100_1715192445020_1715192445265.JPG", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550326", "eventUri": "eng-9550326", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1058823529411765, "wgt": 151, "relevance": 1}

There was speculation that Harry might have to attend the event solo, given the Royal Family's decision not to participate.\n\nFortunately, Earl Spencer and Lady Jane Fellowes, both siblings of the late Princess Diana, arrived to show their support for Harry.\n\nRoyal expert Tom Quinn believes the show of solidarity \"speaks volumes about where their loyalties lie\".\n\nSpeaking exclusively to The Mirror, he said: \"Harry may have cut a lonely figure at St Pauls, but he did have one other family supporting him - his mother's family. Diana's sister Lady Jane Fellowes was there as well as her brother, Earl Spencer.\n\n\"The Spencer family have always felt uncomfortable with the Royal Family after the death of Harry and William's mother. Earl Spencer, Diana's brother, was openly critical of the way the Royal Family treated his sister and of course that criticism largely centred on Prince Charles (as he then was).\"\n\nPrincess Diana sadly died in August 1997 in a fatal car crash in Paris. Tom said there is \"still a lot of bitterness around\" and said the Spencers' decision to support Harry was significant.\n\nThe expert told : \"The fact that the Spencers were out in force for Harry on this visit speaks volumes about where their loyalties lie. Like Harry, the Spencers still see the Royal Family, to some extent, as the enemy.\n\n\"If anyone is taking sides, the Spencers will always take sides with Harry simply because they feel he was hard done by and Harry hugely appreciates their support.\"\n\nWhile Earl Charles Spencer and Lady Jane Fellowes attended the Invictus Games service, Harry was alone as he walked up the steps to the entrance of the cathedral. As the event took place, King Charles was flanked by a huge contingent of royals in a show of unity at this afternoon's Buckingham Palace garden party, which took place just two miles away.\n\nFor the unversed the then Prince Charles and Lady Diana Spencer were married at St. Paul's on July 29, 1981, in a traditional Church of England wedding service.\n\nLater on December 9, 1992, it was announced that Charles and Diana had decided to separate but would continue to fulfill their public duties and to share the responsibility of raising their sons.\n\nOn April 9, 2005, he married Camilla Parker Bowles with whom he had a long-standing relationship; after the wedding, Parker Bowles took the title of duchess of Cornwall.", "source": {"uri": "thenews.com.pk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The News International"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Harry,_Duke_of_Sussex", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_royal_family", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "British royal family"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Spencer,_9th_Earl_Spencer", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Charles Spencer, 9th Earl Spencer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invictus_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Invictus Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diana,_Princess_of_Wales", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Diana, Princess of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jane_Fellowes,_Lady_Fellowes", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jane Fellowes, Lady Fellowes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Paul's_Cathedral", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "St Paul's Cathedral"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spencer_family", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spencer family"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_Diana,_Princess_of_Wales", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Death of Diana, Princess of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_I_of_England", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Charles I of England"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Mirror", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Daily Mirror"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wedding_of_Prince_Charles_and_Lady_Diana_Spencer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wedding of Prince Charles and Lady Diana Spencer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_Camilla", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Queen Camilla"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_of_England", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Church of England"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckingham_Palace", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Buckingham Palace"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornwall", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cornwall"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cornwall"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Genealogy/Royalty", "label": "dmoz/Society/Genealogy/Royalty", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/General_Merchandise/O", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/General Merchandise/O", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 66}], "image": "https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2024-05-09/l_1187113_071026_updates.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550326", "eventUri": "eng-9550326", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "1992-12-09", "textStart": 2348, "textEnd": 2364}, {"amb": false, "date": "2005-04-09", "textStart": 2539, "textEnd": 2552}, {"amb": false, "date": "1997-08-", "textStart": 1274, "textEnd": 1285}], "sentiment": -0.1058823529411764, "wgt": 150, "relevance": 1}

But when King Charles was diagnosed with cancer in February, Harry rushed to London for a brief visit with his father. He said he planned to be back in the U.K. soon, and would \"see my family as much as I can.\"\n\nHarry is currently on one of those planned visits. He returned to London on May 8 to mark the tenth anniversary of the Invictus Games, a sports competition for wounded veterans that he founded. But Buckingham Palace has made it pretty clear that the royals' general stance toward the Spare memoirist hasn't changed.\n\nKing Charles is pretending, once again, that he's simply too busy to see his son. This message was first conveyed via a leak to The Telegraph last week:\n\nHowever, any potential meeting between the pair is likely to be brief as the King's diary is \"quite busy\", The Telegraph understands.\n\nAs former BuzzFeed News royal correspondent Ellie Hall explained amid the \"where is Kate Middleton\" debacle, this is how royal press offices typically comment without actually commenting:\n\nInstead of going on the record, royal press offices will give briefings and in some situations provide information to a core group of royal reporters -- with the caveat that these reporters won't say that the information came from an official spokesperson. Phrases like \"this reporter understands\" or \"this news outlet can confirm\" are very common in stories about the royal family.\n\nQuestions about a royal reunion persisted, as no one was satisfied by this tired and somewhat absurd excuse. And since Buckingham Palace would not say anything on the record, Prince Harry took it upon himself to confirm that his father wouldn't see him.\n\n\"In response to the many inquiries and continued speculation on whether or not the duke will meet with his father while in the U.K. this week, it unfortunately will not be possible due to His Majesty's full programme,\" a spokesman for the Duke of Sussex said on Tuesday.\n\n\"The duke of course is understanding of his father's diary of commitments and various other priorities and hopes to see him soon.\"\n\nApparently Buckingham Palace did not find this sufficiently humiliating. So just a few hours later, it announced that King Charles had found time in his \"quite busy\" diary to formally put Prince William in charge of Prince Harry's old regiment, the Army Air Corp. Per The Independent:\n\n\"His Majesty the King will officially hand over the role of Colonel-in-Chief of the Army Air Corps to His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales,\" the palace said in a statement.\n\n\"In August 2023, following His Majesty's Accession, the King was pleased to announce military appointments including that the Prince of Wales would become Colonel-in-Chief of the Army Air Corps. The role was previously held by His Majesty the King, as Prince of Wales, for 31 years.\"\n\nWilliam was an air ambulance pilot between 2015 and 2017 and was not involved in active combat. Prince Harry served two tours in Afghanistan; the second was with the Army Air Corps from 2012-2013. The younger prince was expected to be named colonel-in-chief until he stepped back from royal duties in 2020.\n\nWilliam taking the role wasn't a surprise. As the statement notes, the Palace said he would be the next colonel-in-chief of the Army Air Corps over a year ago. So did the announcement about next week's rare father-son ceremony making the change official really need to go out within hours of Harry's statement? Probably not.\n\nStill, it's hard to say how much of this double snub came from King Charles himself and how much is attributable to palace aides. Presumably, the king could see his son if he really wanted to, but he isn't hitting \"send\" on royal press releases. Dubious excuses and nasty PR moves may be more attributable to \"the institution\" that Prince Harry thoroughly trashed in Spare.", "source": {"uri": "nymag.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NYMag"}, "authors": [{"uri": "margaret_hartmann@nymag.com", "name": "Margaret Hartmann", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Harry,_Duke_of_Sussex", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_I_of_England", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Charles I of England"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_royal_family", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "British royal family"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Daily_Telegraph", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "The Daily Telegraph"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckingham_Palace", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Buckingham Palace"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meghan,_Duchess_of_Sussex", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Meghan, Duchess of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invictus_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Invictus Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catherine,_Princess_of_Wales", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Catherine, Princess of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_XVI_Gustaf", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Carl XVI Gustaf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BuzzFeed_News", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "BuzzFeed News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Army_Air_Corps_(United_Kingdom)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Army Air Corps (United Kingdom)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonel-in-chief", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Colonel-in-chief"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_VIII", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Edward VIII"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William,_Prince_of_Wales", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "William, Prince of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_of_Wales", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prince of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "British Army"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regiment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Regiment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_relations", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Public relations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Highness", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Royal Highness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Independent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Independent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Afghanistan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Afghanistan"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Genealogy/Royalty", "label": "dmoz/Society/Genealogy/Royalty", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Monarchy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Monarchy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History/Historical_Personages", "label": "dmoz/Society/History/Historical Personages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Tile_Games/Kings_Cribbage", "label": "dmoz/Games/Tile Games/Kings Cribbage", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 72}], "image": "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/970/ca0/9192829fa74920cdb91cde897aff2968de-5-8-Charles.1x.rsocial.w1200.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550326", "eventUri": "eng-9550326", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-08", "textStart": 665, "textEnd": 670}], "sentiment": -0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 150, "relevance": 1}

With a smile and a wave, he walked up the steps of St Paul's Cathedral as a lone figure, his staff and security making their way in slightly away from the cameras.\n\nInside, though, it was a different story: the Spencer family rode to the very public rescue.\n\nHis uncle Earl Spencer and aunt Lady Jane Fellowes were waiting with hugs, three of Prince Harry's Spencer cousins behind them.\n\n\"Thanks for coming,\" Prince Harry told the Earl, looking sincere as he pulled back from the maternal family embrace. He blew a kiss and waved at others.\n\nThe Invictus veterans and competitors always give the Prince a warm welcome, but the presence of some family members was a visible boost to his spirits.\n\nIt was enough to inspire The Sun front page to declare: \"Diana's Family Backs Harry.\"\n\n\"Now that Harry has left the Royal family, the Spencers have laid claim to him again,\" said Ingrid Seward, editor of Majesty magazine.\n\nThe invitation, and its acceptance, brought the rare spotlight onto the side of the Prince's family he has valued over the years, a quiet but constant part of his adult life.\n\nHe has mentioned them only occasionally, sparing them from the truth-telling pages of his memoir save for in the acknowledgements where he offered \"stand out thanks to my mother's siblings for their love, support, time and perspective\".\n\nHis paternal family - so well-covered throughout the book, his Netflix series, and his interviews - were not thanked.\n\nThe King, it is claimed, was invited to the Invictus Games service. The Prince and Princess of Wales were sent invitations, but were not able to attend.\n\nThe King was at a garden party a few miles away, his first since his diagnosis with cancer. Prince William conducted an investiture in Windsor on the same day and the Princess, as is well known, is out of the public eye during a course of preventative chemotherapy.\n\nInside the cathedral, those watching Prince Harry noted his relatively newfound confidence in delivering his reading, and the animation with which he turned around in his seat to chat to the Spencers.\n\nThey have rarely appeared in public with him over the years, but have remained present - not least in their roles as the closest remaining link to his late mother.\n\nHis aunts in particular have been there in the shadows, should one care to look closely.\n\nIn a 2017 television interview to mark her engagement, Meghan Markle said: \"I think in being able to meet his aunts ... I'm able to, in some way, know a part of her [Diana] through them and, of course, through him. And it's incredibly special.\"\n\nLady Jane, the middle of the three sisters, gave a reading at Prince Harry and Meghan's wedding, and is said to have been one of the first people introduced to a newborn Prince Archie.\n\nBoth Lady Jane and Lady Sarah were included in the formal photographs from Prince Archie's christening.\n\nAt the Invictus Games service, Prince Harry was seen deep in conversation with both the Earl and Lady Jane, beaming at them as they waited for the service to start.\n\nThe venue, St Paul's, was evocative in itself, where Lady Diana Spencer's siblings watched in 1981 as she married Prince Charles and became the new Princess of Wales.\n\nSixteen years later, with the 12-year-old Prince Harry watching on, Earl Spencer rocked the establishment with a eulogy in which he called his sister the \"most hunted person of the modern age\".\n\nAddressing her \"beloved boys\", he said then: \"I pledge that we, your blood family, will do all we can to continue the imaginative and loving way in which you were steering these two exceptional young men, so that their souls are not simply immersed by duty and tradition, but can sing openly as you planned.\"\n\nHe has since passed occasional comment on the Royal family. In 2002, in an interview with The Guardian, he is quoted as remarking: \"What I can say is that they may not be encouraged to stay in touch with their mother's side of the family.\"\n\nIn 2017, on Radio 4, he claimed he had been \"lied to\" about Princes William and Harry \"wanting\" to walk behind their mother's coffin.\n\nThis time, his appearance was low-key. Before the service, it was rumoured that all three of Diana's siblings would attend, but Lady Sarah McCorquodale was not seen. Her son George, 39, was there along with Lady Lara and Louis Spencer, Viscount Althorp.\n\nThe Earl's only public comment was made afterwards on social media site X. \"I hope my father would have approved that I wore his Royal Scots Greys regimental cufflinks at \u2066the moving celebration of 10 years of \u2066@WeAreInvictus\u2069 at @StPaulsLondon\u2069 yesterday,\" he said.\n\nIngrid Seward, author of recent royal biography My Mother and I, notes that the late Diana, Princess of Wales was \"proud of her Spencer heritage as is Viscount Althorp and as is Harry\".\n\n\"He is close to what he calls his 'red aunts',\" she says, a reference to the family hair colour.\n\nThe Duke of Sussex, as he left St Paul's, had a spring in his step. Launching into a walkabout, he fell into the tried-and-tested pattern of handshakes and snippets of conversation: \"Very nice to meet you. How are you? Have you come on holiday?\"\n\nWhen one member of the public told him they were in London for a wedding, he turned to point at St Paul's and joked: \"Not in here?\"\n\nShown the two cameras held by another, he exclaimed: \"You've got two cameras? That doesn't even make sense!\"\n\nHe and the Duchess will fly to Nigeria for a three-day trip, also based around military veterans, arriving on Friday.\n\nThe image, as Harry leaves Britain once again, is still of a divided family.\n\nThe Royal family, as ever, will remain silent. The Spencers, by turning up, have said it all.", "source": {"uri": "ca.style.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!"}, "authors": [{"uri": "hannah_furness@ca.style.yahoo.com", "name":

Harry was seen walking up the steps wearing a navy suit and his military medals and he smiled and waved as the crowd cheered.\n\nHarry was then given a warm welcome by the Dean of St Paul's, the Very Reverend Andrew Tremlett. Body language expert Judi James believes Harry was \"grateful for the reception\" after a no-show from his family.\n\nFor all the latest on news, politics, sports, and showbiz from the USA, go to The Mirror US.\n\nREAD MORE: Prince Harry sits next to 'second dad' Mark 'Marko' Dyer at Invictus service after King Charles snub\n\nPrince Harry was given a warm welcome as he arrived at St Paul's Cathedral\n\nSpeaking exclusively to The Mirror, Judi said: \"Despite those medals pinned to his chest and despite the couple of friendly grins he threw at the crowds, Harry's body language here suggested a slightly forlorn and wary inner state as he exited his car and made his way up the steps to the church.\n\n!He buttoned his jacket and then kept his hand there, even replacing it as he shook hands with the clergy, suggesting a need for a partial barrier gesture. His three waves to the crowd were relatively humble rather than royal, with the palm held out and the fingers splayed and more of an over-the-shoulder glance than any creation of a more static and deliberate pose of greeting.\n\n\"His grin suggested he was grateful for the reception and keen to create some friendly bonds with the crowds here. The way the grin widened as he turned for one last wave also suggested a possible sense of relief that he had got this very public solo arrival over.\"\n\nHundreds of people gathered in London to catch a glimpse of the Duke of Sussex\n\nHundreds of fans had gathered outside St Paul's Cathedral hoping to catch a glimpse of Harry. He was cheered as he made his way inside the venue.\n\nMeghan Markle decided not to join her husband as he returned to the UK and it was reported she was \"wary\" of getting booed at the Invictus Games event. The Daily Mail's Richard Eden told Palace Confidential: \"She does not want to return to Britain in a hurry. There are many people here who won't be sad about that. Meghan will be wary of getting booed at St Paul's.\"\n\nRoyal Correspondent Jack Royston also told Newsweek's Royal Report podcast: \"The centrepiece of this visit is a service of Thanksgiving for Invictus at St. Paul's Cathedral. Now the last time Meghan went there, Meghan and Harry were booed by royalists.\n\n\"That was during Queen Elizabeth II's Platinum Jubilee. There were cheers as well, but there were certainly boos, and that was during a similar service of Thanksgiving.\"\n\n* Follow Mirror Celebs on TikTok, Snapchat, Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, YouTube and Threads.", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri": "scarlett_o_toole@mirror.co.uk", "name": "Scarlett O'Toole", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Harry,_Duke_of_Sussex", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invictus_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Invictus Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Paul's_Cathedral", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "St Paul's Cathedral"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Mirror", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Daily Mirror"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_royal_family", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "British royal family"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Tremlett", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Andrew Tremlett"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dean_of_St_Paul's", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dean of St Paul's"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_family", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Royal family"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathedral", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cathedral"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_I_of_England", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Charles I of England"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clergy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Clergy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platinum_Jubilee_of_Elizabeth_II", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Platinum Jubilee of Elizabeth II"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "TikTok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meghan,_Duchess_of_Sussex", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Meghan, Duchess of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thanksgiving_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Thanksgiving (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cavalier", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cavalier"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newsweek", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Newsweek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Podcast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Mail", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Daily Mail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snapchat", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Snapchat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Architecture/Building_Types", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Architecture/Building Types", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Genealogy/Royalty", "label": "dmoz/Society/Genealogy/Royalty", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Monarchy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Monarchy", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Large_Families", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Large Families", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Family_Resources_and_Support", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Family Resources and Support", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article32766025.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_Ceremony_MAIN_Excl.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550326", "eventUri": "eng-9550326", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3411764705882352, "wgt": 149, "relevance": 1}

And though the royal firm at first attempted to keep it secret, Kate Middleton also has cancer.\n\nEven the harshest critics of the royal family will mince words when it comes to someone undergoing cancer treatments. Though, to be blunt, neither Charles or Kate seem to be the primary antagonists of Prince Harry's royal experiences.\n\nThough Prince Harry and William continue to feud, Harry has made multiple trips to the UK to see his father, King Charles. Especially in light of his cancer diagnosis.\n\nEven when he cannot see his father -- who has a very busy schedule -- Harry has affirmed his love and support for him in various interviews.\n\nHarry has every right to share his story with the world. However, if he wants to hold off upon saying more while some of his closest family are undergoing cancer treatments, that is very reasonable.", "source": {"uri": "thehollywoodgossip.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hollywood Gossip"}, "authors": [{"uri": "simon_delott@thehollywoodgossip.com", "name": "Simon Delott", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Harry,_Duke_of_Sussex", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoir", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Memoir"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_royal_family", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "British royal family"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_I_of_England", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Charles I of England"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Enquirer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Enquirer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catherine,_Princess_of_Wales", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Catherine, Princess of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/General_Merchandise/O", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/General Merchandise/O", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 83}], "image": "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/0508_princeharry_header-scaled.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550326", "eventUri": "eng-9550326", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1529411764705881, "wgt": 148, "relevance": 1}

They just need to knock on the door and say, 'Hi. We've all had it in our families before.'\n\n\"Well perhaps, royal sources have long argued, if his accusations hadn't been so hurtful, and the spilling of family confidences so spitefully public.\n\nYour cookie settings are preventing this third party content from displaying.\n\nIf you'd like to view this content, please adjust your Cookie Settings.\n\nTo find out more about how we use cookies, please see our Cookie Guide.\n\nOver at Buckingham Palace, the King (who Harry made clear this week was too busy to see him) had a packed morning of meetings before greeting 8000 guests, who had been invited to the garden party for their service to communities, the military or charities and other organisations at 4pm.\n\nHe was accompanied by his wife the Queen, the Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh, the Princess Royal and the Duke and Duchess of Gloucester.\n\nIt was a clear sign of solidarity for Charles, 75, who has just been given permission to carry out more forward-facing public duties by doctors amid his ongoing cancer battle.\n\nWhile he continues treatment, each engagement is being calibrated to balance his desire to meet as many members of the public as possible with his health.\n\nAides are particularly keen he is protected as much as possible from picking up any colds or bugs.\n\nAlthough there were thousands of guests present, however, the event was deemed appropriate as it takes place outside on the palace lawn.\n\nThe King may have met slightly fewer people than he would do in a normal year but the changes were minimal - and he was clearly delighted to get out and shake as many hands as he could.\n\nAfter standing on the terrace for the National Anthem, the King was escorted by the Yeoman of the Guard down to the lawn to mingle with the crowds.\n\nSpontaneous applause erupted at the sight of His Majesty as he began to move along his predetermined \"lane\", escorted by gentleman ushers in top hats and tails.\n\n\"God bless you\", said one man, clasping his hands. \"I've dreamt of this all my life.\"\n\nAnother added: \"So glad you are looking so much better.\"\n\n\"I'm not doing badly,\" Charles smiled, clearly touched.\n\nDozens asked after his health and told him how good it was to see him back in public again.\n\n\"How are you feeling, Sir?\" one man asked.\n\n\"Not too bad,\" he replied.\n\nSpotting one guest tucking into a plate of cakes, the King joked: \"Did you make them yourself? Are you being looked after?\"\n\n\"Good to see you out and about again,\" he was told.\n\nThe Queen, meanwhile, appeared touched as one guest told her: \"We are thinking of you.\"\n\nThe couple met up just before they got to the Royal Tea Tent, with Camilla - clearly keen for a cuppa - jokingly ushering her husband on as he continued to chat.\n\nAlthough there had been expectations the King might cut his visit short slightly, he left not long after 5pm as he normally does.\n\nAs he made his way out of the palace garden to prepare for his weekly audience with the Prime Minister followed by a full Privy Council meeting, Harry was arriving at St Paul's.\n\nA significant crowd had gathered, mostly an opportunistic one, who largely cheered at Harry's arrival but sounded the odd \"boo\" too.\n\nThe prince waved and headed inside to greet members of the extensive congregation, appearing smiling and relaxed.\n\nHarry listened intently as Damian Lewis gave a theatrical reading of the poem Invictus by WE Henley, and offered his own from Corinthians.\n\nHe also appeared emotional as Michelle Turner, vice-captain of Team UK at Sydney Invictus, thanked the competition for \"giving me my life back\".\n\nThe prince, who remains fifth in line to the throne despite not undertaking any official duties or living in the UK, is due to leave on Thursday, according to reports.\n\nHe is set to fly to Nigeria with his wife Meghan, ostensibly to publicise the Invictus Games but on what has also been described as a \"quasi-royal tour\".\n\nWith his father in Surrey for a military visit and Prince William in Cornwall on official engagements, there will be no time for a last minute change of heart -

The service followed two high-profile snubs during Harry's London trip; his claim, made in a public statement, that his father was too busy to see him, and then the palace revealing William was to made head of Harry's old regiment. Even when they do not see each other, the royals find their own ways to trade blows.\n\nIt was hard to believe, as Harry walked into the cavernous church in London for a service to mark the tenth anniversary of the Invictus Games, that his widely-praised initiative for wounded servicemen once enjoyed the support not just of Harry's father, King Charles III, and brother, Prince William, but also the late Queen Elizabeth II herself. Indeed, Elizabeth went as far as recording a comedy video also featuring Barack and Michelle Obama to promote it in 2016.\n\nNow however, the event has been stripped of royal affiliation. A military source recently told The Daily Beast, \"Some people feel it's not fair to deny the foundation proper royal endorsement. It was explicitly set up as an organization endorsed by the royal family, but now it's not.\" Indeed, the working royals seemed determined to overshadow Harry's big day.\n\nCharles was hosting a garden party for 5,000 people on the great lawn at Buckingham Palace, and William made his own headlines at Windsor Castle earlier in the day, hosting an investiture honoring, among others, Gladiator director Sir Ridley Scott.\n\nThe Invictus ceremony looked low wattage by comparison. Top flight British celebrities are now understandably wary of being associated with Harry for fear they will be blackballed by the king and William.\n\nHarry's most high profile guest was the actor Damian Lewis, who was due to read the poem Invictus, by William Ernest Henley from which the organization takes its name.\n\nHarry may, at least, have been able to draw comfort from the poem's closing lines, where the poet ponders that, despite the hardships visited upon him by life: \"I am the master of my fate, I am the captain of my soul.\"\n\nSome insiders believe that the royals are making a mistake by not supporting Harry's cause.\n\nOne source, a former courtier, told The Daily Beast last week: \"Charles has made it quite clear he is ready to be friendly and supportive to Harry in his capacity as a private person, as his dad, but he is not going to throw the weight of the institution behind Invictus again. This all seems very logical inside the Palace bubble, but the trouble is that people who don't particularly care about such things, who are dimly aware that the royals spend their days visiting community centers and opening supermarkets, are going to wonder why they are boycotting this terrific charity that is headed by the king's son.\n\n\"Many of us think this is a classic example of the royals cutting off their nose to spite their face, because Invictus is clearly exactly the kind of organization the royal family should be supporting. If a bridge is ever going to be built [between Harry and the royals], Invictus is the bridgehead to build it from, and they should get on and do it.\"\n\nRead more at The Daily Beast.\n\nGet the Daily Beast's biggest scoops and scandals delivered right to your inbox.

The prince developed the idea after attending the veterans Warrior Games in the U.S. a year earlier and expanded on its vision to provide injured, sick and wounded ex-armed forces members with an international platform to display their mental and physical rehabilitation through sport.\n\nHarry's attendance at the 10th anniversary service of thanksgiving for the games at St Paul's on Wednesday afternoon was made as speculation surrounded his relationship with royal family members, principally his father, King Charles III.\n\nOn Tuesday an announcement was made by Harry's spokesperson confirming that despite speculation, the prince would not spend time with the king during his U.K. visit. A meeting, they said, \"will not be possible due to His Majesty's full program.\"\n\nAt the time of Harry's Invictus service, Charles was hosting a garden party for 8,000 guests at Buckingham Palace alongside Queen Camilla and a number of senior royals.\n\nDespite his popularity being reduced in Britain since his split from the monarchy with Meghan Markle in 2020 and the publication of his bombshell memoir three years later, Harry received a heartening response from well-wishers who turned out at St Paul's to witness the arrivals for the service.\n\nUploaded to TikTok by user theroyaldiary2, footage of the prince's arrival and the cheers he was met with has gone viral, gaining over 100,000 views in less than 24 hours.\n\nCaptioned \"I'm so happy for Prince Harry,\" and \"This makes me so emotional, the reception he received was amazing,\" the footage shows Harry exiting a Land Rover at the steps of the cathedral before climbing them to be met by a member of the clergy.\n\nThe clip has received in excess of 5,000 likes and over 600 comments so far, many of which have praised the royal and the warmth he received from the crowd.\n\n\"We love you and your family \ud83d\ude4f,\" wrote one TikTok user.\n\n\"The People's Prince \ud83d\udc96\ud83d\udca5,\" posted another, with a further comment reading: \"We need to walk in his shoes before we judge him \ud83d\ude4f\u2764.\"\n\nHarry was the only member of the royal family to attend the service but he did have relatives in the congregation.\n\nSeveral members of Princess Diana's family were invited to the event.

But it's been particularly egregious this week, all of it stemming from Prince Harry's spokesperson issuing a simple statement - not even an angry or shady statement - merely confirming the fact that Harry would not see his father during his trip to the UK and citing the king's full schedule as the reason. In response, Buckingham Palace has been on the bloody warpath, leaking some really insidery sh-t to Richard Kay and Charlotte Griffiths, both of them Daily Mail writers. Palace insiders were authorized to do Charles and Camilla's dirty work and smear Harry as unnamed palace sources. But Harry is not allowed to tell the truth about the whole rotten institution in his own words. That is the cardinal sin for this WASP mafia. Please allow even more royal sources to throw a huge hissy fit about why Charles refused to meet Harry. You see, it was never about the king's schedule after all, who would have thought. It was all about Harry's hatred for Camilla, and Harry \"selling out\" his family by, you know, writing about how he was traumatized, abused and neglected for much of his life.\n\nKing Charles decided not to meet his son Prince Harry in London this week because of Harry's \"cruel\" remarks about his wife, Queen Camilla, in his memoir, Spare, a friend of Charles and Camilla has told The Daily Beast.\n\n\"Harry has made things very difficult for himself by saying such cruel and hurtful things about Camilla,\" the friend told The Daily Beast. \"Charles loves his sons, but he also loves his wife. The last few months have made it very clear how important she is; she has been the one propping up the whole edifice. Harry has made it very clear, very publicly, that he despises her. He has forced Charles to choose, which was a very silly thing to do because Camilla and he both chose each other a long time ago.\"\n\n\"William had his reservations but he accepted his father's choice and got on with it. Harry made a different decision, and one of the inevitable consequences of publicly calling your stepmother cruel names is that it becomes difficult for you to see your father.\"\n\nAnother source, a friend of William and Kate's, quipped: \"It is hardly surprising that Charles didn't invite Harry round for tea and a scone. He did, after all, portray his wife as an evil, calculating, bitch in the biggest selling book since the Bible.\" [In fact, Spare broke records for being the fastest-selling non-fiction book but it is not, yet at least, certified as the biggest selling non-fiction book of all time.]\n\nAnother source, a former Buckingham Palace staffer, said, \"As far as the palace is concerned, the further away that Harry and Meghan are from Buckingham Palace the better. Look how distracting Harry's visit has been this week. The media should be talking about the king's return to work, instead we are talking about a 39 year old man's daddy issues. If Harry thinks he can drop in for a cuppa at Clarence House whenever he happens to be changing planes in London, that would encourage him to come here more often, which is the exact opposite of what the institution typically wants from exiled family members. The whole point of being exiled is that you are out of sight and out of mind.\"\n\nThe courtier also said that Harry's statement saying his father had declined to meet him was \"childish.\" In the statement, Harry's spokesperson said: \"In response to the many inquiries and continued speculation on whether or not the Duke will meet with his father while in the U.K. this week, it unfortunately will not be possible due to His Majesty's full program. The Duke of course is understanding of his father's diary of commitments and various other priorities and hopes to see him soon.\"\n\nThe source said, \"It was classic Harry -- childish and petulant foot-stamping. Everything is always someone else's fault. Even Harry must know the reason a meeting isn't happening is not due to Charles' 'full program' -- it's because Harry sold out his own family.\"\n\n[From The Daily Beast]\n\nChildish and foot-stamping? \"The Duke of course is understanding of his father's diary of commitments and various other priorities and hopes to see him soon.\" What... what is childish about that? It's a model of maturity - an adult son understanding that his father carefully planned some busy work around his visit and the son is just cutting his losses with maturity. It sounds more like a 75 year old man threw a childish tantrum because Harry was getting more attention than him this week. Also: whenever \"sources\" go overboard describing Charles's affection for Camilla or how important she is to the institution, that's coming straight from the horse's mouth, so to speak. That's ALL coming from Camilla's office, from her operations. That being said, if Charles wanted to meet Harry (without Camilla's presence), he would have. He didn't want to. Harry accepted his choice, issued a statement confirming it and proceeded to move ahead with his schedule. And that's what has upset the left-behinds even more.", "source": {"uri": "celebitchy.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Celebitchy"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_Camilla", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Queen Camilla"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_I_of_England", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Charles I of England"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Harry,_Duke_of_Sussex", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Daily_Beast", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "The Daily Beast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckingham_Palace", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Buckingham Palace"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_deadly_sins", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Seven deadly sins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypocrisy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hypocrisy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Mail", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Daily Mail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte,_North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Charlotte, North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Charlotte, North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoir", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Memoir"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tea", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duke", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Duke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bible"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dog"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scone", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Courtier", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Courtier"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarence_House", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Clarence House"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 85}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550326", "eventUri": "eng-9550326", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 148, "relevance": 1}

It was speculated Harry would have to face the event alone, as the Royal Family decided not to attend the event.\n\nLuckily, Earl Spencer and Lady Jane Fellowes, both siblings of the late Princess Diana, turned up to support Harry. Royal expert Tom Quinn believes the show of solidarity \"speaks volumes about where their loyalties lie\".\n\nFor all the latest on news, politics, sports, and showbiz from the USA, go to The Mirror US.\n\nREAD MORE: Prince Harry's eight-word response to fans as he walked away from cheering crowds\n\nSpeaking exclusively to The Mirror, he said: \"Harry may have cut a lonely figure at St Paul's, but he did have one other family supporting him - his mother's family. Diana's sister Lady Jane Fellowes was there as well as her brother, Earl Spencer\n\n\"The Spencer family have always felt uncomfortable with the Royal Family after the death of Harry and William's mother. Earl Spencer, Diana's brother, was openly critical of the way the Royal Family treated his sister and of course that criticism largely centred on Prince Charles (as he then was).\"\n\nPrincess Diana sadly died in August 1997 in a fatal car crash in Paris. Tom said there is \"still a lot of bitterness around\" and said the Spencers' decision to support Harry was significant.\n\nThe expert told us: \"The fact that the Spencers were out in force for Harry on this visit speaks volumes about where their loyalties lie. Like Harry, the Spencers still see the Royal Family, to some extent, as the enemy.\n\n\"If anyone is taking sides, the Spencers will always take sides with Harry simply because they feel he was hard done by and Harry hugely appreciates their support.\"\n\nWhile Earl Charles Spencer and Lady Jane Fellowes attended the Invictus Games service, Harry was alone as he walked up the steps to the entrance of the cathedral. As the event took place, King Charles was flanked by a huge contingent of royals in a show of unity at a Buckingham Palace garden party, which took place just two miles away.\n\n*Follow Mirror Celebs on TikTok , Snapchat , Instagram , Twitter , Facebook , YouTube and Threads .\n\nJoin the Irish Mirror's breaking news service on WhatsApp. Click this link to receive breaking news and the latest headlines direct to your phone.

They just need to knock on the door and say, 'Hi. We've all had it in our families before.'\n\n\"Well perhaps, royal sources have long argued, if his accusations hadn't been so hurtful, and the spilling of family confidences so spitefully public.\n\nOver at Buckingham Palace, the King (who Harry made clear this week was too busy to see him) had a packed morning of meetings before greeting 8000 guests, who had been invited to the garden party for their service to communities, the military or charities and other organisations at 4pm.\n\nHe was accompanied by his wife the Queen, the Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh, the Princess Royal and the Duke and Duchess of Gloucester.\n\nIt was a clear sign of solidarity for Charles, 75, who has just been given permission to carry out more forward-facing public duties by doctors amid his ongoing cancer battle.\n\nWhile he continues treatment, each engagement is being calibrated to balance his desire to meet as many members of the public as possible with his health.\n\nAides are particularly keen he is protected as much as possible from picking up any colds or bugs.\n\nAlthough there were thousands of guests present, however, the event was deemed appropriate as it takes place outside on the palace lawn.\n\nThe King may have met slightly fewer people than he would do in a normal year but the changes were minimal - and he was clearly delighted to get out and shake as many hands as he could.\n\nAfter standing on the terrace for the National Anthem, the King was escorted by the Yeoman of the Guard down to the lawn to mingle with the crowds.\n\nSpontaneous applause erupted at the sight of His Majesty as he began to move along his predetermined \"lane\", escorted by gentleman ushers in top hats and tails.\n\n\"God bless you\", said one man, clasping his hands. \"I've dreamt of this all my life.\"\n\nAnother added: \"So glad you are looking so much better.\"\n\n\"I'm not doing badly,\" Charles smiled, clearly touched.\n\nDozens asked after his health and told him how good it was to see him back in public again.\n\nSpotting one guest tucking into a plate of cakes, the King joked: \"Did you make them yourself?

Harry has this week landed in the UK for the tenth annual Invictus Games, sparking rumours of a possible reconciliation with King Charles. However, it emerged that there would be no Royal rendezvous, with the King's packed schedule blamed for the missed connection.\n\nAnd while Mr Fitzwilliams suggested that this absence will be perceived as a \"snub\", he revealed that Harry and Meghan have crafted a strategy to navigate this \"setback.\" He said: \"Meghan has wisely decided that a hostile press and public would prefer her to stay away from the Service at St Paul's to commemorate a decade of Invictus. Their visit to Nigeria is a cover for what is a setback.\"\n\nREAD MORE: William and Kate's 'frightening fight' means they won't 'deal with Harry Problem'\n\nMeghan and Harry have seemingly planned a 'cover' for King Charles' 'snub'\n\nMeghan won't be accompanying Harry in the UK but will join him for their upcoming journey to Nigeria. The couple plans to engage with Service members and immerse themselves in local cultural events there. Mr Fitzwilliams commented that, despite having a plan to mend fences, the sting of the snub from Harry's father remains significant. \"This will be seen as a snub. There is little doubt that this was not arranged as it should have been as King Charles has always made it clear that his door is open to Harry,\" he added.\n\nThe last time Harry and Charles have seen each other was when Charles was diagnosed with cancer and Harry quickly flew out to see him. Mr Fitzwilliams said: \"Their meeting after the King's diagnosis was extremely brief and we do not know how well it went.\"\n\nDespite Charles' condition, Mr Fitzwilliams claims he understands the impact of this decision will be significant. He said: \"The King has engagements and duties he needs to perform and has to balance these with treatment for cancer that must be deeply debilitating. The fact that they will not be meeting will, as all things affecting the royal family will, be worldwide news. If the royal rift is ever to be healed it will be when matters are less public and can be considered privately and less stressfully.\"\n\nAs for Harry's brother, Prince William, Mr Fitzwilliams had predicted that the chance of them meeting was even slimmer. \"There was never a chance of him seeing William, who does not trust him, and with good reason,\" he said.\n\nHowever, while there are plenty of obstacles, experienced royal writer Mr Fitzwilliams does believe there is a path to redemption for Harry and Meghan. He revealed: \"If they were to mention the Commonwealth, of which it is a member, in a favourable light in a speech, this would be positive. They trashed the institution, Queen Elizabeth's most important legacy, in their documentary Harry and Meghan.

as soon as he can.\n\n'Frankly speaking, Harry and Meghan are a painful distraction that he could do without.'\n\nThe King returned to his public engagements last week - with a visit to a cancer centre -

The boys, but especially Harry, loved his strength of character and decisiveness.\n\n\"Where King Charles was always filed with doubt about his abilities as a parent and unsure how to behave towards the boys, Dyer was always 'fierce, but fair' as the boys themselves agreed.\" Mark acted as a mentor to Harry and his brother Prince William after their mother's death in 1997.

The service followed two high-profile snubs during Harry's London trip; his claim, made in a public statement, that his father was too busy to see him, and then the palace revealing William was to made head of Harry's old regiment. Even when they do not see each other, the royals find their own ways to trade blows.\n\nIt was hard to believe, as Harry walked into the cavernous church in London for a service to mark the tenth anniversary of the Invictus Games, that his widely-praised initiative for wounded servicemen once enjoyed the support not just of Harry's father, King Charles III, and brother, Prince William, but also the late Queen Elizabeth II herself. Indeed, Elizabeth went as far as recording a comedy video also featuring Barack and Michelle Obama to promote it in 2016.\n\nNow however, the event has been stripped of royal affiliation. A military source recently told The Daily Beast, \"Some people feel it's not fair to deny the foundation proper royal endorsement. It was explicitly set up as an organization endorsed by the royal family, but now it's not.\" Indeed, the working royals seemed determined to overshadow Harry's big day.\n\nCharles was hosting a garden party for 5,000 people on the great lawn at Buckingham Palace, and William made his own headlines at Windsor Castle earlier in the day, hosting an investiture honoring, among others, Gladiator director Sir Ridley Scott.\n\nThe Invictus ceremony looked low wattage by comparison. Top flight British celebrities are now understandably wary of being associated with Harry for fear they will be blackballed by the king and William.\n\nHarry's most high profile guest was the actor Damian Lewis, who was due to read the poem Invictus, by William Ernest Henley from which the organization takes its name.\n\nHarry may, at least, have been able to draw comfort from the poem's closing lines, where the poet ponders that, despite the hardships visited upon him by life: \"I am the master of my fate, I am the captain of my soul.\"\n\nSome insiders believe that the royals are making a mistake by not supporting Harry's cause.\n\nOne source, a former courtier, told The Daily Beast last week: \"Charles has made it quite clear he is ready to be friendly and supportive to Harry in his capacity as a private person, as his dad, but he is not going to throw the weight of the institution behind Invictus again. This all seems very logical inside the Palace bubble, but the trouble is that people who don't particularly care about such things, who are dimly aware that the royals spend their days visiting community centers and opening supermarkets, are going to wonder why they are boycotting this terrific charity that is headed by the king's son.\n\n\"Many of us think this is a classic example of the royals cutting off their nose to spite their face, because Invictus is clearly exactly the kind of organization the royal family should be supporting. If a bridge is ever going to be built [between Harry and the royals], Invictus is the bridgehead to build it from, and they should get on and do it.\"\n\nRead more at The Daily Beast.\n\nGet the Daily Beast's biggest scoops and scandals delivered right to your inbox.

The Duchess of Sussex opted to remain in the United States while Harry ventured overseas to the event, and the fact that it took place in the United Kingdom seemingly has a lot to do with it.\n\nMeghan has attended most of Harry's Invictus Games events through the years with the exception of a handful, and one royal expert thinks that Meghan opted not to attend this event because it wasn't worth the \"criticism\" and \"disparaging comments\" that the duchess has received in the past.\n\nMeghan's departure from the royal family alongside Harry has always been somewhat negatively viewed by members of the British public. The Sussexes left the UK back in 2020 after dealing with harsh treatment from the press and little support from the royals; they settled down in Montecito, California, and Meghan has only returned to the UK twice: Once for the late queen's Platinum Jubilee, and once for her funeral, both in 2022.\n\nMeghan chose not to accompany Harry to his Invictus Games ceremony in the UK this time around, and she has avoided other events too; she also did not attend King Charles' coronation ceremony last year.\n\n\"'Why risk any more disparaging comments here,' is likely to have been her response,\" Royal expert and author Dr. Pauline Maclaran told Express, referring to Meghan's decision when Harry asked her about attending the event. \"There was criticism when she attended the last Invictus Games that she was overshadowing the event.\"\n\nMeghan has seemingly done her best to avoid the drama of the royal family, and perhaps it has brought her peace. She might have felt like there was no sense in opening herself up to negative press by attending, and since she has supported Harry's event so many other times, he likely didn't think anything of it.\n\nAlthough Harry's father and brother did not even attend the event, Meghan might have also been worried about running into them.

However, royal watchers have suggested that the Duke of Sussex's return visit, sans his wife Meghan Markle, would not lead to any reconciliation efforts between his elder brother Prince William and sister-in-law Kate Middleton, who is undergoing treatment for cancer, a media report said.\n\n\"Harry would love to reconnect with Kate. They were once extremely close, and Harry was hit hard by the news of her cancer diagnosis, which he learnt about just the way the rest of us did, via Kate's shocking video,\" Christopher Andersen, author of \"The King: The Life of Charles III\", told Fox News.\n\n\"Unfortunately, it doesn't appear William is willing to let his brother anywhere near his ailing wife.\"\n\nThe author further said that there was \"just too much drama between the brothers and their wives, and there is lingering bitterness on everyone's part\".\n\n\"So, the chances of even a meeting between Harry and the rest of the royal family, much less some sort of reconciliation, seem extremely slim.\"\n\nAfter months of rumours and bizarre conspiracy theories about Kate Middleton's whereabouts since her disappearance from the spotlight after Christmas in December 2023, Kensington Palace released a video message in March in which the Princess of Wales said that she is undergoing chemotherapy for cancer and is \"well and getting stronger every day\".\n\nShe said that the cancer was not known when she had the abdominal surgery in January.\n\nShortly after the video was released, Prince Harry and his wife Meghan Markle wished Kate Middleton \"health and healing\".\n\n\"We wish health and healing for Kate and the family, and hope they are able to do so privately and in peace,\" Harry and Meghan said in a statement shared with People Magazine.\n\nThe downfall in the relationship of Prince Harry and his wife with the British royal family happened after the couple stepped back from duties in 2020.\n\nHarry's ties with William were also fractured, especially after the Duke of Sussex revealed in his memoir and in an interview about a physical fight between the siblings.\n\nHarry and Meghan were last seen with Kate and William for a surprise walkabout in Windsor following the death of Queen Elizabeth II in September 2022.\n\nIn February this year, the Duke of Sussex travelled from California, where he resides with his wife and their two children, Archie Harrison (4) and Lilibet Diana Mountbatten-Windsor (2), to the UK after the announcement of his father, King Charles' cancer diagnosis.\n\nDuring his brief stay, he didn't meet Prince William or Kate Middleton.", "source": {"uri": "indiatoday.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "India Today"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

This communication was initially disclosed through a leak to The Telegraph, and the royal family fans couldn't remain mute spectators to the ongoing fiasco. The king was labeled childish for holding a grudge against his son.\n\nPrince Harry, the Duke of Sussex, confirmed that he won't be able to meet his father, King Charles III, during his visit to the UK due to the monarch's packed schedule. \"In response to the many inquiries and continued speculation on whether or not The Duke will meet with his father while in the U.K. this week, it, unfortunately, will not be possible due to His Majesty's full program. The Duke, of course, is understanding of his father's diary of commitments and various other priorities and hopes to see him soon,\" revealed a spokesperson for the Duke of Sussex per Reuters. Buckingham Palace seemingly didn't see this as adequate retribution. Just a few hours later, an announcement was made that Charles had managed to carve out some time in his \"quite busy\" schedule to formally appoint Prince William as the head of Harry's former regiment, the Army Air Corps.\n\nDespite recently resuming royal duties while undergoing cancer treatment, Charles held an audience at Buckingham Palace on May 7, welcoming the Prime Minister of Fiji, Sitiveni Rabuka. Furthermore, preparations are underway at the Palace for its inaugural garden party of the season on May 8, with the guest list from the royal family still undisclosed. \"His Majesty the King will officially hand over the role of Colonel-in-Chief of the Army Air Corps to His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales,\" the palace said according to The Independent.\n\n\"In August 2023, following His Majesty's Accession, the King was pleased to announce military appointments including that the Prince of Wales would become Colonel-in-Chief of the Army Air Corps. The role was previously held by His Majesty the King, as Prince of Wales, for 31 years,\" the statement added. Netizens took to X, formerly known as Twitter in criticism of the King's decision. User @duchess_salty wrote, \"#KingCharles has deftly taken the wind out of his son's sails. The snub is strategic - Harry can't flounce off to Africa BLABBING his mouth off about meeting the King and updating his condition during ANY interviews in Africa. Well, played #KingCharlesIII \" Another user @allzugern wrote, \"Charles and William are emotionally stunted. Neither of them will ever grow into true adulthood. Sad.\"\n\nIt's likely within the king's power to arrange a meeting with his son if he truly wanted to, but royal press releases confirming such encounters have yet to be issued.

Combined with the buttonhole fiddling it implies a desire to self-comfort.\n\nFor Harry it is linked to deeper emotions too as he has used it in the past when he has been speaking about his mother.\n\nJudi James is a psychologist and body language expert\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe said his 'lack of body engagement probably gives him the option of a face-saving exit if his reception is less than warm'.\n\nMs James added: 'Harry's wreathed grin with eye crinkling suggests he might be excited and relieved to meet fans in the UK.'\n\nAs Harry left the cathedral around 6pm yesteday, he greeted the crowds and was heard asking two fans from New York what had brought them to the UK.\n\nWhen they responded that they were in Britain for a wedding, the Prince jokingly asked whether it was 'in there' - referring to St Paul's.\n\nThe Duke joked around with one enthusiastic fan who had her arms outstretched with two phones to try and get the best shot of Harry.\n\n'Why have you got two phones?' he laughed. 'It doesn't make sense!'\n\nThe crowd was tightly guarded by police officers, and shouts of 'we love you Harry' could be heard while others screamed with excitement until Harry got into a Range Rover and was driven away.\n\nEarlier, Harry arrived at St Paul's just before 5pm for the service which was also attended by close relatives of his mother Diana, Princess of Wales and a mentor who supported him after her death, along with hundreds from the 'Invictus family'.\n\nAnalysing his arrival, Ms James said there were 'signals of inner anxiety that were visible on the way into the service' which were 'still on display' by the time he did the walkabout afterwards, and 'might even have increased'.\n\nShe said: 'Harry's hand to waist gesture on his way into the service was a barrier ritual masking as a buttoning of his jacket.\n\n'On his way out though he is placing his hand flat across his stomach and even switches hands when he goes to do handshakes with the crowd. At one point his left hand also pulls his jacket across and he starts to fiddle with the buttonhole.'\n\nShe added that the 'placing of the flat of the hand across the stomach' is a 'barrier ritual' which he shares with his estranged brother Prince William.\n\nMs James continued: 'Combined with the buttonhole fiddling it implies a desire to self-comfort. For Harry it is linked to deeper emotions too as he has used it in the past when he has been speaking about his mother.

"title": "'Modest rather than regal': Prince Harry 'appeared' lonely at Invictus Games ceremony", "body": "Prince Harry's body language at the Invictus Games cathedral service revealed the Duke of Sussex's sadness after his father King Charles opted to snub his younger son, an expert has claimed.\n\nHarry marked the 10th anniversary of the Invictus Games with an emotional reading at a thanksgiving service on Wednesday, while his father hosted a family garden party about three kilometres away.\n\nThe entire royal family, including Prince William, declined to attend the service to mark a decade of Harry's signature organisation.\n\nHarry's wife Meghan Markle and the couple's two children also skipped the service, reportedly because the Duchess of Sussex refuses to return to the UK without an apology from the monarchy.\n\nThe Duke of Sussex helped set up Invictus in 2014 as an Olympics-style international sporting event for injured and wounded service men and women across the globe.\n\nBody language expert Judi James revealed that Harry's appearance at the cathedral showed signs of the Duke's loneliness and sadness after being snubbed by his father and brother.\n\nShe claimed Harry appeared to light up upon hearing cheers from the crowd but overall the Duke of Sussex seemed \"wary\".\n\n\"He appeared to take his lead from the crowd and when there were sounds of cheers he glanced towards them with a grin, throwing two friendly waves to either side then one afterthought wave over his shoulder at the top of the steps,\" she told the Daily Express newspaper on Thursday.\n\n\"His head was held down and his waves were modest rather than regal, performed as he was in transit and with the handheld relatively low and the palm displayed.\"\n\nWednesday's service was the first time Harry has returned to the cathedral since he was booed by hecklers on the church steps two years ago during the Platinum Jubilee.\n\nWhile Harry put on a brave face at St Pauls, the King was just a few kilometres away hosting a garden party, and Ms James believes the contrast between father and son \"could hardly have been greater\".\n\n\"While Charles stood beaming and wreathed in smiles, surrounded by loving family and guests, Harry was making his very solitary arrival at the church his mother and father were once married in,\" she said.", "source": {"uri":

The reason given was due to the 75-year-old monarch's full program.\n\nHowever, some royal experts urged the King to embrace his son in private without making it a news. But, the King and other royals, according to some, think that it's not possible to keep anything private in Harry's presence.\n\nRoyal correspondent Jack Royston has urged the King to take the step to ease the suffering of himself and his son Harry as opportunity seldom knocks twice.\n\nSome royal fans and commentators still believe Charles would have embraced his in private by putting all his rift a side to not let him feel 'Spare'.\n\nThe Duke, in his memoir, has already claimed of being treated differently by his own royal relatives. And, the King and William's snub, according to some, could strengthen his narrative against the monarchy.\n\n\"It's about how the public read the myth of the motivation behind [Charles] not seeing Harry,\" Royston told Sky News.\n\n\"When it was simply the case that Charles wasn't going to see him, that was hugely disappointing. The risk is that they look like it's deliberate and that it's petty, so they need to realize that if the public perceive this as a petty swipe at Harry.\"\n\nJournalist and royal commentator Angela Mollard wrote for Daily Mail. \"I'm astounded the monarch isn't meeting with his own son, even briefly.

None of the royals supported Prince Harry at the 10th anniversary of the Invictus Games. Oof.\n\nAs Perezcious readers know, the Duke of Sussex traveled to England to be there for a ceremony to mark the milestone occasion for the sports competition he created on Wednesday. While the 39-year-old extended invites to his estranged relatives as an olive branch, King Charles III's team was quick to shut down reconciliation speculation by revealing his calendar was too full to meet up with his son. But there was still hope someone -- anyone -- might show up... but nope!\n\nUnsurprisingly, Prince William and Princess Catherine, along with Charles, were not in attendance at a Service of Thanksgiving held at St. Paul's Cathedral on Wednesday. They likely stayed away because of the family feud and Kate Middleton's cancer battle. As for the other royals? Well, they were all hobnobbing with each other elsewhere!\n\nRelated: William Gives Rare Update On Kate & The Kids Amid Cancer Battle\n\nHarry's event coincided with the first garden party of the season, held a few miles from Buckingham Palace. That's where Charles and Queen Camilla were with Princess Anne, Prince Edward and his wife Sophie, Duchess of Edinburgh, and the Duke and Duchess of Gloucester, Prince Richard and Birgitte. Wow! They ALL snubbed Harry! Rough! No word on where Princess Beatrice or Eugenie were.\n\nFWIW, a spokesperson for the Archewell founder previously opened up about His Majesty's absence, saying:\n\n\"In response to the many inquiries and continued speculation on whether or not The Duke will meet with his father while in the U.K. this week, it unfortunately will not be possible due to His Majesty's full program. The Duke of course is understanding of his father's diary of commitments and various other priorities and hopes to see him soon.\"\n\nWe guess he's keeping his head held high and not letting these no-shows get him down! But it's gotta hurt that nobody bothered to come!\n\nThat said, plenty of representatives from the participating nations of the Invictus Games and members of the wounded, injured, and sick service personnel and veteran community showed up. Homeland star Damian Lewis was one of several people who spoke (including Harry), reading a poem called \"Invictus.\" Hey, having the lead from Band Of Brothers is a pretty nice consolation prize. But still would've been nice to have some family in the audience, though!\n\nThoughts??

While he declined to share any private information about conversations he's had with the royals, Welby did speak about the need for compassion for the monarchy's situation.\n\n\"We must not judge them,\" he said. \"They're human beings, they must not be judged. They need to be prayed for and supported.\"\n\nThe Archbishop's comments come just one day after the prince arrived in the U.K. to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the Invictus Games. On May 8, Harry, 39, attended a service at St. Paul's Cathedral commemorating the landmark anniversary, while his family, including King Charles and Queen Camilla, hosted the first garden party of the season at Buckingham Palace.\n\nA spokesperson for the Duke of Sussex previously confirmed Harry will not see his father during his visit due to the King's \"full\" schedule.\n\n\"In response to the many inquiries and continued speculation on whether or not The Duke will meet with his father while in the U.K. this week, it unfortunately will not be possible due to His Majesty's full program,\" the spokesperson said on May 7. \"The Duke of course is understanding of his father's diary of commitments and various other priorities and hopes to see him soon.\"\n\nHarry last saw his father in February when he visited the U.K. following Buckingham Palace's announcement of King Charles' cancer diagnosis. Shortly after his visit, the Duke of Sussex spoke about the reunion on Good Morning America.\n\n\"I spoke to him. I jumped on a plane and went to go see him as soon as I could,\" he said at the time. \"Look, I love my family. The fact that I was able to get on a plane and go and see him and spend any time with him, I'm grateful for that.\"\n\nThe prince did not see his brother, Prince William, or Kate Middleton during his February visit. At the time, the Princess of Wales was recovering from abdominal surgery. Since then, Kate has announced that she's undergoing treatment for cancer.\n\nCan't get enough of PEOPLE's Royals coverage?

The Duke of Sussex appeared alone at the celebration marking the tenth anniversary of the Invictus Games, held at St Paul's Cathedral in London.\n\nThe Games, which were established by Harry in 2014, aim to support injured servicemen and women. The Duke arrived at the Cathedral without any other Royal Family members, following news that King Charles was unable to reunite with his son due to his schedule.\n\nUpon exiting his car, dressed in a navy suit and adorned with his military medals, Harry greeted the crowd with a smile and wave, eliciting cheers from the wellwishers who had gathered to see him. Meanwhile, King Charles was hosting a garden party at Buckingham Palace, just two miles away, according to The Mirror.\n\nREAD MORE: HMRC to hit pet owners with tax bill that millions don't know about\n\nREAD MORE: Dog owners rave about affordable treats ideal for training that are 'big hit' with fussy pets\n\nDespite the absence of other royals at the event, Harry was accompanied by a few family members. His uncle, Earl Charles Spencer, and his aunt, Lady Jane Fellowes - both siblings of the late Princess Diana - were present, along with Harry's cousin, Louis Spencer.\n\nPrime Minister Rishi Sunak and actor Damien Lewis were among the attendees at a special service, where Lewis delivered a poignant poem. The hymn \"Praise My Soul The King Of Heaven\" marked the opening of the ceremony, reports Birmingham Live.\n\nThe Dean of St Paul's addressed the crowd, saying: \"We gather this evening to offer grateful thanksgiving to Almighty God for the work of the Invictus Games Foundation, and in this their tenth anniversary year, we celebrate the tremendous achievements of the numerous competitors across 23 nations.\n\n\"We give thanks for the inspiring vision and compassion that formed the foundation and, chiefly, for the resultant decade of profound and transformational work. We lament the pain, cost and indignity of war and terror, and pray for a world where justice shall reign and where the nations will find their longed for unity.\n\n\"We recall, with admiration, the skill and determination of those who seek to repair, rehabilitate, and reclaim the lives of those living with serious illness or injury: changing and saving lives.\"\n\nMichelle Turner, the former vice-captain of the Invictus Games Team UK, also read a poem that reflected on the significant impact the Invictus Games had on her path to recovery and the lives of her family members. Ex-RAF sergeant Michelle, who rendered her service for a duration of 21 years, was diagnosed with a cardiac condition during her deployment time. A severe infection resulted in postural tachycardia syndrome (PoTS), a disorder that triggers arbitrary heart responses and lead to sudden collapses.\n\nOn one horrific occasion, her four-year-old offspring saved her from potential harm by calling 999 as she collapsed at home. In her poem, she traced the journey of Invictus athletes who \"fought for our countries on deployments far and wide, devoted our years and served with pride...\" Post-discharge she found herself left \"wounded, injured, sick and with no career, consumed with insecurities, the pain and the fear\", and it was during this stage that her young daughter cared for her.\n\nHer little girl contributed a poignant section to her mum's verse, reflecting on moments when she felt like she was \"felt like I was losing my mum, she was in hospital all the time.\" Harry led the crowd in applauding emotionally as Michelle concluded her reading: \"Thank you Invictus, for giving me my life back.\"\n\nDuring the ceremony, Prince Harry, who has twice served in Afghanistan over his decade-long military tenure, put forward a reading from Corinthians 12. 4-11 preceding the Dean of St Paul's sermon. The Dean paid homage to those who have sacrificed their lives in conflicts both past and present, while the tune of Flowers of the Forest filled the air, played by a piper.\n\nGet daily headlines and breaking news emailed to you - it's FREE", "source": {"uri": "coventrytelegraph.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "Coventry Telegraph"}, "authors": [{"uri": "robert_rowlands@coventrytelegraph.net", "name": "Robert Rowlands", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "isabelle_bates@coventrytelegraph.net", "name": "Isabelle Bates", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Harry,_Duke_of_Sussex", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_I_of_England", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Charles I of England"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invictus_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Invictus Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Spencer,_9th_Earl_Spencer", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Charles Spencer, 9th Earl Spencer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William,_Prince_of_Wales", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "William, Prince of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_royal_family", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "British royal family"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HM_Revenue_and_Customs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "HM Revenue and Customs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rave", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rave"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Paul's_Cathedral", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "St Paul's Cathedral"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Mirror", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Daily Mirror"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckingham_Palace", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Buckingham Palace"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jane_Fellowes,_Lady_Fellowes", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jane Fellowes, Lady Fellowes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rishi_Sunak", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rishi Sunak"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dean_of_St_Paul's", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dean of St Paul's"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birmingham_Mail", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Birmingham Mail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diana,_Princess_of_Wales", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Diana, Princess of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soul_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Soul music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heaven", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Heaven"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "God"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hymn", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hymn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flowers_of_the_Forest", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Flowers of the Forest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._M._W._Turner", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "J.

Despite arriving alone, amidst reports of a Royal Family snub, Harry seemed \"forlorn\", as reported by the Mirror. As he climbed up the cathedral steps wearing a navy suit adorned with his military accolades, he graciously acknowledged the cheering crowd with a smile and a wave.\n\nThe Dean of St Paul's, the Very Reverend Andrew Tremlett, also extended a heartfelt greeting. Additionally, body language expert Judi James saw a sense of gratitude in Harry, perhaps in response to the absence of his family.\n\nJames said, \"Despite those medals pinned to his chest and despite the couple of friendly grins he threw at the crowds, Harry's body language here suggested a slightly forlorn and wary inner state as he exited his car and made his way up the steps to the church.\"\n\nShe added, \"He buttoned his jacket and then kept his hand there, even replacing it as he shook hands with the clergy, suggesting a need for a partial barrier gesture. His three waves to the crowd were relatively humble rather than royal, with the palm held out and the fingers splayed and more of an over-the-shoulder glance than any creation of a more static and deliberate pose of greeting.\"\n\nJames further said, \"His grin suggested he was grateful for the reception and keen to create some friendly bonds with the crowds here. The way the grin widened as he turned for one last wave also suggested a possible sense of relief that he had got this very public solo arrival over.\" Hundreds of fans gathered outside St Paul's Cathedral, hoping to see Harry.\n\nThey cheered as he entered the venue. However, King Charles couldn't meet his son during Harry's short visit to the UK due to lack of time, according to the Daily Express.\n\nAmong the attendees were not only Harry but also Earl Spencer, Princess Diana's brother, and Louis Spencer, Harry's cousin. However, Meghan Markle chose not to accompany her husband on his return to the UK. Reports suggested she was concerned about the possibility of facing booing at the Invictus Games event. Richard Eden said, \"She does not want to return to Britain in a hurry.\n\nThere are many people here who won't be sad about that. Meghan will be wary of getting booed at St Paul's.\" Royal Correspondent Jack Royston also spoke about this in a podcast.\n\nHe said, \"The centrepiece of this visit is a service of Thanksgiving for Invictus at St. Paul's Cathedral. Now the last time Meghan went there, Meghan and Harry were booed by royalists. That was during Queen Elizabeth II's Platinum Jubilee.\n\nThere were cheers as well, but there were certainly boos, and that was during a similar service of Thanksgiving.\" Meanwhile, in a heartfelt tribute, the Duke of Sussex lauded the courageous athletes of the Invictus Games as the event celebrated its remarkable 10th anniversary in London.

The last few months have made it very clear how important she is; she has been the one propping up the whole edifice.\"\n\nThe friend adds that \"Harry has made it very clear, very publicly, that he despises her. He has forced Charles to choose, which was a very silly thing to do because Camilla and he both chose each other a long time ago. William had his reservations but he accepted his father's choice and got on with it. Harry made a different decision, and one of the inevitable consequences of publicly calling your stepmother cruel names is that it becomes difficult for you to see your father.\"\n\nMeanwhile, one of Prince William and Kate Middleton's friends said \"It is hardly surprising that Charles didn't invite Harry round for tea and a scone. He did, after all, portray his wife as an evil, calculating, bitch in the biggest selling book since the Bible.\"\n\nAnd, um, this isn't even the saltiest quote the Daily Beast procured. They also spoke to a former Buckingham Palace courtier who said, in part:\n\n\"As far as the palace is concerned, the further away that Harry and Meghan are from Buckingham Palace the better. Look how distracting Harry's visit has been this week. The media should be talking about the king's return to work, instead we are talking about a 39 year old man's daddy issues.\"\n\nWell then!

The crowds showed up to support him, but the royal family did not -- and yes, they were reportedly invited to the event. How did the palace honor the Duke of Sussex's appearance in London? Well, they announced a new royal role for Prince William that was originally slated to go to Prince Harry before his exit.\n\nRoyal expert Katie Nicholl chimed in with her thoughts to Entertainment Tonight on the curiously timed announcement, one that likely cut Harry to the core because it involved the military. The Prince of Wales was named the Colonel-in-Chief of the Army Air Corps by King Charles, which Nicholls considers a \"slap in the face\" to Prince Harry. \"For many years he served two tours in Afghanistan,\" she explained. \"You know, the timing is curious. I think many people will see that as a bit of a snub, really, from the palace, and perhaps a little bit of a poke in the ribs to Prince Harry.\"\n\nThe royal family could have shared the news on any day of the week, but they chose to rain on the Duke of Sussex's parade. \"Yes, he's over here part of the Invictus community celebrating 10 years, but he's been stripped of his right to wear his military uniform,\" the royal expert continued. \"And now his brother's taken over the role that I think Harry would have expected to have come to him, had he still been a working member of the royal family.\" She described the timing as \"poignant\" and called it \"yet another reminder that he's very much out rather than in when it comes to the royal family.\"\n\nHarry, who takes great pride in his military service, has been punished more than once for his royal exit. He was stripped of his military patronages and titles after he and Meghan Markle left the U.K., and when Queen Elizabeth II passed away, he was only allowed to wear his military regalia for his grandmother's vigil. The regulations are petty, but an insider told Us Weekly that Harry had already \"come to terms with not wearing uniform on these occasions.\" He knows that no one can take away his military experience, and the U.S. has honored him for his work in this area.\n\nThe Duke of Sussex's words resonated at the 2023 Invictus Games in Germany when he pointed out that it's not the uniform that makes the military man or woman. \"For many of you, the uniform that you've been wearing this past week will give you a new story to tell. And for others, it may give your old uniform new meaning,\" he proudly told the audience of athletes and spectators. \"But I'm here to remind you that after all of this, you don't need to rely on a uniform, nor should you ever feel lost without one. Why? Because everything you need is already within you.\"", "source": {"uri": "sheknows.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SheKnows"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kristyn_burtt@sheknows.com", "name": "Kristyn Burtt", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Harry,_Duke_of_Sussex", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_royal_family", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "British royal family"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William,_Prince_of_Wales", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "William, Prince of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invictus_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Invictus Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gigi_Hadid", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gigi Hadid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entertainment_Tonight", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Entertainment Tonight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bradley_Cooper", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bradley Cooper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Army_Air_Corps_(United_Kingdom)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Army Air Corps (United Kingdom)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonel-in-chief", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Colonel-in-chief"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_I_of_England", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Charles I of England"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Afghanistan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Afghanistan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meghan,_Duchess_of_Sussex", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Meghan, Duchess of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regalia", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Regalia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patronage", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Patronage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_II", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Elizabeth II"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Us_Weekly", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Us Weekly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Genealogy/Royalty", "label": "dmoz/Society/Genealogy/Royalty", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/prince-william-prince-harry.jpg?w=1024", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550326", "eventUri": "eng-9550326", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-08", "textStart": 98, "textEnd": 103}], "sentiment": 0.1607843137254903, "wgt": 135, "relevance": 1}

Speaking to The Mirror, she said: \"I would say that Harry is by now an expert on communication. He knows that every single thing he says will be picked apart by the media and the public, just like we are doing now,\".\n\nShe continued: \"Therefore it's definitely not an accident that his dinner plans were mentioned. I would guess that he wanted to send the message that he's busy and has plans and that they are to do with his work. It could be directed towards his father or Meghan to show his independence or even just in general to indicate a productive busy schedule to the world at large,\" Jane elaborated.\n\nThis decision to bypass a family meeting comes shortly after he stated he would be visiting his father following his urgent trip to see Charles in February when his cancer diagnosis was made public. He flew to London, had a meeting with his father at Clarence House, then spent the night in a hotel before flying back to Los Angeles the next day.\n\nShortly after his visit, he told ABC News that he planned to return to London soon, adding: \"I've got other trips planned that will take me through the UK, or back to the UK, and so I'll stop in and see my family as much as I can.\"#\n\nGet the latest celebrity gossip and telly news sent straight to your inbox.

Prince Harry is heartbroken for Kate Middelton as she continues her battle with cancer\n\nAccording to royal expert Robert Jobson, King Charles snubbed Prince Harry's recent visit to the UK because he wants to steer clear of his son's 'circus'. Jobson explained, \"People think if Harry rolls into town there's going to be some sort of reconciliation. But you're going to realize there's been a lot of water under the bridge, a lot of portrayal of trust. That takes time to rebuild, and I don't think we're anywhere near the stage of rebuilding trust.\"\n\nJobson further pointed out that Harry's decision to visit his father was not well-received by the King, stating, \"Harry effectively took it by himself to come see his dad when he said that he had been diagnosed with cancer that would be seen by as many as a good thing. But at the time I think the King didn't want all the media circus that would accompany Harry's arrival.\"\n\nThis insight sheds light on the strained relationship between father and son, indicating that there are deep-rooted issues that need time and effort to resolve. Jobson's analysis offers a glimpse into the complexities of the royal family dynamics and the challenges they face in rebuilding trust and repairing fractured relationships.\n\nThe situation was evident when Harry attended a service at St Paul's Cathedral to mark the 10th anniversary of his Invictus Games, while Charles attended a garden party at Buckingham Palace.\n\nThe timing of their events seemed to deliberately avoid any interaction between the two, with Harry leaving the service just as Charles wrapped up the first Buckingham Palace garden party of the year.\n\nA spokesperson for Harry confirmed that the prince would not meet Charles during his visit, citing the King's busy schedule as the reason. This decision reflects the ongoing tension between them, as they navigate their strained relationship in the public eye.\n\nThe absence of reconciliation during Harry's recent visit underscores the complexities of their familial dynamics, as they grapple with past grievances and work towards rebuilding trust. Jobson's insights provide a deeper understanding of the underlying reasons behind their strained relationship, shedding light on the challenges they face in repairing their fractured bond.", "source": {"uri": "marca.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MARCA"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Harry,_Duke_of_Sussex", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_I_of_England", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Charles I of England"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Circus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_royal_family", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "British royal family"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_circus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Media circus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckingham_Palace", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Buckingham Palace"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invictus_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Invictus Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Paul's_Cathedral", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "St Paul's Cathedral"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/General_Merchandise/O", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/General Merchandise/O", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 52}], "image": "https://phantom-marca.unidadeditorial.es/f46c8fb401387cfa52f3bc5ae837908b/resize/1200/f/webp/assets/multimedia/imagenes/2024/05/09/17152661625398.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550326", "eventUri": "eng-9550326", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 133, "relevance": 1}

trip.\n\nAnd while it's not the first time the \"Suits\" alum left her husband to his own devices on home soil, Markle jetted off to Nigeria this week where she'll be reunited with the Duke on Thursday.\n\n\"Meghan seems to spend a lot of time in LA at home, she doesn't tend to come over to the UK that much,\" Grand Harrold, who worked for Charles for seven years when he was the Prince of

raised as to why Harry didn't bring Archie and Lilibet with him so that they could see their ailing grandfather.\n\nAccording to Harrold, the exiled royal \"was aware\" of his father's jam-packed schedule -- making it \"tricky\" for the kids to come with.\n\n\"The late Queen was always about family, that's not to say that the King isn't about family as well, but there's obviously something going on for Harry to choose not to.\"\n\n\"There may be a plan for later in the year for Harry to bring them over, maybe when it's quieter,\" he added.", "source": {"uri": "nypost.com", "dataType":

On Wednesday, May 8, the youngest son of Charles III arrived alone at St. Paul's Cathedral to attend a ceremony marking the 10th anniversary of the Invictus Games. The sporting event he founded in 2014 for military personnel injured in the line of duty. Several members of the British royal family, including his brother William, were invited, but chose not to attend.\n\nMeanwhile, about four kilometers away, the king was having a good time with Camilla at a party held in the gardens of Buckingham Palace, accompanied by other members of the royal family. His agenda also includes a visit to a military training base on Thursday.\n\n\"Unfortunately, that will not be possible due to His Majesty's busy schedule.\"A spokesman for the Duke of Sussex said about a possible, albeit brief, meeting with the royal. \"The Duke of course understands his father's agenda and many other priorities and looks forward to seeing him soon.\"he added.\n\nThis is expected to be another quick visit by Harry to the United Kingdom, as the prince currently lives with his wife, Meghan Markle, and their two children, Archie and Lilibeth, in California, in the United States.\n\nThe last time Carlos III was with his son was in February, when he publicly revealed his cancer diagnosis. However, the meeting did not even last for an hour, as Harry had an event in the United States. This was not the case with Kate. According to the British press, he only learned about his sister-in-law's cancer through the media.\n\nOnce again, Harry is traveling alone. Meghan was initially scheduled to accompany him on this visit, but the North American's complicated relationship with her husband's family and fear of poor reception by the British prompted her to abandon the idea, at a time when she is trying to restore her reputation in the United States through a series of projects.", "source": {"uri": "brytfmonline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "brytfmonline"}, "authors": [{"uri": "shirley_farmer@brytfmonline.com", "name": "Shirley Farmer", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Harry,_Duke_of_Sussex", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_royal_family", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "British royal family"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_III_of_Spain", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Charles III of Spain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invictus_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Invictus Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Paul's_Cathedral", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "St Paul's Cathedral"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_Camilla", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Queen Camilla"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duke", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Duke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckingham_Palace", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Buckingham Palace"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meghan,_Duchess_of_Sussex", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Meghan, Duchess of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Genealogy/Royalty", "label": "dmoz/Society/Genealogy/Royalty", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Monarchy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Monarchy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History/Historical_Personages", "label": "dmoz/Society/History/Historical Personages", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://cdn.vidas.pt/images/2024-05/img_1200x676$2024_05_08_20_54_48_170933_im_638507993631822357.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550326", "eventUri": "eng-9550326", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-08", "textStart": 93, "textEnd": 98}], "sentiment": 0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 133, "relevance": 1}

Though there were still aspirations for a reunion with his father who was estranged, practicalities won. Harry's spokesman said he understood the King's obligations and said he hoped to see him again in the future.\n\nA meeting between father and son was unexpected, as royal analyst Richard Palmer pointed out, suggesting that unsolved problems still exist. Harry is still dedicated to his Invictus Games commitments, which include meetings and an evening supper.\n\nWith reference to the Invictus Games, competitors\u00e2\u0080\"including Harry\u00e2\u0080\"consider ten years of development and camaraderie. Established in 2013 following Harry's Warrior Games experience, the Invictus Games represent the resiliency and friendship among injured military people.\n\nThough Harry's visit falls on the first anniversary of Charles and Camilla's coronation, the dynamics of the royal family point to a gradual approach to efforts at reconciliation.

While accompanied by his wife, Queen Camilla, His Majesty appeared in good spirits as he met with staff workers and well-wishers at the facility.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [{"uri": "karelle_mckay@yahoo.com", "name": "Karelle McKay", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Harry,_Duke_of_Sussex", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William,_Prince_of_Wales", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "William, Prince of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Army_Air_Corps_(United_Kingdom)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Army Air Corps (United Kingdom)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonel-in-chief", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Colonel-in-chief"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_I_of_England", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Charles I of England"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majesty", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Majesty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hello!_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hello!

Harry could even be seen giving his aunt and uncle warm hugs as they attended the event.\n\nThe Duke's aunt and uncle attended the event amid reports that the Royal Family turned down invitations to attend, with Earl Spencer and Lady Jane's display of support for their nephew coming after it was revealed that King Charles is too busy to meet with his son.\n\nFor all the latest on news, politics, sports, and showbiz from the USA, go to The Mirror US.\n\nREAD MORE: Prince Harry and Meghan Markle to have bombshells exposed in upcoming German documentary\n\nHarry's aunt and uncle were at the Invictus Games event last night The Duke of Sussex is back in the UK for a short visit\n\nBut how does Harry's body language around the Spencers last night compare to his body language when he's around his father? Body language expert Judi James has exclusively analysed photos from last night of Harry with his aunt and uncle, and compared them to previous snaps of him with his father in times gone by.\n\n\"Harry clearly looks excited and delighted to be seeing his mother's family again here, his cheeks are rounded, his face red and shiny and his eye-smile involves crinkling to signal authentic pleasure and affection,\" Judi noted of the new snaps of Harry with the Spencers.\n\nHarry was seen with his aunt at the event\n\nShe noted that the actual greeting rituals are \"complex\", and change between relatives and involving different stages of touch to signal deeper affection. \"With Diana's sister there is a three-stage hug. He begins with a cheek kiss, with his hands clutching her back at shoulder level,\" she noted.\n\nJudi added: \"Then stage two is where they pull closer for an actual hug and Harry places his head over her shoulder with a facial expression that signals love. The parting is stage three, with 'regret' or 'reluctance' rituals to hint he would like the hug to go on longer, as he rubs his hands up and down her upper arms.\"\n\nMeanwhile, with his uncle Earl Spencer \"there is a two-stage handshake that converts into a hug and back-pat and as he greets other members of the group his signals of excitement increase as he grins, chats and pulls faces\", Judi revealed.\n\n\"Harry's body language here is a blend of excited, 'free' child and fond adult. He looks relaxed and socially 'safe' as though able to express his emotions as well as be more playful,\" she noted.\n\nIn 2014, Charles and Harry embraced for a hug\n\nHarry's greeting rituals or public displays of affection with his father \"have always been far more tempered because for Charles the depiction of being 'regal' involves much higher levels of formality,\" Judi noted.\n\n\"Like his father Philip, Charles would be seen kissing his sons in public but the cheek-kiss ritual for Charles is similar to the one he even did with Diana during their marriage, i.e an awkward gesture that contains restraint signals to avoid any of the intensifying stages we can see between Harry and the Spencers,\" Judi revealed.\n\nAnalysing a past snap of Harry with his father, Judi noted how there is \"distance between Charles and Harry's torsos here despite the fact Harry seems to have moved in for a hug, with both hands round his father's waist\". She added: \"Charles has grasped Harry's bicep to take the lead here and ensure the only contact is between the two cheeks. There is none of the type of loving, over-the-shoulder gazes from Charles here, his eyes are looking away in a distraction gaze while his mouth is closed and twisted slightly to make the ritual look even more awkward.\"\n\nConcluding her expert analysis, Judi said: \"The love is still there though, despite the awkwardness. Harry will know his father is old-school plus he has his royal role in mind at all times.\n\n\"The Spencers have the luxury of being able to act with more spontaneity in public and, given the current royal frost, Harry would naturally be keen to be seen giving and receiving family love during this visit to the UK.\"\n\nFollow Mirror Celebs on TikTok , Snapchat , Instagram , Twitter , Facebook , YouTube and Threads .", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mollie_quirk@mirror.co.uk", "name": "Mollie Quirk", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Harry,_Duke_of_Sussex", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Spencer,_9th_Earl_Spencer", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Charles Spencer, 9th Earl Spencer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_Jane_Grey", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lady Jane Grey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Body language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invictus_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Invictus Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meghan,_Duchess_of_Sussex", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Meghan, Duchess of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_royal_family", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "British royal family"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_I_of_England", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Charles I of England"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diana,_Princess_of_Wales", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Diana, Princess of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Paul's_Cathedral", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "St Paul's Cathedral"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Mirror", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Daily Mirror"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Documentary_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Documentary film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "TikTok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snapchat", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Snapchat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article32768276.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_harryexcl.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550326", "eventUri": "eng-9550326", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.388235294117647, "wgt": 132, "relevance": 1}

number of journalists, photographers, and cameramen covering his every move.\n\nHarry acknowledge them with a wave as he strode up St Paul's steps and was warmly greeted warmly greeted by the Dean of St Paul's, the Very Reverend Andrew Tremlett.\n\nHarry was inspired to found the global tournament after attending the Warrior Games in Colorado in 2013 and seeing how injured American military personnel thrived on the challenge of taking part in competitive sports that aided their recovery.\n\nHe went on to stage the inaugural games in London's Olympic Park in 2014 and the tournament has

insecurities, the pain and the fear.\n\n\"Our lives were upside down, how could it be, that the little girl I was meant to protect, was now looking after me.\"\n\nAt the end, after her voice broke with emotion as she said \"Thank you Invictus for giving my life back\", the congregation stood and applauded.\n\nThe Dean of St Paul's echoed her words in his sermon when he said the Invictus Games Foundation, which organises the competition, was \" ... not only changing lives through sport but quite literally by saving lives\".\n\nHarry later joined some of the Invictus community for a private

He flew from California especially for the service, organised to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the games.\n\nBut his hopes of also seeing his father while in London were dashed when apparent efforts to make contact went unanswered. Palace sources suggested no formal contact had been made.\n\nAs the King ploughed on with his public duties, so did his younger son as he joined members of the Invictus community, including many injured military personnel, inside St Paul's.\n\nOn arrival, the Duke was received by the Dean, the Very Rev Andrew Tremlett, before being joined by the Lord Mayor of London.\n\nAs he took his seat among the 1000-strong congregation, Harry gave huge hugs to his uncle, Earl Spencer, and aunt, Lady Jane Fellowes. As the clock could be heard striking 5pm and the cathedral began to silent, he turned to chat with them both, seated behind him.\n\nAlso present were Mark Dyer, a former Army officer and the father figure known to the Duke as Marko, David Sherborne, the Duke's barrister, who is representing him in his legal battles with the tabloid press, Jamie Lowther-Pinkerton, the former private secretary to both Prince William and Prince Harry, and Akshata Murty, the wife of Rishi Sunak.\n\nThe service opened with the hymn Praise, My Soul, the King of Heaven, before the Dean gave the welcome, hailing the \"tremendous achievements\" of the sick and injured military personnel from 23 nations who compete in the Invictus Games.\n\n\"We recall, with admiration, the skill and determination of those who seek to repair, rehabilitate and reclaim the lives of those living with serious illness or injury: changing and saving lives,\" he said.\n\n\"We acknowledge, with gratitude, the courage and strength of those wounded, injured or sick servicemen and women who have sought a pathway to recovery, encouraging those who live in darkness by the unconquered light of their spirit.\"\n\nThe actor Damian Lewis, who the Duke once joked should play him in The Crown, recited the Invictus poem by William Henley, of whom there is a memorial bust within the crypt of St Paul's.\n\nThe cheers the Duke received from the crowd were a far cry from the boos that greeted him and Meghan when he was last at St Paul's for a service of thanksgiving during the late Queen's Platinum Jubilee celebrations in 2022.\n\nMeanwhile, the King stepped out of Buckingham Palace at 4pm for the national anthem, joined by the Queen and senior members of the Royal family.\n\nWearing a grey suit and light blue waistcoat, he took off his black top hat as he observed the anthem. As it ended, the crowd cheered and the King shook his hat theatrically in acknowledgement and thanks.\n\nThe Queen wore a white Fiona Clare dress, a Philip Treacy hat, and a heart-shaped diamond brooch that once belonged to Queen Elizabeth II.\n\nTony Hudgell, a 9-year-old double amputee who lost both legs after being abused by his birth parents, was among those invited after he raised \u00a31.8 million ($3.7m) for the Evelina London Children's Hospital.\n\nOn the day, his family updated his social media to say they had been \"stuck on [the] M20 for last two hours\" and \"won't be making the King's Garden Party\".\n\nThe large turnout marked the first garden party of the season, and a major public outing for the King as he continues his cancer treatment.\n\nThe Queen, Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh, Princess Royal, and Duke and Duchess of Gloucester joined him for the party. The Prince of Wales was in Windsor Castle, conducting an investiture.\n\nOrdinarily, the King would shake hundreds of hands and hold conversations with as many guests as possible, working his way through \"lanes\" of guests as he walked through the gardens.\n\nPalace sources have stressed that his engagements, including garden parties, will now be arranged around medical advice, with possible restrictions on the number of people he is able to meet in order to protect his health.\n\nHe is beginning to resume a regular programme of public activity, visiting fellow cancer patients last week and continuing to hold a variety of audiences.", "source": {"uri": "nzherald.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title": "NZ Herald"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

founded by Harry himself.\n\nThe Duke of Sussex is in the country without his wife and children, although Meghan Markle is expected to join him on his trip to Nigeria next week.\n\nHarry will not see his father during his UK visit after King Charles said that his schedule was too busy for him to fit in a meeting with his youngest son.\n\nAs Harry arrived at the Invictus event this evening, wearing his military medals on his chest, body language expert Judi James told Fabulous that, although he tried to channel some of his \"jaunty bounce\", he appeared to be uncomfortable as he greeted the crowd.\n\nJudi said: \"Harry cuts a very solitary figure here as he walks up the steps on his arrival at St Pauls.\n\n\"He appears to try to channel some of his signature jaunty bounce but there are at least three body language cues to suggest a sense of wariness or caution as though he might be expecting to be booed.\n\nShe continued: \"His shoulders are hunched slightly forward and his head is dipped, suggesting no attempt to peacock or to imply royal status.\n\n\"He buttons his jacket but then brings his right arm up after the left has dropped in a partial barrier ritual, suggesting some discomfort.\n\n\"Harry performs three waves, one to either side of the steps and one last, over-the-shoulder wave as he enters the church.\n\n\"They all look tentative and for the last one he has his head dipped again.\n\n\"When he finishes the waves he brings his 'wave' hand down onto his thigh in a small slapping gesture, suggesting a desire to self-motivate.\"\n\nAfter walking up the steps of St Paul's Cathedral Harry, was greeted by a clergyman, but Judi claimed that this did little to calm the Prince's anxiety.\n\nShe said: \"Wearing his medals pinned to his chest again, Harry looks wary, holding his jacket together with his left hand in a barrier ritual, a self-comfort self-touch that is still in place as he holds the clergyman's hand in a tight, tense-looking shake.\"\n\nThe King spent the evening just three miles away from his son, at the first Buckingham Palace Garden Party of the year.\n\nCharles, 75, resumed public duties last week for the first time since beginning cancer treatment.\n\nAnnouncing that the duo would not be reuniting this week, a spokesperson for Harry said: \"\n\nIt unfortunately will not be possible due to His Majesty's full programme.\n\n\"The Duke of course is understanding of his father's diary of commitments and various other priorities and hopes to see him soon.\"", "source": {"uri": "thescottishsun.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title":

Why didn't he fly to the UK last week before his engagements for the Invictus games began to spend some quality time with his Dad?\n\nNo, that's not selfish Harry's style.

Harry arrived at the Cathedral without any members of the Royal Family, following the announcement King Charles was too busy to reunite with his son.\n\nAs he got out of his car wearing a navy suit and his military medals, he smiled and waved as cheers rang out among wellwishers, who had been waiting to catch a glimpse of him. It happened as King Charles hosted a garden party at Buckingham Palace just two miles away, The Mirror reports.\n\nREAD MORE: Win a \u00a3200 Wickes voucher to celebrate the launch of Kimberley Walsh's new paint\n\nGet breaking news on BirminghamLive WhatsApp\n\nDespite the lack of royals at the event, Harry was joined by a couple of family members. His uncle Earl Charles Spencer and his aunt Lady Jane Fellowes - both siblings of the late Princess Diana - were in attendance as well as Harry's cousin, Louis Spencer.\n\nPrime Minister Rishi Sunak was also there as well as actor Damien Lewis who read a poem. The service began with the hymn Praise My Soul The King Of Heaven. The Dean of St Paul's told the congregation: \"We gather this evening to offer grateful thanksgiving to Almighty God for the work of the Invictus Games Foundation, and in this their tenth anniversary year, we celebrate the tremendous achievements of the numerous competitors across 23 nations.\n\n\"We give thanks for the inspiring vision and compassion that formed the foundation and, chiefly, for the resultant decade of profound and transformational work. We lament the pain, cost and indignity of war and terror, and pray for a world where justice shall reign and where the nations will find their longed for unity.\n\n\"We recall, with admiration, the skill and determination of those who seek to repair, rehabilitate, and reclaim the lives of those living with serious illness or injury: changing and saving lives.\"\n\nFormer Invictus Games Team UK vice-captain Michelle Turner also read a poem during the event. It outlined the impact of the Invictus Games on her recovery, and on the lives of her family members.\n\nFormer RAF sergeant Michelle served for 21 years and has a heart condition that developed while on deployment. While a nasty bug left her with postural tachycardia syndrome (PoTS) which means her heart fires up randomly, causing her to regularly collapse without warning. On one occasion, her four-year-old daughter saved her life by dialling 999 when she collapsed at home.\n\nThe poem recalled how Invictus athletes \"fought for our countries on deployments far and wide, devoted our years and served with pride...\" She told how after being discharged she was \"wounded, injured, sick and with no career, consumed with insecurities, the pain and the fear\", and how her little girl looked after her.\n\nHer daughter added a section to the poem. She described how she \"felt like I was losing my mum, she was in hospital all the time.\" Harry led a standing ovation as the reading ended with Michelle's tearful words: \"Thank you Invictus, for giving me my life back.\"\n\nDuring the service, Harry, who undertook two tours of Afghanistan during a ten-year military career, provided a reading from Corinthians 12. 4-11 ahead of a Sermon by The Dean of St Paul's.

While the event commemorated the 39-year-old's cause, royal observers noted that the Duke of Sussex's return visit to the UK is unlikely to initiate a reconciliation with his family, as the House of Windsor is rocked by health woes, a media report stated. The younger son of King Charles III has arrived in London without wife Meghan Markle by his side.\n\nPrince Harry's trip comes at a time when sister-in-law Kate Middleton is undergoing treatment for cancer and father, King Charles III, has just returned to public duties amid his cancer battle.\n\n\"Harry would love to reconnect with Kate. They were once extremely close, and Harry was hit hard by the news of her cancer diagnosis, which he learnt about just the way the rest of us did, via Kate's shocking video,\" Christopher Andersen, author of \"The King: The Life of Charles III\", told Fox News.\n\n\"Unfortunately, it doesn't appear William is willing to let his brother anywhere near his ailing wife.\"\n\n\"There was just too much drama between the brothers and their wives, and there is lingering bitterness on everyone's part,\" Andersen continued. \"So, the chances of even a meeting between Harry and the rest of the royal family, much less some sort of reconciliation, seem extremely slim,\" the author added.\n\nFollowing months of speculation and wild conspiracy theories surrounding Kate Middleton's absence from public life since December 2023, Kensington Palace finally addressed the rumors with a video message in March. In the heartfelt message, the 42-year-old Princess of Wales disclosed her battle with cancer, a diagnosis that came to light after a major abdominal surgery in January. Middleton's candid revelation followed weeks of intense speculation about her health and whereabouts. In her plea for privacy, she emphasized the need for \"time, space, and privacy\" as she undergoes treatment for the unspecified form of cancer, expressing her determination to fight and emerge stronger each day.\n\nAfter months of speculation and bizarre conspiracy theories regarding Kate Middleton's absence from public view since her disappearance after Christmas in December 2023, Kensington Palace issued a video message in March. In it, the Princess of Wales, 42, revealed that she is undergoing chemotherapy for cancer and reassured the public that she is \"doing well and becoming stronger every day\".\n\nMiddleton asked for \"time, space and privacy\" while she is treated for an unspecified type of cancer that was discovered after what she described as \"major\" surgery.\n\nShortly after the video was released, Prince Harry and his wife Meghan Markle wished Kate Middleton \"health and healing\".\n\n\"We wish health and healing for Kate and the family, and hope they are able to do so privately and in peace,\" Harry and Meghan said in a statement shared with People Magazine.\n\nSince resigning from royal duties, Harry has had a tumultuous relationship with the Royal Family. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex attributed their relocation to California in 2020 to the intolerable intrusions and racist attitudes of the British media.", "source": {"uri": "republicworld.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Republic World"}, "authors": [{"uri": "digital_desk@republicworld.com", "name": "Digital Desk", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catherine,_Princess_of_Wales", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Catherine, Princess of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Harry,_Duke_of_Sussex", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_III_of_Spain", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Charles III of Spain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Andersen", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Christopher Andersen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Windsor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "House of Windsor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invictus_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Invictus Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meghan,_Duchess_of_Sussex", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Meghan, Duchess of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fox News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_royal_family", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "British royal family"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kensington_Palace", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kensington Palace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspiracy_theory", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Conspiracy theory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duke_of_Sussex", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Duke of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diana,_Princess_of_Wales", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Diana, Princess of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Christmas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chemotherapy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Racism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Cancer", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Cancer", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Support_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Health/Support Groups", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Support_Groups/Conditions_and_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Support Groups/Conditions and Diseases", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Genealogy/Royalty", "label": "dmoz/Society/Genealogy/Royalty", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 77}], "image": "https://img.republicworld.com/rimages/harrykatemiddleton-171524175081816_9.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550326", "eventUri": "eng-9550326", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3333333333333334, "wgt": 128, "relevance": 1}

To catch us all up real quick, Harry's in the United Kingdom for the 10th anniversary of Invictus Games. And amid speculation about whether or not he'll see his dad, who is undergoing cancer treatment, Harry's spokesperson dropped this statement to The Telegraph:\n\n\"In response to the many inquiries and continued speculation on whether or not the duke will meet with his father while in the UK this week, it unfortunately will not be possible due to His Majesty's full programme. The duke of course is understanding of his father's diary of commitments and various other priorities and hopes to see him soon.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Harry showed up at St Paul's Cathedral on Wednesday, May 8, for the Invictus Games service wearing an outfit that seemingly took aim at King Charles. According to The Mirror, Harry wore four medals on his jacket: his Operational Service Medal for Afghanistan, Queen Elizabeth's Queen's Golden Jubilee Medal, Queen Elizabeth's Diamond Jubilee Medal, and Queen Elizabeth's Platinum Jubilee Medal.\n\nBut he notably didn't wear his King's Coronation Medal -- for the second time.\n\nAs for the real reason King Charles is snubbing his youngest son during this visit, a friend tells the Daily Beast that \"Harry has made things very difficult for himself by saying such cruel and hurtful things about Camilla. Charles loves his sons, but he also loves his wife. The last few months have made it very clear how important she is; she has been the one propping up the whole edifice.\"\n\nThe friend also explained, in part, that \"Harry has made it very clear, very publicly, that he despises her.

After all, Prince Harry's Spare -- released in January 2023 -- was a bestseller, and the public is arguably as interested (if not more so) in Meghan's story.\n\nAccording to royal author Tom Quinn, the thought of a tell-all from Meghan certainly -- how shall we say it? -- doesn't fill King Charles with great excitement and joyous anticipation, let's put it that way. The King is said to be worried about the prospect of a Meghan memoir, especially since he knows that his son, Prince Harry, is bound to be involved in it somehow. (Just in case you haven't heard, relations are a bit frosty right now between father and son.)\n\nThe Mirror reports that Meghan's potential book is believed to be in preparation for the forthcoming launch of her new lifestyle brand, American Riviera Orchard. According to Quinn, Charles particularly fears that private conversations could end up being made public: \"When King Charles heard his son was planning to return for the Invictus Games, he joked that if he saw Harry, he would have to have him searched first to see if he was taping their conversation,\" Quinn said. \"And, of course, at many levels this is no joking matter.\"\n\nHarry was in the U.K. this week for the 10-year anniversary celebrations of the Invictus Games, but the King didn't make time to see him. Though Harry's brother Prince William fares arguably worst of all, Charles also has moments in Spare of not being painted in the best light -- and there have \"been reports he [Harry] was working on a follow up book,\" The Mirror reports. \"However, these plans were said to be scrapped following the damage Spare did to Harry's relationship with Charles.\"\n\nHarry did say he had enough material for a second volume of Spare, but that what he could say (and what was left on the cutting room floor from the first iteration, which ran over 400 pages long) would likely end his relationship with his father and brother for good, forever. \"There was a sigh of relief at Kensington Palace and Clarence House that Harry appears to have scrapped the idea of a second book after his bestseller Spare, but the focus has now switched to Meghan,\" Quinn said. \"King Charles now fears that anything he says to his son may end up in a book written by Meghan.\"\n\nQuinn added that writing a tell-all would be a shrewd business move on Meghan's part as she continues to expand her empire, not just with her new lifestyle brand but also with her ongoing Netflix deal (which she shares with Harry) and her forthcoming podcast with Lemonada Media.\n\n\"For all her efforts to make a success of her new online business, American Riviera Orchard, Meghan knows that a personal memoir of her time in the U.K. as a working royal would sell millions of copies and make her the sort of money she craves,\" Quinn said. \"She is also acutely aware that such a book would only boost traffic to her new online business. All this fills King Charles with horror, because Harry is bound to be a major contributor to the book.\"", "source": {"uri": "marieclaire.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Marie Claire"}, "authors": [{"uri": "rachel_burchfield@marieclaire.com", "name": "Rachel Burchfield", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Harry,_Duke_of_Sussex", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_I_of_England", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Charles I of England"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoir", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Memoir"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meghan,_Duchess_of_Sussex", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Meghan, Duchess of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Confirmation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times_Best_Seller_list", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times Best Seller list"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invictus_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Invictus Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Mirror", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Daily Mirror"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William,_Prince_of_Wales", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "William, Prince of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Riviera", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "French Riviera"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarence_House", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Clarence House"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kensington_Palace", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kensington Palace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horror_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Horror film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Podcast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Paranormal/Prophecies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Paranormal/Prophecies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WwmDjkLt2F8vtojU7cRysj-1200-80.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550326", "eventUri": "eng-9550326", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1529411764705881, "wgt": 127, "relevance": 1}

Now, just ten days out from their sixth wedding anniversary, Harry and Meghan's officiant has opened up about the royal rift between the couple and King Charles, Queen Camilla, Prince William, and Princess Catherine.\n\nDuring an interview on ITV's Good Morning Britain today, May 9, 2024, the religious figure was asked what he thought of the drama between Harry and the rest of the royal family. Welby's response was short and sweet. \"We must not judge them,\" he said. \"They're human beings, they must not be judged. They need to be prayed for and supported.\" People reports that Welby declined to share information about any private conversations -- or whether or not he's even had any -- with royal family members in regards to the rift.\n\nHarry and Meghan chose Welby to officiate their marriage and worked closely with him in the months leading up to their nuptials, so it's understood that the Archbishop got to know the couple quite well; he also baptized Meghan into the Church of England, a requirement for marriage into the royal family. \"It was very special. It was beautiful and sincere and very moving. It was a great privilege,\" Welby told ITV News in 2018, People reports. \"You know, at the heart of it, is two people, who have fallen in love with each other, who are committing their lives to each other with the most beautiful words and profound thoughts, who do it in the presence of God.\"\n\nWhether or not Harry and Meghan have turned to their former wedding officiant for counsel or support while making their decision to give up their roles as work members of the royal family or in the months following, as the drama between all members intensified, remains to be seen, but there's no denying that the trio certainly grew to know each other well.\n\nEarlier this year, Harry flew from his home in California to London to spend time with his father following news of the king's cancer diagnosis. \"I spoke to him. I jumped on a plane and went to go see him as soon as I could,\" the prince told Good Morning America at the time. \"Look, I love my family. The fact that I was able to get on a plane and go and see him and spend any time with him, I'm grateful for that.\" Now, however, Harry is back in London for the Invictus Games, but a \"full schedule\" is being cited as the reason why he won't be spending any time with King Charles.\n\nHarry and Meghan will celebrate their sixth wedding anniversary in a little over a week, an occasion the pair will likely mark in private. Prince William and Kate Middleton took a similar approach to their own wedding anniversary last month, which they presumably enjoyed at home amid her ongoing cancer battle. According to reports, William had grand plans to \"spoil\" his wife after 13 years of marriage.", "source": {"uri": "brides.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Brides"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_royal_family", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "British royal family"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Welby", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Justin Welby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archbishop", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Archbishop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_Camilla", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Queen Camilla"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Harry,_Duke_of_Sussex", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meghan,_Duchess_of_Sussex", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Meghan, Duchess of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_I_of_England", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Charles I of England"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITV_(TV_network)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ITV (TV network)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catherine,_Princess_of_Wales", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Catherine, Princess of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William,_Prince_of_Wales", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "William, Prince of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITV_News", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ITV News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_of_England", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Church of England"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "God"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baptism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Baptism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invictus_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Invictus Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Morning_America", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Good Morning America"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 74}], "image": "https://www.brides.com/thmb/zaVyedroPKpO_UcpIKL3DO1m_1s=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/prince-harry-meghan-markle-wedding-ceremony-getty-primary-0524-712edafd3b9f4c889416738fd667d2bf.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550326", "eventUri": "eng-9550326", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2018-05-19", "textStart": 147, "textEnd": 159}], "sentiment": 0.1529411764705881, "wgt": 126, "relevance": 1}

Possibly that's why the trip was three days... but as we now know, there will be no family meetings.\"\n\nLikewise, no royal family members stepped out to attend Harry's event, which paints a stark contrast to when he launched the Games a decade ago.\n\n\"When you look at the inaugural Invictus Games back in 2014... he had support from his father and from Prince William,\" Nicholl said. \"... You could see that wonderful closeness between Charles and his sons, and you could see how happy Harry was to have the support of his older brother.\"\n\n\"When you consider that this is the 10th anniversary, this felt a little flat, I think it's fair to say,\" she added. \"He certainly cut a pretty lonely figure... He looked very much an outsider over here in Britain.\"\n\nThe lack of meeting is particularly of note, Nicholl said, as Harry and Charles were \"spitting distance\" from each other at separate events.\n\n\"I think certainly the fact that time hasn't been made over these three days for father and son to have some sort of meeting -- when you consider their last meeting was just about 30 or 40 minutes when Harry flew all the way from California to see his father -- certainly fuels that narrative of a rift.\n\nEven so, Nicholl's sources say \"that the king is very, very keen to get his relationship with his son back on track.\"\n\n\"He very much wants to be close to his son again and to see more of his grandchildren, who he's barely seen since they were born,\" Nicholl said of Harry and Meghan Markle's kids Archie, 5, and Lilibet, 2.\n\nBecause of that, Nicholl said, \"There is a sense of surprise that he hasn't made time to see his son.\"\n\nThe \"fundamental issue\" remains, however, as there's been \"this breakdown of trust between Harry and the family,\" according to Nicholl.\n\n\"Clearly, there are still some pretty major trust issues and concerns on Charles' part that any private meetings or conversations that he has with his son may not stay private for long,\" she said. \"I think Harry's going to have to work really quite hard to repair some of that trust before he's going to get a sort of privileged audience with his father.\"\n\nKnowing that, Nicholl said that she believes \"there is just a feeling of of disappointment, certainly on Harry's part, and genuine sadness that he hasn't got to see his father.\"\n\n\"When you take away the rift and who they are in terms of the royal family, they are a family, and Harry's gone through an awful lot since finding out his father's been diagnosed with cancer,\" Nicholl said. \"He's all those miles away, understandably very worried about his papa, as he calls him, and he is here for three days. I think it was very much his hope that he'd get to see his father. I'm told he's rather hurt and quite disappointed that he hasn't had that opportunity.\"\n\nAn additional disappointment for Harry may come from the fact that, on Wednesday, Charles appointed William to be the Colonel-in-Chief of the Army Air Corps, a role the king held for 31 years. It was Harry, however, who served multiple tours in Afghanistan, serving in the very unit that William will be in charge of.\n\n\"I think many people will see that as a bit of a snub from the palace, and perhaps a little bit of a poke in the ribs to Prince Harry... He's been stripped of his right to wear his military uniform, and now his brother's taken over the role that... Harry certainly would have expected to come to him had he still been a working member of the royal family,\" Nicholl told ET. \"I think the timing does feel poignant. I think it's probably another slap in the face for Prince Harry, and yet another reminder that he's very much out rather than in when it comes to the royal family.\"\n\nWith that in mind, Harry and Meghan aren't expected to be invited to June's Trooping the Colour.\n\n\"I think it's incredibly unlikely,\" Nicholl said. \"They are not working members of the royal family.

Leave it with us.\"\n\nPrince Harry, meanwhile, was in central London on Wednesday celebrating the 10th anniversary of his Invictus Games. It fuelled hopes he could have used the opportunity to see his father but a spokesman for the duke said the King's \"full programme\" meant the get-together would not happen.\n\nBBC Royal correspondent Michael Cole called it \"quite a snub\".Harry and Charles last met soon after the King announced his cancer diagnosis in February when the prince, who lives with his family in California, travelled from the US to see his father.\n\nHarry's visit to St Paul's Cathedral - just a few miles from where his father was - saw him give a reading at the anniversary service where he was supported by guests including his mother's sister and brother, Lady Jane Fellowes and Earl Spencer, and former army officer Mark Dyer who acted as a mentor to him after Diana's death.\n\nHis spokesman said the duke, who is heading to Nigeria later where he will be reunited with his wife, Meghan Markle, hopes to see the King \"soon\".\n\nMeanwhile, Harry's brother William is in Newquay in Cornwall before travelling to the Isles of Scilly on Friday.\n\nAmong the sites he is visiting on Thursday is the Duchy of Cornwall's first homeless housing project which will provide 24 homes with wraparound carein Nansleden, Newquay.\n\nIt has also been announced his father has accepted the patronage of the Royal Society of Portrait Painters whose annual exhibition opens to the public at the

A friend of the King and Queen tells the Daily Beast that Harry made \"cruel\" comments about Camilla in Spare, and the couple aren't over it.\n\n\"Harry has made things very difficult for himself by saying such cruel and hurtful things about Camilla,\" the friend said. \"Charles loves his sons, but he also loves his wife. The last few months have made it very clear how important she is; she has been the one propping up the whole edifice.\"\n\nThe friend adds that \"Harry has made it very clear, very publicly, that he despises her. He has forced Charles to choose, which was a very silly thing to do because Camilla and he both chose each other a long time ago. William had his reservations but he accepted his father's choice and got on with it. Harry made a different decision, and one of the inevitable consequences of publicly calling your stepmother cruel names is that it becomes difficult for you to see your father.\"\n\nMeanwhile, one of Prince William and Kate Middleton's friends said \"It is hardly surprising that Charles didn't invite Harry round for tea and a scone. He did, after all, portray his wife as an evil, calculating, bitch in the biggest selling book since the Bible.\"\n\nAnd, um, this isn't even the saltiest quote the Daily Beast procured.

At the time, he and his wife Meghan said they would be becoming financially independent, with them deciding to move to America mere months later.\n\nAnd now former royal butler Paul Burrell has said that he thinks the Royal Family is now \"letting him get on with it\", with him also revealing that he believes the Duke is getting closer to isolating himself completely by pressing the \"self-destruct button\".\n\nFor all the latest on news, politics, sports, and showbiz from the USA, go to The Mirror US.\n\nREAD MORE: Prince Harry and Meghan Markle to have bombshells exposed in upcoming German documentary\n\nHarry greeted wellwishers who had turned out to see him last night in London\n\nPaul Burrell is a former servant of the British Royal Household and latterly butler to Diana, Princess of Wales. The now-65-year-old joined the household of the then-Prince Charles and late Princess Diana at Highgrove House in 1987, with him working as Diana's butler until her death in 1997.\n\nSpeaking on behalf of Spin Genie, Mr Burrell said: \"I think they are just letting him get on with it now, I don't think they are too happy about it but Harry is taking another step closer all the time to isolation. Harry has pressed the self-destruct button and he is going ahead with what he thinks is right and I think he will come unstuck. I don't think all their plans are going to pan out, I think there is a time scale to his destruction.\"\n\nMr Burrell went on to note how he believes that \"none of this would have happened and there wouldn't be this mess if Diana was still here\", he added that she \"would have cleared it up\", but concluded by saying that \"there is no one to do it and so it is going to rumble on because nobody is brave enough to stick their neck out and no one is strong enough for Harry to listen to\".\n\nThis comes after the Duke of Sussex flew back to the UK from his home in California for an Invictus Games event, with him seemingly \"snubbed\" by his father and the wider Royal Family. Soon after Harry touched down in London on Tuesday, a spokesperson for the Duke said: \"It, unfortunately, will not be possible due to His Majesty's full programme.

He wanted her to follow the example of her oldest sister Sarah: marry a country landowner, live in a nice house, have children, be happy.\n\nJohnnie knew all about the Royal Family. As a young man, after distinguished war service, he was an Equerry to King George VI and to the young Queen Elizabeth II when she succeeded her father in February, 1952.\n\nHe had accompanied the late Queen on her early foreign tours was made a Member of her personal order of chivalry, The Royal Victorian Order, but only fourth class.\n\nJohnnie saw the Royal Family up close and personal. He was not in the least starry-eyed about the Windsors - now Mountbatten-Windsors - and wanted to safeguard his youngest daughter from the incessant public scrutiny that would be her fate as Princess of Wales.\n\n'I just wanted Diana to be happy', he told me years later. 'I didn't want her to have to bear all that responsibility. Who would?'\n\nBut when the engagement became a fair accompli, he went along with it. A keen cricketer, he 'played the game' in television interviews before Diana's wedding in 1981, saying how delighted he was by a match that in truth made him fearful for his beloved daughter's future.\n\nAnd, of course, he gave Diana away, escorting her down the long aisle of St. Paul's Cathedral to plight her troth to Prince Charles, mixing up the order of his names in the process.\n\nBut the Spencers never went weak at the knees at the sight of a royal personage. Diana, who had had a severe case of cold feet before her wedding, would often remind Prince Charles that her royal lineage was more than equal to his own - tracing her ancestry back to Charles II and the Scottish Stuart kings whereas his dated from the German Hanoverian monarchs of the 18th century.\n\nAsked by an impudent reporter if she was looking forward to being a Princess, the 19 year old Lady Diana Spencer replied, 'I have a title of my own, thank you very much'.\n\nFor their part, the Windsors were suspicious of the Spencers who had the allegation of 'Mad Blood' hanging over them. The Earl of Leicester had forbidden the marriage of his daughter, Lady Anne Coke, later Lady Glenconnor and recently a best-selling author, to Johnnie Spencer because the rumoured mental weakness in the Spencer genes.\n\nWhen the marriage of the Prince and Princess of Wales came apart in circumstances that could not have been more acrimonious, nor more public, it was natural that the Spencers would side with Diana. But this was not without complications.\n\nDiana's older sister Lady Jane had married Robert Fellowes, the son of the estate manager at Sandringham where the Spencer children grew up at Park House, close to the parish church of St. Mary Magdalene. Fellowes had become a courtier to the late Queen and rose to be her Private Secretary at the time his sister-in-law Diana was divorcing his boss's oldest son, Charles.\n\nThis was not easy for either family. It resulted in Diana not being on speaking terms with her sister Jane although the three sisters could not have been greater friends before Diana's marriage to Prince Charles.\n\nIt took the diplomatic skills of Raine, Countess Spencer to maintain good relations with Prince Charles. This she accomplished brilliantly, always hoping to promote peace and amity between the two families.\n\nThis uneasy truce existed until the terrible death of Diana, Princess of Wales, in Paris in the early hours of August 31, 1997. During the six days leading to her funeral at Westminster Abbey, a strong current of anti-royal feeling swept through the country.\n\nIt was an atmosphere of antipathy that I had never known before and would have said was impossible until I saw for myself the resentment - bordering on outrage - that the public felt about the way Diana had been treated during her 15 mainly unhappy years within the Royal Family.\n\nThis was exacerbated by the failure to fly the Union Flag at half-mast over Buckingham Palace and the decision of the Queen to remain at Balmoral, saying nothing about the death of Diana until persuaded to do so by the new Prime Minister, Tony Blair.\n\nOne tabloid newspaper even published the headline: 'SPEAK TO US, MA'AM!'\n\nPrince Charles had to persuade his mother to allow Diana to have a State funeral and to allow her coffin to rest in the Chapel Royal opposite St. James's Palace the night before.\n\nThe climax of the growing storm of public disquiet and antipathy was reached when Diana's brother, Charles, the 9th Earl Spencer, mounted the steps into the pulpit at Westminster Abbey on September 6, 1997, and delivered the most remarkable - and certainly the most coruscating - eulogy ever heard within those ancient walls.\n\nI was sitting ten yards away. There was nothing subtle about the Charles Spencer's attack on the Royal Family. It was direct, it was incendiary, it hit home, as I could see from the faces and demeanour of the Queen and other members of the Royal Family facing the pulpit.\n\nAt the end, something almost as extraordinary happened. The cheering and applause that could be heard outside the Abbey, rolled in through the great West Door and swept up the aisle until the congregation were also clapping to approve the Earl's heartfelt, bitter and quite devastating address. British people never applaud in church. But they did that day.\n\nThose words that will live forever in the annals of English prose. Whether it was wise of Charles Spencer is quite another matter. Words have power. The Earl's words that historic morning cemented another brick in the wall between the Spencers and the Windsors.\n\nThat divide was shown in its deepest and starkest form this week when Prince Harrys' 'birth family', led by Earl Spencer and his sister Lady Jane Fellowes, went to St Paul's to support him at the thanksgiving service celebrating the 10th anniversary of his Invictus Games. And the entire Royal Family stayed away.\n\nWhen Princess Diana's coffin arrived at Althorp, for burial on the Spencer family estate in Northamptonshire, Charles Spencer whipped off the flag that covered it and replaced it with the Spencer standard. Nothing could have illustrated more clearly the gap that will always separate two famous families.\n\nWords have power and actions have consequences, as Prince Harry, whose criticisms of his Windsor family have been harsh, cruel and wounding, is increasingly finding out.\n\nMichael Cole is a former BBC royal correspondent and commentator\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMr Cole pointed out that while Harry's 'birth family' - led by Earl Spencer and Lady Jane Fellowes - went to St Paul's to support the Duke, 'the entire Royal Family stayed away'.\n\nHe also recalled that when Princess Diana's coffin arrived for burial on the Spencer family estate of at Althorp in Northamptonshire in 1997, Earl Spencer 'whipped off the flag that covered it and replaced it with the Spencer standard'.\n\nMr Cole said: 'Nothing could have illustrated more clearly the gap that will always separate two famous families.\n\n'Words have power and actions have consequences, as Prince Harry - whose criticisms of his Windsor family have been harsh, cruel and wounding - is increasingly finding out. '\n\nGoing back to before Princess Diana and then-Prince Charles wed in 1981, Mr Cole said Diana's father Earl 'Johnnie' Spencer did not want the marriage to take place and advised against it.\n\nMr Cole said Johnnie wanted Diana to 'follow the example of her oldest sister Sarah: marry a country landowner, live in a nice house, have children, be happy'.\n\nHe also pointed out that Johnnie knew all about the Royal Family, given that he was an equerry to King George VI and to the young Queen Elizabeth II when she became the monarch in February 1952.\n\nMr Cole said Johnnie had accompanied the late Queen on her early foreign tours and was made a member of her personal order of chivalry, The Royal Victorian Order.\n\nHe continued: 'Johnnie saw the Royal Family up close and personal. He was not in the least starry-eyed about the Windsors - now Mountbatten-Windsors - and wanted to safeguard his youngest daughter from the incessant public scrutiny that would be her fate as Princess of Wales.'\n\nMr Cole said Johnnie told him years later: 'I just wanted Diana to be happy.

The Duke acknowledged them with a wave as he strode up St Paul's steps and was warmly greeted warmly greeted by the Dean of St Paul's, the Very Reverend Andrew Tremlett.\n\nEarl Spencer and his

found the global tournament after attending the Warrior Games in Colorado in 2013 and seeing how injured American military personnel thrived on the challenge of taking part in competitive sports that aided their recovery.\n\nHe went on to stage the inaugural games in London's Olympic Park in 2014 and the tournament has been held across the globe from Orlando and Sydney to Dusseldorf in 2023, with the 2025 event being hosted in Vancouver and Whistler.\n\nThe St Paul's congregation of just over 1,000 people gave a standing ovation after ex-RAF servicewoman Michelle Turner, husband John and daughter Maya each read verses of a poem that described their experiences following Mrs Turner's medical discharge, after a tropical disease she caught while on deployment affected her heart.\n\nMrs Turner, Team UK captain for the 2018 Games, told the guests: 'Wounded, injured, sick, and now with no career: consumed by insecurities, the pain and the fear.\n\nPrince Harry waves as he arrives to

she said 'Thank you Invictus for giving my life back', the congregation stood and applauded.\n\nThe Dean of St Paul's echoed her words in his sermon when he said the Invictus Games Foundation, which organises the competition, was ' ... not only changing lives through sport but quite literally by saving lives'.\n\nHarry later joined some of the Invictus community for a private reception in the cathedral's crypt and it is thought he will travel on Thursday to Nigeria, for a tour of the African country with his wife Meghan.\n\nWhen Harry left he went on a brief walkabout, shaking hands with

I thought it would be a morning service or, at the latest, something around noon. I think it started at like 5 pm GMT? Anyway, that's why we're covering it today, because it took a while to get the photos and everything.\n\nIt was also amazing to watch it unfold in real time on social media, because the royal reporters desperately wanted to cover Harry's every move, but King Charles set up his dumbass \"garden party\" to start at almost the exact same time as the Invictus service. Literally, as Charles and Camilla were staggering around greeting guests, Harry was walking up the steps of St. Paul's Cathedral. Which meant that most of the rota was basically blocked from waiting around the cathedral like groupies. Still, the photographers were out in full force and Harry looked like a king, walking up and down those steps by himself, waving to his adoring crowds.\n\nTom Sykes at the Daily Beast tried to make it sound like Charles \"delivered a harsh message of rejection\" by ordering the other Windsors to stay away from the Invictus service and... you know, scheduling a garden party for the exact time as Harry's service. Is it really a harsh message of rejection? I'm sure that's what Charles intended, but it came across as fearful. Terrified, even. Charles had to assemble his version of the Avengers (a bunch of old farts with made-up titles) just to create counterprogramming for a handsome prince, the son of Britain's beloved Lady Diana Spencer, being celebrated for creating the Invictus Games and the Invictus community. The intention, as Sykes writes, was to \"overshadow\" Harry's day. But the Windsors ended up looking old, terrified, out of touch, spiteful, petty and anti-veteran. Sidenote: after these shenanigans, I really don't see how the 2027 games would ever go to Birmingham, let's be real.\n\nBesides, Harry's other family came out for the service. The Earl Spencer (Harry's uncle) was there, as were Harry's aunts Lady Jane Fellowes and Lady Sarah McCorquodale. Three of Harry's Spencer-fam cousins were there as well. Just what Charles wanted - another reminder that Harry is Diana's son, that Harry inherited the Spencer rizz, and that Diana's memory lives on in her youngest child.", "source": {"uri": "celebitchy.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Celebitchy"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invictus_Records", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Invictus Records"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_I_of_England", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Charles I of England"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_Camilla", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Queen Camilla"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Sykes", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tom Sykes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Daily_Beast", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Daily Beast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Paul's_Cathedral", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "St Paul's Cathedral"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathedral", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cathedral"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jane_Fellowes,_Lady_Fellowes", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jane Fellowes, Lady Fellowes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Spencer,_5th_Earl_Spencer", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "John Spencer, 5th Earl Spencer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_Sarah_McCorquodale", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lady Sarah McCorquodale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invictus_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Invictus Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Avengers_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Avengers (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diana,_Princess_of_Wales", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Diana, Princess of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birmingham", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Birmingham"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Birmingham"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/General_Merchandise/O", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/General Merchandise/O", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 66}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550326", "eventUri": "eng-9550326", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 120, "relevance": 1}

Charles Spencer and Lady Sarah McCorquodale with their nephew at a Service to remember Princess Diana in 2007\n\nEarl Spencer made an eviscerating speech at Princess Diana's funeral in 1997 vowing to protect his nephews despite their 'duty' and referring to himself as her 'blood family'\n\nPictured: Earl Spencer, Princess Diana, King Charles, Lady Jane Fellowes and Lady Sarah McCorquodale at Earl Spencer's 21st birthday party\n\n'We fully respect the heritage into which they have both been born and will always respect and encourage them in their royal role but we, like you, recognise the need for them to experience as many different aspects of life as possible to arm them spiritually and emotionally for the years ahead.\n\n'I know you would have expected nothing less from us.'\n\nAs he made mention of 'duty and tradition' and stressed that he, Lady Jane Fellowes and Lady Sarah McCorquodale were Diana's 'blood family', Earl Spencer made it clear that he and his siblings were close to the late Princess, in comparison to the family into which she married.\n\nIt was an inflammatory speech perhaps further fuelled by the fact Princess Diana had named Earl Spencer the guardian of William and Harry in her will.\n\nAn ITV documentary, Diana: The Day Britain Cried, which aired in 2017, revealed Earl Spencer's eviscerating speech was, unsurprisingly, received poorly by the Royal Family , who did not even applaud at the end.\n\nMartin Neary, Westminster Abbey's musical director, told the documentary: 'I felt a great sympathy for what she had suffered but at the same time I was shocked by some of things which were said.\n\n'The princes actually applauded at the end, although the senior members of the Royal Family did not.'\n\nEarl Spencer has previously claimed he was 'lied to' about William and Harry wanting to walk behind Princess Diana's coffin at her funeral procession - which he says they did not\n\nSir Malcom Ross, one of the Queen's right-hand men who was responsible for the funeral arrangement, added: 'It grated to me on the day because I thought he was actually having a little bit of a go at the Royal Family.\n\n'It was my mistake to leave the doors of the Abbey open. What that meant was that when Lord Spencer made his remarks the audience outside applauded, which, in fact, started the audience inside applauding.'\n\nHe added, rather unconvincingly: 'Fine. I don't think anybody took offence.'\n\nEarl Spencer has continued to speak out against the royal family in the years following her death and has claimed he was lied to about his sister's funeral procession.\n\nIn 2017, he claimed he had been told by royal officials that his nephews wanted to walk behind Diana's coffin in the funeral procession, after he had raised concerns about it.\n\nDescribing the moment as the 'most horrifying half hour of my life', he revealed he still has nightmares about the 'harrowing' experience.\n\nHowever he acknowledged that the walk would have been 'a million times worse' for William and Harry.\n\nSpeaking on Radio 4's Today Programme, he slammed the decision for the boys to follow the coffin as a 'very bizarre and cruel thing'.\n\nEarl Spencer and his sisters attended the unveiling of a memorial fountain for Princess Diana in Hyde Park\n\nSpeaking to the BBC earlier this year, the Earl said he believed the treatment Princess Diana suffered was worse than that of Catherine, Princess of Wales\n\nHe added: 'Eventually I was lied to and told they wanted to do it, which of course they didn't but I didn't realise that.'\n\nAddressing his funeral speech, he added: 'I don't feel I said many pointed things. I believe that every word I said was true and it was important for me to be honest.\n\n'I wasn't looking to make any jabs at anyone actually. I was trying to celebrate Diana - and if by doing that it showed up particularly the press, I think, in a bad way, well, they had that coming.'\n\nSpeaking to the Guardian in 2002, Earl Spencer took further swipes at the royal family over the frequency in which he saw his nephews.\n\nHe did not reveal how often he saw William and Harry but said: 'What I can say is that they may not be encouraged to stay in touch with their mother's side of the family.'\n\nAt the time, a spokesperson for St James's Palace declined to comment on what was a 'private family matter'.\n\nIn line with the royal family's 'never complain, never explain' motto, the feud has been somewhat more muted - however, there have been signs of hostility towards the Spencers on the royal side as well.\n\nFor example, neither Earl Spencer, nor his sisters, were invited to King Charles's Coronation last May, in a snub for the uncle of the King's sons.\n\nAt the time, a friend of the Earl told the Independent: 'What's galling is that Earl Spencer may well have turned down the invitation for obvious historic reasons, but this brutal exclusion left no option for any elegant diplomacy.'\n\nOver the last few months, Earl Spencer has undertaken several interviews in light of the release of his memoir, A Very Private School, in which he detailed horrific experiences of abuse he suffered while attending boarding school in Northamptonshire.\n\nAt the time of the interviews, conspiracy theories were raging online about the Princess of Wales, who had been taking time out from royal duties as a result of an abdominal operation.\n\nIt was later revealed that the Princess had been undergoing chemotherapy due to the presence of cancer cells which were discovered after her surgery, however this was not publicly known at the time, leading to wild theories circulating online about her wellbeing.\n\nSpeaking to the BBC, Earl Spencer addressed the conspiracy theories surrounding Kate's health, while the Palace kept quiet about her condition.\n\nHe told Laura Kuenssberg the situation had been worse for his late sister, saying: 'I think it was more dangerous back in the day.'\n\nAs Earl Spencer, Lady Jane Fellowes and Lady Sarah McCorquodale have continued to support Prince Harry since his move to the US, they have filled a void left by the rift that has continued to deepen between the Duke and the royals.\n\nYesterday, as Harry proudly attended his Invictus Games event at St Paul's Cathedral, he was pictured warmly embracing his uncle with a beaming smile on his face.\n\nThe presence of the Spencers at the event follows support they have offered to him many times since he moved to the US - with his aunts among the few of Harry's family members to have attended Princess Lilibet's christening.\n\nWhile there are glimmers of hope that Harry's frosty relationship with his father's side of the family is beginning to thaw, he has the firm support of his mother's side of the family until that day comes.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

One on the ground and one in the air. He wasn't messing around out there,\" Wiseman tells PEOPLE, referring to Harry's decade of service in the British Army from 2005 to 2015 and two tours in Afghanistan.\n\n\"The identity of being a soldier doesn't go away or change because you're a prince or a duke. He feels that. He feels part of this community and we feel him as part of our community,\" Wiseman says. \"That's the passion and drives him in, wishing to serve this community. In terms of that vision -- I was shot in the chest in 2009 and finally left the Army May 1, 2013. I think on May 15 I was on this tour with Prince Harry and called in to see the Warrior Games.\"\n\nRelated: Why the Royal Family Did Not Attend Prince Harry's Invictus Games Service in London\n\nKing Charles' younger son has cited a May 2013 trip to the U.S. where he saw the adaptive sports tournament for wounded, ill and injured active duty and veteran U.S. military service members organized by the U.S. Department of Defense as the breakthrough inspiration to launch the Invictus Games, which Wiseman verifies came to be over breakfast the next day.\n\n\"He could see where this was going. He sat there, glass of orange juice in hand and created this vision. He said 'This is mega. What we're seeing here is brilliant but let's take it back, let's internationalize it, invite the world and the general public, put it in the Olympic Park and put it on the BBC and let's have a huge closing concert and use it as a focal point to inspire the world,' \" he recalls. \"He could see it on that very morning and that's where he took us.\"\n\nThe inaugural Invictus Games were held at the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park in London in September 2014. The anniversary service at St. Paul's celebrated the decade of impact Invictus has had through sport, highlighted by six cycles of competition in London, Orlando (2016), Toronto (2017), Sydney (2018) and The Hague (2022, bumped from 2020 due to the pandemic) and D\u00fcsseldorf (2023). The latest Games welcomed 550 athletes from 21 countries across 10 sports, and the next event is set for Vancouver and Whistler, Canada in 2025 where winter sports will debut for the first time.\n\nChalmers says that while the reach has been massive, Prince Harry's vision was simple.\n\nRelated: Prince Harry Reveals His Favorite Invictus Games Memory Involves a USA-UK Face-Off During London Visit\n\n\"As far as I can say, the Duke set out to do two things. Create a platform that could give us physical and mental recovery, and secondly, what we had learned about ourselves and more importantly, what we'd learned about disability and the world he could see this was an opportunity to educate and inspire people out with our community,\" he says.\n\n\"That's the service element of it. What he really set out to do by bringing those people to see it and giving us the stage was to basically bottle what we were all living. That's where that 'I Am' and the name Invictus Games came from,\" he continued, referring to the William Ernest Henley poem that inspired the Invictus motto and was read at the Service of Thanksgiving.\n\nChalmers and Wiseman both joke that they could have come up with the idea but only one person could deliver it.\n\nCan't get enough of PEOPLE's Royals coverage?

But he decided to commit it to others and to our community -- a community that he's part of,\" Chalmers says of Prince Harry's platform. And I will be forever grateful that I got caught in the wake of that and got to be part of it and continue to be part of it.\"\n\nChalmers suffered life-threatening injuries while serving with the Royal Marines in Afghanistan, became captain for Team Great Britain's trike cycling at the first event in 2014 and won a gold medal before becoming an Invictus Games Foundation trustee. Wiseman, meanwhile, helped helm the original executive team for the first Invictus Games and captained at Orlando 2016, and has clinched 14 medals.\n\n\"No one wants to see me in my Speedos anymore, \" Wiseman jokes about his former Invictus sport of swimming. \"My job now is to bring in more and more nations who have a closer proximity to not just conflict but deployment. Soldiers, sailors and airmen don't just do fighting but do so much around the world to support us in the international community.\"", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news",

The Duke of Sussex headed to the U.K. this week for a celebration of the 10th anniversary of the Invictus Games, and he will then head to Nigeria for more Invictus-related events where Markle will join him. According to a report by PEOPLE, they still made time for a \"low-key\" party just before leaving.\n\n\"They'll have friends around them and Meghan's mom, Doria [Ragland],\" a source close to the couple said on Monday. \"Meghan will definitely have support that weekend.\" The insider added that Archie's younger sister Lilibet will also be celebrating, saying: \"They are so sweet together.

Markle and the children did not attend the coronation at all, just as she skipped the event in London this week.\n\nPundits have had a lot to say about the Sussexes' recent travel itinerary. The fact that Markle is traveling overseas to visit Nigeria but skipped the portion of the trip in the U.K. struck many as an intentional sleight. The Duchess has not been back to the U.K. since Queen Elizabeth II's Platinum Jubilee in 2022.\n\nThe prince's time in the U.K. did not go as planned, either. Previous reports indicated that his event in London would end at the same as his father's event at Buckingham Palace just two miles away, and that the two would meet up afterward. However, according to a report by The Post the meeting fell through because of the king's \"full\" schedule. Royal expert Charlotte Griffiths said that they actually called the meeting off because they couldn't agree on who would be joining them.\n\n\"I think the reason was because Harry made certain demands about who could be in the room and who couldn't. Although on the surface it looks like a snub, Harry made it very difficult for his father,\" Griffiths said. \"Maybe other forces were driving Charles' position on this. William may have had a thought about how this meeting should be conducted or whether it should be conducted at all.\"\n\n\"We know that Charles likes to meet Harry with Camilla in the room, which isn't always a popular decision,\" she went on. \"Harry was without his wife as well, so this was fraught with difficulty.\"\n\n0comments", "source": {"uri": "popculture.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Celebrity"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Harry,_Duke_of_Sussex", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Archie_of_Sussex", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prince Archie of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meghan,_Duchess_of_Sussex", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Meghan, Duchess of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invictus_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Invictus Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coronation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sussex", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sussex"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princess_Lilibet_of_Sussex", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Princess Lilibet of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_I_of_England", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Charles I of England"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platinum_Jubilee_of_Elizabeth_II", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Platinum Jubilee of Elizabeth II"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_Camilla", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Queen Camilla"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckingham_Palace", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Buckingham Palace"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte,_North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Charlotte, North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Charlotte, North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/2021/08/05/a58c9860-f63f-419a-a030-ff529975bc5e/harry-meghan-archie-20107596.jpg?width=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550326", "eventUri": "eng-9550326", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4823529411764707, "wgt": 117, "relevance": 1}

Image: Instagram via @_meghanandharry_\n\nIn a striking display of family dynamics, Prince Harry's Invictus Games service became the stage for a notable absence: the Royal Family.\n\nWhile Harry warmly embraced his uncle, Earl Spencer, and aunt, Lady Jane Fellowes, at St Paul's Cathedral, the rest of the royal bloodline opted for a garden party hosted by King Charles.\n\nFormer BBC royal correspondent Michael Cole highlighted the significance of this divide.\n\nHe emphasised that the Spencers and the Windsors have never shared a close bond, according to Daily Mail.\n\nAccording to Cole, the rift dates back to Princess Diana's father, Earl 'Johnnie' Spencer, who initially advised against her marriage to Prince Charles.\n\nHe expressed concerns about the intense public scrutiny she would face.\n\nDespite his reservations, Johnnie Spencer ultimately supported the marriage. He symbolically gave Diana away at St. Paul's Cathedral.\n\nHowever, the Spencer family never fully embraced the aura of royalty. Diana herself asserted her title and lineage, according to Hello.\n\nThe tensions between the families escalated during Diana's tumultuous divorce from Prince Charles. The Spencers naturally sided with Diana.\n\nEarl Spencer's impassioned eulogy at Diana's funeral openly criticised the Royal Family. This further cemented the divide between the two dynasties.\n\nFast forward to the present, and the rift remains palpable.\n\nAt Harry's Invictus service, attended by his 'birth family,' represented by Earl Spencer and Lady Jane Fellowes, the absence of the Royal Family spoke volumes.\n\nThe Spencers' unwavering support for Harry contrasts starkly with the perceived detachment of the Windsors, according to the Tatler.\n\nThe symbolic gesture of Earl Spencer replacing the Union Flag with the Spencer standard upon Diana's coffin's arrival at Althorp epitomised the enduring gap between the two families.\n\nAs Cole aptly points out, \"Words have power and actions have consequences.\"\n\nPrince Harry's criticisms of his Windsor family have only served to deepen the chasm, with his 'birth family' providing a steadfast counterbalance.\n\nDespite the absence of the Royal Family, Harry's Invictus service was a poignant affair.\n\nEx-RAF servicewoman Michelle Turner delivered a moving poem describing her journey of recovery through the Invictus Games.\n\nThe congregation's standing ovation underscored the profound impact of the event.\n\nHarry continues to navigate his complex relationship with the Royal Family.\n\nThe divide between the Spencers and the Windsors remains a poignant reminder of the complexities of royal lineage and familial dynamics.\n\nIn the words of Cole, \"Nothing could have illustrated more clearly the gap that will always separate two famous families.\"\n\nPrince Harry's Invictus service serves as a microcosm of the enduring divide between the Spencers and the Windsors.\n\nAs Harry forges his path, the contrasting loyalties of his 'birth family' and the Royal Family continue to shape his journey.", "source": {"uri": "thesouthafrican.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The South African"}, "authors": [{"uri": "precious_simpasa@thesouthafrican.com", "name": "Precious Simpasa", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Harry,_Duke_of_Sussex", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_royal_family", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "British royal family"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earl_Spencer_(peerage)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Earl Spencer (peerage)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_I_of_England", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Charles I of England"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diana,_Princess_of_Wales", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Diana, Princess of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jane_Fellowes,_Lady_Fellowes", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jane Fellowes, Lady Fellowes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invictus", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Invictus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Paul's_Cathedral", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "St Paul's Cathedral"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invictus_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Invictus Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Mail", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Daily Mail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "BBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spencer_family", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spencer family"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Funeral_of_Diana,_Princess_of_Wales", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Funeral of Diana, Princess of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hello!_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hello!

He was seen wearing a navy suit and his military medals as he waved to the crowd.\n\nAlso noticeable on his wrist was a silver bangle as well as a green beaded bracelet. Harry has been wearing them for more than two decades and is rarely seen without the bracelets.

Harry wore the bracelet while with his brother Prince William as they cheered on their teammates at a charity polo match. William was seen wearing a very similar bangle.\n\nIt's believed Harry first got his bracelet on a trip to Africa in 1997, shortly after the death of his mother. The late Princess of Wales died in a car crash in Paris in August of that year.\n\nSpeaking to Town and Country magazine back in 2021, Harry explained: \"I first came in 1997, straight after my mum died. My dad told my brother and me to pack our bags -- we were going to Africa to get away from it all.\"\n\nHe's been wearing the jewellery for decades\n\nHarry also explained how that trip made him feel like himself more than \"anywhere in the world\". He added: \"I have this intense sense of complete relaxation and normality here. To not get recognised, to lose myself in the bush with what I would call the most down-to-earth people on the planet.\"\n\nWhile Harry's silver bangle seems to be a permanent fixture on his wrist, his other bracelet does sometimes change. However, it's always a beaded-style bracelet.\n\nWhen Harry first started dating Meghan Markle, the pair were spotted wearing matching blue, beaded bracelets. The matching bracelets fuelled rumours of a romance between the pair before they eventually went public with their relationship.\n\n* Follow Mirror Celebs on TikTok, Snapchat, Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, YouTube and Threads.", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri": "scarlett_o_toole@mirror.co.uk", "name": "Scarlett O'Toole", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Harry,_Duke_of_Sussex", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bracelet", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bracelet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangle", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bangle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invictus_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Invictus Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Silver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diana,_Princess_of_Wales", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Diana, Princess of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Paul's_Cathedral", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "St Paul's Cathedral"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewellery", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jewellery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William,_Prince_of_Wales", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "William, Prince of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engraving", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Engraving"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polo", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Polo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charitable_organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Charitable organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Mirror", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Daily Mirror"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Africa"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "TikTok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meghan,_Duchess_of_Sussex", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Meghan, Duchess of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Town_&_Country_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Town & Country (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snapchat", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Snapchat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/General_Merchandise/O", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/General Merchandise/O", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 71}], "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article32765667.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_Bracelet_MAIN.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550326", "eventUri": "eng-9550326", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 116, "relevance": 1}

Followed categories will be added to My News.\n\nUnder the ornate ceiling of London's St Paul's Cathedral, an ex-servicewoman, alongside her young daughter and husband, choked up as she told the hundreds gathered how the Invictus Games had saved her life.\n\nSeated in the front row, the event's patron and founder, Prince Harry, was the first to rise in a standing ovation, before wiping away his own tears.\n\nHe certainly cut a lonely figure as he entered the church alone on Wednesday, without a single member of the royal family in attendance (although his mother's brother and sister were there to support him).\n\nThe global headlines this week have largely been centred on the 'will-they, won't-they?' speculation surrounding Harry's potential reunions with estranged relatives during his brief return to the UK for Invictus celebrations.\n\nTo summarise that drama: they won't. Even the King, by Harry's own admission, is too busy.\n\nA disappointment, and just the latest chapter in the ongoing saga.\n\nBut in that moment, at the service of thanksgiving for the 10th anniversary of the Games, the years-long royal soap opera melted away.\n\nLove him or hate him - and rarely is there middle ground - Harry's Invictus Games has proven a triumph.\n\nMore than a decade ago, after attending a similar event in the USA, inspiration struck for the Duke of Sussex, who - as he wrote in his memoir Spare - had struggled to find purpose after leaving the military.\n\nHe witnessed first-hand the power of sport in helping wounded and sick servicemen and women in their recovery - physically, psychologically and socially - and realised he could use his platform to help change their lives.\n\nI've been lucky enough to attend some Invictus Games competitions myself.

It was Harry's ability to connect with people, clearly learned from his mother, that injects each event with authenticity and raw emotion.\n\nAnd whether he liked it or not, it's Harry's years of diplomacy and relationship-building as a prince of the United Kingdom that saw him able to harness all of those skills, along with his personal understanding of the service's struggles, and allowed him to pull it all together.\n\nAfter all the negativity engulfing Harry amid his family squabbles in recent years, the Invictus once again showcased where his true royal power lies: as an advocate for the community who he adores, and who adores him right back.", "source": {"uri": "couriermail.com.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Courier Mail"}, "authors": [{"uri": "bronte_coy@couriermail.com.au", "name": "Bronte Coy", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Harry,_Duke_of_Sussex", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invictus_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Invictus Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invictus_Records", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Invictus Records"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_royal_family", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "British royal family"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_family", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Royal family"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Paul's_Cathedral", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "St Paul's Cathedral"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drama", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Drama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoir", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Memoir"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soap_opera", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Soap opera"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarchy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Monarchy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathedral", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cathedral"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Computer_Platforms", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Computer Platforms", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Genealogy/Royalty", "label": "dmoz/Society/Genealogy/Royalty", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Monarchy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Monarchy", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Family_Resources_and_Support", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Family Resources and Support", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/fc14bae8e0e28d8c627f2092a1ba9a8e", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550326", "eventUri": "eng-9550326", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 115, "relevance": 1}

The duo will then meet the Chief of Defence Staff before heading to visit injured service personnel in hospital during the afternoon. On Saturday, the Duke and Duchess will attend a training session for Nigeria: Unconquered as well as a reception where military families will be honoured.\n\nMeghan is also due to co-host an event of Women in Leadership with Dr Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, the Director-General of the World Trade Organisation on Saturday. Their final day will be Sunday, and Harry and Meghan will attend a basketball clinic with Giants of Africa as well as a cultural reception. Their final engagement will them attend a polo fundraiser for Nigeria: Unconquered.\n\nThe trip comes just days after the Duke of Sussex marked the 10th anniversary of the Invictus Games at St Paul's Cathedral in London on Wednesday.\n\nThe couple also celebrated Prince Archie's fifth birthday on Monday, and will no doubt have made it very special before Harry's visit to the UK and their joint trip to Nigeria.\n\nWhy Prince Harry and Meghan are going to Nigeria\n\nThe Duke and Duchess of Sussex have been invited by the West African country's chief of defence staff, who met Harry in Germany last September at the Invictus Games Dusseldorf.\n\nThe Invictus Games was founded as a sporting event for injured and sick military personnel and veterans. Prince Harry and Meghan are expected to meet service members and their families and participate in traditional cultural activities.\n\nWhy is Nigeria special to the couple\n\nThis will be their first visit to Nigeria as a couple, with the pair having strong links to the country. During last year's Invictus Games, Meghan spent a lot of time bonding with the Nigerian team, who even gave her her own Nigerian name Amira Ngozi Lolo.\n\nThe name holds a special royal meaning; \"Amira\" translates as warrior princess from a legend, \"Ngozi\" means blessed and \"Lolo\" symbolises royal wife.\n\nDuring a chat with Bobby Ojeh, the team leader for the Nigerian team, he opened up about their decision to give Meghan a Nigeran name. \"She has the sentimental attachment to Nigeria, so it dawned on us as a team to say why don't we just give Meghan a name,\" he told HELLO! last year.\n\n\"She's wonderful, she's just wonderful. The way she embraced [her Nigerian heritage] meant a lot to us as Nigerians and this is the message we take back to Nigeria.\"\n\nAt the time, Meghan had told Bobby she wanted to pay Nigeria a visit with her children Archie and Lilibet, and her mother, Doria Ragland. He said: \"Behind every successful man is a woman, and trust me Megahn has been amazing, contributing to the success story of Invictus. The sky is the limit but trust me they are going to the heavens.\"\n\nPrince Harry referred to Meghan's Nigerian heritage at the opening ceremony of the Dusseldorf Invictus Games last September after Nigeria entered the games for the first time.\n\nHarry said that while the Sussexes do not \"play favourites\", the discovery means that things are likely to get \"a little bit more competitive\" between the couple.\n\nLISTEN: The reason why Meghan and her children don't want to visit the UK just yet\n\n\"We're also very excited to have new nations join us,\" the Duke told the packed arena. \"Let's hear it for Colombia, Israel, and Nigeria.\"\n\nHe added: \"Now I'm not saying we play favourites in our home... but since my wife discovered that she is of Nigerian descent, it's likely to get a little bit more competitive this year.\"\n\nMeghan Markle's Nigerian heritage\n\nThe country holds a special place in Meghan's heart as the mum-of-two has Nigerian heritage, she revealed on her former podcast, Archetypes.\n\nTalking with celebrity interviewer Ziwe, the former actress said: \"I just had my genealogy done a couple years ago... [and I'm] Forty-three percent Nigerian.\"\n\nMeghan went on: \"I'm going to start to dig deeper into all this because anybody that I've told, especially Nigerian women, are like 'What!'\"\n\nOther links to Nigeria\n\nIn 2022, Prince Harry and Meghan donated an unspecified amount to charities working in Nigeria to \"help provide relief following devastating flooding\" that ravaged parts of Nigeria, killing more than 600 people.\n\nSave the Children Nigeria tweeted: \"More than 1.5 million children are at risk after devastating flooding in Nigeria. Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's Archewell Foundation has donated to Save the Children in Nigeria as our teams deliver life-saving supplies to affected families.\"", "source": {"uri":

While he shook hands and smiled, body language expert Judi James suggested he felt a \"degree of wariness and anxiety\".\n\nFor all the latest on news, politics, sports, and showbiz from the USA, go to The Mirror US.\n\nREAD MORE: King Charles and Prince Harry 'won't have an easy journey' if they want to fix their relationship\n\nPrince Harry met with fans outside St Paul's Cathedral\n\nSpeaking exclusively to The Mirror, she said: \"The way Harry takes a virtual 'dive' towards the crowds here, bending his legs and his torso into a bit of a crouch suggests he want to make this pressing of the fans' flesh look spontaneous and impromptu.\n\n\"He seems to be bolstered up by the warm greeting as his grin widens with unfiltered pleasure as he shakes the group by their hands, letting everyone know that this is not going to be a long walkabout though by his bent posture.\n\n\"Harry still retains the barrier rituals though. One hand is across his torso at all times here and although its function might seem to be to hold his tie back it looks suspiciously like a barrier ritual that suggests a degree of wariness and anxiety here.\"\n\nHundreds of people waited to catch a glimpse of Harry\n\nJudi also suggested Harry was \"grateful\" for the warm reception he received from the crowd, following reports he and Meghan Markle were worried about people booing. She said: \"Despite those medals pinned to his chest and despite the couple of friendly grins he threw at the crowds, Harry's body language here suggested a slightly forlorn and wary inner state as he exited his car and made his way up the steps to the church.\n\n\"He buttoned his jacket and then kept his hand there, even replacing it as he shook hands with the clergy, suggesting a need for a partial barrier gesture. His three waves to the crowd were relatively humble rather than royal, with the palm held out and the fingers splayed and more of an over-the-shoulder glance than any creation of a more static and deliberate pose of greeting.\n\n\"His grin suggested he was grateful for the reception and keen to create some friendly bonds with the crowds here. The way the grin widened as he turned for one last wave also suggested a possible sense of relief that he had got this very public solo arrival over.\"\n\n* Follow Mirror Celebs on TikTok, Snapchat, Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, YouTube and Threads.", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri": "scarlett_o_toole@mirror.co.uk", "name": "Scarlett O'Toole", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Harry,_Duke_of_Sussex", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Body language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Paul's_Cathedral", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "St Paul's Cathedral"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Mirror", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Daily Mirror"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_royal_family", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "British royal family"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invictus_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Invictus Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathedral", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cathedral"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anxiety", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anxiety"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_I_of_England", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Charles I of England"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "TikTok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meghan,_Duchess_of_Sussex", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Meghan, Duchess of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clergy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Clergy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snapchat", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Snapchat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 81}], "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article32767623.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_harryexcl.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550326", "eventUri": "eng-9550326", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 112, "relevance": 1}

And this was many years before he met his future wife, Meghan Markle, in 2016.\n\nHowever, it is highly unusual for a news organization to name anonymous sources, and this demonstrates the publisher's commitment to defending the case.\n\nOther potential sources were cited, including a member of Prince Harry's \"inner circle\" and \"a socialite and acquaintance of [Prince Harry], a club promoter for Boujis nightclub (a nightclub that both [Prince Harry] and Ms Pinkham frequented) and a freelance journalist who was a friend of Ms Pinkham.\"\n\nIn the case Harry won against Mirror Group Newspapers, much was made of the fact that most of the journalists named in the allegations did not give evidence. However, Mail reporters named in this case have already begun supplying the publisher's lawyers with information about where their stories came from.\n\nAnother of the prince's allegations relates to a 2006 Daily Mail story about a statement the two princes released following the publication in Italy of a photograph of their mother, Princess Diana, as she lay dying.\n\nAccording to the court filing, a source said \"that Prince William took charge and phoned [Prince Harry] to discuss what they should do; an account attributed to a source close to them that it was a 'highly emotional call for both' and that they had not seen the photographs but 'they honestly believe it simply couldn't get much worse.'\"\n\nThe details may sound ripe for an allegation of phone hacking, but the Mail named its source -- Kensington Palace.\n\nThe court filing said the Mail \"spoke to a press officer at Kensington Palace who provided the information\" and then \"asked the press officer whether Prince William was directing the response and was briefed by the press officer that Prince William had taken charge of the situation and phoned [Prince Harry], that the Princes had spoken on the phone to discuss what they should do, were of the same mind and that it was a 'highly emotional call for both.'\"\n\nThis all means Harry may have far more of an uphill battle in this case than the Mirror Group Newspapers case he won and against a high-stakes backdrop.\n\nHarry and Meghan have sued the Mail titles four times, while the prince has accused The Mail on Sunday of causing Meghan's miscarriage in the summer of 2020, during an interview for their 2022 Netflix documentary Harry & Meghan.\n\nIt is a grudge match if there ever was one, but with a huge potential price tag attached to it if the case goes as far as a full trial and ends in defeat for the prince, who would have to pay substantial legal costs.\n\nJack Royston is chief royal correspondent for Newsweek, based in London.

Harry is said to be flying to Nigeria alone to join her in the country, but this is unconfirmed.\n\nThe Duke has been in London since Tuesday where he has attended various events relating to the competition, including a service at St Paul's Cathedral yesterday.\n\nIt is thought that Harry will travel to Nigeria today, with Meghan expected to be making her own way there from California.

An economy single costs \u00a31,651. Premium economy is \u00a33,971 while business is \u00a34,805.\n\nSix commercial flight options from Los Angeles to Lagos\n\nUnited Airlines, via Washington DC - 17h35m (with 2h10m stop) - \u00a31,651Delta Airlines, via Atlanta - 17h45m (with 2h20m stop) - \u00a31,577Air France/Delta Airlines, via Paris - 19h10m (with 3h15m stop) - \u00a31,574American Airlines/British Airways, via London - 19h50m (with 2h50m stop) - \u00a33,297Turkish Airlines, via Istanbul - 21h35m (with 1h25m stop) - \u00a3825Qatar Airways, via Doha - 32h40m (with 8h45m stop) - \u00a3617\n\nPrices checked for economy seats on Google Flights on May 9. Shortest total duration for each option is listed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe next fastest option is with Delta Airlines via Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta Airport, which takes 17 hours and 45 minutes with a stop lasting two hours and 20 minutes.

Tickets are \u00a31,574 in economy.\n\nAnd if Meghan wanted to be reunited with Harry in London before flying onto Lagos, she could take an American Airlines flight to Heathrow , then change onto a British Airways flight to Nigeria.\n\nThis would take 19 hours and 50 minutes with a stop lasting two hours and 50 minutes, and the cost in premium economy would be \u00a33,297. No economy tickets are available, but first-class singles are on sale for \u00a312,677.\n\nAside from commercial options, Meghan could also look at hiring a private jet - with the cheapest option offered by PrivateFly being a turboprop aircraft from \u00a396,260.\n\nA light jet for the route starts at an estimated \u00a3113,870, while a midsize jet is \u00a3147,180, a heavy jet is \u00a3232,240 and an airliner from \u00a3353,670.\n\nRead More Revealed: What Prince Harry said to a fan on her honeymoon during surprise walkabout after Invictus Games event\n\nHowever Meghan could of course call on some of her celebrity friends to lend them their jet - while there is also a chance that their flights could be paid for by Nigeria, although this is unknown.\n\nWhen in Nigeria, the Sussexes will watch a volleyball game and visit military hospitals and charities in Abuja and Lagos, and meet injured armed forces personnel as well as their families.\n\nTheir trip is in a private capacity and not an official visit on behalf of the UK Government, given that they stepped down as working royals in early 2020.\n\nThe Defence HQ revealed their itinerary in a press conference today, and said that while some of the meetings will be private, the couple will do a photocall after.\n\nThe department said Meghan was looking forward to visiting Nigeria to 'explore her Nigerian ancestry'.\n\nIt comes after Meghan revealed on her Spotify podcast Archetypes in 2022 that she found out she has Nigerian ancestry, describing herself as '43 per cent Nigerian'.\n\nPrince Harry meets members of the public outside St Paul's Cathedral in London yesterday\n\nFans take photographs as Prince Harry shakes hands outside St Paul's Cathedral yesterday\n\nDuring a visit to the Nigerian team at last year's Invictus Games in Dusseldorf, Meghan was given the name Amira Ngozi Lolo, which holds a special royal meaning.\n\nRead More Archbishop of Canterbury says the royals are 'human beings' who 'must not be judged' as he addresses rift in the House of Windsor - after King Charles was 'too busy' to see Prince Harry during his UK trip\n\n'Amira' means warrior princess from a legend, while 'Ngozi' means blessed and 'Lolo' means royal wife.\n\nHarry also joked about Meghan's ancestry during his opening speech at the games.\n\nHe said: 'Now, I'm not saying we play favourites in our home, but since my wife discovered she's of Nigerian descent, it's likely to get a little bit more competitive this year.'\n\nThe couple were invited to Nigeria by the Chief of Defence Staff, General Christopher Musa, who met Harry in Germany last September at the games in Dusseldorf.\n\nThe competition was founded as a sporting event for injured and sick military personnel and veterans.\n\nThe couple will meet service members and their families, and participate in traditional cultural activities, Nigerian media reported.\n\nPrince Harry waves to well-wishers outside St Paul's Cathedral in London yesterday\n\nLocal newspapers said that Defence Headquarters was 'honoured' and 'delighted' after Harry and Meghan, who is of Nigerian descent, had accepted the invitation.

Prince Harry arrived on Tuesday to attend a worthy cause. Yesterday, he celebrated the 10th anniversary of the Invictus Games at St. Paul's Cathedral -- an event Harry co-founded in 2014 to honor wounded soldiers and military veterans that now includes 23 nations.\n\nHe did so alone. His wife, Meghan, the duchess of Sussex, remained in Montecito, as did King Charles III's two young grandchildren.\n\nHarry did not make time to see his ailing father, who was diagnosed with an unspecified cancer in February. Preemptively, Harry's office released a statement disingenuously claiming it was due to \"his father's diary of commitments and various other priorities.\"\n\nBut sons are always priorities, even to kings.\n\nThe duke of Sussex's estrangement from his family uncomfortably continues, including from his brother William, the prince of Wales, and his sister-in-law, Catherine, the princess of Wales. What should have been the start of an inspiring trip that ends later this week in Nigeria has now turned into a dystopian exercise reminiscent of Joseph Conrad's \"Heart of Darkness.\"\n\nMeghan's decision to shun King Charles once again is par for the course -- essentially declaring herself persona non grata in the United Kingdom. So too, in effect, at least from a public perception standpoint, is Meghan's preventing the king from seeing her children, in effect weaponizing them against the king.\n\nBut familial darkness is a small matter, compared to carelessly spreading darkness on the global stage. Geopolitical and national security implications are very much in play right now in the Sahel in sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nHarry and Meghan's initial decision to accept Nigerian Defense Minister Alhaji Mohammed Abubakar Badaru's invitation to visit Abuja this week was completely above reproach. Nigeria is hopeful of soon hosting a future Invictus Games, and Nigeria is a vital ally in an increasingly destabilized yet strategically important region of Africa.\n\nMeghan's machinations, however, have changed all of that.\n\nBy refusing to travel to London with Harry, and by failing to bring her children along with them to see King Charles and Queen Camilla, Meghan intentionally put the media spotlight on herself just in time for it to highlight her trip to Nigeria.\n\nHollywood power games may play to one's advantage in Tinseltown. But in the real world of foreign policy and national security, Harry and Meghan are only naively strengthening the hands of Moscow and Beijing.\n\nInstead of arriving in Abuja as the beloved daughter-in-law of the UK's reigning monarch, who is also the head of the 56-member Commonwealth of Nations, Meghan chose to travel alone to Nigeria -- and, in effect, to play the role of the aggrieved royal outcast bearing the self-proclaimed scars of modern-day British racism.\n\nTo be sure, legacy racism persists in the UK as it does in other countries, including the U.S. However, the UK is not a racist country, nor one defined by racism. Just look at the people British voters put in power. Rishi Sunak, England's prime minister, is of Punjabi Indian heritage, the son of Hindu parents who were born in East Africa. Sadiq Khan, the three-term mayor of London, is of Pakistani descent and the son of Sunni Muslims. Until Tuesday, Humza Yousaf, himself a Muslim, was the first minister of Scotland.\n\nAll three men are representative of the cosmopolitan England that came into its prime during the reign of the late Queen Elizabeth II and as a result of her counsel.\n\nThat is the messaging that Harry and Meghan should be bringing to Nigeria. One of the UK's commitment to the Commonwealth, especially in Africa, and the relevance of the Global South in modern-day England, Scotland and Wales.\n\nInstead, we are witnessing a redux of \"Empire 2.0\" -- the notion that the Commonwealth is just a modern-day imperialist enterprise, that Harry and Meghan foolishly allowed themselves to first become associated with it in their eponymous Netflix series and their Oprah Winfrey interview, when they raised still-unsubstantiated claims of racism in the Royal Family.\n\nHarry and Meghan are not simply \"popping in\" to a Nigeria detached from the regional realities of Sub-Saharan Africa. Niger, an impoverished country to its north in the western Sahel, underwent a coup in 2023. U.S. forces were expelled from an airbase being used to surveil and interdict Boko Haram, essentially a \"Nigerian Taliban,\" and ISIS operating in West Africa.\n\nEarlier this month, Russian President Vladimir Putin's military forces began using Airbase 101. Moscow is rapidly building military and economic inroads into the region, including in nearby Chad, Mali and Burkina Faso, and toppling previously stable democracies throughout the Sahel in the process.\n\nOne key factor in overthrowing once western-friendly countries is Putin's propaganda wars aimed at painting the UK and its NATO allies as modern-day western imperialists and unrepentant racists. Putin does this in concert with Chinese President Xi Jinping as part of their coordinated effort to undermine and destroy the Commonwealth in Africa.\n\nHarry and Meghan's most virulent fandom, often referred to as the 'Sussex Squad,' fail to understand the tragic extent to which African nationals are being placed in harm's way by Moscow and Beijing. Now, as Western interests are being attacked in the Sahel, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex are unwittingly aiding Putin and Xi's by continuing to undermine King Charles as head-of-state and head of the Commonwealth.\n\nMillions of African civilians in the Sahel are now being actively economically exploited by Russia and China. National resources are being stolen, and in hundreds of cases, they are being brutally massacred by Russian paramilitary groups. Ditto in the Central African Republic, Sudan and across the entire African continent -- and Nigeria, courtesy of Boko Haram, is high on Putin and Xi's wish list in Africa.\n\nDemocracy dies in darkness, but also in naivet\u00e9. Harry and Meghan must ditch their \"Knives Out\" approach to King Charles that was on display in Jamaica and recognize that, when they operate on the world stage, their decisions and actions result in very real consequences because of who Harry's father is and the role he plays in global affairs.\n\nUnfortunately, Harry and Meghan remain self-servingly lost in propagating a dystopian \"Heart of Darkness\" that in reality ostensibly no longer exists. Western imperialism and racism of old are not destroying modern-day Africa. Rather, Russian and Chinese military and economic imperialism are subjugating sub-Saharan Africa, increasingly through violence and anti-democratic oppression.", "source": {"uri": "thehill.com",

Like Queen Elizabeth, she loves horses and a great tiara moment.\n\nPrince Harry's friends who have been there since the start of the Invictus Games say that his fire for helping the veteran community has always burned bright, regardless of his royal status.\n\nDavid Wiseman and JJ Chalmers are veterans of the British armed forces and former Invictus Games competitors who attended Service of Thanksgiving at St. Paul's Cathedral in London on May 8 honoring the 10-year anniversary of the Invictus Games.\n\nWiseman and Chalmers, who were both involved with the leadership of the Invictus Games Foundation and appeared in the August 2023 Netflix docuseries Heart of Invictus, exclusively told PEOPLE about how it all never would have happened without the Duke of Sussex's vision.\n\nPrince Harry is \"the same as me and JJ, he was a combat soldier who did two tours. One on the ground and one in the air. He wasn't messing around out there,\" Wiseman tells PEOPLE, referring to Harry's decade of service in the British Army from 2005 to 2015 and two tours in Afghanistan.\n\n\"The identity of being a soldier doesn't go away or change because you're a prince or a duke. He feels that. He feels part of this community and we feel him as part of our community,\" Wiseman says. \"That's the passion and drives him in, wishing to serve this community. In terms of that vision -- I was shot in the chest in 2009 and finally left the Army May 1, 2013. I think on May 15 I was on this tour with Prince Harry and called in to see the Warrior Games.\"\n\nKing Charles' younger son has cited a May 2013 trip to the U.S. where he saw the adaptive sports tournament for wounded, ill and injured active duty and veteran U.S. military service members organized by the U.S. Department of Defense as the breakthrough inspiration to launch the Invictus Games, which Wiseman verifies came to be over breakfast the next day.\n\n\"He could see where this was going. He sat there, glass of orange juice in hand and created this vision. He said 'This is mega. What we're seeing here is brilliant but let's take it back, let's internationalize it, invite the world and the general public, put it in the Olympic Park and put it on the BBC and let's have a huge closing concert and use it as a focal point to inspire the world,' \" he recalls. \"He could see it on that very morning and that's where he took us.\"\n\nThe inaugural Invictus Games were held at the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park in London in September 2014. The anniversary service at St. Paul's celebrated the decade of impact Invictus has had through sport, highlighted by six cycles of competition in London, Orlando (2016), Toronto (2017), Sydney (2018) and The Hague (2022, bumped from 2020 due to the pandemic) and D\u00fcsseldorf (2023). The latest Games welcomed 550 athletes from 21 countries across 10 sports, and the next event is set for Vancouver and Whistler, Canada in 2025 where winter sports will debut for the first time.\n\nChalmers says that while the reach has been massive, Prince Harry's vision was simple.\n\n\"As far as I can say, the Duke set out to do two things. Create a platform that could give us physical and mental recovery, and secondly, what we had learned about ourselves and more importantly, what we'd learned about disability and the world he could see this was an opportunity to educate and inspire people out with our community,\" he says.\n\n\"That's the service element of it. What he really set out to do by bringing those people to see it and giving us the stage was to basically bottle what we were all living. That's where that 'I Am' and the name Invictus Games came from,\" he continued, referring to the William Ernest Henley poem that inspired the Invictus motto and was read at the Service of Thanksgiving.\n\nChalmers and Wiseman both joke that they could have come up with the idea but only one person could deliver it.\n\nCan't get enough of PEOPLE's Royals coverage? Sign up for our free Royals newsletter to get the latest updates on Kate Middleton, Meghan Markle and more!\n\n\"He could have done anything with his time, and his resource and his life. But he decided to commit it to others and to our community -- a community that he's part of,\" Chalmers says of Prince Harry's platform. And I will be forever grateful that I got caught in the wake of that and got to be part of it and continue to be part of it.\"\n\nChalmers suffered life-threatening injuries while serving with the Royal Marines in Afghanistan, became captain for Team Great Britain's trike cycling at the first event in 2014 and won a gold medal before becoming an Invictus Games Foundation trustee. Wiseman, meanwhile, helped helm the original executive team for the first Invictus Games and captained at Orlando 2016, and has clinched 14 medals.\n\n\"No one wants to see me in my Speedos anymore, \" Wiseman jokes about his former Invictus sport of swimming. \"My job now is to bring in more and more nations who have a closer proximity to not just conflict but deployment. Soldiers, sailors and airmen don't just do fighting but do so much around the world to support us in the international community.\"", "source": {"uri": "people.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

After all, what's that saying? There are three sides to every story -- his side, her side (well, in the case of King Charles and Prince Harry's drama this week, another his side), and the truth. And while we turn to trusted royal commentators to give us insight, only those involved really know what's going on -- something to keep in mind as we unpack what seems to be a pretty catastrophic setback in the relationship between Charles and Harry, father and son.\n\nIn case you've somehow missed the drama this week, here's a brief recap: a spokesperson for Harry confirmed earlier this week that, while Harry was briefly in the U.K. celebrating 10 years since the founding of the Invictus Games, his father the King wouldn't have time to see him. But that's not all: that same day, Charles gave Harry's brother, Prince William, an appointment as Colonel-in-Chief of the Army Air Corps, the regiment in which Harry served in Afghanistan. This news would probably have been a tough pill to swallow anyway -- after all, had Harry stayed on as a working royal, the role would have likely gone to him -- but the timing was extremely suspect, on the day he flew into the U.K. This news reportedly left Harry in tears.\n\nLast night, as Harry attended the Invictus Games Service of Thanksgiving at St. Paul's Cathedral, his father was just a few miles away at a Buckingham Palace garden party, along with the other working royals. No members of the royal family came out to support Harry on what was an important night for him and the Invictus Games -- but thankfully, his late mother Princess Diana's siblings were there on site so that Harry would have some family present. (His wife, Meghan Markle, didn't join him in the U.K.) Relations continue to be frosty between not just Charles and Harry but also between Harry and William, and Harry and Queen Camilla. It's a mess, and if we're this exhausted, the royal family must be unbelievably so.\n\nRoyal biographer Robert Jobson weighed in on it all to The Sun: \"People think if Harry rolls into town there's going to be some sort of reconciliation,\" he said. \"But you're going to realize there's been a lot of water under the bridge, a lot of portrayal [sic] of trust. That takes time to rebuild, and I don't think we're anywhere near the stage of rebuilding trust.\"\n\nThis trip to the U.K. was Harry's first in three months, after he flew back to his native country in February after Charles announced his cancer diagnosis publicly on February 5; he got about a 30-minute audience with his dad. Jobson added \"Harry effectively took it by himself to come see his dad when he said that he had been diagnosed with cancer. That would be seen by many as a good thing. But at the time, I think the King didn't want all the media circus that would accompany Harry's arrival.\"\n\nFellow royal biographer Ingrid Seward (who is also editor-in-chief of Majesty magazine) echoed similar sentiments, saying that Charles \"snubbed\" Harry for fear he'd be used as a tool to boost Harry's image. \"He's the father of Harry,\" she said. \"It would look nice if they met. He probably doesn't want it to be used as a PR opportunity. Or maybe Harry's being the one being difficult, and we just don't know.\"\n\nThat's it, really -- we just don't know. It all remains terribly sad, and the feud has become so ubiquitous in the news and in culture that even Justin Welby, the Archbishop of Canterbury, spoke out about the father and son rift on ITV's Good Morning Britain this morning.\n\n\"We must not judge them,\" he said, per People. \"They're human beings. They must not be judged. They need to be prayed for and supported.\"\n\nThe Archbishop has long had a close relationship with the royal family, marrying Harry and Meghan six years ago this month and playing a prominent role in Charles' coronation, which just marked its one year anniversary on May 6. In regards to the health of Charles -- who, as previously mentioned, is battling cancer -- and the Princess of Wales, who is also receiving treatment for the disease, Welby encouraged people to \"pray\" for the royals, saying \"I'll just say to everyone, if you're someone who prays, pray for them, because that's -- can't go wrong, I mean,\" he said. \"And if you're someone who doesn't pray, pray for them, because it can't do any harm, and it might do some good.\"", "source": {"uri": "marieclaire.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Marie Claire"}, "authors": [{"uri":

(Photo by Dinendra Haria/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images British online electronics and electrical retailer AO World closed its 2024 financial year with a 280% hike in earnings per share, delivering gains for investors despite revenue sliding by 9% to \u00a31,039 billion ($1,314 billion). AO\u2019s stock ended the week at \u00a31.12, almost 40% up on a year ago, with earnings per share of \u00a34.29 versus \u00a31.13 a year ago. The company released its annual results (for the 12 months ending March 31) on Wednesday, but the stock has been steadily rising over the past year in response to a strategy focused on profitability. AO's founder and CEO, John Roberts, said in a statement: \u201cWe have made good progress on our profit performance in FY24. We are now a much simpler, more efficient business with excellent and sustainable unit economics.\u201d Adjusted profit before tax rose by over 180% to \u00a334.3 million ($43.4 million) even as revenue declined due to a decision to remove non-core channels and loss-making sales last year. Having done that, AO is confident it can now generate double-digit revenue growth in FY25 alongside another hike in profit to \u00a341 million. One of AO\u2019s key strategic aims has been to increase customer satisfaction scores as a way to drive sales. \"During the year we passed the milestone of 500,000 Trustpilot reviews, with an increased score of 4.8 out of 5. This ranks AO as the leading and most trusted U.K. retailer for the combination of volume and quality,\u201d said Roberts.

AO\u2019s mobile business made a loss in FY24. This encouraged the company to strengthen its market position through the acquisition of the IP rights to two websites: Affordable Mobiles and Buy Mobiles, so that it has additional channels from which to scale up in a very competitive market. Strategic transition Commenting on the AO performance, Oliver Maddison, a retail analyst at data company GlobalData, said: \u201cAO World is in a transition phase in its progression towards its business objectives focusing on profitable sales and significant efficiency savings, particularly warehousing and administrative costs. It sought to rationalize operations, including through an increased use of third-party providers.\u201d AO\u2019s expectation of strong revenue growth in FY25 is build on anticipated higher consumer spending on technology. This may be optimistic given that GlobalData forecasts online electricals retail spending in the U.K. will increase by just 0.4% this year. Also, AO\u2019s larger rival Currys is stepping up its campaign to build revenue using a similar strategy. The U.K. technology market leader took a hit from falling consumer demand for electricals in recent years but is also likely to see a recovery as incomes and consumer confidence improve, according to Maddison. The company has also focused on delivering profitable sales, with adjusted profit before tax up by 10% to \u00a3118 million in the year to April 27, 2024 (and announced the day after AO's results). This was despite group sales declining by 4% to \u00a38.5 billion (of which the Nordics accounted for \u00a33.8 billion). On AO\u2019s future path, Maddison commented: \u201cTo improve its chances in gaining market share, AO must address its lack of cut-through with consumers aged 16-34, who are less likely to purchase from AO than any of the UK\u2019s top six electricals retailers, according to GlobalData\u2019s 2023 How Britain Shops survey. \u201cTo do this, AO must continue to expand in areas with the highest penetration among young consumers (such as personal care electricals and portable audio), orient its marketing budget away from TV ads towards alternative media such as streaming, and invest in its delivery infrastructure to achieve cheaper and faster order fulfillment.\u201d Follow me on Twitter or LinkedIn.

To then win Euro 2024 a couple of months later would be extraordinary.\n\nAs we saw with Manchester United, Mainoo has now fitted seamlessly into the team and provided a perfect mix of both style and substance.\n\nGive it a couple of years, and you can only imagine how good this lad is going to be.\n\nFor much of this tournament, the focus has been on the disappointing form of Harry Kane, Bellingham and Phil Foden.\n\nSo Mainoo, to a degree, had almost been off the radar. But against the Dutch, in tight, congested spaces, he is a class apart.\n\nWhen he was put under pressure, remained cool, navigated his way out of difficult situations and drove forward.\n\nDespite what was at stake, Mainoo once again looked extraordinarily composed and was England's best player in the first half. He won possession, he rode tackles and he drove forward like an old master.\n\nHe nearly delivered an assist at 1-1 with some brilliant play. He received the ball from Foden, turned and drove forward before returning the ball to his team-mate but the shot was hacked off the line by Denzel Dumfries.\n\nMainoo delivered a terrific block to snuff out some serious danger in a lightning-quick Dutch counter attack.\n\nIn the second half, he had less space in midfield but nevertheless still had bags of energy and kept his discipline positionally - and then he let subs Cole Palmer and Ollie Watkins deliver the business.\n\nIt is still mind-boggling that Mainoo is now heading to Berlin on Sunday, when you consider Mainoo only made his United debut against Charlton in the Carabao Cup in January 2023. His first Premier League start was just eight months ago.\n\nYet it was his dazzling midfield form in an otherwise dysfunctional United team which earned him his first cap as a substitute against Brazil in March. He was then Man of the Match in a ridiculously-good performance in the 2-2 draw with Belgium.\n\nMainoo's form dipped in the last few weeks of the season. It was probably because he was knackered carrying some of his team-mates.\n\nBut he then saved them again in the FA Cup final against Manchester City with a Man of the Match performance in a 2-1 win.\n\nA bit like Adam Wharton, he was part of England's 26-man squad to soak up the experience, to learn what it is like to feature in a major tournament and maybe, if needed, to have a few cameo roles off the bench.\n\nAnd the fact he was effectively Southgate's third-choice to partner Declan Rice here in Germany tells you exactly where he stood in a squad of 26.\n\nThe Trent Alexander-Arnold midfield failed in the two opening games against Serbia and Denmark. Conor Gallagher - despite some bright performances as a sub in those games - really struggled in his start against Slovenia.\n\nApart from a strong appearance as a substitute by Palmer, Mainoo's performance against Slovakia was the only bright spot in a dismal and extremely fortunate win over Slovakia in the last 16.\n\nThere was always a worry about Mainoo's movement when England do not have possession but that will come with experience, like it would for any other central midfielder.\n\nYet Mainoo has solved the problem for Southgate and now England can continue to dream big. And it is totally unthinkable from where you consider how they played in the group stages when they stunk out Germany.\n\nIn Sunday's final, England's experienced players will be able to draw on the pain of both the 2018 World Cup and Euro 2020.\n\nFor Mainoo, this will be a completely new experience but do not expect him to wilt. He'll absolutely love it.", "source": {"uri": "thesun.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Sun"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kealan_hughes@thesun.co.uk", "name": "Kealan Hughes", "type": "author",

It makes such a difference when your midfield players can receive (while being) pressed, turn with the ball so easily and comfortably.\n\n\"I thought him, Phil (Foden) popping up in spaces, Jude (Bellingham), our movement was really good. It caused a lot of problems and them to adapt without the ball.\"\n\n- Futsal background -\n\nMainoo, who attributes his slick ability on the ball to his past playing futsal, the five-a-side small-pitch game requiring high levels of technique and skill, helped England dominate their opponents in the first half.\n\nThe Manchester United midfielder pinned the Netherlands deep in their own territory by aggressively putting heavy pressure on the ball every time they tried to break loose.\n\nEngland benefitted from a slice of luck after Xavi Simons blasted Netherlands ahead when Harry Kane won a soft penalty, but after the England captain converted it to level the score, their superiority was evident.\n\nWith Mainoo pulling the strings in midfield it was hard for the Dutch to win the ball back and England boasted a higher possession at full time, with Ollie Watkins' 91st-minute strike saving them from a third successive period of extra-time.\n\n\"It will be, I would imagine, a long time since -- or if ever -- an English side had 60 percent of the ball against a side from the Netherlands,\" said Southgate.\n\n\"It shows the more modern England way and the resilience and the character of the group.\"\n\nMainoo's rise to prominence has even surprised those close to him by its speed.\n\nLuke Shaw, his team-mate for club and country, said ahead of the Netherlands game that his \"growth is scary\" and that Mainoo has \"the world at his feet\".\n\nThat was laid bare on a heady night in Dortmund which propelled him to new heights, with the biggest game of his career awaiting in Berlin on Sunday.\n\nMainoo will have his work cut out against the team-of-the-tournament Spain in the final. La Roja midfielders Rodri Hernandez and Fabian Ruiz have been two of the stars of the summer.\n\nHowever, Mainoo and Manchester United got the better of Pep Guardiola's Manchester City in the FA Cup final in May, with the young midfielder scoring what proved to be the winner.\n\nAsking for a repeat of that would be too much but Southgate will be delighted if he can just reproduce his near flawless display against the Netherlands.", "source": {"uri": "thedailystar.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Daily Star"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

To then win Euro 2024 a couple of months later would be extraordinary.\n\nAs we saw with Manchester United, Mainoo has now fitted seamlessly into the team and provided a perfect mix of both style and substance.\n\nGive it a couple of years, and you can only imagine how good this lad is going to be.\n\nFor much of this tournament, the focus has been on the disappointing form of Harry Kane, Bellingham and Phil Foden.\n\nEURO 2024 FREE BETS AND OFFERS\n\nSo Mainoo, to a degree, had almost been off the radar. But against the Dutch, In tight, congested spaces, he was a class apart.\n\nWhen he was put under pressure, remained cool, navigated his way out of difficult situations and drove forward.\n\nDespite what was at stake, Mainoo once again looked extraordinarily composed and was England's best player in the first half. He won possession, he rode tackles and he drove forward like an old master.\n\nHe nearly delivered an assist at 1-1 with some brilliant play.\n\nHe received the ball from Foden, turned and drove forward before returning the ball to his team-mate but the shot was hacked off the line by Denzel Dumfries\n\nMainoo delivered a terrific block to snuff out some serious danger in a lightning-quick Dutch counter attack.\n\nIn the second half, he had less space in midfield but nevertheless still had bags of energy and kept his discipline positionally - and then he let subs Cole Palmer and Ollie Watkins deliver the business.\n\nIt is still mind-boggling that Mainoo is now heading to Berlin on Sunday, when you consider he only made his United debut against Charlton in the Carabao Cup in January 2023.\n\nHis first Premier League start was just eight months ago.\n\nYet it was his dazzling midfield form in an otherwise dysfunctional United team which earned him his first cap as a substitute against Brazil in March.\n\nHe was then man-of-the-match in a ridiculously-good performance in the 2-2 draw with Belgium.\n\nMainoo's form dipped in the last few weeks of the season. It was probably because he was knackered carrying some of his team-mates.\n\nBut he then saved them again in the FA Cup final against Manchester City with a man-of-the-match performance in a 2-1 win.\n\nA bit like Adam Wharton, he was part of England's 26-man squad to soak up the experience, to learn what it is like to feature in a major tournament and maybe, if needed, to have a few cameo roles off the bench.\n\nAnd the fact he was effectively Southgate's third-choice to partner Declan Rice here in Germany tells you exactly where he stood in a squad of 26.\n\nThe Trent Alexander-Arnold midfield failed in the two opening games against Serbia and Denmark.\n\nConor Gallagher - despite some bright performances as a sub in those games - really struggled in his start against Slovenia.\n\nApart from a strong appearance as a substitute by Palmer, Mainoo's performance against Slovakia was the only bright spot in a dismal and extremely fortunate win over Slovakia in the last 16.\n\nThere was always a worry about Mainoo's movement when England do not have possession but that will come with experience, like it would for any other central midfielder.\n\nYet Mainoo has solved the problem for Southgate and now England can continue to dream big.\n\nAnd it is totally unthinkable from where you consider how they played in the group stages when they stunk out Germany.\n\nIn Sunday's final, England's experienced players will be able to draw on the pain of both the 2018 World Cup and Euro 2020.\n\nFor Mainoo, this will be a completely new experience but do not expect him to wilt. He'll absolutely love it.", "source": {"uri": "thesun.ie", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Irish Sun"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kobbie_Mainoo", "type":

It makes such a difference when your midfield players can receive (while being) pressed, turn with the ball so easily and comfortably.\n\n\"I thought him, Phil (Foden) popping up in spaces, Jude (Bellingham), our movement was really good. It caused a lot of problems and them to adapt without the ball.\"\n\nFutsal background\n\nMainoo, who attributes his slick ability on the ball to his past playing futsal, the five-a-side small-pitch game requiring high levels of technique and skill, helped England dominate their opponents in the first half.\n\nThe Manchester United midfielder pinned the Netherlands deep in their own territory by aggressively putting heavy pressure on the ball every time they tried to break loose.\n\nEngland benefitted from a slice of luck after Xavi Simons blasted Netherlands ahead when Harry Kane won a soft penalty, but after the England captain converted it to level the score, their superiority was evident.\n\nWith Mainoo pulling the strings in midfield it was hard for the Dutch to win the ball back and England boasted a higher possession at full time, with Ollie Watkins' 91st-minute strike saving them from a third successive period of extra-time.\n\n\"It will be, I would imagine, a long time since - or if ever - an English side had 60 percent of the ball against a side from the Netherlands,\" said Southgate.\n\n\"It shows the more modern England way and the resilience and the character of the group.\"\n\nMainoo's rise to prominence has even surprised those close to him by its speed.\n\nLuke Shaw, his team-mate for club and country, said ahead of the Netherlands game that his \"growth is scary\" and that Mainoo has \"the world at his feet\".\n\nThat was laid bare on a heady night in Dortmund which propelled him to new heights, with the biggest game of his career awaiting in Berlin on Sunday.\n\nMainoo will have his work cut out against the team-of-the-tournament Spain in the final. La Roja midfielders Rodri Hernandez and Fabian Ruiz have been two of the stars of the summer.\n\nHowever, Mainoo and Manchester United got the better of Pep Guardiola's Manchester City in the FA Cup final in May, with the young midfielder scoring what proved to be the winner.\n\nAsking for a repeat of that would be too much but Southgate will be delighted if he can just reproduce his near flawless display against the Netherlands.", "source": {"uri": "gulfnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GULF NEWS"}, "authors": [{"uri": "agence_france_presse@gulfnews.com", "name": "Agence

EUROS DAILY. Available wherever you get your podcasts\n\nAirpods in with a complexion like stone, Kobbie Mainoo strode off England's team bus with the air of a man on a mission.\n\nWell, we say a man. He's a kid, really. At the age of 19 years and 82 days, Mainoo became the youngest ever player to represent England in the semi-finals of a major tournament here in Dortmund on Wednesday night.\n\nNot that the accolade would have fazed this wonderfully gifted lad from Stockport. Nothing does.\n\nHere on the biggest night of his career, Mainoo produced a performance that flew in the face of his tender age.\n\nMainoo played to his own tune, controlling England's tempo with the air of footballer who believes he belongs on this stage.\n\nHis injections of pace with the ball at this feet are a sight to behold.\n\nOne or two touch passing. Receiving the ball on the half-turn. Arrowing balls into forwards feet. Aerial passes. Short passes. Long passes. The boy's got the full repertoire.\n\nPoise, balance, intelligence, work ethic. You name it, Mainoo has it and more.\n\nIn the 20th minute, he sprinted 30 yards towards his own goal to take the ball off goalkeeper Jordan Pickford.\n\nWith his back to goal, he turned, surveyed the scene before spraying an inch perfect pass out to Kieran Trippier on the left.\n\nThree minutes later, at the other end of pitch, he drove forward ferociously with the ball stuck to his feet before releasing an inch perfect pass into Phil Foden's path.\n\nMoments later he was hurtling back towards his own penalty area again to thwart a dangerous Holland attack.\n\nAll action. All from a player still in his teens.\n\nThe most refreshing of Mainoo's traits, and there are many, is his clear devotion to playing forwards.\n\nYes, he'll put in the hard yards as all modern day central midfielders are required. But Mainoo isn't one to retreat. No one for keeping possession for possession sake.\n\nIf there's space ahead, he'll you run into it. If there's a forward pass to play, he'll play it - even if it means risking the ball.\n\nThe way football should be played - and Mainoo executes it tremendously.\n\nThe most puzzling quandary Gareth Southgate faced before heading into the tournament was the identity of Declan Rice's midfield partner.\n\nThe Trent Alexander-Arnold experiment failed, Conor Gallagher's trial last 45 minutes.\n\nOn the evidence of England's previous three matches here at Euro 2024, all of which Mainoo has started, the answer was staring Southgate in the face all along.\n\nNever flustered, Mainoo exudes the sort of spirit that has largely embodied Southgate's reign. Courage, bravery - but most pertinently of all bags of ability.\n\nTogether with Rice, the Manchester United starlet should represent the future of England's midfield - with or without Southgate.\n\nIf Southgate departs then his successor must embrace Mainoo's abilities; let him grow into international football. Give him room to breathe.\n\nIf that happens then the national team will reap the benefit for the next decade.\n\nOn May 25, 2024, Mail Sport begged this question after Mainoo's man of the match performance in the FA Cup final win over arch rivals Manchester City.\n\n'Will Gareth Southgate give this outrageously talent kid from Stockport the keys to his midfield?,' we queried after marvelling at his swaggering display at Wembley.\n\nWe know the answer now.

Mainoo was completely unfazed by the magnitude of the last four clash but his maturity has defied belief since making his first Manchester United start just eight months ago.\n\nThe midfielder earned the man of the match award on that occasion against Everton in November and he's enjoyed a stratospheric rise since then. Mainoo only earned his England debut in March and his stunning breakthrough season was capped by scoring the winning goal in the FA Cup final. His first game of the season with in the UEFA Youth League but his last will be in the Euro 2024 final against Spain. The Man United academy graduate's acclimatisation to the biggest stage has been immense considering his inexperience and he was, remarkably, Gareth Southgate's third choice to start at No.8 at the start of Euro 2024.\n\n\"I think all of his performances have been exceptional, especially when you consider his age. We haven't really had a player like him until now,\" was Southgate's glowing verdict on Mainoo's display against the Netherlands. Southgate - who has guided England to consecutive Euros finals - preferred Trent Alexander-Arnold alongside Declan Rice and Jude Bellingham for England's opening two games. Furthermore, when the Alexander-Arnold midfield experiment didn't reap rewards, Southgate picked Conor Gallagher over Mainoo before ultimately seeing the light. Southgate's decision to slowly integrate Mainoo into his starting eleven could've been based upon his inexperience - not only at international level, but also senior football.\n\nBefore last season, Mainoo had only played ten minutes of first-team football for Man United. An unfortunate injury in preseason disrupted Erik ten Hag's plan to unleash the Englishman and as the graphic above illustrates, Mainoo had played the fewest first-team minutes from the four semi-final teams before Euro 2024 started. His 2,665 senior minutes is considerably less than Spanish sensation Lamine Yamal (3325) and Warren Zaire-Emery (4520) - who rank second and third. The statistic puts Mainoo's stratospheric rise across the 2023/24 season into perspective and he's taken it all in his stride.\n\nMainoo's incredible rise is reflected in his market value development. The midfielder gained his first valuation of \u20ac300k on Transfermarkt in November 2022 and that increased slightly to \u20ac800k by the start of last season. But Mainoo's market value skyrocketed last season, increasing to \u20ac6 million in December's update, \u20ac35m in March and it rose again in the final update of the season in June to his current valuation of \u20ac50m. As the graphic below highlights, Mainoo's \u20ac44m market value increase since the start of 2024 is the most of any player in the year this year.\n\nEngland have the most valuable international squad in the world and it's littered with world class players and Mainoo only ranks as their 15th most valuable player. He is already the fourth most valuable player at Man United and the most valuable player born in 2005. Euro 2024 has seen the emergence of incredibly talented young players and Mainoo ranks as the seventh most valuable teenager on the planet.\n\nMainoo had been earmarked as a future first-team star during his progression through Man United's famed academy. Despite winning the FA Cup last season, United endured a disappointing campaign but Ten Hag's trust in academy players like Mainoo and Alejandro Garnacho were a silver lining. Mainoo possesses the desired characteristics from a central midfielder. He's incredibly calm in possession, can manipulate his body to evade pressure and he uses the ball intelligently. Mainoo is sometimes labelled a No.6 but his best position is at No.8 where he's allowed the licence to get forward and linking play but he's also effective from a defensive perspective. Mainoo has drawn comparisons to Clarence Seedorf and the legendary Dutch midfield believes similarities exist. In a recent interview, Seedorf said: \"He (Mainoo) reminds me of a young me with his body and movement. But the thing that he has that I never did is his maturity on the ball at such a young age. The sky is the limit for him.\"", "source": {"uri": "transfermarkt.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "transfermarkt.co.uk"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kobbie_Mainoo", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kobbie Mainoo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gareth_Southgate", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gareth Southgate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "England national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trent_Alexander-Arnold", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Trent Alexander-Arnold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Player_of_the_match", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Player of the match"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FA_Cup_Final", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FA Cup Final"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Youth_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Youth League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cap_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cap (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spain national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everton_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Everton F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manchester United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conor_Gallagher", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Conor Gallagher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jude_Bellingham", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jude Bellingham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declan_Rice", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Declan Rice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alejandro_Garnacho", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alejandro Garnacho"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarence_Seedorf", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Clarence Seedorf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FA_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FA Cup"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://tmssl.akamaized.net/images/foto/big/mainoo-spot-1720700074-142233.png?lm=1720700087", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9722994", "eventUri": "eng-9722994", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 181, "relevance": 1}

Foden was unlucky - keeper made a good save, incredible shot that hit the woodwork, the clearance off the line, all from Foden,\" Lineker said.\n\n\"I thought Mainoo was, again, he just bosses the place, he keeps the ball really well.\n\n\"Kobbie Mainoo, goodness me. Goodness me, what a footballer.\"\n\nRichards is most impressed by Mainoo's demeanour.\n\n\"It's actually mindblowing,\" he said. \"I don't want to go overboard but for someone who has not really been in the England setup, who was supposed to play the year before at Manchester United but got a bad injury so he came on the season later, his first couple of games I was thinking, 'Wow, amazing'.\n\n\"Then he made a mistake in one of his earlier games where he gave the ball away. I was thinking, 'Okay, is he still too young? Is he ready? Is he a bit naive?'\n\n\"But he carried on doing the same things, getting on the ball in areas where a lot of midfielders will shy away from it. He's so elegant on the ball, he can drop his shoulder, he can drive forward, and he's just so calm. He's playing like he's a 35-year-old veteran of the game! And he's so young. He's just been a real key part to that spark that England needed, not just in midfield but the team needed in terms of adding the different dynamic.\"\n\nLineker compared his impact to that of brilliant Spain teenager Lamine Yamal, who Mainoo will face in Sunday's final.\n\n\"He's incredible. We talked about Lamine Yamal and obviously he's unbelievably talented but in a different sort of way, Mainoo is incredibly impressive and another teenager. It's kind of a tournament of emerging stars, which is something that you want to see.\n\n\"Obviously we know he can cope with a cup final. He played against Manchester City and scored that goal and performed brilliantly. I think he won the man of the match in that final. Nothing seems to faze him. Fearlessness of youth, I guess.\"\n\nRichards added: \"Also just believing in his own quality. You hear him in his interviews, he doesn't get too excited. He's just calm. His interviews are just like how he is on the pitch: calm, composed, but that little bit of confidence as well. It is really great to see and long may it continue.\"\n\nMainoo discussed his own rise, saying: \"It's an indescribable feeling. It's happened quickly, but I've just been taking it day by day, game by game, and yes now we're in the European Championship final.\n\n\"We're all buzzing, it's been such a journey to get here. I feel like we've built on our performances that we've had leading to this point and I feel like the only way is up, time to put ourselves into history.\n\n\"I feel like in the first half it was clicking with the whole team, everyone was getting on the ball. Me, Phil, Dec, Jude, I feel like we had the game under control in middle of the park and feel like the second half we had to grind out.\n\n\"It was very tough but the whole squad was a help. I mean, the impact off the bench from Cole and Ollie. I mean, what a finish, what a way to end it.\"", "source": {"uri": "football365.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Football News -"}, "authors": [{"uri": "matt_stead@football365.com", "name": "Matt Stead", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kobbie_Mainoo", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kobbie Mainoo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micah_Richards", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Micah Richards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Lineker", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gary Lineker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Foden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Phil Foden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gareth_Southgate", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gareth Southgate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamine_Yamal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lamine Yamal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manchester United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Player_of_the_match", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Player of the match"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_European_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "UEFA European Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manchester City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9722994", "eventUri": "eng-9722994", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3490196078431373, "wgt": 180, "relevance": 1}

His form will not surprise many United fans who have seen him grow immensely since making his bow against Charlton Athletic in the League Cup back in January 2023.\n\nREAD MORE: Luke Shaw explains why Manchester United youngster Kobbie Mainoo has 'scared' him\n\nREAD MORE: Jude Bellingham's two-word Kobbie Mainoo message sums up Man United role\n\nHe was selected to start that debut and lasted an hour, coming off after an exciting performance. Despite a major injury setback at the beginning of the season, the teenager has gone from strength to strength and is now one of the first names on Erik ten Hag's team sheet.\n\nMainoo is one of just four players safeguarded from a sale this summer with Andre Onana, Rasmus Hojlund and Alejandro Garnacho exempt from transfer approaches, all four seen as integral to the club's long-term rebuild.\n\nIn order to evolve, United are looking at bringing in a defender, a midfielder and a striker this summer. Anthony Martial left upon the end of his contract last month meaning Hojlund is the only natural centre-forward among current ranks.\n\nUnited seem to be closing in on a deal for Joshua Zirkzee, who has a \u00a333m release clause but could cost as much as \u00a346m when agents' fees are factored in. The Dutchman was called up late by his country for Euro 2024 amid a spate of injuries with the Netherlands camp.\n\nHe had to cut short his holiday at DisneyWorld to make the flight over to Germany, where has made two substitute appearances. He came on as a last throw of the dice for Ronald Koeman after Watkins had fired home, but he hardly had enough time to make a touch.\n\nThe emotions of both Zirkzee and Mainoo at full-time could not have been more contrasting, but Mainoo made sure to console his potential new teammate after the final whistle as a mark of respect. He shared a smile with the striker before celebrating with his England teammates.\n\nMainoo has shown to be a class character on and off the pitch for both club and country, and now he is focused on becoming immortalised in English football history.\n\nAfter the game in Dortmund, he added: \"It has been such a journey and we have built on old performances, the only way is up - time to put us in history.\"", "source": {"uri": "uk.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News UK"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kobbie_Mainoo", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kobbie Mainoo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_European_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "UEFA European Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Manchester United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_Radio_5_Live", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "BBC Radio 5 Live"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cap_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cap (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ollie_Watkins", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ollie Watkins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alejandro_Garnacho", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alejandro Garnacho"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jude_Bellingham", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jude Bellingham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EFL_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "EFL Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luke_Shaw", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Luke Shaw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlton_Athletic_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Charlton Athletic F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joshua_Zirkzee", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joshua Zirkzee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Martial", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Martial"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substitute_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Substitute (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "England national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Germany national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Koeman", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ronald Koeman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_in_England", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Football in England"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dortmund", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dortmund"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dortmund"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports", "label": "dmoz/Sports", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Paranormal/Prophecies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Paranormal/Prophecies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/manchester_evening_news_792/71be3e5f13ca300a6ae92ddef1cbe631", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9722994", "eventUri": "eng-9722994", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.388235294117647, "wgt": 179, "relevance": 1}

Ollie Watkins' sensational winner on the cusp of injury time has fired England into a second consecutive European Championship final.\n\nA 2-1 win over the Netherlands sends England to Berlin to play hands down the best team at Euro 2024, Spain. They've already dispatched of hosts Germany and favourites France in the knockout rounds, and dominated current holders Italy in the group stages. England have their biggest task ahead of them but a newly-developed knack of getting the job done. You never know.\n\nGareth Southgate has plenty to celebrate. But these moments are fleeting - the England manager has spent most of the last month having to bat away criticism for poor performances, while carrying the weight of a nation's expectations on his shoulders. The usual thing for someone in his position at a major tournament, y'know, and far more in keeping than this 'making finals' stuff.\n\nIt feels an era ago today, but just a few short weeks ago Southgate was showing signs of crumbling under the pressure. He turned up to discuss his team's performance in a 1-1 draw against Denmark - a game in which England were largely outplayed - and ended up speaking about his midfield conundrum.\n\n\"We know it's an experiment. We know we don't have a natural replacement for Kalvin Phillips,\" Southgate said, to national rage and desperation. The clip below sums up the situation nicely.\n\nSouthgate started the tournament with Liverpool right-back Trent Alexander-Arnold taking the third spot in central midfield, alongside shoo-ins Declan Rice and Jude Bellingham. The balance was off and he rotated through Conor Gallagher, who shuffled around a bit. Both very good players in their own right, but clearly not what Southgate was seeking for his midfield to control big moments in big games, like they're doing now.\n\nWith Southgate in auto-pilot while dropping the \"natural replacement for Phillips\" line, perhaps scared to act and put his faith in a 19-year-old kid sitting on his bench, the case soon became that if he didn't, his spell in charge of his country, a largely successful one without the riveting football or trophies to show for it (to date, Sunday is England's biggest moment) would slip through his fingers.\n\nBut that 19-year-old kid we're talking about? That's no ordinary 19-year-old kid.\n\nThat's Kobbie Mainoo.\n\nPerhaps Southgate was right, though. Mainoo is not a natural replacement for Phillips. He's so much more.\n\nAnd Manchester United's latest academy star is taking absolutely no time in his short career to date to show it, no matter the level, no matter the occasion. It's been a rollercoaster eight months, but time and again, Mainoo takes it in cruise control.\n\nWhat Southgate has stumbled on is replacing the Yorkshire Pirlo with the Stockport Seedorf. The two were teammates at Milan, but very different players. And while you'd keep your tongue in cheek most of the time comparing Phillips to the glorious Italian, you can use Mainoo's Seedorf comparison with authority. You watch Mainoo and believe that this boy is good enough to do what he's doing now, and better, for the next 15 years.\n\nHe's got everything, and England just simply do not make these types of midfielders. Until now.\n\nMainoo became the youngest ever player to represent England in the semi-final of an international tournament on Wednesday night, and the third youngest to play for England in a quarter-final last weekend, behind Michael Owen and Wayne Rooney. Back then, England only did quarter-finals at a maximum, but not any more.\n\nHe's made a habit over the course of two thirds of his maiden season in senior football of delivering in the moment. Whether it be a crucial goal line clearance in his first Premier League appearance at Everton or waltzing through opponents in Turkey against Galatasaray, one of world football's most hostile atmospheres, Mainoo is unfazed.\n\nScoring a worldie against Liverpool in Jurgen Klopp's final season in charge? Whatever. Or how about scoring the winning goal in an FA Cup final against Manchester City and walking away with the player of the match award? All in a day's work.\n\nThis is a player who has broken through into one of the worst Manchester United teams in history and risen above it (nobody does that), brushing the pressure off his shoulders and just doing his thing time after time. Those who've watched him closely enough throughout the last few months knew this was the midfield answer Southgate had been looking for. Now the world can see it.\n\nMainoo's night against the Netherlands was incredibly impressive. And especially in the first half, England's finest 45 in Germany so far. Mainoo was everywhere, on and off the ball. Tracking back to make crucial interceptions is his game, and so is the anticipation to cut out passes to maintain attacks. But he's so incredibly gifted that these qualities almost go under the radar.\n\nWhen you watch Mainoo in possession, you see a natural. He glides. He carries. He plays with his head up and drives into spaces. He can thread passes through the finest alleys and pop it around the corner. His range of passing. long or short, it's all there. And he's already shown he's got the goal threat to carry with him, something we'll see aplenty in the years to come.\n\nBut none of these are Mainoo's most impressive traits. Kobbie Mainoo is not fazed. By anything, by the looks of it. Every moment he's been dropped into in his short career so far, Mainoo has got the ball and played his game. Taken it off an opponent, and played his game.\n\nThe biggest game of his career is approaching. The biggest game in all of these England players' careers. From what we've seen in his short career so far, you can bet your bottom dollar Kobbie Mainoo is going to deliver.\n\nREAD THE LATEST EURO 2024 NEWS, PREVIEWS & PLAYER RATINGS", "source": {"uri": "90min.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "90min.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "scott_saunders@90min.com", "name": "Scott Saunders", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kobbie_Mainoo", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kobbie Mainoo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gareth_Southgate", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gareth Southgate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalvin_Phillips", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kalvin Phillips"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarence_Seedorf", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Clarence Seedorf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westfalenstadion", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Westfalenstadion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_European_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UEFA European Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Italy national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "France national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-elimination_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Single-elimination tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dortmund", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dortmund"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dortmund"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ollie_Watkins", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ollie Watkins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conor_Gallagher", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Conor Gallagher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jude_Bellingham", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jude Bellingham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declan_Rice", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Declan Rice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrea_Pirlo", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Andrea Pirlo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A.C._Milan", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "A.C.

I know some fans haven't always been satisfied with the style of the performances by England at these Euros, but against the Netherlands it was really convincing, and a deserved result, in my opinion.\n\n\"Now no one wants to talk about Gareth Southgate's future, of course sources are quiet and only hoping to win the final all together. But for sure, for England it's already a massive achievement. Cole Palmer has been perfect in the final minutes, same for Watkins of course.\n\n\"But again, what a player Kobbie Mainoo is - he really stood out for me. He's an incredible talent.

a major tournament for the Three Lions.\n\nAnd the Red Devils ace did not fold under pressure as he was the driving force in midfield that saw England beat the Netherlands 2-1.\n\nTo share his excitement of reaching his first-ever major European final Mainoo posted a heartfelt carousel on Instagram of his family proudly watching him from the stands at BVB Stadion in Dortmund on Wednesday night.\n\nIn the carousel, Mainoo also shared a clip which has become a viral meme of Paul Gascoigne saying \"I'm now away to get my suit measured\" after Tottenham won the 1991 FA Cup semi-final.\n\nMainoo only made his full England debut against Belgium at Wembley back in March and instantly looked right at home.\n\nA bit like Adam Wharton, Mainoo was part of England's 26-man squad to learn what it is like to feature in a major tournament and maybe make a few appearances off the bench.\n\nHe was effectively Southgate's third-choice to partner Declan Rice and now started the semi-final.\n\nMainoo's first Premier League start was just eight months ago and already bagged an FA Cup winners' medal at the age of 19.\n\nFor him to win Euro 2024 a couple of months later

They've already dispatched of hosts Germany and favourites France in the knockout rounds, and dominated current holders Italy in the group stages. England have their biggest task ahead of them but a newly-developed knack of getting the job done. You never know.\n\nGareth Southgate has plenty to celebrate. But these moments are fleeting - the England manager has spent most of the last month having to bat away criticism for poor performances, while carrying the weight of a nation's expectations on his shoulders. The usual thing for someone in his position at a major tournament, y'know, and far more in keeping than this 'making finals' stuff.\n\nIt feels an era ago today, but just a few short weeks ago Southgate was showing signs of crumbling under the pressure. He turned up to discuss his team's performance in a 1-1 draw against Denmark - a game in which England were largely outplayed - and ended up speaking about his midfield conundrum.\n\n\"We know it's an experiment. We know we don't have a natural replacement for Kalvin Phillips,\" Southgate said, to national rage and desperation. The clip below sums up the situation nicely.\n\nSouthgate started the tournament with Liverpool right-back Trent Alexander-Arnold taking the third spot in central midfield, alongside shoo-ins Declan Rice and Jude Bellingham. The balance was off and he rotated through Conor Gallagher, who shuffled around a bit. Both very good players in their own right, but clearly not what Southgate was seeking for his midfield to control big moments in big games, like they're doing now.\n\nWith Southgate in auto-pilot while dropping the \"natural replacement for Phillips\" line, perhaps scared to act and put his faith in a 19-year-old kid sitting on his bench, the case soon became that if he didn't, his spell in charge of his country, a largely successful one without the riveting football or trophies to show for it (to date, Sunday is England's biggest moment) would slip through his fingers.\n\nBut that 19-year-old kid we're talking about? That's no ordinary 19-year-old kid.\n\nThat's Kobbie Mainoo.\n\nPerhaps Southgate was right, though. Mainoo is not a natural replacement for Phillips. He's so much more.\n\nAnd Manchester United's latest academy star is taking absolutely no time in his short career to date to show it, no matter the level, no matter the occasion. It's been a rollercoaster eight months, but time and again, Mainoo takes it in cruise control.\n\nWhat Southgate has stumbled on is replacing the Yorkshire Pirlo with the Stockport Seedorf. The two were teammates at Milan, but very different players. And while you'd keep your tongue in cheek most of the time comparing Phillips to the glorious Italian, you can use Mainoo's Seedorf comparison with authority. You watch Mainoo and believe that this boy is good enough to do what he's doing now, and better, for the next 15 years.\n\nHe's got everything, and England just simply do not make these types of midfielders. Until now.\n\nMainoo became the youngest ever player to represent England in the semi-final of an international tournament on Wednesday night, and the third youngest to play for England in a quarter-final last weekend, behind Michael Owen and Wayne Rooney. Back then, England only did quarter-finals at a maximum, but not any more.\n\nHe's made a habit over the course of two thirds of his maiden season in senior football of delivering in the moment. Whether it be a crucial goal line clearance in his first Premier League appearance at Everton or waltzing through opponents in Turkey against Galatasaray, one of world football's most hostile atmospheres, Mainoo is unfazed.\n\nScoring a worldie against Liverpool in Jurgen Klopp's final season in charge? Whatever. Or how about scoring the winning goal in an FA Cup final against Manchester City and walking away with the player of the match award? All in a day's work.\n\nThis is a player who has broken through into one of the worst Manchester United teams in history and risen above it (nobody does that), brushing the pressure off his shoulders and just doing his thing time after time. Those who've watched him closely enough throughout the last few months knew this was the midfield answer Southgate had been looking for. Now the world can see it.\n\nMainoo's night against the Netherlands was incredibly impressive. And especially in the first half, England's finest 45 in Germany so far. Mainoo was everywhere, on and off the ball. Tracking back to make crucial interceptions is his game, and so is the anticipation to cut out passes to maintain attacks. But he's so incredibly gifted that these qualities almost go under the radar.\n\nWhen you watch Mainoo in possession, you see a natural. He glides. He carries. He plays with his head up and drives into spaces. He can thread passes through the finest alleys and pop it around the corner. His range of passing. long or short, it's all there. And he's already shown he's got the goal threat to carry with him, something we'll see aplenty in the years to come.\n\nBut none of these are Mainoo's most impressive traits. Kobbie Mainoo is not fazed. By anything, by the looks of it. Every moment he's been dropped into in his short career so far, Mainoo has got the ball and played his game. Taken it off an opponent, and played his game.\n\nThe biggest game of his career is approaching. The biggest game in all of these England players' careers. From what we've seen in his short career so far, you can bet your bottom dollar Kobbie Mainoo is going to deliver.", "source": {"uri": "ca.sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports Canada"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kobbie_Mainoo", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kobbie Mainoo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gareth_Southgate", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gareth Southgate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-elimination_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Single-elimination tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jude_Bellingham", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jude Bellingham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalvin_Phillips", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kalvin Phillips"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declan_Rice", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Declan Rice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarence_Seedorf", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Clarence Seedorf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "France national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trent_Alexander-Arnold", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Trent Alexander-Arnold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conor_Gallagher", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Conor Gallagher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrea_Pirlo", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Andrea Pirlo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A.C._Milan", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "A.C.

Belying his age, the teen helped dictate possession and was a dangerous and dynamic threat with the ball as he combined brilliantly with Phil Foden in tormenting Ronald Koeman's side.\n\nMainoo's place in the starting XI on Sunday is virtually guaranteed with Southgate lauding his latest display.\n\nThe England boss began the competition with Trent Alexander-Arnold moved into midfield as he sought to find a suitable replacement for Jordan Henderson and Kalvin Phillips, key figures in previous competitions but both left out of this summer's squad.\n\nSouthgate has now fully placed his faith in a midfield option his team has sorely lacked.\n\n'I think all of his performances have been exceptional, especially when you consider his age. We haven't really had a player like him until now,' the England boss said.\n\n'It makes such a difference when your midfield players can receive [the ball] pressed and turn with the ball so easily and comfortably. It looks simple when he does it, but it isn't simple.\n\n'But I thought him and Phil popping up in spaces, Jude [Bellingham]... our movement was really good. That caused a lot of problems and forced them to adapt how they were without the ball.'\n\nMainoo made his full Premier League debut for United in November and instantly became a key figure under Erik ten Hag, scoring memorable goals against Wolves and Liverpool before getting on the score sheet again in the FA Cup final victory over Manchester City.\n\n'It's an indescribable feeling,' Mainoo said, reflecting on his journey.\n\n'It's happened quickly, but I've just been taking it day by day, game by game, and yes now we're in the European Championship final.\n\n'We're all buzzing, it's been such a journey to get here. I feel like we've built on our performances that we've had leading to this point and I feel like the only way is up, time to put ourselves into history.\n\n'I feel like in the first half it was clicking with the whole team, everyone was getting on the ball.

Mainoo, 19, has enjoyed a remarkable rise since making his first league start for United in November, and reaching a Euros final is the latest milestone in his incredible journey.\n\nMainoo, who scored in the FA Cup final, has consistently been unfazed by the pressure of the occasion. The teenager proved as much by finding time to congratulate one of his ex-team-mates on the same day that he lined up in a semi-final for the Three Lions.\n\nFormer United striker Charlie McNeill announced that he had signed for Sheffield Wednesday on a three-year deal after leaving Old Trafford. Mainoo was one of many Red Devils youngsters to wish him well on social media, commenting with a heart emoji hours before kick-off in Dortmund.\n\nMcNeill was released by United this summer after coming to the end of his contract. The 20-year-old was once snapped up from local rivals Manchester City - scoring 24 goals in 21 U18 games during his debut season - and made his sole first-team appearance aged 18, coming on against Real Sociedad in the Europa League.\n\nThe forward previously had short loan spells at Newport County and Stevenage but will hope to showcase his quality at the Owls. On Instagram, McNeill wrote: \"Delighted to join this massive club for the next three years! Can't wait to get started and see all the fans at Hillsborough.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Mainoo's focus will be on ending his breakthrough season with another flourish as this England side aim to make history. The young midfielder started the tournament on the bench but has arguably become an undroppable player for England boss Gareth Southgate in a short space of time.\n\nHAVE YOUR SAY! Who will win the Euro 2024 final? Tell us in the comments section below\n\nAsked to sum up what he has achieved so far, Mainoo said: \"It's been unbelievable... I think I've worked hard this season. I never would have thought I'd be [at the Euros], but I always backed myself.\n\n\"Whenever I get a chance to play I give it 100% every time. That's what my parents have always said to me, when you get your chance you have to grab it with both hands. [Playing for England] is feeling better and better every time, so I think it'll only get better from here.\"\n\nJoin our new WhatsApp community and receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

You can check out at any time. More info\n\nKobbie Mainoo's impassioned expression when Ollie Watkins netted England's winner over the Netherlands on Wednesday was as joyful as the goalscorers' himself.\n\nThe Manchester United midfielder put in a performance of someone ten years his senior, having gone from a club debutant to a European Championship finalist in the space of just 18 months.\n\n\"It is an indescribable feeling, we are all buzzing!\" Mainoo told BBC Radio 5 Live at full-time, admitting his rise in senior football has \"happened quick and now we are in a European Championship final.\"\n\nMainoo only turned 19 in April and has just eight caps under his belt, most of them coming at his maiden international tournament. His form will not surprise many United fans who have seen him grow immensely since making his bow against Charlton Athletic in the League Cup back in January 2023.\n\nREAD MORE: Luke Shaw explains why Manchester United youngster Kobbie Mainoo has 'scared' him\n\nREAD MORE: Jude Bellingham's two-word Kobbie Mainoo message sums up Man United role\n\nHe was selected to start that debut and lasted an hour, coming off after an exciting performance. Despite a major injury setback at the beginning of the season, the teenager has gone from strength to strength and is now one of the first names on Erik ten Hag's team sheet.\n\nMainoo is one of just four players safeguarded from a sale this summer with Andre Onana, Rasmus Hojlund and Alejandro Garnacho exempt from transfer approaches, all four seen as integral to the club's long-term rebuild.\n\nIn order to evolve, United are looking at bringing in a defender, a midfielder and a striker this summer. Anthony Martial left upon the end of his contract last month meaning Hojlund is the only natural centre-forward among current ranks.\n\nUnited seem to be closing in on a deal for Joshua Zirkzee, who has a \u00a333m release clause but could cost as much as \u00a346m when agents' fees are factored in. The Dutchman was called up late by his country for Euro 2024 amid a spate of injuries with the Netherlands camp.\n\nHe had to cut short his holiday at DisneyWorld to make the flight over to Germany, where has made two substitute appearances. He came on as a last throw of the dice for Ronald Koeman after Watkins had fired home, but he hardly had enough time to make a touch.\n\nThe emotions of both Zirkzee and Mainoo at full-time could not have been more contrasting, but Mainoo made sure to console his potential new teammate after the final whistle as a mark of respect. He shared a smile with the striker before celebrating with his England teammates.\n\nMainoo has shown to be a class character on and off the pitch for both club and country, and now he is focused on becoming immortalised in English football history.\n\nAfter the game in Dortmund, he added: \"It has been such a journey and we have built on old performances, the only way is up - time to put us in history.\"\n\nThis article contains affiliate links, we will receive a commission on any sales we generate from it.

becomes England's youngest star to play in a major championships semi-final - Man United News And Transfer News | The Peoples Person", "body": "England secured their place in the final of the European Championships on Wednesday by beating the Netherlands 2-1 in Dortmund.\n\nA last-gasp winner by Ollie Watkins and a controversial Harry Kane penalty was enough to complete the comeback after Xavi Simons had fired the Dutch ahead in the early moments of the game.\n\nThe memorable triumph meant the Three Lions made it into back-to-back Euro finals and set up a mouthwatering showdown against tournament favourites Spain on Sunday.\n\nWatkins grabbed the headlines but it was Manchester United man Kobbie Mainoo who was the star of the show for the Gareth Southgate's side.\n\nMainoo produced yet another mature display beyond his years in the middle of the park and in doing so set a new record for his national side.\n\nAs reported by The Sun, at 19 years and 82 days old, Mainoo became the youngest player to represent England in a semi-final of a major tournament and he looked completely at ease throughout the 90 minutes.\n\nThe United man was applauded by England fans after the full-time whistle who recognised his excellence.\n\nMainoo covered every blade of grass in the Westfalenstadion, breaking down countless Dutch attacks while dictating the tempo of the game.\n\nThe composed display did not come as a surprise to United fans who have taken the young man to their hearts over the course of last season.\n\nSince breaking into the first-team after recovering from injury midway through the campaign, the academy product has been a beacon of light in what was ultimately a poor season for Erik ten Hag's side.\n\nMainoo is now showcasing his talents on the international stage and will surely start in the showpiece occasion against Spain at the weekend.\n\nA win would cap an incredible year for the midfielder who had also scored the winner in the FA Cup final just over a month ago for his boyhood club.\n\nUnited fans will be desperate to welcome back one of their own to Old Trafford for the new season and will look forward to him continuing his development under Ten Hag.", "source": {"uri": "thepeoplesperson.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Peoples Person | MUFC News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "conner_botterill@thepeoplesperson.com",

More info\n\nManchester United midfielder Kobbie Mainoo demonstrated his class ahead of England's semi-final win over the Netherlands.\n\nThe United star, who partnered with Declan Rice, put in an impressive performance to help the Three Lions earn a dramatic win. At just 19, Mainoo has had a meteoric rise since making his first league start for United in November and reaching the Euro 2024 final is another significant achievement in his extraordinary journey.\n\nDespite the pressure of big occasions, Mainoo, who scored in the FA Cup final, has consistently remained composed. This was evident when he took time out to congratulate a former team-mate on the same day he lined up for a semi-final match as part of Gareth Southgate's side.\n\nREAD MORE: Man United have got \u00a333m reminder of just how bad their transfer window could have been\n\nREAD MORE: Jadon Sancho swap deal 'emerges' for Manchester United as new defender targeted\n\nFormer United striker Charlie McNeill announced that he had sealed a permanent move to Sheffield Wednesday after leaving Old Trafford. Mainoo was among several Red Devils youngsters who wished him well on social media, posting a heart emoji hours before kick-off in Dortmund.\n\nMcNeill, who was released by United this summer at the end of his contract, was once a promising talent snapped up from local rivals Manchester City. He scored 24 goals in 21 U18 games during his debut season and made his only first-team appearance at 18, coming on against Real Sociedad in the Europa League.\n\nThe striker expressed his joy at joining the Owls, posting on Instagram: \"Delighted to join this massive club for the next three years! Can't wait to get started and see all the fans at Hillsborough.\" United midfielder Dan Gore joined Mainoo in congratulating McNeill, writing: \"Good luck brother.\" Joe Hugill commented, \"All the best brother\", while Ethan Wheatley added, \"Good luck bro.\"\n\nInstagram\n\nIn contrast, Mainoo's attention is firmly set on capping off his breakthrough season by making history with England and winning the Euros. Despite beginning the tournament as a substitute, Mainoo has rapidly become a key player in Southgate's team.\n\nReflecting on his remarkable journey so far, Mainoo said: \"It's been unbelievable... I think I've worked hard this season. I never would have thought I'd be [at the Euros], but I always backed myself.\"\n\n\"Whenever I get a chance to play I give it 100% every time,\" he added. \"That's what my parents have always said to me, when you get your chance you have to grab it with both hands. [Playing for England] is feeling better and better every time, so I think it'll only get better from here.\"\n\nThis article contains affiliate links, we will receive a commission on any sales we generate from it.

England went against the Netherlands in the tense semi-final, deciding who would go against Spain over the weekend. But it appeared that luck was on England's side as Gareth Southgate's team went on to secure a 2-1 victory.\n\nAston Villa's Ollie Watkins scored the last goal of the match, ensuring England went sailing through to the final. This came after the Dutch team had taken the lead during most of the game with Xavi Simon marking the first goal of the evening before Harry Kane evened out the score with a penalty.\n\nJordan, 29, took to his Instagram after the match to celebrate the Three Lions' achievements. Sharing a snap alongside his brother Kobbie Mainoo and relatives, the model was all smiles. \"Proudest in the damn world, Berlin next,\" he wrote alongside his upload, which also saw Ollie Watkins greeting relatives in the stands.\n\nHis upload which has gained over 15,000 likes was flooded with celebratory messages within minutes. \"He's a f***ing star,\" exclaimed one. Meanwhile, a second went on to add: \"He is the best honestly so much talent and so much more to come pur star boy for both United and England. So proud Kobbie.\"\n\n\"Keep looking after our star boy Kobbie Mainoo,\" added a third. Elsewhere, a fourth excited fan typed: \"What a player so proud of Mainoo.\" Stockport-born Jobbie, 19, made history as part of England's midfield alongside Declan Rice. The Manchester United ace has the highest pass accuracy recorded by Opta, at 96 per cent.\n\nHe's secured a whopping 133 out of 138 passes at this tournament. CBS' James Benge acknowledged that out of the 132 players who have completed over 100 passes at the Euros, Kobbie is ranked 131st for the proportion of forward passes with 13 per cent. Mainoo made his senior debut for England in their match against Brazil, with Declan Rice saying the \"sky is the limit\" for the teen.\n\nHe said: \"Every time I've seen him playing for United on the TV, he has been pretty much their best player every game. I've been asked a lot by my friends 'What's Mainoo like?' - and he's really, really impressive. I really want him to enjoy his career. I think it's really important that we don't put too much pressure on him.\n\n\"He's at one of the biggest clubs in the world, and now he's at England we just want to let him flourish. He's so composed. I have come across so many 18-year-olds who are top players but don't have that full package. He's just a really normal kid. The sky is the limit for him.

Ollie Watkins scored a superb last-minute goal, to send the Dutch packing, and keep the dream of 'bringing it home' alive. Away from the goals and the celebrations, a certain teenager in the middle of the park is slyly running away with the headlines. Teenage sensation Kobbie Mainoo has had a tremendous campaign at the base of midfield, carrying on from his terrific season with Manchester United.\n\nEngland will face Spain in the final on Sunday. Both sides, on paper are incredibly well-rounded, with a wealth of experience and quality. But for both sides, the biggest talking points of the tournament have been their teenage superstars.\n\nSoon to be 17-year-old livewire Lamine Yamal took the breathe away from millions watching the game, scoring an absolute scorcher in the semis against France. The Barcelona winger has been outstanding all throughout the tournament, becoming the youngest goalscorer ever in the semi finals of a major tournament. Yamal has racked up 4 goal involvements in the campaign so far, making a strong case for being named Player of the Tournament if Spain are to win Euro 2024.\n\nAlthough Mainoo doesn't fill the statsheet in the obvious ways, his impact on the team has arguably been as much as Yamal's. The 19-year-old has completed more than 95% of his passes with a staggering dribble percentage of 98%. Incredibly composed on the ball, playing line-breaking passes and dribbling out of trouble, Mainoo has provided the England midfield a brand new dimension. In the semi final, Mainoo played more of a reserved role at the base of the midfield, winning 100% of his duels and tackles. Mainoo's skillset has enabled Declan Rice to be more expansive with his game, bombing forward at every opportunity possible.\n\nAfter a disappointing Finals loss in the last Euros, England will be determined to put in a big shift in Berlin.

Not as involved after break but kept running and running and never hid. England's best. At 19, what a star!\n\nSo it would be churlish to rewind the clock three weeks to when Hope pretended that he knew exactly who should have been playing alongside Declan Rice; but we are really sodding churlish, so here we go:\n\nThere has been talk out here among the press pack and former players that the solution for the deeper midfield role is sitting at home in England. Not Jordan Henderson or Kalvin Phillips, but Bournemouth's Lewis Cook, who had an outstanding season and was capped by Southgate in a friendly against Italy in March 2018.\n\nAlas, Cook is not here...\n\nAnd alas, what a right load of hindsight bollocks that was from a man who had literally never written about Lewis Cook before.\n\nThe Main man\n\nThe giddiness about Kobbie Mainoo is real - we're giddy too - but let's not pretend that he is 12 years old, people.\n\nAND we all thought England had just the one generational talent.\n\nKobbie Mainoo was effectively brought to Germany as a work experience kid but has emerged as the key kid behind this country's attempt to rewrite history.\n\nThe double 'kid' has us squirming but it was late. For the subs as well as Sun Football Editor Charlie Wyett, it seems.\n\nBut 'work experience kid'? Behave.\n\nPesky fact: Kobbie Mainoo had started two of England's last three games before Euro 2024.\n\nMORE EURO 2024 ENGLAND COVERAGE ON F365\n\n\ud83d\udc49 16 Conclusions on England 2-1 Netherlands: Watkins, subs, Mainoo, Southgate, *that* penalty and more\n\n\ud83d\udc49 'Arise Sir Gareth of Southgate' as England fans respond to epic victory\n\n\ud83d\udc49 England player ratings v Netherlands: Watkins a national hero as Foden, Mainoo shine\n\nPump up the volume\n\nWe are a stuck record on this particular subject but 'speak volumes' refers to, well, not actually speaking at all. Or, as the dictionary would put it, 'convey a great deal without using words'.\n\nWhich brings us to this on the Express website:\n\nGary Lineker's eight-word statement on England star Kobbie Mainoo speaks volumes\n\nSouthgate, you're not the one\n\nNegativity sells - we all know that - so there's more traffic in England disappointment than England glory, which is why we end up here on the Express:\n\nEngland into Euro 2024 final thanks to hero Ollie Watkins as Southgate proven very wrong\n\nYou might naturally think that Southgate has been 'proven very wrong' by Watkins, but of course you would be mistaken; he was clearly proven very right by the Villa striker.\n\nWhat's actually happened is that the Express' desperation for a negative spin has seen them claim Mainoo's brilliance as a chance to kick the England manager:\n\nSouthgate's claim that he didn't possess a natural midfield replacement for Kalvin Phillips after England's 1-1 draw with Denmark in Group C was met with bemusement.\n\nMainoo proved why every time he intercepted a dangerous ball, lasered a direct pass through the lines or confidently took on a Dutch player. Manchester United and England have a gem at their core.\n\nNow we all laughed at Southgate for that nugget, but just after full-time of one of the greatest England results in history - managed brilliantly by the coach - is not the time to be proclaiming that actually, Southgate got it pretty wrong with something he said four games ago.\n\nLook of the Irish\n\nIf Mediawatch were John Cross, we would a) chill out a bit about self-embargoed quotes, but also b) be a bit p***ed off that we slog our guts out in Germany along with our Daily Mirror colleagues only to find that the biggest story in football on Thursday morning after you watch England beat the Netherlands in a European Championship semi-final is:\n\nRoy Keane's brilliant reaction to England's last-gasp Ollie Watkins goal vs Netherlands\n\nFrom the TV. In England.\n\nWe're told that 'fans spotted' (it was on the telly) the 'hilarious' reaction (he literally did nothing) to Ollie Watkins' goal, which is clearly far better content than could have been written by anybody actually at the match or anything - and this seems important - written about the match.\n\nIrishman Keane was on punditry duty for ITV and when Watkins' shot hit the back of the net, English colleagues Gary Neville and Ian Wright went wild celebrating.

You can check out at any time. More info\n\nEngland manager Gareth Southgate has admitted his team has lacked a midfielder of Kobbie Mainoo's profile after he starred in Wednesday night's European Championship semi-final victory over the Netherlands.\n\nSubstitute Ollie Watkins netted a dramatic 90th-minute winner to send the Three Lions to a second successive European Championship final. England had earlier come from behind to draw themselves level via a Harry Kane penalty.\n\nOn a night of pure joy and emotion, England produced their best performance of the tournament thus far, inspired by the brilliance of Phil Foden and Mainoo in midfield. The duo were at their sparkling best in the first half, with Foden a lick of paint away from scoring a Goal of the Tournament contender.\n\nREAD MORE: United news and transfer updates LIVE\n\nREAD MORE: Kobbie Mainoo shows true colours in moment with Joshua Zirkzee amid United transfer\n\nMainoo, who started for the third game running, was a colossus in the engine room, playing progressive passes, receiving the ball on the half turn and winning almost every second ball. His performance oozed class and he is almost guaranteed to start Sunday's final against Spain.\n\nLauding his display in his post-match press conference, Southgate told reporters: \"I think all of his performances have been exceptional, especially when you consider his age. We haven't really had a player like him until now.\n\n\"It makes such a difference when your midfield players can receive [the ball] pressed and turn with the ball so easily and comfortably. It looks simple when he does it, but it isn't simple.\n\n\"But I thought him and Phil popping up in spaces, Jude [Bellingham]... our movement was really good. That caused a lot of problems and forced them to adapt how they were without the ball.\"\n\nMainoo, who made his first Premier League start as recently as last November, only made his England debut in March, stepping off the bench in the Three Lions' 1-0 reverse to Brazil. He earned his full debut against Belgium three days later and has now won eight caps for his country, five of which have been earned at this tournament.\n\nThis article contains affiliate links, we will receive a commission on any sales we generate from it.

major tournament for England in the process.\n\nAfter Watkins' last-gasp strike, Ronald Koeman, in a desperate attempt to try and take the game to extra-time, threw on United target Joshua Zirkzee for the final few seconds.\n\nZirkzee wasn't able to do much given his limited time but after the full-time whistle, he was seen bumping into Mainoo.\n\nThe pair embraced at the end of the game with hopeful United fans labelling it as Mainoo 'welcoming' the striker to Old Trafford.\n\nAs reported by The Sun, Mainoo stopped for a quick chat with the Bologna man who is widely expected to be linking up with him in Manchester ahead of the new season.\n\nTransfer guru Fabrizio Romano also shared the photo of the duo, captioning it with \"soon\".\n\nThe Peoples Person have recently relayed that a deal for the 23-year-old is close to completion and the striker will join Erik ten Hag's troops after the European Championships.\n\nZirkzee will provide competition to Rasmus Hojlund who had to carry the burden of being United's only striking option last season.\n\nDespite not featuring for his national side in the Euros as much as he would have liked, Zirkzee enjoyed a fine season at club level.\n\nThe Dutchman hit double figures to help secure an excellent fifth place finish for Bologna, which meant plenty of suitors were interested in his signature.\n\nUnited look set to win the race

You can check out at any time. More info\n\nGary Lineker singled out Kobbie Mainoo for praise after the Manchester United star helped England into the final of Euro 2024.\n\nThe Old Trafford prodigy was superb as Gareth Southgate's side clinched a thrilling victory over the Netherlands thanks to a last-gasp goal from Ollie Watkins. Mainoo has proved to be the answer to Southgate's midfield puzzle, which began with the unsuccessful trial of Trent Alexander-Arnold in the centre alongside Declan Rice.\n\nConor Gallagher was brought into the side for the final group match against Slovenia but was substituted for Mainoo at the interval. Since then, the 19-year-old has been a fixture in the starting XI, impressing everyone with his composure and drive. His poise has stood out for Lineker, who gave his post-match verdict on his The Rest is Football podcast.\n\nREAD MORE: Manchester United have four players fighting for the same position\n\nREAD MORE: Erik ten Hag might be about to unleash United's next academy hopeful\n\nThe Match of the Day presenter said \"Kobbie Mainoo, goodness me, what a footballer. He's incredible. We talked about [Spain's] Lamine Yamal. Obviously, he's unbelievably talented in a different way. Mainoo is incredibly impressive, and he's also a teenager. It's kind of the tournament of emerging stars, which is something you want to see.\n\n\"Obviously, we know he can cope with a cup final. He played against Manchester City and scored that goal and performed brilliantly. Nothing seems to faze him, fearlessness of youth, I guess.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Micah Richards praised Mainoo's quiet confidence. The former City defender said: \"He believes in his own quality. You hear him in his interviews and he doesn't get too excited. He's just calm.\n\n\"His interviews are like he is on the pitch, calm, composed, but with that little bit of confidence to say, 'OK, I know what my ability is, I'm going to show you what I can do'. It's great to see and long may it continue.\"\n\nMainoo's exceptional talent was first noticed when he was only five years old at Cheadle and Gately FC. Volunteer coach Steve Vare recognised his potential immediately.\n\n\"He was five when he first came down and started and within a couple of weeks myself and another volunteer at the time just looked at each other and said, 'Wow, this kid is unbelievable,\" said Vare. \"He was dominating games, running from one end to the other and it just became apparent that he was a fantastic young boy that had come through.\n\n\"We had to find ways to challenge him. We put some rules in games where he could only score with his left foot, he had to pass to a team-mate, all sorts of different things just to challenge and develop him.\n\n\"The drills were far too easy for him, we were fizzing passes to him and chipping them in. I would have to load all the best players onto the opposing team just to make it a challenge for him.\n\n\"At the end of the session we used to hand out trophies and I told him he'd win one every week but we have to share them out. Some boys or girls might have reacted differently but Kobbie always understood. He knew how good he was.\n\n\"It got to a situation where we couldn't challenge him on a Sunday morning session, he was ready to go into a professional set up at the age of five, that's how good he was.\"", "source": {"uri": "manchestereveningnews.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Manchester Evening News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mark_whiley@manchestereveningnews.co.uk", "name": "Mark Whiley", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kobbie_Mainoo", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kobbie Mainoo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gareth_Southgate", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gareth Southgate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Lineker", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gary Lineker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Manchester United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conor_Gallagher", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Conor Gallagher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declan_Rice", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Declan Rice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_Association_of_Slovenia", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Football Association of Slovenia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "England national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Trafford", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Old Trafford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trent_Alexander-Arnold", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Trent Alexander-Arnold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ollie_Watkins", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ollie Watkins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erik_ten_Hag", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Erik ten Hag"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micah_Richards", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Micah Richards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Match_of_the_Day", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Match of the Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manchester City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article29519656.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Untitled-design-45jpgGary-Lin.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9722994", "eventUri": "eng-9722994", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3176470588235294, "wgt": 144, "relevance": 1}

You can check out at any time. More info\n\nIt is July 2022 and Mancheseter United have not long lost their penultimate pre-season friendly against Atletico Madrid in Oslo. Nearly 1,300 miles away at the J Davison Stadium, a United XI is preparing to face National League Altrincham.\n\nAltrincham won 2-1 in a run-out so inconsequential that, at the time of writing, the eight-minute highlights of their victory have amassed only 3,500 views on YouTube. The Altrincham match reporter, John Edwards, should be particularly pleased with one sentence.\n\n\"With Kobbie Mainoo the pick of the United youngsters by some distance, but all of them comfortable in possession, there was plenty to admire about a first half that finished goalless.\"\n\nThe United anoraks in the crowd noticed Mainoo, aged 17, was not as scrawny as he was when he lifted the FA Youth Cup a few months earlier. With a first major winner's medal to treasure and a new face in the manager's office at Carrington, Mainoo had embarked on a personal pre-season before returning to Carrington.\n\nEXCLUSIVE: United open to signing three centre backs\n\nREAD MORE: Why Malacia is still not training with United\n\nAlejandro Garnacho, Mainoo's teammate in the youth team, would start for United against Rayo Vallecano at Old Trafford the day after Altrincham hosted United. Garnacho had been included in Ten Hag's tour squad but did not play a minute in Thailand and Australia after some tardy timekeeping.\n\nFrenkie de Jong was topical with United's pursuit of the Barcelona midfielder at an impasse. Zidane Iqbal, an academy graduate who modelled his game on De Jong, acquitted himself impressively from Bangkok to Perth, via Melbourne.\n\nIt was not until September 16 that Ten Hag and his assistant, Mitchell van der Gaag, watched Mainoo in the flesh for the Under-21s against West Ham. Again, it was at Altrincham, a ground United occasionally borrow for junior games.\n\nTen Hag is not a frequent attendant at academy matches but Altrincham's ground is a short journey for the cycling enthusiast and Hale resident. Without that bike ride, the wheels might have come off England's European Championship campaign.\n\nMainoo played 90 minutes in a goalless draw with West Ham. Exactly a month later, he was named on the United bench for the first time in the goalless draw with Newcastle.\n\nTen Hag felt Mainoo was already in his comfort zone at under-21 level and that he should have been more dominant against West Ham. Mainoo had already been summoned from the academy building for his first ad hoc promotion to first team training. He got to rub shoulders with Cristiano Ronaldo, Casemiro and new signing Antony the day after United beat Leicester in Ten Hag's fourth match in charge.\n\nIqbal's impact and Ten Hag's constructive criticism pushed Mainoo in the right direction. His father had also advised United staff to provide some tough love. Come the halfway point of Ten Hag's first season, Mainoo had usurped Iqbal, bound for Utrecht.\n\nThere has not been one outright breakthrough in Mainoo's nascent career. He showed teeth in the Goodison Park bear pit in his full Premier League debut in November but Ten Hag had planned to start last season with Mainoo in midfield until he was lucklessly injured after 74 seconds against Real Madrid in a pre-season friendly.\n\nMainoo was so accomplished in midfield against the Arsenal duo of Declan Rice and Martin Odegaard at the start of that tour that he was accommodated with Casemiro, Bruno Fernandes and new signing Mason Mount five days later in the defeat to Madrid.\n\nLong before Everton, Mainoo was the story to write home about from the winter training camp in Cadiz in December 2022. He made his debut a month later and was permanently promoted to the first team squad but a quad injury ended his first season in early April.\n\nUnited staff at the Montecastillo Hotel spoke optimistically about Mainoo during a training session journalists were invited to observe. \"That's when he (Ten Hag) first saw me properly,\" Mainoo told me in May.\n\n\"That's the first time I played under him in a game and, definitely to score in that (the friendly against Cadiz) was definitely me turning a corner, him seeing me. And then I trained with them a lot more and got to show myself a lot more.\"\n\nTwo breakthroughs preceded breakdowns. Everton was third time lucky. Mainoo has not suffered an injury since the Real Madrid winger Rodrygo accidentally collided with his ankle last July.\n\nThe Uruguay coach Marcelo Bielsa delivered an erudite lecture last week on how the commercialisation of football was diluting it as a spectacle. The European Championship has been sterile and its change in format from 16 teams to 24 teams has sapped its quality.\n\nThen you watch Lamine Yamal outclass France with such grace it makes you wonder if the divine Lionel Messi bathed him in holy water for that baby calendar shoot in 2007. Then you watch Mainoo dance past Dutch midfielders like a disciple of Cruyff.\n\nPep Guardiola told us we were \"lucky\" to watch a 17-year-old Phil Foden in Houston seven years ago. We were.\n\nThey were also lucky at Altrincham two years ago.", "source": {"uri": "manchestereveningnews.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Manchester Evening News"}, "authors": [{"uri":

But Southgate adjusted his team's structure without the ball to limit its threat.\n\nThe problem with that approach was that it allowed Kobbie Mainoo to roam freely in midfield, as the 19-year-old had space to attack with Bellingham and Foden dragging Schouten and Reijnders across the centre of the pitch.\n\nHere, Gakpo is close to Mainoo, but this wasn't the case for the rest of the first half.\n\nSchouten and Reijnders focused entirely on marking Bellingham and Foden, and with Simons trying to close down on Rice, Mainoo had spaces to attack and time on the ball when he received it.\n\nBellingham and Foden's positioning empties Netherlands' midfield by moving Schouten and Reijnders wider, which allows Harry Kane to drop into that area to receive Rice's pass.\n\nSimons is initially blocking the passing lane into Mainoo, but now Kane can find the Manchester United midfielder between the lines.\n\nEngland's centre-forward drops and plays the pass to Mainoo, but Simons stretches to intercept it.\n\nIn another example, Schouten and Reijnders are close to Foden and Bellingham, and Simons is moving towards Rice, which leaves Mainoo unmarked in midfield.\n\nThe movement of Foden and Bellingham stretches Netherlands' double pivot and creates space in midfield, which Kane drops into again.\n\nStill, Mainoo is relatively free because Reijnders has to position himself closer to Bellingham. Rice finds Kane between the lines...\n\n... and the Bayern Munich striker links the attack to find Mainoo, who is free in midfield. Meanwhile, Foden attacks the space behind the defence...\n\nEngland kept finding Mainoo because of this four-versus-three scenario in midfield.\n\nHere, Simons is defending against Rice, while Schouten and Reijnders are marking Foden and Bellingham, which allows England's midfield to combine and reach Mainoo in space.\n\nReijnders then tries to push up and defend that area, with Schouten dropping to track Foden's movement, but Mainoo's pass finds Kane.\n\nThe domino effect of Reijnders leaving Bellingham is that Kane can find the Real Madrid midfielder in an advantageous situation against Netherlands' centre-backs. However, Kane's pass into Bellingham is intercepted by Virgil van Dijk.\n\nIn another example, Foden finds Mainoo between Schouten and Reijnders with Netherlands' double pivot focusing on the City player and Bellingham.\n\nMainoo then carries the ball forward and finds Foden's run...\n\nEngland's goal in the first half came from a contentious penalty kick, but the attack which led to the penalty was all about the overload in midfield.\n\nIn the build-up, Simons and Schouten switch their focus to Mainoo and Rice, leaving Dumfries to mark Bellingham with Reijnders near Foden.\n\nHowever, Netherlands' right-back can't commit to Bellingham because of Kieran Trippier's advanced position down the left wing. When Mainoo plays the ball to Marc Guehi...\n\n... Dumfries leaves Bellingham and moves back to defend against Trippier. The four-versus-three overload in midfield allows Guehi to find Bellingham in space, and the Madrid midfielder progresses the attack, which eventually leads to the penalty kick.\n\n\"The match started really good for us, (but) after that we had some difficulties in the midfield to stop the good players like Bellingham and Foden between the lines,\" said Koeman after the game. \"We didn't control the game. We made some changes to (get) control back in the game.\"\n\nOne of the changes Koeman was referencing was adjusting his team's shape out of possession after Joey Veerman replaced Memphis Depay and Simons moved to the right wing.\n\nTo nullify England's overload in midfield, Veerman marked Mainoo with Simons moving inside from the right wing to keep an eye on Rice.\n\nKoeman's tweak neutralised England's threat on the ball as they couldn't use Mainoo or Kane to attack the vacated space in midfield.\n\nVeerman marked Mainoo closely and Stefan de Vrij was more than happy to push up and press Kane because Schouten and Reijnders were tracking Bellingham and Foden's runs.\n\nSouthgate's team couldn't play through the Netherlands as they did for the majority of the first half, and a change in approach was needed.\n\nThe introduction of Watkins offered a different profile than Kane, with the Villa striker offering a passing option behind the defence.\n\nIn this example, Watkins signals to Stones that he wants the ball over the top...\n\n... and the centre-forward makes the run, but the pass falls behind him.\n\nBut Watkins kept attacking the space behind Netherlands' back four, even when his team-mates didn't find him.\n\n... and Watkins rifled the ball into the far corner to win the game for England.\n\n\"We have got good players on the bench and we wanted to make that gamble in normal time rather than wait until extra time,\" said Southgate after the game.\n\n\"We felt, energy-wise, we were starting to lose a bit of pressure -- Harry got that knock in the first half as well. Ollie can press well and he can make those runs in behind that he did.\"\n\nIn the second half, England couldn't combine and play through the Netherlands' midfield, so Watkins' runs in behind offered an alternative attacking method against tired legs.\n\nIf Watkins hadn't scored that goal, the substitution was still logical considering the Netherlands' approach without the ball. Luckily for England, he did.\n\nA fitting ending that England will be hoping to relive in the final against Spain.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York

What the 19-year-old has also proved over the course of this season is his elite sense of timing. A nose for the big occasion.\n\nCalling Mainoo's first Premier League goal a 'late winner' doesn't do it justice. Not when it came in the 97th minute, requiring him to weave past three Wolves players before bending the ball into the bottom corner to snatch a 4-3 victory at Molineux.\n\nMainoo's first senior goal at Old Trafford was pretty special, too. What better way to announce yourself to your home fans than by whipping a finish into the top corner against Liverpool, your great rivals.\n\nAnd with United desperate for a shock win over noisy neighbours Manchester City to end a tough season on a high, of course it was Mainoo who stepped up to score the winner at Wembley.\n\nMainoo is no stranger at the national stadium - he'd already been named player of the match on his first start for England in March. Any lingering doubts have been put to rest at Euro 2024.\n\nIn a midfield that boasts Declan Rice, Jude Bellingham and Phil Foden, it is Mainoo who has taken control for England in Germany. Trent Alexander-Arnold and Conor Gallagher can't even get a look in now.\n\nStill only a teenager, Mainoo has gone from playing U18s football to becoming almost undroppable for club and country in the space of 12 months.

Kate appeared in high spirits as she donned an England jersey and danced to the famous Three Lions song alongside her pet pooch - but made sure to share a warning to fans commenting negatively on her page.\n\nKate's beloved Pomeranian Myf was nowhere to be seen in the wholesome clip, but she did dance with another dog who is believed to be a beloved pet of the actress. The Switch star paired her England jersey with a pair of denim shorts and some black boots as she styled her brunette tresses in a high ponytail.\n\nAlongside the celebratory video, Kate penned: \"Well done England and everyone who wants to come on my page and go Spain is going to win, just give us this moment. It's really bad karma to p**s on people's joy and thank you to everyone from other European countries wishing us well. You have been so supportive and amazing and I think that's just such good sportsmanship but f**k me lads it might be coming home.\"\n\nEarlier on Wednesday, Kate shared other snaps to show her support for England ahead of their kick-off against The Netherlands. Kate posted photos from previous games where she was cheering on the England players including Harry Kane and Jude Bellingham.

But it appeared that luck was on England's side as Gareth Southgate's team went on to secure a 2-1 victory.\n\nAston Villa's Ollie Watkins scored the last goal of the match, ensuring England went sailing through to the final. This came after the Dutch team had taken the lead during most of the game with Xavi Simon marking the first goal of the evening before Harry Kane evened out the score with a penalty.\n\nJordan, 29, took to his Instagram after the match to celebrate the Three Lions' achievements. Sharing a snap alongside his brother Kobbie Mainoo and relatives, the model was all smiles. \"Proudest in the damn world, Berlin next,\" he wrote alongside his upload, which also saw Ollie Watkins greeting relatives in the stands.\n\nHis upload which has gained over 15,000 likes was flooded with celebratory messages within minutes. \"He's a f***ing star,\" exclaimed one. Meanwhile, a second went on to add: \"He is the best honestly so much talent and so much more to come, star boy for both United and England. So proud Kobbie.\"\n\n\"Keep looking after our star boy Kobbie Mainoo,\" added a third. Elsewhere, a fourth excited fan typed: \"What a player so proud of Mainoo.\" Stockport-born Jobbie, 19, made history as part of England's midfield alongside Declan Rice. The Manchester United ace has the highest pass accuracy recorded by Opta, at 96 per cent.\n\nFollow Mirror Celebs on TikTok , Snapchat , Instagram , Twitter , Facebook , YouTube and Threads .",

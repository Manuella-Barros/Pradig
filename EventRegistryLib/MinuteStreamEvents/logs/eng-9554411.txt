District Court Judge Spencer Walsh accepted a bail agreement between prosecutors and Gaulden's attorneys and set a July 1 arraignment for the 24-year-old rapper.\n\nGaulden was arrested April 16 on more than 60 felony counts tied to an operation where he and at least two others fraudulently obtained the prescription drugs promethazine and codeine from several Utah pharmacies, according to authorities. He has been held without bond in a Cache County, Utah, jail since then.\n\nGaulden was already out on bail when the latest arrest happened. He was slated to be tried in July in the U.S. Middle District Court of Louisiana on a possession of a firearm by a felon case that stems from a 2020 music video shoot near an abandoned lot on Chippewa Street. Baton Rouge police rounded up Gaulden and 15 others after swarming the video shoot and finding pistols and assault rifles hidden in the area, arrest reports indicate.\n\nU.S. District Judge Shelly Dick, who allowed Gaulden to remain free on house arrest with several restrictions while he awaited trial, ordered him to be returned to federal custody two days after his arrest in Utah. Dick has yet to set a hearing date to determine if she will revoke his federal bond outright.\n\nDick signed a separate order May 2 postponing the trial to a date yet to be determined, court records show.", "source": {"uri": "theadvocate.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Advocate"}, "authors": [{"uri": "matt_bruce@theadvocate.com", "name": "Matt Bruce", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YoungBoy_Never_Broke_Again", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "YoungBoy Never Broke Again"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prescription_drug", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Prescription drug"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapping", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rapping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utah", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Utah"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Utah"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_arrest", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "House arrest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bail", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_Lake_City", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Salt Lake City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Salt Lake City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_County,_Utah", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cache County, Utah"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cache County, Utah"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baton_Rouge,_Louisiana", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Baton Rouge, Louisiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Baton Rouge, Louisiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Promethazine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Promethazine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codeine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Codeine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Felony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pharmacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arraignment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arraignment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ojibwe", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ojibwe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pistol", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pistol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assault_rifle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assault rifle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firearm", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Firearm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_district_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States district court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Research", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Research", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 52}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/theadvocate.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/a/a0/aa0edbd4-7ad2-11e8-a27e-231fcb956402/5b2d92e204b56.image.jpg?crop=1333%2C700%2C283%2C0&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9554411", "eventUri": "eng-9554411", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-01", "textStart": 635, "textEnd": 641}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-16", "textStart": 704, "textEnd": 712}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-02", "textStart": 1777, "textEnd": 1782}], "sentiment": -0.3019607843137255, "wgt": 206, "relevance": 1}

The rapper has been in the Cache County Jail since he was apprehended after authorities raided his Utah home. During the court hearing, YoungBoy's attorneys agreed to forego a preliminary hearing in exchange for a deal where the rapper would get a $100,000 bail. In doing so, Utah's 1st District Court Judge Spencer D. Walsh put things in motion for Top to face trial for the charges.\n\nYoungBoy will be arraigned during his next court hearing, which has been scheduled for July 1. At that time, he will enter his plea.\n\nThe controversial rapper has been living in Utah for the last two years on house arrest as he awaits trial for a federal firearm case in Louisiana. Despite that fact, the rapper managed to put out a mind-boggling amount of music in that time. However, the new charges again threaten his freedom. His home was raided on April 16 by authorities in Utah who arrested the prolific rhymer and charged him with being a part of a prescription drug ring. At one point he faced a total of 66 charges.\n\nAccording to KUTV, that number has been knocked down to 49. The charges include identity theft, forgery, procuring or attempting to procure drug prescription, possession of other controlled substances, possession of a dangerous weapon by a restricted person and pattern of unlawful activity.\n\nPolice say YB would pose as a doctor and call in prescriptions using the real birthdates and names of unsuspecting victims.

The rapper is accused of posing as a doctor and calling in prescriptions to obtain drugs. Prior to his arrest, he was on house arrest awaiting trial on unrelated federal weapons charges.\n\nToday, the rapper appeared in court for the first time since his April arrest, where his bond was set at $100K. In new photos circulating online, he appears to be in good spirits, smiling as he faced the judge. He waived his preliminary hearing, allowing the case to move forward, and his arraignment has been scheduled for July 1. If he's freed in Utah, his home state of Louisiana wants him transported there to await his aforementioned trial.\n\nYB was initially facing 63 charges including \"patterns of unlawful activity, procuring or attempting to procure drugs, identity fraud, forgery, possession of controlled substances, and possession of a dangerous weapon.\" Now, his list of charges has been reduced to 48. The charges include identity fraud, forgery and obtaining or attempting to obtain prescription drugs illegally,\" per WBRZ.\n\nAs for how YB was allegedly caught, a probable cause affidavit from Cache County suggests that a suspicious pharmacist tipped off authorities. They claim to have received a call from someone who identified themselves as a doctor named Gwendolyn Cox. Gwendolyn, however, \"sounded as though she was a much younger male from the Southern states.\" The Cache County Sheriff's Office, along with the FBI, Secret Service, and a SWAT team, then conducted a search warrant on YB's Utah home. He was later taken into custody. What do you think of NBA YoungBoy appearing in good spirits during his recent court appearance? What about his bond being set at $100K?

{"id": 223730020, "title": "Katie Price victim of 'acid attack' as 'scumbags' target her house and car overnight", "text": "Katie Price has said she's eager to leave to leave her 'Mucky Mansion' following an 'acid attack' by vandals on her car. The 45 year old model and media personality shared a video on Instagram showing the damage to her pink Range Rover, expressing her fury at the situation. Katie declared: \"It's nice to know someone in the night has come to throw acid all over my car, everywhere, all on my car. Thank you whoever that was.\" She captioned the footage with: \"Scumbags outside my house on my private property. I can't wait get out of this house in a few months' time.\" This incident came on the heels of Katie receiving a parking ticket on the same vehicle while she was recording a podcast in south London earlier in the week. Her new beau, Married At First Sight's JJ Slater, was on duty outside, but even the 31 year old couldn't prevent the bright yellow 'Penalty Charge Notice' from landing on the windscreen. Photos later emerged showing Slater looking disheartened as he stood beside the road in grey shorts and a hoodie. The TV star began dating Katie towards the end of last year following her split from ex-fiance Carl Woods, reports the Mirror. And it seems the age difference - Katie is 46, making her 14 years older than Slater - doesn't bother them at all, given how content Katie appears in their presence. The couple, who have been together for six months now, have already started discussions about marriage and children they even sport matching tattoos. However, Katie's love life isn't the only thing making headlines this week; she also confirmed that she has to leave her cherished Horsham, West Sussex residence, notoriously known as Mucky Mansion over the years. This comes following The Mirror's revelation that the former glamour model was served an eviction notice after being declared bankrupt over an unpaid \u00a3750,000 tax bill. Horsham County Court granted her creditors eviction notices, ordering her to be ousted from the house by the end of the month so it can be sold to offset her outstanding debts. The mum-of-five applied for a court hearing in a bid to prolong her stay at the home. However, she was given mere days to move out. A second notice surfaced outside the model's home, dated 3rd May 2024, indicating she had just days left before her property was seized. Katie had earlier stoutly vowed nobody could force her from the Mucky Mansion and refuted claims that she was planning to shift into a caravan. However, she recently admitted she \"can't wait\" to depart her home of nine years, attributing it to hosting \"nothing but bad memories\". Katie expressed her disdain, saying: \"I absolutely hate the Mucky Mansion, even how it's been called the Mucky Mansion because of all the stuff that happened there before. I can't wait to get out of that house. I've had nothing but bad memories in that house for nine years.. I hate the Mucky Mansion, I never want to see it again and I can't wait to move into my new place, I am so excited.\" Get the latest celebrity gossip and telly news sent straight to your inbox.

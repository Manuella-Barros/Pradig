I still don\u2019t feel like it\u2019s real. My sister moved out so it\u2019s just been me and my mum every day. I just feel like she\u2019s going to walk through the door, like she\u2019s not really gone. \u201cEspecially the way it happened \u2013 she promised she would never leave me. She told me a few weeks ago she was struggling and didn\u2019t want to be here but she wouldn\u2019t leave me. She was my best friend and we used to do everything together.\u201d A British Transport Police spokesperson confirmed Jill\u2019s death is not being treated as suspicious and a file is being prepared for the coroner. Amber is now making arrangements for her mum\u2019s funeral. She plans to scatter her ashes with Jill\u2019s late 19-year-old dog Benson at her request. She also hopes to attend university this year \u2013 something the mum and daughter duo had hoped to do together \u2013 to study business studies. The pair had dreams of owning their own pub and turning it into a franchise.", "summary": "Jill Canovan was discovered near Heaton Chapel station on Monday (June 3)", "url": "https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/my-heart-breakssuch-beautiful-soul-29322469", "image": "https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article29322542.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_PO_TEM_060624jill_06.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 16:19:16", "author": "James Holt", "authors": ["James Holt"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": -0.14}

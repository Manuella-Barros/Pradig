{"id": 231225010, "title": "Becoming The Swamp", "text": "Hello, it\u2019s the weekend. This is The Weekender \u2615 In this week\u2019s episode of The Insurrectionists Are Running The Show, NBC News reported on Friday that the RNC recently hired a big time supporter of the \u201cStop the Steal\u201d movement to work on the party\u2019s policy platform-writing committee. Ed Martin is now the RNC\u2019s deputy policy director of the platform committee. But before that cushy gig he was chairing the Missouri Republican Party and encouraging Trump supporters, or \u201cdie-hard true Americans\u201d as he called them, on Jan. 5, 2021 to fight until their \u201clast breath\u201d to \u201cstop the steal.\u201d Martin was among the crowd of MAGA fans who attended Trump\u2019s speech at the Ellipse before marching to the Capitol. He was reportedly not involved in any illegal storming-of-the-Capitol activities, according to NBC News. But it\u2019s not hard to imagine where a policy writer \u2014 with \u201cStop the Steal\u201d roots \u2014 for a political party that currently has few values outside of Trump\u2019s grievances might turn when drafting a platform for the fall. Here\u2019s what else TPM has on tap this weekend: Hunter Walker explores the new marshland metaphor Trump is employing to try to convince everyone he convinced four years ago to hate mail-in voting to, this year, vote by mail. Josh Kovensky unpacks why Senator RonJohn was pushing Kremlin talking points at a Christian nationalist conference. Kate Riga theorizes about why the Supreme Court is dragging its feet to release decisions this June. Khaya Himmelman prepares us for the next threat against mail-in voting and Emine Y\u00fccel tries to make sense of Rep. Byron Donalds\u2019 (R-FL) outrageous Jim Crow remarks this week. Let\u2019s dig in. \u2014 Nicole Lafond I Am Become Swamp After years of promising to \u201cdrain the swamp\u201d while maintaining coziness with lobbyists and engaging in unprecedented self dealing, former President Trump has a new awkward marshland metaphor. Trump is now asking his supporters to become the \u201cswamp\u201d themselves as part of his continued flip flopping on early voting and mailed ballots. On Tuesday, Trump\u2019s campaign and its newly-launched turnout effort \u201cTrump Force 47\u201d announced a program called \u201cSwamp The Vote USA.\u201d The announcement included a statement from Trump himself that echoed his false claims that Democrats have somehow stolen votes from him. \u201cWe must swamp the radical Democrats with massive turnout. The way to win is to swamp them, if we swamp them with votes they can\u2019t cheat,\u201d Trump said. \u201cYou need to make a plan, register, and vote any way possible. We have got to get your vote.\u201d Per the announcement, Trump\u2019s plan to go from draining swamps to creating them involves promoting \u201cthe use of absentee and mail ballots and early in-person voting.\u201d Of course, these very voting methods were part of Trump\u2019s debunked narratives about voter fraud in the last election. Trump\u2019s past suggestions that mailed ballots and early voting were somehow sources of nefarious activity sowed deep distrust among his base. That contributed to Democrats having a major edge with these methods. This latest launch is the culmination of a monthslong GOP effort to reverse this collateral campaign damage caused by Trump\u2019s election conspiracies. Dearly departed former Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel launched an awkward initiative to embrace early voting last year. Since McDaniel was deposed in favor of a Trump loyalist and the former president\u2019s daughter in law, the dramatic Republican 180 on early voting has accelerated. However, after Trump\u2019s steady drumbeat of efforts to question the election, some of the more conspiratorial elements of his base have had trouble getting their heads around the new direction. While McDaniel\u2019s early voting push didn\u2019t exactly light up the base, this new one comes with more direct participation from Trump. It also offers distinctly Trumpian branding complete with odd capitalization and a hint of election paranoia. Now, rather than reviling the swamp, Trump wants his supporters to be part of the biggest one ever. And, rather than the cause of election issues, his people are suggesting early voting can fix them. As the initiative\u2019s site puts it, \u201cAll Republicans must SWAMP THE VOTE in 2024 to make our victory TOO BIG TO RIG!\u201d \u2014 Hunter Walker Reading RonJon The most surprising thing about the GOP\u2019s anti-Ukraine cohort is not how decisively it breaks from decades of hawkishness; not that it\u2019s overtly dismissive of the concerns of the country being invaded, or that it rejects what\u2019s a key American interest in preventing Russian imperial expansion from smashing into a NATO ally, which we\u2019d be treaty-bound to protect. Rather, it\u2019s that they\u2019re not ignorant. You can look at their public remarks on the war, and see people who have learned real, troubling facts \u2014 and promptly assimilated them into a worldview that holds America responsible for Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. Take one example of this: Sen. Ron Johnson (R-WI). Sen. Johnson spoke recently at an event jointly hosted by American Moment, a think tank and personnel farm for the MAGA youth, and New Saint Andrews College, a Moscow, Idaho institution linked to the burgeoning view on the right that federal policy needs more Christianity in order to be effective. The two have been putting on a series of events titled \u201cTheology of American Statecraft\u201d in which former Trumpworld figures and Republican elected officials gather with others on the right to articulate exactly what that kind of Christianity-influenced vision would be. I wrote earlier this year about former OMB acting director Russ Vought\u2019s appearance at a \u201cTheology of American Statecraft\u201d event devoted to immigration, where he used biblical language to argue for Trump\u2019s border proposals. Johnson\u2019s talk was titled \u201cTheology of American Statecraft: Just War.\u201d It was less biblical: he began with an encomium to \u201cnational strength\u201d and \u201cnational unity\u201d before moving to the point: U.S. support for Ukraine is not just, and should end. This focused on a few key points: Ukraine\u2019s 2014 revolution was \u201cfomented\u201d by the U.S., the regions Russia seized in its aftermath \u201cwanted to be ruled by Russia,\u201d Russia\u2019s invasion was legitimate because of NATO\u2019s eastward expansion (Was Ukraine\u2019s defense a \u201cjust war?\u201d That\u2019s left unanswered). Johnson showed an awareness of the counterarguments to these points in his talk. He claimed that James Baker had promised Russia that NATO would not expand \u201cone inch\u201d eastward, before instantly becoming contrite: \u201che didn\u2019t exactly say that, but that was certainly the implication.\u201d It\u2019s true. Baker never promised that to the Russians. Later, Johnson suggested that Ukraine\u2019s fight was futile in part because Russia is outproducing the West in artillery shells \u2014 this is also true. Both cases are interesting however because they demonstrate that Johnson, and those who agree with him, are assimilating facts given to them as senators, and counterarguments made against them, to make their points. It\u2019s not blithe shouting; it\u2019s a more considered view, even if it\u2019s one that parrots Kremlin talking points while advocating for the U.S. to prod Ukraine into capitulating. \u2014 Josh Kovensky The Ominous Supreme Court Silence Of June Traditionally, the Supreme Court term ends in June. Tell that to the ~25 outstanding cases, which include the biggest of the term on issues including domestic abusers\u2019 right to have guns, the accessibility of abortion drug mifepristone and Donald Trump\u2019s immunity in the Jan. 6 prosecution. Some experts contend that this is a sign of a Court too willing to intercede in bombshell, culture war cases that take a long time to decide and often engender many splits. In some cases, like Trump immunity, it\u2019s hard not to feel that the foot dragging is purposeful. And some are just plain alarming: The case concerning whether or not domestic abusers can have firearms was argued on November 7. A seven-month delay does not indicate ringing consensus that such a gun right is, blindingly obviously, catastrophically dangerous. \u2014 Kate Riga Now It\u2019s Dangerous Just To Count Mail-In Ballots Election workers are preparing for the upcoming presidential election with new training to protect against the possibility of fentanyl-laced mail-in ballots. In response to recent incidents involving suspicious substances being sent to county clerks\u2019 offices in Oregon, Washington, and elsewhere, election officials across the country are now training staff on how to use Narcan, instituting new policies around glove-wearing while opening mail, and in some jurisdictions, even using drug-sniffing dogs to suss out suspicious mail. In Lane County, Oregon, as previously reported by TPM, after an election worker opened an envelope containing an unknown suspicious powdery substance following a 2023 special election, the county clerk\u2019s office implemented in\u2013person training on administering Narcan and new policies regarding how to open mail to minimize risk in the event of an exposure to a dangerous substance. These updated processes, which are now standard for many election offices in the country ahead of 2024, are yet another grim reminder of the dangerous environment election workers find themselves in in a post-2020 world. \u201cElection officials are risk averse and they tend to try and prepare for all possible scenarios, and you have to prioritize,\u201d Tammy Patrick, Chief Executive Officer for Programs of The Election Center told TPM this week. \u201cThis is yet another thing that they [election workers] have to be concerned about,\u201d she said. \u201cIn the same way that for the last 20-plus years, election officials have policies in place for active shooter situations or have policies in place for a bomb scare \u2014 they have disaster recovery plans, they have continuity of operation plans. This is just yet another chapter.\u201d Patrick also noted that election offices are working closely with the United States Postal Inspection Service to investigate these matters, if they do occur. In an email to TPM, a representative for the United States Postal Inspection Service explained that as a member of the Department of Justice\u2019s Election Threat Task Force, the agency, in addition to conducting mailroom security reviews for election offices, also works closely with federal, state, and local law enforcement to investigate these incidents. \u2014 Khaya Himmelman Words Of Wisdom That\u2019s Rep. Byron Donalds (R-FL) earlier this week speaking at a \u201cCongress, Cognac, and Cigars\u201d GOP outreach event in Philadelphia. It\u2019s hard to not interpret those words as Donalds insinuating Black Americans were better off during an era of explicit and violent racial segregation. It\u2019s so unthinkable, that I was wary of over-interpreting what he might have meant. But it seems I wasn\u2019t the only one taken aback by Donalds\u2019 remarks \u2014 it prompted immediate backlash from Democrats, including members of the Congressional Black Caucus. \u201cIt has come to my attention that a so-called leader has made the factually inaccurate statement that Black folks were better off during Jim Crow,\u201d Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY) said on the House floor. \u201cHow dare you make such an ignorant observation? You better check yourself before you wreck yourself.\u201d Amid the widespread backlash, Donalds defended his words, saying he never said Black people were doing better under Jim Crow. \u201cWhat I said was is that you had more Black families under Jim Crow, and it was the Democrat polices under H.E.W., under the welfare state, that did help to destroy the Black family,\u201d Donalds said in his defense. That\u2019s one way to spin it. Regardless, it\u2019s hard to defend a speech during which Donalds also claimed Black women are turned off by Democrats\u2019 positions on transgender policies in the most outrageous way: \u201cBlack women are looking at their sons and saying, \u2018Now, wait a minute. You\u2019re telling me that my young son can become a girl? Nope.\u2019\u201d \u2014 Emine Y\u00fccel", "summary": "Hello, it\u2019s the weekend.

On Tuesday, Fox said he's \"extremely disappointed\" with a change of position North Dakota is taking in a court case involving Fort Berthold. (Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)\n\nAttorneys for the state of North Dakota have taken the unusual step of asking the U.S. Supreme Court to vacate a ruling in a case the state had actually won.\n\nIt's a change of position the Mandan, Hidatsa and Arikara Nation chairman calls \"unconscionable\" after the tribe and state had previously been aligned.\n\nNorth Dakota Attorney General Drew Wrigley said the state is trying to gain clarity on how legislative district lines can be drawn to comply with both the U.S. Constitution and the federal Voting Rights Act.\n\n\"We're inviting them to ... decide that well-intentioned racial discrimination is still discrimination,\" Wrigley said.\n\nThe case goes back to 2021, when the Republican-dominated North Dakota Legislature redrew legislative district lines based on the 2020 census results.\n\nThe legislation created subdistricts in districts 4 and 9 for two reservations. District 4A follows the borders of the Fort Berthold Reservation, home to the Mandan, Hidatsa and Arikara Nation.\n\nA lawsuit filed by Republicans in February 2022 challenged the constitutionality of the new subdistrict citing the Equal Protection Clause of the Constitution. The Equal Protection Clause is outlined in the 14th Amendment, requiring that laws apply to all people equally.\n\nRobert Harms is one of the attorneys representing Charles Walen and Paul Henderson, who challenged the constitutionality of the district lines. In depositions quoted in a court filing, Walen and Henderson said they are not Native American. Harms and Walen are running as Republicans for the state Legislature this year. Henderson is a former Republican Party chair candidate for District 9.\n\nLisa Finley-DeVille, a Democrat and member of the MHA Nation, currently represents District 4A.\n\nThe state and attorneys for the MHA Nation were on the same side fighting the lawsuit and won.\n\nIn a 2023 court filing, attorneys for the state argued the case should be dismissed because the plaintiffs failed to prove that race was a predominant factor for establishing the subdistrict. The state said the Legislature considered other factors, including drawing district lines around political subdivisions. Attorneys for the state further argued that even if race was determined to be a predominant factor, the state had a \"compelling interest\" in complying with the Voting Rights Act.\n\nFederal judges Peter Welte, Ralph Erickson and Daniel Hovland sided with the state and the MHA Nation, which intervened in the case.\n\nIn their ruling, the judges agreed with North Dakota, stating that regardless of whether race was a factor, \"we find that the State's decision to draw subdistricts in districts 4 and 9 is narrowly tailored to the compelling interest of compliance with the (Voting Rights Act).\"\n\nBut Monday, the state filed a motion asking the U.S. Supreme Court to reconsider that decision. The motion was filed after plaintiffs Walen and Henderson appealed the ruling. The state now seeks to vacate the ruling of the three-judge panel and send it back for further proceedings.\n\n\"In short, attempted compliance with the (Voting Rights Act) cannot justify violating the Equal Protection Clause when drawing an election map,\" the state said in its court filing.\n\nMark Fox, chair of the MHA Nation, called the state's motion to vacate \"extremely disappointing.\" The tribe is seeking to have the appeal dismissed.\n\n\"We opposed this unconscionable change of position when the Attorney General raised it with us, and we oppose it now,\" Fox said in a statement. \"MHA Nation was right to intervene in this suit, as, once again, it becomes apparent that our Tribe must forcefully act to protect our own interests.\"\n\nMichael Carter of the Native American Rights Fund, part of the MHA legal team, called the state's move \"very perplexing.\"\n\n\"It is undisputed that subdistrict 4A is necessary to comply with the Voting Rights Act,\" the attorneys for the tribe said in its motion to dismiss.\n\nNorth Dakota \"just took a 180 on its own legal argument with no explanation, and really to its own detriment,\" Carter said.\n\nNorth Dakota Attorney General Drew Wrigley speaks from the podium during the 2024 NDGOP Convention at Sanford Health Athletic Complex in Fargo on April 6, 2024. (Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)\n\nWrigley's explanation is that the Supreme Court has not ruled on whether a state's attempt to satisfy a federal law, the Voting Rights Act, satisfies the Equal Protection Clause.\n\n\"All they've done in this regard is repeatedly assumed, and they've never decided whether a state's attempt to satisfy the requirements of a federal statute is sufficient to meet the requirements of the Constitution's Equal Protection Clause,\" he said.\n\nThe state's filing draws heavily from Justice Clarence Thomas' dissenting opinion on a case the Supreme Court ruled on in June 2023.\n\nIn that case, Allen v. Milligan, the court ruled 5-4 that Alabama had violated the Voting Rights Act by creating only one majority-Black district, thereby weakening the power of Black voters in the state.\n\nIn his dissenting opinion, Thomas stated the court's decision would require Alabama to engage in unconstitutional racial gerrymandering. Thomas also wrote that he does not feel the Voting Rights Act applies to redistricting at all.\n\nWrigley said in light of the Supreme Court's narrow ruling on Milligan, it may have an appetite for North Dakota's case.\n\n\"I believe there's a real possibility,\" Wrigley said.\n\nThe court could also decide not to take up the case, could ask for more information, or make a ruling with the information it has.\n\nHarms said legislators were trying to satisfy what they think their obligation is in the Voting Rights Act.\n\n\"In the process, they're stomping on the Equal Protection Clause,\" Harms said.\n\n\"They discriminated based upon race in creating these subdistricts. That's why it's so important. Nobody wants any citizen in America to be discriminated against based upon the color of their skin, whether it's how they get treated at work, or whether they have a legitimate means of exercising their right to vote,\" Harms said.\n\nHe predicts that the case will come back to the same three-judge panel. But instead of a summary judgment, there could be a trial that could include expert witnesses and data analysis that he said could be useful.\n\nThe case involving District 4A is separate from another redistricting court case involving North Dakota tribes.\n\nThe Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa and Spirit Lake Nation successfully sued the state to have their reservations included in the same legislative district - District 9. That case eliminated a subdistrict for the Turtle Mountain reservation.\n\nThe state has appealed that decision to the 8th Circuit Court of Appeals.\n\nThose two tribes are represented by attorney Tim

District 4A follows the borders of the Fort Berthold Reservation, home to the Mandan, Hidatsa and Arikara Nation.\n\nA lawsuit filed by Republicans in February 2022 challenged the constitutionality of the new subdistrict, citing the Equal Protection Clause of the Constitution. The Equal Protection Clause is outlined in the 14th Amendment, requiring that laws apply to all people equally.\n\nRobert Harms is one of the attorneys representing Charles Walen and Paul Henderson, who challenged the constitutionality of the district lines. In depositions quoted in a court filing, Walen and Henderson said they are not Native American. Harms and Walen are running as Republicans for the state Legislature this year. Henderson is a former Republican Party chair candidate for District 9.\n\nLisa Finley-DeVille, a Democrat and member of the MHA Nation, currently represents District 4A.\n\nThe state and attorneys for the MHA Nation were on the same side fighting the lawsuit and won.\n\nIn a 2023 court filing, attorneys for the state argued the case should be dismissed because the plaintiffs failed to prove that race was a predominant factor in establishing the subdistrict. The state said the Legislature considered other factors, including drawing district lines around political subdivisions. Attorneys for the state further argued that even if race was determined to be a predominant factor, the state had a \"compelling interest\" in complying with the Voting Rights Act.\n\nFederal Judges Peter Welte, Ralph Erickson and Daniel Hovland sided with the state and the MHA Nation, which intervened in the case.\n\nIn their ruling, the judges agreed with North Dakota, stating that regardless of whether race was a factor, \"we find that the State's decision to draw subdistricts in districts 4 and 9 is narrowly tailored to the compelling interest of compliance with the (Voting Rights Act).\"\n\nBut on Monday, the state filed a motion asking the U.S. Supreme Court to reconsider that decision. The motion was filed after plaintiffs Walen and Henderson appealed the ruling. The state now seeks to vacate the ruling of the three-judge panel and send it back for further proceedings.\n\n\"In short, attempted compliance with the (Voting Rights Act) cannot justify violating the Equal Protection Clause when drawing an election map,\" the state said in its court filing.\n\nMark Fox, chair of the MHA Nation, called the state's motion to vacate \"extremely disappointing.\" The tribe is seeking to have the appeal dismissed.\n\n\"We opposed this unconscionable change of position when the Attorney General raised it with us, and we oppose it now,\" he said in a statement. \"MHA Nation was right to intervene in this suit, as, once again, it becomes apparent that our Tribe must forcefully act to protect our own interests.\"\n\nMichael Carter of the Native American Rights Fund, part of the MHA legal team, called the state's move \"very perplexing.\"\n\n\"It is undisputed that subdistrict 4A is necessary to comply with the Voting Rights Act,\" the attorneys for the tribe said in its motion to dismiss.\n\nNorth Dakota \"just took a 180 on its own legal argument with no explanation, and really to its own detriment,\" Carter said.\n\nWrigley's explanation is that the Supreme Court has not ruled on whether a state's attempt to satisfy a federal law, the Voting Rights Act, satisfies the Equal Protection Clause.\n\n\"All they've done in this regard is repeatedly assumed, and they've never decided whether a state's attempt to satisfy the requirements of a federal statute is sufficient to meet the requirements of the Constitution's Equal Protection Clause,\" he said.\n\nThe state's filing draws heavily from Justice Clarence Thomas' dissenting opinion on a case the Supreme Court ruled on in June 2023.\n\nIn that case, Allen v. Milligan, the court ruled 5-4 that Alabama had violated the Voting Rights Act by creating only one majority-Black district, thereby weakening the power of Black voters in the state.\n\nIn his dissenting opinion, Thomas stated the court's decision would require Alabama to engage in unconstitutional racial gerrymandering. Thomas also wrote that he does not feel the Voting Rights Act applies to redistricting at all.\n\nWrigley said in light of the Supreme Court's narrow ruling on Milligan, it may have an appetite for North Dakota's case.\n\n\"I believe there's a real possibility,\" Wrigley said.\n\nThe court could also decide not to take up the case, could ask for more information, or make a ruling with the information it has.\n\nHarms said legislators were trying to satisfy what they think their obligation is in the Voting Rights Act.\n\n\"In the process, they're stomping on the Equal Protection Clause,\" Harms said.\n\n\"They discriminated based upon race in creating these subdistricts. That's why it's so important. Nobody wants any citizen in America to be discriminated against based upon the color of their skin, whether it's how they get treated at work, or whether they have a legitimate means of exercising their right to vote,\" Harms said.\n\nHe predicts that the case will come back to the same three-judge panel. But instead of a summary judgment, there could be a trial that could include expert witnesses and data analysis that he said could be useful.\n\nThe case involving District 4A is separate from another redistricting court case involving North Dakota tribes.\n\nThe Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa and Spirit Lake Nation successfully sued the state to have their reservations included in the same legislative district -- District 9. That case eliminated a subdistrict for the Turtle Mountain reservation.\n\nThe state has appealed that decision to the 8th Circuit Court of Appeals.\n\nThose two tribes are represented by attorney Tim Purdon, but he is just an observer in the case involving MHA Nation.\n\n\"This is unprecedented,\" Purdon said of the tactic by North Dakota. \"Imagine you hired a lawyer. That lawyer won your case. The other side appeals, and on appeal, your lawyer said, 'Yeah, please vacate the judgment in my clients' favor and send this back down for trial.' You probably wouldn't be very happy with that lawyer.\"", "source": {"uri": "inforum.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "INFORUM"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

(AP) -- Months after it won a lawsuit over legislative boundaries, North Dakota is asking the U.S. Supreme Court to revisit its victory, baffling others involved in the state's redistricting fights and prompting some legal experts to call the state's action a potential assault on the Voting Rights Act.\n\nAt issue is a ruling by a federal panel over a lawsuit filed by Republicans challenging the constitutionality of a redistricting map that created House subdistricts encompassing two American Indian reservations. Proponents of the subdistricts said they gave tribal nations better chances to elect their own members. Last fall, a federal three-judge panel tossed out the lawsuit at the request of the state and the Mandan, Hidatsa and Arikara Nation. The judges wrote that \"assuming without deciding\" that race was the main factor for the subdistricts, \"the State had good reasons and strong evidence to believe the subdistricts were required by the VRA.\"\n\nThe plaintiffs appealed.\n\nNorth Dakota Attorney General Drew Wrigley said the three-judge panel decided the matter correctly under existing case law -- but for the wrong reason. The state argues in a filing made Monday that it \"cannot defend this Court's 'assumption' that attempted compliance with the VRA (or any statute) would justify racial discrimination in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.\"\n\n\"We're not seeking to reverse\" the panel's decision, Wrigley said. \"We're seeking to have it upheld but for the reason that race was not the predominant factor, and we think that we should prevail.\"\n\nBut critics bashed the move as a questionable legal maneuver as well as an attempt to assault the Voting Rights Act.\n\n\"Imagine if you hired a lawyer, and that lawyer won the case for you, and then the other side appealed, and on appeal your lawyer argued that the judgment in your favor should be vacated and the matter should be sent back for a trial so that your lawyer could make some different arguments. Imagine that. I think in that scenario, you'd probably want your money back from your lawyer,\" said Tim Purdon, who represents the Spirit Lake Tribe and Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Indians in their separate, successful lawsuit for a joint legislative district.\n\nDavid Schultz, a Hamline University professor and a visiting professor of law at the University of Minnesota, said he thinks the action is part of a broader assault on the Voting Rights Act \"to say that racial considerations cannot be used for any circumstances\" when district lines are drawn.\n\nMeanwhile, more than a dozen Republican-led states -- most of which have engaged in legal fights over election maps -- want the decision reversed. Last month, Alabama's attorney general and the other states filed their brief with the court, saying they \"have an interest in being able to accurately predict whether their redistricting laws will comply with federal law.\"\n\nSchultz also said he thinks the states see an opportunity now that the U.S. Supreme Court has a conservative majority.\n\nKareem Crayton, senior director of voting rights and representation at the Brennan Center for Justice, said, \"This is sort of, to my mind, a question as to whether or not states are really learning the lessons that the Voting Rights Act was intended to help them embrace, which is you've got to treat communities of color as everyone else. They're entitled to an opportunity to elect candidates.\"\n\nKey in the North Dakota case is Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, which forbids discriminatory voting practices based on race or color. Crayton said \"these continued assaults on it raise questions as to whether or not these states actually want any fair consideration of election systems for people of color who are citizens of their states.\"\n\nIn a statement, MHA Nation Tribal Chairman Mark Fox called it \"extremely disappointing\" to see Wrigley's office now arguing \"for this winning judgment to be vacated and this matter sent back down for a trial. We opposed this unconscionable change of position when the Attorney General raised it with us, and we oppose it now.\"\n\nPlaintiff attorney Bob Harms welcomed the state's filing.\n\n\"I know the attorney general's getting some criticism from people who feel like they won at the district level, but I do think that we have to step above that, about not just winning and losing but looking at constitutional principles and how they're applied,\" he said.\n\nWrigley said the Supreme Court will decide whether to have oral arguments and further briefing.", "source": {"uri": "kimt.com",

The court concluded that it was racial gerrymandering because North Dakotans don't elect Native Americans at a rate proportional to their portion of our state's overall population.\n\nThe solution? The court ordered lawmakers to engage in, uh, racial gerrymandering. Specifically, the drawing of new district lines to create a legislative district with the express intent of electing Native American candidates. The court then set an absurd timeline for drawing this new map, and when lawmakers couldn't meet it, the court chose its own map.\n\nClaims that the original map drawn by lawmakers was the result of racial animus are ridiculous and not rooted in fact. Lawmakers took great pains to comply with the Voting Rights Act, creating legislative subdistricts near the Fort Berthold and Turtle Mountain reservations. Every Native American serving in the Legislature at the time that map was approved voted for it, as did a majority of the Democratic-NPL's legislative minority. The map resulted in the election of two new Native American lawmakers.\n\nBut that wasn't enough for the federal courts.\n\nSo, again, the Voting Rights Act, as the courts have interpreted it, is broken. Even lawmakers working diligently to comply with that law can run afoul because the courts have created a subjective and unpredictable standard for compliance. Which is great for lawyers who get paid to file lawsuits over these things, and bad for everyone else.\n\nCongress should fix the law, but Congress, you might have heard, is dysfunctional.\n\nPlaintiffs in a lawsuit over redistricting are asking the U.S. Supreme Court to fix this mess, though it's an odd situation. As the North Dakota Monitor reports, the State of North Dakota previously asked the courts to dismiss their case, and the courts obliged the state. Now Attorney General Drew Wrigley has filed a motion in the appeal asking the highest court in the land to vacate that ruling.\n\nThe crux of that suit is the claim that the state violated the 14th Amendment's equal protection clause by creating subdistricts to comply with the Voting Rights Act. These subdistricts were drawn to strengthen Native American voting power, and, as I already mentioned, they did just that, resulting in the election of two new Native American lawmakers.\n\nHowever, the subdistricts also create an unusual situation: the people living there can only vote for two members of the Legislature.\n\nIn my Minot-area legislative district, as with most districts around the state, I get to vote for two members of the state House and one member of the state Senate.\n\nBut if you live in Districts 4 or 9, you can only vote for one Senator and one Representative.\n\nHow in the world is that equal representation?\n\n\"All they've done in this regard is repeatedly assumed, and they've never decided whether a state's attempt to satisfy the requirements of a federal statute is sufficient to meet the requirements of the Constitution's Equal Protection Clause,\" Wrigley told the Monitor.\n\n\"We're inviting them to ... decide that well-intentioned racial discrimination is still discrimination,\" he's also quoted as saying.\n\nWill the Supreme Court go for it? Wrigley and the plaintiffs hope that a recent SCOTUS decision in Allen v. Milligan, a redistricting case out of Alabama, might signal an appetite for the justices to clear up some of the legal precedents around the Voting Rights Act. Justice Clarence Thomas, specifically, wrote in a dissenting opinion in that case that he's not sure the Voting Rights Act even applies to redistricting.\n\nStill, with their expansive interpretations of that federal law, the courts have appropriated an enormous amount of power over a process central to the apportionment of political power in our country. Like any other branch of our government, the courts are typically loathe to give up the power they've granted themselves.\n\nWe'll see what happens, but I'm glad Wrigley and the state are pursuing this. The laws around redistricting should be easy to understand, easy to comply with, and in pursuit of equal representation for everyone.", "source": {"uri": "inforum.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "INFORUM"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_and_ethnicity_in_the_United_States_census", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Race and ethnicity in the United States census"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerrymandering", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gerrymandering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Dakota", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "North Dakota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "North Dakota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subdistricts_of_China", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Subdistricts of China"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_judiciary_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Federal judiciary of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voting_Rights_Act_of_1965", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Voting Rights Act of 1965"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_reservation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indian reservation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_Americans_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Native Americans in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drew_Wrigley", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Drew Wrigley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redistricting", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Redistricting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal_Protection_Clause", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Equal Protection Clause"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Attorney_General", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Attorney General"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Supreme court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allen_v._Milligan", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Allen v.

Mostly.\n\nFans will revel in seeing their heroes in the same frame, kicking arse and kicking back. It's undoubtedly exciting stuff and that hallway fight -- these guys love a hallway fight -- teased in the trailers is riveting and propulsive when you see their different fighting styles working together.\n\nLike its big-screen Marvel cousin, The Avengers, The Defenders features four heroes -- Daredevil (Charlie Cox), Jessica Jones (Krysten Ritter), Luke Cage (Mike Colter) and Iron Fist (Finn Jones) -- coming together to take on a bigger threat than what they could've handled on their own.\n\nBut unlike The Avengers, these characters are street-level good eggs and this is a much more intimate fight than the world-saving shenanigans the big green guy gets up to.\n\nWell, not intimate-intimate like their individual adventures have been -- this time a whole city is under threat. But it's still more relatable than, say, Peter Quill's planet-dad's evil plot to consume every world in the universe.\n\nThe stakes are raised in this series as The Hand, a powerful mystical organisation that has been around since at least the days of Pompeii, look to wreak havoc in New York.\n\nSome months after the events of Daredevil season two and Iron Fist, Alexandra (Sigourney Weaver), a formidable leader of The Hand, finds out she's dying. For someone who's lived forever, it's a hard prognosis to hear. It's also the catalyst for her moving up the timetable on her grand plan, one that'll make New York the next Chernobyl.\n\nSeparate inciting incidents lead our heroes into Alexandra's path but it's a while before they come together. Once they do, these very different people with different philosophies have to overcome their scepticism to work as one to stop The Hand.\n\nThe Marvel series have all suffered from pacing problems in some form and while it's improved in The Defenders (at least in the four episodes made available for review), it's not altogether gone.\n\nIt takes two episodes for any of our heroes to meet, and even then it's only in pairs, and it's not before the end of the third episodes before all four do, when, really, it should've happened at the end of the first.\n\nWhile it's certainly worth checking in on each character's lives, it takes too long for the convergence to happen, especially when there are only eight episodes in total.\n\nThe other downside of this is we have to spend just as much one-on-one time with Iron Fist/Danny Rand, whose story is still most generously described as \"meh\", as we get to with Jessica Jones, who we haven't seen on screen in almost two years. Sometimes, The Defenders just reminds you that what you really want is Jessica Jones season two.\n\nIn the Marvel Netflix world, Daredevil was the first show off the rank and it set the tone and standard for what followed. Each series had a distinct identity, except for Iron Fist, which failed on so many levels. Throwing them all together was always going to be a challenge but one that's been largely pulled off.\n\nTheir personalities also balance each other out. Luke serves as a good foil for Danny's naiveties -- there's something very satisfying about watching Luke schooling Danny on his billionaire privilege. Meanwhile, Jessica's snarky, self-deprecating humour is a great counter to Daredevil/Matt Murdock's earnest seriousness.\n\nThere are definite fan service moments with supporting characters from each superhero series getting their moment and starting to cross into other Defenders' worlds.\n\nVisually, the series exceeds the already high standard of the shows that preceded it. The cinematography is heightened by a four-pronged colour scheme with a shade assigned to each character -- red for Daredevil, blue for Jessica Jones, gold for Luke Cage and olive green for Iron Fist. This also comes across in the costuming.\n\nEach colour is dialled up when we're in their individual worlds but the real fun is seeing the hues in group scenes -- a blue light illuminated behind Jessica or a red neon sign in the corner of Daredevil's frame.\n\nBecause it is smaller scale than a blockbuster movie, it is steeped in emotional resonance, though some of it is good will carried over from the individual series. You care about what these characters care about -- well, three out of four of them anyway (Marvel really needs to sort out this Iron Fist problem).\n\nThe Defenders is not a perfect series but it'll give you the same kind of thrill as when you first saw the Avengers grouped together in that hero shot.

It does take longer than some fans might expect for the Defenders to finally assemble, but don't fear: it does happen soon enough! After a few episodes of Daredevil, Jessica Jones, Luke Cage, and Iron Fist doing their own thing, the Defenders join forces at last about three episodes into the new series.\n\nThe Defenders starts out with Daredevil, Jessica Jones, Luke Cage, and Iron Fist each picking up where they left off at the end of their respective standalone series: Matt Murdock is trying to wean himself off of vigilantism, Jessica Jones is reluctantly dealing with her new city-wide fame, Luke Cage is getting out of prison, and Iron Fist is heading to America after the attack on K'un-Lun. As each hero goes on their own missions, we actually do see a few meet-ups in Episode 2 -- Luke Cage and Iron Fist fight it out over a misunderstanding, and Matt Murdock offers to represent Jessica Jones when she's arrested -- but to see all four Defenders get together, you'll have to wait until the end of Episode 3.\n\nAll of their solo missions finally lead our four heroes to a shady financial firm called Midland Circle, which we learn is run by the evil organization The Hand and led by the mysterious Alexandra, played by Sigourney Weaver. When a fight breaks out in the boardroom, all four heroes spring into action and wind up meeting one another while beating up a horde of suit-wearing ninjas. I mean, what better way is there to meet some new friends than that?\n\nGiphy\n\nThough we get to see them fight alongside one another in the final scene of Episode 3, it's not until Episode 4 that we really see the Defenders introduce themselves to one another and lay out their plans going forward. And as you might expect with the prickly personalities involved, not everyone is really on board to start a super-team right off the bat...\n\nSubscribe to Elite Daily's official newsletter, The Edge, for more stories you don't want to miss.", "date": "2017-08-18", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television", "wgt": 100, "id": 111, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "wgt": 100, "id": 212, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "loc", "id": "233"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vigilante", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "308262", "label": {"eng": "Vigilante"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "313939", "label": {"eng": "Action film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigourney_Weaver", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "314952", "label": {"eng": "Sigourney Weaver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daredevil_(Marvel_Comics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "351103", "label": {"eng": "Daredevil (Marvel Comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ninja", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "354796", "label": {"eng": "Ninja"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defenders_(comics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "358975", "label": {"eng": "Defenders (comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessica_Jones", "type": "person", "score": 5, "id": "364911", "label": {"eng": "Jessica Jones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luke_Cage", "type": "person", "score": 5, "id": "373788", "label": {"eng": "Luke Cage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Fist_(comics)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "id": "431572", "label": {"eng": "Iron Fist (comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hand_(comics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "652996", "label": {"eng": "The Hand (comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Features_of_the_Marvel_Universe", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "714041", "label": {"eng": "Features of the Marvel Universe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giphy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "1280486", "label": {"eng": "Giphy"}}]}

The gang is all here, from Daredevil, Jessica Jones, Luke Cage and, yes, even Iron Fist, as they join together to save New York. So how does the first episode fare?\n\n'Get Justice' seems to take inspiration from Joss Whedon's The Avengers, using the breakout superhero film as a baseboard. Much like the opening act of that film, much of this episode is spent catching up on the various activities of these street level heroes. Throughout the episode we go back and forth between Matt Murdock, Jessica Jones, Luke Cage and Iron Fist as we see what each of them are up to. Even though it largely plays catch up, the premiere moves along at a brisk pace. Its especially intriguing to see Daredevil and Jessica Jones, seeing as we've gone the longest time without seeing either of them.\n\nIts also interesting to see how the various characters mesh together for this crossover. Each of the series had its own unique tone, from Daredevil's superhero drama to Jessica Jones' mystery noir to Luke Cage's Blaxploitation influence. During the individual segments with the characters, Defenders adopts that shows style, such as with the grey filter during Jessica's scenes or how everything looks so yellow and brighter with Luke. It's a subtle touch to the character's differences.\n\nAs for story progression, not much happens beyond catching up with everyone. The threat from Sigourney Weaver's Alexandra and her connections with The Hand are laid, but don't really come into play until much later in the episode. 'Get Justice' lays the groundwork, but the set-up still doesn't feel boring or wasted, even if none of the Defenders actually come into contact with each other.\n\nThe cast is great all round. Krysten Ritter again shines as Jessica while Charlie Cox plays a more subdued Matt Murdock now that he's found a small measure of comfort in his 'retirement'. Mike Colter continues to imbue Luke's charm. The only odd one out is, as some might imagine, Finn Jones' Iron Fist. To his credit, though, he seems more comfortable in the role here than he did for much of Iron Fist. The various supporting characters who appear do good jobs as well, particularly Elden Henson as Foggy, who seems to have matured a bit from Daredevil.\n\nThe real draw to the new cast, however, is Sigourney Weaver. She portrays Alexandra with an air of mystery, yet an immense amount of charisma. In her few scenes in the premiere, she comes across as likeable, intelligent and even sympathetic. She's already proven herself to be a great addition to the Netflix series and the wider Marvel Cinematic Universe.\n\nWhile the first episode doesn't have a ton of story progression, it is interesting to see where the characters are and the new dynamics they have with some of their friends and allies. It sets up the threat in an understated way, yet also plants enough crumbs to make you see how the four heroes will connect with each other.

(referred to as the Marvel Cinematic Universe) but feature a darker vibe and tackle more complex, adult themes that some may find unsuitable for younger viewers. Daredevil explores religion, physical disability, and the nature of crime and violence, Jessica Jones revolves around a survivor of sexual abuse, Luke Cage focuses on black culture and identity politics in America, while Iron Fist deals with abusive father figures, bullying, abuse, and mental illness.\n\nWhile Luke Cage and Jessica Jones met in the first season of Jessica Jones, The Defenders will be the first time all four street-level superheroes meet in person.

Just a lot of build-up.\n\nThat build-up starts out a little rough. \"Here's-what-everyone-is-up-to\" scenes in the opening episode are filled with cliche dialogue.\n\nBut by episode four, the series proves it's filled with action and necessary character development for these incredibly flawed heroes.\n\n\"Defenders\" unites the protagonists of Netflix's Marvel shows: \"Jessica Jones,\" \"Luke Cage,\" \"Daredevil,\" and \"Iron Fist.\"\n\nAs expected, the series starts with each Defender doing his or her own thing.\n\nThe story begins after the end of \"Fist,\" with Danny Rand hunting down members of the Hand. Rand -- who annoyingly insists that he is The Immortal Iron Fist in every conversation he has, despite no one really knowing what that is or questioning him -- is searching for members of the Hand, and finds that the biggest threat is in New York City.\n\nMeanwhile, Jessica Jones reluctantly investigates a case, and finds herself in need of a lawyer. And you'll never guess who shows up as her lawyer. It's Matt Murdoch: Daredevil.\n\nLuke Cage is mostly off doing his own thing, just coming out of prison. Cage and Danny Rand -- The Immortal Iron Fist, in case you forgot -- have a fight that mostly exists to prevent these heroes from realizing they're on the same side. At least for a little big longer.\n\nEventually, these two pairs pair together, somewhat accidentally.\n\nSigourney Weaver makes the otherwise boring Hand more captivating than it's been in \"Daredevil\" and \"Iron Fist.\" Weaver's character, Alexandra, who has an excellent and enviable cape collection, brings Elektra back from the dead, and turns her into her little warrior. This plot, and the reveal when Murdoch sees her for the first time, fall a bit flat, since her storyline was one of the weakest points in season two of \"Daredevil.\"\n\nBut what really separates \"Defenders\" from its blockbuster movie counterpart, \"The Avengers,\" is its subtlety. No matter how super these heroes get, the characters and the world they're in always feels grounded in reality. And that's a testament to the writing, especially of the main characters. The Defenders team does not have a Tony Stark, a Thor, or a Captain America. They're pretty much all Hawkeye -- but with personalities, flaws, and purpose. They're stubborn, they're scared, they're confused, and they're real. The super powers are just a sidebar.\n\nSo while it gets off to a slow start, \"Defenders\" is definitely worth your time, especially if you're already a fan of any of the standalone shows. Even if the action and story moving forward is a bit dull, these characters are worth exploring, especially when they're together.", "date": "2017-08-18", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television", "wgt": 100, "id": 111, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "wgt": 100, "id": 212, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying/Genres", "wgt": 100, "id": 713, "label": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying/Genres"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "type": "loc", "id": "218049"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New York"}, "type": "loc", "id": "218051"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "org", "score": 4, "id": "302687", "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "302838", "label": {"eng": "Television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "303648", "label": {"eng": "Academy Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "304357", "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Comics", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "304577", "label": {"eng": "Marvel Comics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_(arts)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "304816", "label": {"eng": "Character (arts)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superhero", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "304941", "label": {"eng": "Superhero"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockbuster_(entertainment)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "305271", "label": {"eng": "Blockbuster (entertainment)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Man", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "309419", "label": {"eng": "Iron Man"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thor_(Marvel_Comics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "311303", "label": {"eng": "Thor (Marvel Comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "313939", "label": {"eng": "Action film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigourney_Weaver", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "314952", "label": {"eng": "Sigourney Weaver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawkeye_(comics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "329008", "label": {"eng": "Hawkeye (comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_America", "type": "person", "score": 1, "id": "333570", "label": {"eng": "Captain America"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daredevil_(Marvel_Comics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "351103", "label": {"eng": "Daredevil (Marvel Comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ninja", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "354796", "label": {"eng": "Ninja"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defenders_(comics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "358975", "label": {"eng": "Defenders (comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Avengers_(2012_film)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "363641", "label": {"eng": "The Avengers (2012 film)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessica_Jones", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "364911", "label": {"eng": "Jessica Jones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luke_Cage", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "373788", "label": {"eng": "Luke Cage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daredevil_(film)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "386870", "label": {"eng": "Daredevil (film)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Fist_(comics)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "id": "431572", "label": {"eng": "Iron Fist (comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hand_(comics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "652996", "label": {"eng": "The Hand (comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Defenders_(1961_TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "676736", "label": {"eng": "The Defenders (1961 TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Immortal_Iron_Fist", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "1385940", "label": {"eng": "The Immortal Iron Fist"}}]}

This eight-episode miniseries brings the leads of Marvel's Netflix series together against a common foe, but first, it's catching viewers up on who these characters are, where their stories left off, and what kind of enemy they'll be fighting. This premiere episode sets the stage for the conflict to come, providing a crash course on this corner of the Marvel Cinematic Universe for any viewers who haven't watched the 65 episodes of the four series leading to this point.\n\nThere's another main hero in The Defenders, but Danny \"the Immortal Iron Fist\" Rand (Finn Jones) is largely in the background of this episode. The premiere opens with a sewer fight between Danny and a shadowy female assailant -- later revealed to be Elektra (Elodie Yung), resurrected after her death in Daredevil's second season -- and this sequence has characteristics that will be familiar to Iron Fist viewers, including nondescript production design, choppy editing that robs the action of its impact, and a performance from Jones that fails to capture the intensity of the situation.\n\nOf the four lead actors, Jones has the biggest challenge as he tries to internalize the fantastic elements of Danny's backstory. He has to make the audience believe that Danny overcame severe childhood trauma by being trained by monks in an ancient, hidden city, and in both Iron Fist and The Defenders, the reality of Danny's circumstances fails to come through in Jones's superficial performance. He'll play emotions like frustration, terror, and guilt, but these are always very broad, bordering on cartoonish. This could partially be the fault of the writing and S.J. Clarkson's direction, which generally doesn't strive for subtlety, but Colter, Cox, and Ritter are able to bring convincing nuance to their performances, grounding their characters in ways that Jones does not.\n\nJudging by how \"The H Word\" is divided among the four leads, it's safe to say that co-showrunners Douglas Petrie and Marco Ramirez, who wrote the episode, realize that Iron Fist is the least compelling of the four solo series. Danny and his colleague, Colleen Wing (Jessica Henwick), are sidelined for most of this episode, and after that initial fight, they only appear in two more scenes: the first is a recap of Danny's history and his mission to track down the Hand, the villainous organization trying to start a war in New York City; and the second has Danny and Colleen returning to New York City, just in time for the Hand to make their next big move.\n\nWhile Luke, Matt, and Jessica's stories explore their relationships with the communities they live in, Danny's story is entirely focused on the Hand, distancing him from his fellow heroes to the point where he feels like an afterthought. There's such a long gap between Danny and Colleen's airplane scenes that I forgot they were even part of the show. I could say that the script should be better balanced, but I don't actually want to spend more time with Danny. As the Netflix show that ended most recently, Iron Fist is also going to be the freshest in viewers' minds -- if they've watched it, that is -- so this episode can spend less time filling people in on what Danny and Colleen have been up to in the interim.\n\nIt's been more than a year since Matt and Jessica were onscreen, and almost a year since Luke's last appearance, so it makes sense that they would get the most attention in this premiere. The visuals of this episode change depending on the character, particularly with regard to color palette: Matt's scenes have strong red elements because he can't escape the devil inside him, Jessica's are a pale-blue that reinforces her chilly disposition, and Luke's have an aggressive amber filter that adds heat to the Harlem environment and closely ties him to his neighborhood thanks to his signature yellow T-shirt. (That T-shirt comes off when Luke reunites with Rosario Dawson's Claire Temple in a scene that reminds viewers these shows are a lot more liberal with sexual content than their big-screen cousins.)\n\nLuke and Jessica don't know anything about the Hand yet, but their plots have them stumbling into situations that will lead them to the Big Bad. Luke wants to find out who is using Harlem's youth as late-night couriers, and despite her initial reluctance, Jessica starts investigating a missing architect when she receives a phone call telling her not to pursue the case. There's something strange going on, and things only gets weirder when an earthquake hits New York City, promising even greater peril on the horizon. The premiere ends with Matt Murdock in his apartment taking in the sounds of a panicking city, and even though he's trying to leave his Daredevil past behind him, he can't ignore the swell of people crying out for help. There's no doubt he's about to leap back into action, but getting back into hero mode will cause even more trouble for Matt once he realizes that his ex-girlfriend is alive and working with the people who want to destroy his city.\n\nI've had major issues with the Hand as the major villain across Marvel's Netflix shows, largely because there's not much pathos behind a group of evil ninjas that has infiltrated corporations and governments around the world. The Hand needs more complexity to be a captivating antagonist in such a long, serialized story, and while Iron Fist took some steps to add more depth to the organization, the Hand was still lacking an emotional anchor that makes the audience understand its motivations and empathize with its members. Enter Sigourney Weaver. Her character goes unnamed in this first episode, but we know she's a powerful member of the Hand -- powerful enough to puts plans in action that aren't supposed to happen for months -- and we know that she's dying.\n\nWeaver's character is introduced visiting a hospital for an MRI, wearing a dramatic white coat like a suit of armor that she removes before her medical examination. (Costume designer Stephanie Maslansky gives Weaver some serious looks in this episode, and I love the regality of her wardrobe.) She exudes power and confidence in the company of others, even when she's being given test results that confirm her quickly impending death, but there's a deeper vulnerability that comes out when she is alone. The most powerful moment with this character is a single shot after she takes off her coat and jewelry and leans against a window for support. Clarkson frames the shot from the other side of the window, and even though Weaver is behind foggy glass, her exhaustion and desperation in this moment is crystal clear.\n\nA big strength of these shows is that they've created villains with more dimension than the bad guys in superhero movies. Characters like Daredevil's Wilson Fisk and Frank Castle, Jessica Jones's Kilgrave, and Luke Cage's Cottonmouth and Mariah Dillard were as interesting as the lead heroes, and those series benefited from this attention given to the inner workings of the antagonists. (Iron Fist didn't fare especially well on the villain front, although it did give Wai Ching Ho more to do as the intimidatingly calm Madame Gao, who appears in The Defenders.) With an iconic actress like Weaver in the lead villain role, The Defenders has the potential to deliver another riveting addition to this list, but it's too early to tell if her character will be given material that takes full advantage of her immense acting talent.", "date": "2017-08-18", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television", "wgt": 100, "id": 111, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television"},

If you loved the characters individually in their own series (even if there was one you were meh about), you'll love the team together when they actually meet. We were lucky enough to view the first four episodes, and here's what we thought.\n\nThe series starts off very slow as we see what has happened to each of them since their series finished - Luke Cage (Mike Colter) is fresh out of jail and mentoring the neighborhood kids; Jessica Jones (Krysten Ritter) is still doing her P.I. work and takes a case to find her client's missing husband; Matt Murdock aka Daredevil (Charlie Cox) has retired from crime-fighting and practicing law; Danny Rand aka Iron Fist (Finn Jones) along with Colleen (Jessica Henwick) are looking for the Hand.\n\nStrange things are happening in New York City, which all of them live in, and they end up meeting randomly trying to stop the same thing. But just who are they trying to stop? This is where Sigourney Weaver's Alexandria comes into play. Like all the other villains in the previous Netflix stories (sans Iron Fist), Alexandria has a deep backstory that allows you to understand and possibly even empathize with her situation. She is more than just someone with an evil plot. Weaver commands every scene she is in and proves herself to be even more dangerous than the previous baddies, including the fierce Kilgrave (David Tennant) and menacing Fisk (Vincent D'Onofrio).\n\nThe only characters who seem to have a flowing storyline are Jessica, who is actively searching for clues to find her client's husband, and Luke, who is trying to connect with the neighborhood kids to help them avoid trouble. Matt seems to not have any direction in the show, as he is having an internal struggle with himself to return to the vigilante justice. That and finding out that Elektra (Elodie Yung), one of the many women he loved, is still alive-ish.\n\nAs for Danny, there are still many moments where you eye-roll over Rand's entitlement on being Iron Fist and his \"qi\", but the series does poke fun at it with the other three mocking him for it. Even Stick (Scott Glenn) adds to the mocking by calling the Iron Fist a \"thundering dumbass.\" There is even a scene where Luke tells Danny to check his privilege. So you do feel a bit better about Iron Fist being the butt of jokes.\n\nThe best scenes are when the team is together fighting. There is a hint of Luke and Danny's budding friendship, like in the comics, as they tag team against their enemies. Matt and Jessica have their own non-romantic banter as she figures out his true identity, the Devil in Hell's Kitchen.\n\nBetween the four, there are plenty of action scenes that are well-coordinated, including giving Iron Fist fewer cuts for his fight scenes. Please note, the fight scenes are scattered throughout the series. There is a one-shot fight scene as we've seen in Daredevil, and it's pretty awesome. When they are all together thought, you do cheer!\n\nUnfortunately, if you were looking forward to seeing side characters like Foggy Nelson (Elden Henson), Hogarth (Carrie-Ann Moss), Misty Knight (Simone Missick), Trish (Rachael Taylor), Karen Page (Deborah Ann Woll), and Claire Temple (Rosario Dawson), prepare to be disappointed. Their roles are minor in the series, as the focus will be on the major four characters and the villains. Claire does bring together some of our heroes, but doesn't stay very long to be part of the action. Things may change when we see the rest of the series, as this was only the first four episodes.\n\nThe series does a great job establishing each character's individual scenes by adding their color scheme, including with the opening credits. When dealing with Murdock's storyline, red is the defining color in the scene. Cage is surrounded by spots of yellow, including some of the characters he interacts with. Jessica Jones has this blue-ish/purple tint in her scenes, and Rand is shown with spots of green. These color schemes allow the audience to know whose storylines are being followed, which was the intention from showrunner Marco Ramirez. When the four are together, the colors all fade in with each other.\n\nEven though The Defenders is slow to start, it is quite satisfying when they're finally a team. The banter and the fighting styles of each character just meshed so well with each other. With only eight episodes it may feel a bit scattered, but it doesn't take away from the entertainment value. Ramirez gives each character their due and it's a great watch.", "date": "2017-08-18", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television", "wgt": 100, "id": 111, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "wgt": 100, "id": 212, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying/Genres", "wgt": 100, "id": 713, "label": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying/Genres"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "type": "loc", "id": "218049"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "302687", "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Comics", "type": "org", "score": 4, "id": "304577", "label": {"eng": "Marvel Comics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigourney_Weaver", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "314952", "label": {"eng": "Sigourney Weaver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daredevil_(Marvel_Comics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "351103", "label": {"eng": "Daredevil (Marvel Comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defenders_(comics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "358975", "label": {"eng": "Defenders (comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krysten_Ritter", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "364912", "label": {"eng": "Krysten Ritter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luke_Cage", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "373788", "label": {"eng": "Luke Cage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Tennant", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "379719", "label": {"eng": "David Tennant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rachael_Taylor", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "394467", "label": {"eng": "Rachael Taylor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosario_Dawson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "409370", "label": {"eng": "Rosario Dawson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vincent_D'Onofrio", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "409376", "label": {"eng": "Vincent D'Onofrio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Fist_(comics)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "id": "431572", "label": {"eng": "Iron Fist (comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Glenn", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "465006", "label": {"eng": "Scott Glenn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elden_Henson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "504480", "label": {"eng": "Elden Henson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purple_Man", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "531012", "label": {"eng": "Purple Man"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misty_Knight", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "547406", "label": {"eng": "Misty Knight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Colter", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "555507", "label": {"eng": "Mike Colter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Cox", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "574287", "label": {"eng": "Charlie Cox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karen_Page", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "641253", "label": {"eng": "Karen Page"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foggy_Nelson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "641254", "label": {"eng": "Foggy Nelson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrie-Anne_Moss", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "648113", "label": {"eng": "Carrie-Anne Moss"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finn_Jones", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "650834", "label": {"eng": "Finn Jones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hand_(comics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "652996", "label": {"eng": "The Hand (comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deborah_Ann_Woll", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "661053", "label": {"eng": "Deborah Ann Woll"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessica_Henwick", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "749745", "label": {"eng": "Jessica Henwick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claire_Temple", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "1288996", "label": {"eng": "Claire Temple"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessica_Jones_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "1295284", "label": {"eng": "Jessica Jones (TV series)"}}]}

All eight episode of The Defenders should be live right now ready for you to watch. As is the case with all these comic adaptations, we've collected some reading material to help you get the most of what you see on screen. Naturally the best way to prepare is to watch Daredevil, Jessica Jones, Luke Cage, and Iron Fist, but if you need more here are some books you can buy.\n\nYou may notice that this list is devoid of any Defenders comics. That's because the Defenders in the series weren't actually members of the comic team. Except Luke Cage and Iron Fist for a brief time, but that lasted less than a year of real-world time. But the most recent volume is designed to relate to the TV series, so it does consist of Daredevil, Cage, Fist, and Jones. It's so recent that the first collected volume isn't available until 26th December. You can get digital versions for the Kindle, and on Comixology. Obviously start with issue 1.\n\nFrank Miller might have gone off the rails a bit in recent years, but back in the '80s and '90s he was one of the most revered names in comics. His work on Daredevil was a part of that, reinventing Matt Murdoch in a much darker way - which has stuck in the decades since. The Man Without Fear is a retooling of Daredevil's origin story, much of which was the inspiration for the TV-adaptation. It's widely considered to be one of the best Daredevil stories out there, and with good reason. [Buy it here]\n\nAnother Miller tale, focussing on Daredevil after his former lover Karen Page sells out his secret identity to get a drug fix. Armed with the knowledge that Matt Murdoch is Daredevil, the Kingpin makes it his mission to destroy everything holds dear. Daredevil descends into madness during the story, struggling to hold it together and rebuild his life. It also reveals what happens to Matt's mother. [Buy it here]\n\nMiller spent a good four years working on the ongoing Daredevil series, which reinvented the character and became one of the earliest (and best known) examples of Marvel's comics embracing the darkness in the comics industry. Miller reinvented many of the established characters, and even introduced a few biggies of his own: including Stick, Elektra, and the Hand. All three play a large role in the Daredevil TV series which Marvel has confirmed will continue with The Defenders. This is only book one of the series, so if you like it make sure to buy the rest. [Buy it here]\n\nMiller wasn't the only person to make their mark on Daredevil. Brian Michael Bendis helped to define the character in the modern era, with a pulp-fiction-esque drama that took full advantage of the Man Without Fear's range of characters and fondness for psychological drama. The best of this run, written by Bendis with art by Alex Maleev, has been collected into three volumes, and this is number one. [Buy it here]\n\nJessica Jones is a fairly new creation in the grand scheme of things, original debuting back in 2001 as the star of Brian Michael Bendis's Alias. Alias covers everything you need to know about who Jones is and where she came from - fighting crime as the hero Jewel, leaving it behind for life as a PI, and her encounters with the Purple Man. It can get pretty dark at times, and while it's not quite as dark as the Netflix show, it's certainly not for the faint of heart. [Buy it here]\n\nA follow-up to Alias, focussing on characters working on The Pulse a weekly section of the Daily Bugle that covers the life of superheroes. These include Ben Urich, J Jonah Jameson, Kat Farrell, Luke Cage, and Jessica Jones. Jones is the main character, acting as a special consultant to the paper, which helps break some important scoops in the Marvel universe. It also has a focus on Jones's relationship with Cage, and her eventual pregnancy. [Buy it here]\n\nBack in 2005 Scarlett Witch went completely looopy and killed a bunch of Avengers mainstays, and in the aftermath the indestructible Luke Cage ended up in charge of his own Avengers team. His pseudo-Avengers included most big-name heroes who weren't Avengers at the time, drafted to quell a riot as The Raft prison. That means Cage working alongside The Thing, Carol Danvers (as Ms marvel), Spider-Man, and Wolverine. This probably won't make it to TV or film screens, so enjoy it in lovely paper-picture form. [Buy it here]\n\nIf you're made of money, you can also buy the entire run as one 1,208-page hardcover omnibus.\n\nMarvel Masterworks: Luke Cage: Hero for Hire Volume 1, \u00a315/\u00a363\n\nThe first season of Luke Cage covered the origin of the Harlem-based hero, but you can read about it for yourself in Luke Cage's earliest books. It's slightly different in that the experiment is a bit different, and he doesn't immediately discard the yellow shirt/tiara comb. But long story short he was experimented on after being unjustly imprisoned, escaped, then set up the 'Hero for Hire' business so he could pay the bills while helping the people of Harlem. Obviously he's still resentful of how he was treated, and isn't above getting some revenge. [Buy it here]\n\nMarvel also released Avengers Origins: Luke Cage back in 2012, which tells most of the same story in a modern setting. It's not expensive, so it might be worth picking up as well.\n\nLuke Cage and Danny Rand have been very close friend for a long time, sharing more page-time together than some heroes get solo. The Defenders will feature the MCU versions of the characters meeting for the first time, so it's worth reading up on their history. IT began back in the '70s, when Marvel thrust the kung fu-powered hero into the ongoing Power Man series. The two worked well together as heroes for hire, and they've been teamed up ever since. [Buy it here]\n\nLuke Cage and Iron Fist abandoned their street-level heroics to join the Avengers, but this ongoing series has seen them going back to the basics as heroes for hire. That's how they are on Netflix, so it's a good place to pick things up if you're a total marvel newbie. It's not all drug dealers and petty thugs, but it's a good read - if you don't mind the 'unique' art style. [Pre-order it here]\n\nComics have a long and complicated history, with a (mostly) uninterrupted continuity, so it can be tough to know where to begin. Thankfully Marvel has these 'essential' collections for the long-lasting heroes, so new readers can get to grips with the history. The first volume of Essential Iron Fist covers Danny Rand's early years, including his debut on the pages of Marvel Premiere, his first solo series, and some of his early adventures with Luke Cage. [Buy it here]\n\nOne of the best known Iron Fist solo series, and is naturally well-regarded by fans. This series starts off with Danny returning to K'un L'un to fight in a tournament against the other immortal weapons, with each one representing one of the seven capital cities of heaven. Along the way he's forced to come to terms with the legacy of the Iron Fist, which hides more secrets than Danny could have ever imagined. If you only have to pick a single Iron Fist series to read, make sure it's this one. [Buy it here]\n\nOne of the most recent Iron Fist solo series, with Danny forced to face his origin and arrival in K'un L'un. It's a tale of betrayal and revenge, forcing 'the kid with the glowing fist' to deal with the consequences of his past and the actions that led to him earning the mantle, and power that came with it, in the first place.

The Netflix drama features Daredevil, Jessica Jones, Luke Cage and Iron Fist teaming up to take down a powerful villain. Marvel and Netflix came up with a smart way to bring them together, but not everything about the series is perfect.\n\nWhat Audiences Will Love\n\nThe Past: The show isn't ditching characters' important individual storylines from their own shows. Characters pick up right where they left off with supporting characters and references to what happened in their previous seasons. Luke (Mike Colter) is in jail, Jessica (Krysten Ritter) is still avoiding her phone (which has been ringing nonstop since Kilgrave's death), Matt (Charlie Cox) is trying not to be a hero and Danny (Finn Jones) is searching for answers about K'un Lun.\n\nThe Villain: The big bad that unites all of New York's street heroes has to be pretty fearsome. Sigourney Weaver can obviously do anything, and she gives Alexandra a certain amount of gravitas. She also makes her empathetic. You just might feel bad for her when she's introduced.\n\nThe Friends: The Marvel/Netflix shows have some great supporting characters, and they all get a moment to shine in the first episodes of \"The Defenders.\" Whether they are a best friend, a lover or something in between, the miniseries seems to acknowledge every important relationship.\n\n\"Marvel's The Defenders\" gives supporting characters like Colleen Wing (Jessica Henwick, left) and Claire Temple (Rosario Dawson) screen time. Photo: Netflix\n\nThe Humor: Many Marvel lovers have wondered just how these four extremely different characters will react to each other, and it's often just funny. \"The Defenders\" writers embrace the characters' differences and use them to create enjoyable banter.\n\nThe Look: As costume designer Stephanie Maslansky told International Business Times in the spring, the color palettes still play an important role. When we're in Harlem with Luke, we see yellows and oranges. When Jessica graces the screen, it's all blue and purple. The effect makes it feel more like a continuation of each individual show rather than a separate project. Director S.J. Clarkson also makes sure each world sounds the same. Expect plenty of hip-hop in Luke's scenes.\n\nWhat Audiences Won't Love\n\nThe Waiting: The action is always great on a Netflix show, but \"The Defenders\" takes a while setting up what's about to happen. While there are fights in the first few episodes, they are mostly short and unmemorable until the Defenders come together. Getting all the heroes just to meet takes a few episodes.\n\n\"Marvel's The Defenders\" takes just a little too long building up to the heroes getting together. Photo: Netflix\n\nIt isn't just the action that you're waiting for during the first few episodes of \"The Defenders.\" There's a lot of explaining about what's happening. Parts of it are necessary, but some of it is just to introduce viewers to the worlds of each Defender, just in case they skipped one of the four series. The rich world of the Defenders is worth exploring, but it takes just a bit too long to set up what's happening to unite our heroes. Luckily, most viewers are already invested in the characters, so it's not a huge problem.\n\nUltimately, the good outweighs the bad in \"The Defenders.\" It's a fun addition to the growing lineup of Marvel shows.

When Netflix and Marvel announced in 2013 that they'd be bringing the Marvel Cinematic Universe to the streaming service via four series that would culminate in a superpowered team-up known as The Defenders, I was open...and skeptical.\n\nOut of the four series, there's only been one real standout in Jessica Jones. I loved what Luke Cage was all about (and a number of those performances), and Jon Bernthal's Punisher high-key saved a scattered season of Daredevil. Your boy Danny Bland wasn't nearly enough of a hero for me to give a fuck about, and in the four years since Netflix and Marvel announced that there'd be a Defenders, I've wondered to myself if they should've had a redo on many of these series leading into the main event.\n\nWARNING: From this point on, there will spoilers to the first four episodes of The Defenders. Enter at your own risk af.\n\nAfter getting through the first four episodes of The Defenders, I can't front: there's a lot of stuff to enjoy. The shots of the squad together, kicking ninja ass, have been dope. Equally as intriguing is getting to see these heroes finally linking up, whether its Luke Cage and the Iron Fist getting into a fight while pursuing the same bad guy, or the quick reconnection of Luke and Jessica after how they ended things off in Jessica Jones. That said, the best part of the series is without a doubt Krysten Ritter's Jessica Jones, who has zero fucks to give and is ultimately just trying to live.\n\nOne of the biggest issues is the idea of wanting to be a hero versus needing to be the hero. Luke Cage isn't worrying about money; he's trying to put on for Harlem. Matt Murdock doesn't even want to be Daredevil...until it's time to be Daredevil, then he's jacking Jessica's scarf and being the street vigilante he wants to be (and repent for). Danny Rand's trying to stop The Hand on some By Any Means Necessary shit, but after seeing season one, I can't find an iota of a care for him or his mission. Jessica Jones? She's just trying to work her case until she opens up and realizes that these are the only people who truly understand her. AKA she has, like, feelings outside of being a badass.\n\nIt's funny; Jessica's powers in the comics and in Jessica Jones are almost secondary to her work as an investigator, which helps round her character out. Sure, she could just jump extremely high or punch a hole through that door, but hearing her put on a faux voice and con information out of people is way cooler than \"me hit you, you fall down\" action sequences (although that one hallway fight is dope). Hell, one of the best scenes in the four episodes I've seen is of Jessica getting her research on, and no it's not just because they included a shot of her in those jeans that feels like it was made for me (although you'd have to convince me that it wasn't totally made for me).\n\nPOST CONTINUES BELOW\n\nThat's not to say that I don't appreciate other things about The Defenders. Sigourney Weaver's playing the hell out of Alexandra, a mysterious addition to The Hand who is as sophisticated as she is dangerous. It's also dope to see Simone Missick's Misty Knight, although I hope that the later half ups the Simone quotient more than the former. And seeing Luke Cage do any heavy lifting is kinda dope. Not to mention that most of the characters (especially Jessica) waste no time shitting on Danny Rand if they can, which is either a) Marvel knowing that people hated on Danny in season one or b) really odd on Marvel's part, creating a hero that isn't cool and forever gets hated on.\n\nIt's been an interesting two years since the first season of Jessica Jones, and if one thing's for certain, Jessica's sarcasm and lack of fucks being given is truly missed in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The thing is, she left off in a truly troubled point in her life. She'd killed the person who made her life a living hell, and while she definitely decided to pick up the pieces of her life and get back to her work, recovering from that trauma isn't as easy as flipping a light switch for anyone. I want more of that and less of \"bulletproof guy can now be shot\" or \"quirky rich guy reclaims his fortune.\" And with talk of David Tennant returning in some form or fashion in Jessica Jones season two, I'm way more anxious to see that then the Avengers-lite of Netflix, no shade.\n\nUltimately, The Defenders was supposed to be the culmination of years of groundwork being laid during these Marvel series. What the series ended up being a huge tease; all I want right now (aside from The Punisher) is season two of Jessica Jones. It could be worse; I could totally hate watching the show (but I wish I was watching another one).", "date": "2017-08-18", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television", "wgt": 100, "id": 111, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "wgt": 100, "id": 212, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "wgt": 100, "id": 541, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages"}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "302687", "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Comics", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "304577", "label": {"eng": "Marvel Comics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "305834", "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vigilante", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "308262", "label": {"eng": "Vigilante"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "313939", "label": {"eng": "Action film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigourney_Weaver", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "314952", "label": {"eng": "Sigourney Weaver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punisher", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "342245", "label": {"eng": "Punisher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "349437", "label": {"eng": "Marvel Cinematic Universe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daredevil_(Marvel_Comics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "351103", "label": {"eng": "Daredevil (Marvel Comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ninja", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "354796", "label": {"eng": "Ninja"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defenders_(comics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "358975", "label": {"eng": "Defenders (comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessica_Jones", "type": "person", "score": 5, "id": "364911", "label": {"eng": "Jessica Jones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krysten_Ritter", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "364912", "label": {"eng": "Krysten Ritter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luke_Cage", "type": "person", "score": 5, "id": "373788", "label": {"eng": "Luke Cage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Tennant", "type": "person", "score": 1, "id": "379719", "label": {"eng": "David Tennant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daredevil_(film)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "386870", "label": {"eng": "Daredevil (film)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Fist_(comics)", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "431572", "label": {"eng": "Iron Fist (comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Bernthal", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "468287", "label": {"eng": "Jon Bernthal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misty_Knight", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "547406", "label": {"eng": "Misty Knight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hand_(comics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "652996", "label": {"eng": "The Hand (comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Defenders_(1961_TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "676736", "label": {"eng": "The Defenders (1961 TV series)"}}]}

He gave us some insight on his character heading into the team-up show and also addressed a few sticking points about Danny Rand.\n\nDefenders is set about three months after the events of Iron Fist, and we first meet Danny in Cambodia where he's tracking down a member of the Hand. As you'll remember from the end of Iron Fist Season 1 (spoilers!), when Danny returned home to K'un L'un, the city had disappeared and some of his fellow monks were dead in the snow, the result of an assumed Hand attack.\n\n\"At the end of Iron Fist, Danny feels very guilty that he left his responsibilities, he ****ed up basically,\" Jones said. \"He realized how he allowed his own emotions and his own inner recklessness to get in the way of his responsibility and the result was the loss of his home and somewhere where he grew up for 15 years. He's being driven by guilt to take down the Hand, so we're seeing a much more purposeful and driven Danny at the beginning of Defenders.\"\n\nJones had previously revealed that the production schedule of Iron Fist Season 1 was so tight that he would often have to learn the fight choreography just before filming. Viewers noticed this, commenting how the fight scenes weren't on the level they'd expect from one of Marvel's premiere martial arts characters, but Jones asserts that things are much different in Defenders.\n\n\"By the time of Defenders, I had been working on the character and training for about seven months, on and off, so by Defenders I was a lot more well-trained than at the beginning of Iron Fist because I had been doing it for so long. The good thing about Defenders, because it was an ensemble piece I wasn't needed every single second of the day to shoot, which is often the case when you're leading your own individual show. At the beginning of [Defenders] when we're all separated, there was definitely days in the week where I didn't have to shoot. Because of that, I went in and got a chance to rehearse, spend days on choreography before we actually shot. But then as we all came together and our schedules became a lot tighter because of the shooting demands, there was often times, especially towards the end of the show where we were picking up choreography on the day of shooting. That's kind of a regular thing, that's just television scheduling. Unfortunately, it's just something we have to get used to,\" Jones said.\n\nThe combination of having more time to train and working with a different production crew than Iron Fist has Jones optimistic about how Danny will appear as an improved fighter in Defenders.\n\n\"I think the choreography is a lot slicker and I think the way it's been shot and edited is definitely a lot more cohesive [in Defenders]. I also think, just because I went from shooting six months of Iron Fist to immediately going on to shoot Defenders, just by nature of having all of that practice leading up to Defenders, the choreography felt a lot more grounded. It was a different choreography team and the way it was shot was a little bit different as well, and I think that definitely helped sell the fight scenes a lot better. And on top of that, I was more used to picking up choreography and the fluidity of the movements.\"\n\nJones also used his time on the phone with us to clear up what he sees as a common misconception about how viewers see Danny.\n\n\"It's a common misconception that Danny was 'the Chosen One' and he came from money. I know there's a lot of talk about Danny being very privileged and this and that, but I do think it's a common misconception that people are just seeing the character in very broad strokes. Danny, yes he grew up in a very wealthy family, but at 10 years old he was ripped out of an airplane, he lost both of his parents, and he had to grow up in a very desolate environment for 15 years. He had to train and work super hard to become the Iron Fist. It was never about him being 'the Chosen One.' He definitely didn't live a life of privilege from 10 years-old onward. He actually lived a very difficult life,\" Jones explained.\n\nDefenders will see Danny fight evil alongside Daredevil, Jessica Jones, and Luke Cage, and Jones says the experience of meeting them will have a marked change on his character.\n\n\"Danny it definitely influenced by these three characters. Up until the end of Iron Fist, Danny didn't even know what a superhero was. He had these responsibilities and he had this power, but he didn't know how to handle it. He was so caught up in his own trauma and his own grief, he kind of let the power run away from him for a little bit, the responsibility run away from him a bit. He wasn't well-equipped to handle it, which is why he ran away from K'un L'un, foolishly, and he definitely regrets that now,\" Jones said. \"Meeting these three heroes, they're a little bit older, they're probably about six or seven years older than him, and they're people with abilities and problems that still manage to keep their **** together and live a responsible and purposeful life. Danny is really in admiration of that, especially in admiration of Daredevil. He sees someone who is slightly tortured, who has difficulties, who hasn't had the perfect life, but yet he can use these abilities in a way which is responsible and can help the community and help other people. Danny sees these other three people and he's really inspired by what they are able to achieve, so it's like Danny meeting a bunch of older brothers and sister for the first time, and they're keeping him in check a little bit, and they give him a self-realization that he can do that as well.\"\n\nComic fans know that Iron Fist teams up with Luke Cage to form the superhero company Heroes for Hire, and Finn confirms that Defenders will indeed plant the seeds for it.\n\n\"What we're seeing is the birth of this iconic comic book bromance come to life on screen for the first time and it's super exciting,\" Jones said. \"I remember when I read the script, their scenes really stood out to me because [showrunner Marco Ramirez] did such a good job writing the scenes. It didn't feel cheesy or on the nose, it actually felt really relevant. It would have been so easy to just set it up and suddenly they're best buds from the get-go, but what I really admired about the way that they first meet is they don't see eye-to-eye. They come from very different backgrounds and there's conflict between them. It makes a really relevant relationship between the two. I'm super excited about this relationship, not only because it's a lot of fun but there's room for a lot of really interesting conversation along the way.\"\n\nThe Defenders debuts on Netflix on August 18.

And this series premiere, slow as its pace may be, largely accomplishes that. \"The H Word\" basically functions as a 50-minute long \"Where Are They Now\" segment that somewhat stylishly catches us up with our favorite street-level Don't-Call-Us-Heroes (or Legends), some of whom we haven't checked in with since at least 2015. Daredevil, Jessica Jones, Luke Cage, and Iron Fist have all been through a lot, and The Defenders' premiere asks if they're capable of moving forward and becoming the heroes they need to be.\n\nWe begin in Phnom Penh, Cambodia. The camera pans down from people walking on the street to the sewers below, where a vicious fight to death is occurring. This simple transition's message is pretty clear: As the rest of the world goes along with its business, a war is being waged in the shadows. This latest bout is between the newly resurrected Hand representative Elektra (Elodie Yung) and some unknown opponent, and it looks better than almost anything in Iron Fist. Oh speaking of the annoying one, Danny Rand (Finn Jones) interrupts the brawl and tries to save the nameless man, but he fails, and Elektra fatally wounds the man before she escapes. However, this mission wasn't a complete failure. With his dying breath, the man, who knows Danny is the Iron Fist, gives Danny and Colleen Wing (Jessica Henwick) some important information: \"The war you're fighting...is not here. It's in New York City.\"\n\nAnd cue the main title sequence, which screams, \"Guys, New York is really a character in this show.\" And from there, it's time to check in with the other Defenders.\n\nThis shouldn't come as a surprise, but the first shot of Jessica Jones (Krysten Ritter) shows her being awakened by a bartender, who orders her to leave his establishment because it's daytime. Our favorite self-destructive private investigator ventures forth into the day, where she meets up with her friend Trish (Rachael Taylor), who tells her that she has received more interview requests. Jessica is still recovering from her traumatic encounter with Kilgrave, so she has no interest in answering those. Some people may view her as a hero, but she doesn't.\n\nThe last time we saw Luke Cage (Mike Colter), he was being transported back to prison to finish off his sentence, but it appears as though the prison stint doesn't last too long. When we meet up with him in the premiere (as Mos Def's \"Sunshine\" plays), he's in the process of being released thanks to some legal maneuvering by Foggy Nelson (Elden Henson), who is now working for Hogarth. Foggy tells Luke to call him if he needs help starting over, but Luke turns him down. \"I'm not starting over. I'm moving forward,\" he says (#RIPPops). For the moment, \"moving forward\" means \"getting coffee with Claire Temple.\" And by \"coffee,\" I mean \"table-flipping sex.\" (It definitely wasn't quiet uptown.)\n\nWhereas Jessica's scenes in the episode are tinged with blue, Luke's are bathed in warm, yellow light and feature hip-hop music, which makes them standout from the rest and lends the premiere some of Luke Cage's swagger. However, the warmth of Luke's scenes also points out what distinguishes him from his fellow Defenders: He's the most mature and well-adjusted one in the group. While Jessica, Danny -- who is suffering from guilt-induced nightmares -- and retired crime-fighter Matt Murdoch (Charlie Cox) -- who is still grieving Elektra's death -- are struggling to move forward, Luke is optimistic about the future. He immediately jumps at the opportunity to help people when Detective Misty Knight (Simone Missick) updates him on the state of Harlem: Several young boys, who started doing some shady courier work, have all turned up dead. At Misty's urging, Luke decides to use his status as Harlem's hero to reach out to the brother of a recent victim.

Jessica is pretty much doing what she always does, drinking herself into unconsciousness. But then she is approached by a woman worried about her husband, and the private investigator reluctantly realizes this is not just another case of a cheating spouse.\n\nMeanwhile, across the world, Iron Fist -- also known as billionaire Danny Rand -- finds another lead to The Hand, the malevolent global crime organization that has its fingers into everything, including Hell's Kitchen, as Matt can attest.\n\nHell's Kitchen is soon rocked, literally, by a pair of faces -- one, Alexandra (Sigourney Weaver, \"Aliens\"), a powerful woman whose quest for immortality leads back to one of our heroes, and an assassin familiar to Netflix Marvel fans now fighting as the Black Sky. (I'm being vague on Netflix's request.)\n\n\"Defenders\" rises and falls on what its cast can bring to the mix. The less Finn Jones is onscreen, the better. He might be the most miscast actor in any series ever. Colter brings Luke's look and nothing else. Now Ritter and Cox, on the other hand, I could binge on a Jones/Murdock spinoff all weekend long.\n\n\"You grab me again like that, I'll punch you so hard, you'll see,\" she snaps at the blind attorney. The two spark off each other.\n\nWeaver is slinky, smart and just scary enough. Scott Glenn as Matt's grumpy mentor Stick -- and a key figure here in the war against The Hand -- teeters on camp.\n\nIt seems as if it takes the four leads forever to meet -- but it comes at a key moment, and a brawl erupts against a legion of baddies.\n\nIt should be a defining moment for the show, but it just captures the limits of the budget. It's sloppily edited and does a poor job of hiding an obvious stunt double.\n\nIn another action sequence, I wasn't even sure who was fighting whom and how many people were involved.\n\nLuke complains at one point, \"I'm not looking for any super-friends.\"\n\nViewers are, though, and \"Defenders\" gets a thumbs-down.", "date": "2017-08-18", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television", "wgt": 100, "id": 111, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100, "id": 126, "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "wgt": 100, "id": 164, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "wgt": 100, "id": 212, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "wgt": 100, "id": 449, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Prevention", "wgt": 100, "id": 459, "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Prevention"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Textiles", "wgt": 100, "id": 1561, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Textiles"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hell's Kitchen"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hell's_Kitchen,_Manhattan", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hell's Kitchen"}, "type": "loc", "id": "217604"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "302687", "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "304357", "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "305834", "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avengers_(comics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "307118", "label": {"eng": "Avengers (comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Universe", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "311297", "label": {"eng": "Marvel Universe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigourney_Weaver", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "314952", "label": {"eng": "Sigourney Weaver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_investigator", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "315546", "label": {"eng": "Private investigator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratosphere", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "331487", "label": {"eng": "Stratosphere"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daredevil_(Marvel_Comics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "351103", "label": {"eng": "Daredevil (Marvel Comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defenders_(comics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "358975", "label": {"eng": "Defenders (comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessica_Jones", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "364911", "label": {"eng": "Jessica Jones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krysten_Ritter", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "364912", "label": {"eng": "Krysten Ritter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luke_Cage", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "373788", "label": {"eng": "Luke Cage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosario_Dawson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "409370", "label": {"eng": "Rosario Dawson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Fist_(comics)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "id": "431572", "label": {"eng": "Iron Fist (comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Glenn", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "465006", "label": {"eng": "Scott Glenn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elden_Henson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "504480", "label": {"eng": "Elden Henson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Colter", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "555507", "label": {"eng": "Mike Colter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Cox", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "574287", "label": {"eng": "Charlie Cox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finn_Jones", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "650834", "label": {"eng": "Finn Jones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hand_(comics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "652996", "label": {"eng": "The Hand (comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deborah_Ann_Woll", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "661053", "label": {"eng": "Deborah Ann Woll"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Defenders_(miniseries)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "1304371", "label": {"eng": "The Defenders (miniseries)"}}]}

The Hand is shaping up as a formidable threat, but even if it takes time for the heroes to realize there's strength in numbers, we'll assume that's coming.\n\nFor some more or less spoiler-free previews of each episode, Netflix always drops a brief synopsis right when it releases a series at 3:00 a.m. Eastern time. We've compiled all of them here for you, and we're using this as a hub page too, so you can come back and find our recaps linked here once we get them done.\n\nMatt Murdock, Jessica Jones, Luke Cage and Danny Rand investigate criminals and fight injustice, unaware that their paths are about to cross.\n\nAs a new conspiracy takes shape, Matt finds old habits are hard to break, Jessica gets in over her head, Luke tracks a lead, and Danny meets his match.\n\nElektra's secrets are revealed.

But finally comic book fans now have the chance to see the next big superhero team-up, as The Defenders come together for their own ensemble show on Netflix.\n\nFollowing on from their standalone outings, Jessica Jones, Daredevil, Luke Cage and Iron Fist have partnered up to save New York.\n\nIt's a diverse cast of characters, plucked from shows that were already doing things differently.\n\nThere's Jessica Jones, the misanthropic female PI; Daredevil, a blind lawyer who fights crime at night; and Luke Cage, a black vigilante out to clean up the disenfranchised neighbourhoods.\n\nThen there's Iron Fist.\n\nFist's standalone series was easily the weakest of the four, and the unlikeable brat gave Marvel its first real dud on the small-screen.\n\nHe's back in The Defenders too. But while the show around him is miles better than his own solo effort, the character is the weak link in this super-team.\n\nThreadbare cardigans among the punch-ups\n\nAmong the throng of well-rounded heroes that make up The Defenders, Danny Rand's shortcomings are only amplified.\n\nFinn Jones does an admirable job of trying to make him watchable.\n\nBut the character has taken on a grating subtext; like a gap year student who returns from the Far East with a new-found, zen understanding of the universe.\n\nAnd a black belt in every martial art going.\n\nAs he reclines in his threadbare cardigans - a garish, symbolic dragon tattoo emblazoned across his chest - it's hard not to feel the same ire you felt when Sebastian returned from Thailand having really 'found himself'.\n\nThankfully, the series that surrounds him is strong.\n\nThe other three heroes all have their own quirks and foibles.\n\nJones swigs booze while lackadaisically taking on new cases. Daredevil jerks convincingly as his super-sensitive ears pick up distress calls from afar.\n\nAnd Cage is soulful and intelligent in a way a lot of superheros aren't.\n\nJust don't expect a recap to get you up to speed.\n\nLosing the plot?\n\nWe join our heroes as they contemplate the fall-out of their establishing shows.\n\nCage is readjusting to life outside of prison, Jones is attempting to distance herself from her private investigating venture, while Daredevil is back to his daily courthouse job having hung up the spandex.\n\nIf you haven't been watching Netflix's Marvel output up to now, The Defenders turns into a slightly surreal experience.\n\nThere's talk of \"The Hand's\" threat to New York (they're a shadowy organisation that first showed up in Daredevil), and flashbacks to the horrors of series past manifesting themselves as dreamlike hallucinations.\n\nThe show has a rather fractured structure too, darting between its ensemble cast with three-minute 'scenes' that amount to little more than a conversation over some swelling music.\n\nAs the music builds to a crescendo, you know the next cut is coming, and sure enough - after a poignant line or reveal - we switch to another character.\n\nSticking with it\n\nIt's a formula that gives the first couple of episodes a rather slapdash feel, as if the producers are trying to cram as much as possible into a 50-minute run-time.\n\nThat should ease as the heroes' paths slowly come together, of course, but you may have to stick with it. In the episodes made available to review, there's no real physical interaction between the leads just yet.\n\nAction too, is used sparingly; but the fights we do get are fairly satisfying.\n\nThe Defenders looks to be a neat team-up of Netflix and Marvel's outings to date, and should close the book nicely on this chapter.\n\nThat'll be a relief to many fans after the fumbled attempt that was Iron Fist. Although that character remains the most disappointing thing about this comic book collaboration.\n\nMarvel's The Defenders is available to stream in full on Netflix now\n\nMore Netflix from i:\n\nNetflix's first purchase is this Scottish comic book firm\n\nIron Fist on Netflix: unlikable rich kid is Marvel's first superhero flop\n\nI was making a film about doping in cycling - then I uncovered the Russian scandal\n\nWet Hot American Summer: the 'amazingly fun but amazingly difficult' making of Ten Years Later", "date": "2017-08-18", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television", "wgt": 100, "id": 111, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "wgt": 100, "id": 212, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Comics", "wgt": 100, "id": 679, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Comics"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Comics/Retailers", "wgt": 100, "id": 680, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Comics/Retailers"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Kingdom of Thailand"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thailand", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kingdom of Thailand"}, "type": "loc", "id": "218"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "302636", "label": {"eng": "Music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "org", "score": 4, "id": "302687", "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "302838", "label": {"eng": "Television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "304357", "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Comics", "type": "org", "score": 4, "id": "304577", "label": {"eng": "Marvel Comics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superhero", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "304941", "label": {"eng": "Superhero"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comic_book", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "305280", "label": {"eng": "Comic book"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martial_arts", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "311156", "label": {"eng": "Martial arts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daredevil_(Marvel_Comics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "351103", "label": {"eng": "Daredevil (Marvel Comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessica_Jones", "type": "person", "score": 5, "id": "364911", "label": {"eng": "Jessica Jones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luke_Cage", "type": "person", "score": 5, "id": "373788", "label": {"eng": "Luke Cage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Fist_(comics)", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "431572", "label": {"eng": "Iron Fist (comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finn_Jones", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "650834", "label": {"eng": "Finn Jones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hand_(comics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "652996", "label": {"eng": "The Hand (comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Defenders_(1961_TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "676736", "label": {"eng": "The Defenders (1961 TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Defenders_(miniseries)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "1304371", "label": {"eng": "The Defenders (miniseries)"}}]}

The four heroes of New York City will finally team up in The Defenders and fans are hoping the new Netflix series will also solve some Marvel mysteries. What is the purpose of the massive hole Matt Murdock and Elektra Natchios discovered in Daredevil Season 2? Why is a secret organization making super soldiers in Jessica Jones? Is Danny Rand's mother still alive in Iron Fist?\n\nFans who have been following the Marvel shows on Netflix would already notice that they are all somehow connected to The Defenders. The Hand, which is set to be the main villain in the series, has been introduced in Daredevil before playing a large role in Iron Fist. In addition to that, there are speculations that IGH from Jessica Jones might be operating directly under the Chaste's primary nemesis. So does this mean that certain plot holes will finally get revisited and solved this August?\n\nOne of the more frustrating surprises in Daredevil Season 2 has been the discovery of a massive hole in the middle of New York. Although Matt Murdock can be forgiven for forgetting about the literal plot hole in favor of saving Elektra Natchios, fans couldn't get past the fact that it was neglected in the succeeding episodes. Luckily, it looks like Daredevil will be leading his new friends back to his discovery in The Defenders. The show's final trailer seems to show the heroes fighting off baddies in the digging site.\n\nThe main villain of Jessica Jones may have been David Tennant's Kilgrave but people were also wary of the mysterious group that created Will Simpson. There are speculations that IGH might be connected to The Hand, and the connection could be revealed in The Defenders. Some even believe that Sigourney Weaver's Alexandra might be the key link between the two organizations and the possible survival of Danny Rand's mother.\n\nThe identity of Sigourney Weaver's villain is still cloaked in mystery although there have been theories as to who she really is.

For those who have stuck with Daredevil, Jessica Jones, Luke Cage, and Iron Fist there are plenty of hints and nods in this new series that serve as fun rewards. The Marvel easter eggs in The Defenders harken back to the origin stories, the original comics, and the Marvel Cinematic Universe. There are spoilers for The Defenders Season 1 below, so hang up your cape and sit back down on the couch if you haven't finished the episodes yet. That said, the references are broken down below by episode, so scrolling with caution is an option if you want to read along.\n\nUnfortunately, there is still no mention of Peter Parker -- though I suppose the end of Spider-Man: Homecoming might explain why the New York native might be uninvolved. Plus, anyone who lives in the area knows that NYC public transportation has been a disaster this summer, and that might make getting to and from Queens a hassle.\n\nAs early reviews warned, the four heroes do not team up immediately. Jessica Jones, Danny Rand, Matt Murdock, and Luke Cage are reestablished at the beginning of The Defenders, and then one-on-one interactions build to the first group fight. Those early meetings are a highlight of the first few episodes, as they allow for more character development.\n\nAs for references that only the most savvy Marvel fans can catch, here are all the Easter Eggs you can spot in the new series:\n\nIn the very first moments of the new series, Danny and Colleen fight a woman whose identity is hidden at first -- but turns out to be a newly resurrected Elektra.\n\nWhen Luke Cage comes home from Seagate, characters from his world like Bobby Fish and Candace Miller are mentioned. Two characters from previous series, Marci and Turk, make an appearance in Episode 2. Luke questions Turk while looking for someone connected to both crime in Harlem and The Hand. Meanwhile Marci (of Daredevil) is still with Foggy, which is delightful to hear.\n\nAfter what appears to be an earthquake, someone calls in to Trish's radio show and says that he worries it was \"the Incident\" again. He's talking about the Chitauri invasion from The Avengers. Do you think everyone thinks that aliens attacked the Staten Island Ferry during the events of Spider-Man: Homecoming as well?\n\nThe ball really starts rolling as our heroes start meeting in the next two episodes. \"Let me know when they fit you for a costume,\" chaffs Jessica. Even Luke sarcastically refers to the group as \"superfriends\" -- which would be a DC reference rather than a Marvel reference, but still funny.\n\nThe best Easter Egg comes in the form of the main man himself. While Jessica is pursuing Matt in Manhattan, Stan Lee's face can be seen on a Link NYC kiosk advertisement. Those are our new phone booths, essentially, if you haven't been to New York in a few years.\n\nNot only does Elektra don something that resembles her comic book costume, but she is referred to again as a/the Black Sky.\n\nWhen the group first meets, it's at a company called Midland Circle, which has been mentioned before on Iron Fist and Daredevil. They are affiliated with both The Hand and Roxxon Oil, another organization that lurks throughout the MCU as well.", "date": "2017-08-18", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television", "wgt": 100, "id": 111, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "wgt": 100, "id": 212, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Comics", "wgt": 100, "id": 679, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Comics"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Comics/Retailers", "wgt": 100, "id": 680, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Comics/Retailers"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Harlem"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harlem", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Harlem"}, "type": "loc", "id": "217579"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "type": "loc", "id": "217872"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "type": "loc", "id": "218049"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York"}, "type": "loc", "id": "218051"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Queens County"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queens", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Queens County"}, "type": "loc", "id": "218315"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "org", "score": 4, "id": "302687", "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stan_Lee", "type": "person", "score": 1, "id": "304575", "label": {"eng": "Stan Lee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Comics", "type": "org", "score": 4, "id": "304577", "label": {"eng": "Marvel Comics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easter", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "306267", "label": {"eng": "Easter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avengers_(comics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "307118", "label": {"eng": "Avengers (comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider-Man", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "309417", "label": {"eng": "Spider-Man"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Origin_story", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "313388", "label": {"eng": "Origin story"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easter_egg_(media)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "340678", "label": {"eng": "Easter egg (media)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "349437", "label": {"eng": "Marvel Cinematic Universe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daredevil_(Marvel_Comics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "351103", "label": {"eng": "Daredevil (Marvel Comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessica_Jones", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "364911", "label": {"eng": "Jessica Jones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staten_Island_Ferry", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "365952", "label": {"eng": "Staten Island Ferry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luke_Cage", "type": "person", "score": 5, "id": "373788", "label": {"eng": "Luke Cage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Fist_(comics)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "431572", "label": {"eng": "Iron Fist (comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bobby_Fish", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "578633", "label": {"eng": "Bobby Fish"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chitauri", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "616067", "label": {"eng": "Chitauri"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elektra_(comics)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "641252", "label": {"eng": "Elektra (comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hand_(comics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "652996", "label": {"eng": "The Hand (comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Defenders_(1961_TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "676736", "label": {"eng": "The Defenders (1961 TV series)"}}]}

For anyone who needs a reminder of what the heck these characters have been doing, or maybe skipped Iron Fist for relatively obvious reasons, here's a video crash course.\n\nFirst, we've got Jessica Jones, the no-bullshit super heroine who spent the first season of her show overcoming her traumatic past. Her story may not involve the Hand, the big bad of The Defenders, but it's gone down as one of the most impactful shows of the series so far.\n\nLuke Cage, the famous Hero of Harlem, is currently behind bars after his secret identity and previous conviction were uncovered. But if Foggy's involvement is any indication, he won't be in there for long.\n\nMatt Murdock has hung up his Daredevil uniform and settled back into a life of helping those in need legally. But with Elektra being brought back from the dead to be the Hand's chosen one, he's going to have to put on the mask once again. Also, when's Daredevil going to explain that damn hole in the ground?\n\nAnd finally, there's the Iron Fist... who keeps having to tell everyone he's the Iron Fist. He abandoned his mission at K'un Lun to go run his family business, leading to tons of people being murdered.

So, while on the big screen Avengers assemble and Justice forms a league, on the smaller screen Marvel's street-level heroes strike up a long-promised alliance in The Defenders (Netflix, streaming from Friday).\n\nThis multi-pack combination consists of Daredevil, the blind vigilante of Hell's Kitchen; Jessica Jones, a private detective whose near-invincibility may be the only thing shielding her from the consequences of some truly heroic drinking; the unbreakable Harlem protector Luke Cage; and finally some earnest rich kid who won't stop calling himself \"the immortal Iron Fist, weapon of K'un Lun\".\n\nThat they all come together, over the space of three plodding episodes, to take on a common enemy who is somehow not Iron Fist may confuse newcomers, but Marvel has never been especially good at drawing persuasive villains.\n\nFor the new series, the nemesis is Sigourney Weaver, playing the obscenely rich CEO of a shadowy corporation, and a generous benefactor to the arts, named Alexandra. It's the latter quality, I suspect, that marks her out as unnaturally abhorrent, more than her involvement with an ancient ninja terror network that dabbles in the occult. Once you see her enjoy a private Brahms recital from the New York Philharmonic, you know she's rotten to the core.\n\nAlexandra is determined to destroy New York City, a little like Kim Jong-un, or, for that matter, Donald Trump, and the Defenders, who all seemed to have bought at the right time, are in some position to defend it. They themselves have nothing much to lose, however, unburdened by characterisation, personality or much decent dialogue. Jessica Jones, the supercream of the supercrop, is underused over the first four episodes; Iron Fist, the super-runt of the superlitter, is gratefully muted and spared. Narratively, a tormented Daredevil and a pretty sanguine Luke Cage are both in something of a rut.\n\nVisually, they belong to different shows, Daredevil enveloped in burning red, Jessica in sharper light, Luke in a nostalgic summer flicker and Iron Fist frowning over oriental flutes and stupid declarations (\"We got there just in time to watch him die!\"). For his part, Luke Cage hits the nail on the head when he sighs, during Iron Fist's self-exposition, \"I don't know how much more of this I can take.\" Luke has the right idea.

I got a phone call from Jeph Loeb (exec VP and head of television at Marvel) before we showed up for the reveal at Comic Con in New York .\n\n\"That morning he called me and said 'Just so you know, there is going to be the four of you on stage and one other person and it will be Sigourney Weaver' and I was like 'Why? Why is she going to be on stage with us? Is she moderating?'\n\n\"He was like 'No, she's going to be in the show' so the first time I met her we were already on stage and she was called out and so I was like 'Hi' in front of 5,000 people.\n\n\"For an actor to meet someone like Sigourney Weaver is a big deal so I had an impulse and luckily nobody handed me the mic and I didn't get to do this but i had the impulse to say 'in Hell's Kitchen no-one hears you scream' which i thought would have been fun and cool.\n\n\"But it could have been offensive, I don't know.\"\n\nThe Defenders will continue the narrative timeline of all the Marvel shows on Netflix and showrunner Marco Ramirez said keeping the stories straight was a huge task.\n\nHe said: \"We had charts like mad people.

That was the beginning.\"\n\nHe continued: \"When we started Defenders, the Iron Fist writers' room had just started so when we asked what happens in episode 13 they didn't know.\n\n\"We all had to play ball at the same time and figure out that is where it ends so this is what we can do.\"\n\nThe merging of storylines also presented challenges for Cox, who said: \"It is linear but the nature of the final episode of any TV series is there is some kind of climactic ending or something has happened or changed.\n\n\"With the end of season 2 of Daredevil I had my feelings and my ideas about what that had led him to do so there were important questions about how much time has passed?

They have a fight, in the dark, with a hooded woman who serves The Hand. The subtext is clear: If you haven't watched Daredevil Season 2 you're going to be SOL, my friends.\n\nThe good news is that our time with Iron Fist is short-lived, as the show quickly moves from Danny, to Jessica, to Luke, to Matt, catching us up on their individual circumstances: Jessica's getting back on a case after spending some time in the bottom of a shot glass, post-Kilgrave. Luke's being released from jail (By FOGGY NELSON! FROM THE DAREDEVIL!) having served his time. And Matt's back in the courtroom.\n\nThis actually surprised me, because at the end of Daredevil Season 2 it seemed like Matt was turning away from being a lawyer in favour of embracing the vigilante life full time. Here he's returned to his legal profession and sworn off beating people senseless with his fists in favour of beating people senseless with pure logical arguments, and disarmingly messed up hair. But let's face it, if Charlie Cox is wearing anything we'd all prefer an actual suit over the Daredevil costume.\n\nSo it goes that the episode bounces around from plot to plot, setting up each individual character as they pursue their own investigative threads that will lead them, one must assume, to Alexandra (Sigourney Weaver). All we know about her is that she's a powerful enough member of the Hand that she can push Madame Gao around, and that she's on a clock because she's got a life-threatening illness. Whatever plans she had are being pulled forward, and that means, quite literally, that there are going to be earthquakes: the episode ends with New York shaking as Alexandra promises Elektra \"you'll get used to watching them fall\" implying that she's far more ancient than we may realise.\n\nINTRIGUING STUFF. Although let's face it, this episode - while well-written and completely without filler on account of having four leads to service - is SLOW. And I'm not just talking about the almost total lack of action in the episode. Because, do you know what the principal quality of a team-up show should be? The teaming-up. Here the closest we get in this episode is Foggy Nelson having a conversation with Luke Cage.\n\nEspecially with the sheer density of supporting characters around - Trish Walker, Karen Page, Misty Knight, Colleen Wing - this episode is like watching four episodes of the individual shows which have been interleaved, except that none of them get to a point where the characters can reasonably use their powers for anything fun. Talk about teasing it out. It's hard not to watch it and wonder why Claire Temple (Rosario Dawson) doesn't just pull out her phone and tell her four superpowered mates to get in a room and exchange ideas, but we can assume that's coming in... well, episode 2 if we're lucky.\n\nOn the plus side, the glacial pace of the plot is more than compensated for by the star power of the cast. As much as the individual shows may have misstepped, the leads are almost universally great. Even Finn Jones, who it's fair to say never really had the material to make his version of Danny Rand work, is kind of fun. Sure, he might be Iron Fist if Iron Fist just got done begpacking his way around Thailand, complete with ill-advised tattoo and borrowed Eastern philosophy, but here he is - at worst - harmless.\n\nIt's a good start, then. It's like slipping on four pairs of comfortable jeans at once. I'm interested in Alexandra, I'm excited to see the characters again, and in all honesty I don't mind that it's just 50 minutes of conversation because it's not a weekly show: episode 2 is right there. Let's go watch it now.\n\nWell, after these nerdy references:\n\nRather than explain all of the individual back references to the individual shows, I'll point you in the direction of our wholesale recap of the Netflix MCU, which should tell you who everyone is and how they got to this point, with the exception of Alexandra, who's new.\n\nPoint: Danny's Ceremonial Robes, as seen in a surprisingly literal dream sequence, are the closest thing we've seen to his Iron Fist costume yet. In particular, the one depicted on the cover of Immortal Iron Fist #27 (August 2009).\n\nThe missing husband Jessica Jones investigates is called John Raymond. There's no Marvel character called John Raymond that I'm aware of, but he does share his name with the super-obscure DC/Red Circle superhero Web. First appeared in Zip Comics #27 (July 1942). I'm going out on a limb to call it coincidental.", "date": "2017-08-18", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television", "wgt": 100, "id": 111, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "wgt": 100, "id": 212, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Kingdom of Thailand"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thailand", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kingdom of Thailand"}, "type": "loc", "id": "218"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "302687", "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "304357", "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Comics", "type": "org", "score": 4, "id": "304577", "label": {"eng": "Marvel Comics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_(arts)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "304816", "label": {"eng": "Character (arts)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wholesale", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "313659", "label": {"eng": "Wholesale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "313939", "label": {"eng": "Action film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigourney_Weaver", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "314952", "label": {"eng": "Sigourney Weaver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miniseries", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "349310", "label": {"eng": "Miniseries"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daredevil_(Marvel_Comics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "351103", "label": {"eng": "Daredevil (Marvel Comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defenders_(comics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "358975", "label": {"eng": "Defenders (comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luke_Cage", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "373788", "label": {"eng": "Luke Cage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-joke", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "379712", "label": {"eng": "In-joke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosario_Dawson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "409370", "label": {"eng": "Rosario Dawson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_philosophy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "423807", "label": {"eng": "Eastern philosophy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Fist_(comics)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "id": "431572", "label": {"eng": "Iron Fist (comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patsy_Walker", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "504481", "label": {"eng": "Patsy Walker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purple_Man", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "531012", "label": {"eng": "Purple Man"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misty_Knight", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "547406", "label": {"eng": "Misty Knight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colleen_Wing", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "555508", "label": {"eng": "Colleen Wing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Cox", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "574287", "label": {"eng": "Charlie Cox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karen_Page", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "641253", "label": {"eng": "Karen Page"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foggy_Nelson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "641254", "label": {"eng": "Foggy Nelson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finn_Jones", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "650834", "label": {"eng": "Finn Jones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hand_(comics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "652996", "label": {"eng": "The Hand (comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claire_Temple", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "1288996", "label": {"eng": "Claire Temple"}}]}

The four Marvel Netflix heroes find they have a common enemy in the series opener.\n\nWith three superheroes operating in Hell's Kitchen and another not all that far away in Harlem, it was only a matter of time before they crossed paths. That's right, folks: The Defenders isn't just a marketing gimmick, even though it easily could be.\n\nIndeed, it would make more sense for Daredevil, Jessica Jones, Luke Cage and Iron Fist to encounter one another than it would be to explain why they never bump into each other, particularly since Jessica and Luke already know each other intimately, if you catch the drift. The first episode of this team-up series shows newcomers and fans of all the previous Marvel Netflix shows that they have enemies too powerful to defeat solo.\n\nAt the same time if you expect these four heroes to get in a circle and put their fists in the middle in a show of solidarity, you're probably going to be disappointed. It's probably going to be a bumpy start as far as teamwork goes.\n\nWe begin not in New York but Cambodia. Under the bustling streets, there's a swordfight going on. The guy on the losing end is eventually bailed out by Danny Rand. it only saves him for a moment, as the impossibly fast and skilled assailant stabs the dude, knocks Danny down and takes off. When Danny catches up with the attacker, he gets slashes across the chest and only drives the unseen foe off with the Iron Fist. The dude who gets stabbed tells Danny and Colleen Wing to go home, insisting the war he fights is in fact in New York. He dies, of course, because that's what mysterious plot point characters do.\n\nThe Defenders' opening credits sequence is quite cool, giving each hero a distinct color and visual motif. It's very much in line with the other Marvel Netflix openings.\n\nJessica Jones is hitting the bottle again. She leaves the bar in the morning just in time to save her friend Trish Walker's car from getting towed. Trish wants to tell Jess' story publicly, but she, as you might expect, is uninterested.\n\nOne guy who is more interested in getting back to work in the hero biz is Luke Cage. Good thing his legal efforts have gotten him out of prison. Looks like he may have had some help from a face familiar to Daredevil fans: Foggy Nelson, who offers the services of Jeri Hogarth's law firm should he need it.\n\nFoggy's former partner and best friend Matt Murdock is preparing for a case when he hears signs of trouble. He tenses up but hears the police are on it. We get to see him do the thing in court instead, where he wins a multi-million award for a young man left in a wheelchair after neglect in construction. Matt offers some advice to the victim, urging him to take his life back. Before speaking to the press, Matt agrees to grab a bite with Karen Page.\n\nOn a Rand jet, Danny washes his face before hearing voices. He sees a bunch of dead bodies and then some not so dead people before he gets accused of abandoning them by ... himself. Vision, nightmare or ... ?Ah, nightmare it is. Colleen wakes Danny up, who blames his screaming on the turbulence. They briefly discuss the woman they fought in Cambodia, noting her speed and how hard she hit. Colleen seems confident they can get to the bottom of the mystery, and whether it's related to The Hand, together. But what does the group want in New York?\n\nSigourney Weaver, we presume. Her character is at the doctor's office, where she learns she's dying. Her time is short: weeks or months. Into the MRI machine she goes.\n\nA hung over Jessica returns to her office/apartment to find potential clients waiting for her. The adult woman wants Jones to find her architect husband, who's gone missing. Jess suggests it's an affair, but she then gets a call telling her not to look for the guy. You know that's only going to make her want to do it.\n\nCage steps off a bus in Harlem a free man. He's immediately greeted by Claire Temple, who asks if they can get coffee, and you know what that means. Afterward, Luke tells her he needs to know what's going on in Harlem, and he promises to have a life as well as returning to his post as Harlem's hero. A knock on the door brings Misty Knight, who asks him to take a walk with her.\n\nFirst, we check in on Matt and Karen's bite. She's happy with her journalism career and Matt says his pro bono work is fulfilling. He also claims he's happy he told her about his \"secret\" and we learn he's given up being Daredevil. Matt's regret is that it drove people away, but Karen thinks Daredevil made the city safer.\n\nYep, Jessica is chasing down leads on the missing persons case she didn't take. Malcolm Ducasse is into this too and suggests tracking the call, and a few moments later, they've got a lead.\n\nThough Luke wants to take down Mariah and Shades, Misty is now part of a city-wide task force. She explains that Harlem's youth have been recruited for something sinister that is getting some of them killed. The latest victim is the brother of someone Luke knows, a girl killed during the first season of his own show, and Misty suggests helping the lone remaining sibling walk a different path.\n\nWe next see Matt in a familiar place: a confession booth. It's Father Lantom hearing it, and he reassures Matt he's not abandoning Elektra by giving up on his life at Daredevil.\n\nYet another character Marvel Netflix fans will recognize is Madame Gao, and she meets with Weaver's character in Central Park. They discuss \"the final phase\" of whatever plan they have, but it's obvious Gao is the subordinate here and has no choice but to speed things up when told to do so.\n\nCage's fame precedes him as he hunts down the young man Misty told him about. He knows more than he's willing to let on about his brother's fate and may even be mixed up in things himself. But Cage leaves without answers.\n\nMaybe Jess will have more luck. Has she found John Raymond? Nope, but she does stumble upon what looks like a crap-ton (a real unit of measurement, we swear) of explosives.\n\nGao says she's made the necessary arrangements before she's quickly dismissed.\n\nFlying in by helicopter, Colleen and Danny talk about New York, which see says she needs to be home.\n\nWe quickly shift to Matt arriving home and experiencing what seems like an earthquake. Jess does too, as do Colleen and Danny when they land. Luke saves a woman from a falling streetlight, and Weaver's character tells a young woman, \"It's just a city. You'll get used to watching them fall.\" That sure looks like Elektra.\n\nAfter the shaking stops, the sensory overload hits Matt. Heightened senses are probably a burden in a situation like that.\n\nA first episode like this can often be judged by how little unnecessary exposition is involved. The Defenders didn't need much, as it set all four heroes in motion -- though Matt is arguably even more reluctant than Jessica, which is an interesting twist -- and gave them an obvious though very mysterious foe. It sure helps if you've seen the individual series before watching this, but it's not a prerequisite, and that in itself is impressive.\n\nThe true joy of this series will be the character interactions, and we didn't get those here. But the feeling is that they will arrive soon, and that's good enough for now.", "date": "2017-08-18", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television", "wgt": 100, "id": 111, "label":

They become \"Heroes For Hire\" together in the comics. However, those who haven't read the books but have seen Luke Cage and Iron Fist on Netflix may wonder how two characters with such disparate personalities would ever get along. Here's a brief history of Danny and Luke's Marvel comics friendship so that you prepare and compare when The Defenders drops on Aug 18.\n\nThe two appear together primarily in the comic series Power Man & Iron Fist. Power Man is sometime Luke's superhero alias, though he doesn't really go by that on screen. In the books, they meet at a party being hosted by Hogarth the lawyer, who is played by Carrie Ann Moss in the Netflix universe, after Luke's charges are dropped and he comes home from Seagate prison. The party is in his honor, but Luke is attacked by a minor villain who he and Danny fought off together. While that is a little more tense than your average romantic comedy meet-cute, the two men start hanging out, fighting criminals, and getting into shenanigans together.\n\nThey initially work for Colleen Wing and Misty Knight's detective agency, but ultimately left to start their own investigation and protection business, Heroes for Hire. They're also part of the New Avengers storyline and (along with some other heroes) move in together.\n\nDanny and Luke love each other, but don't always get along. There's bickering, and Luke will roll his eyes at Danny's wealth and privilege. Meanwhile, Danny makes fun of Luke's folky language. (\"Sweet Christmas!\") They're an opposites attract kind of odd couple, who have their superpowers in common.\n\nIt's also canon in the comics that Jessica Jones prefers it when Danny doesn't talk, which sounds about right. Jessica and Luke of course end up married in the comics, while Danny is often in a romantic relationship with Misty Knight.\n\nKnowing that this is where Luke Cage and the Iron Fist could maybe end up, it'll be interesting to see how that relationship develops on The Defenders. In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, actor Mike Colter teased that the Luke and Danny relationship would be updated for the modern day. For comic book fans, watching this canon partnership form in The Defenders is probably one of elements they're anticipating the most.", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Publications", "wgt": 100, "id": 243, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Publications"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Publications/Books", "wgt": 100, "id": 244, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Publications/Books"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Arts_and_Entertainment", "wgt": 100, "id": 424, "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Arts and Entertainment"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Mental_Health/Self-Help", "wgt": 100, "id": 544, "label": "dmoz/Health/Mental Health/Self-Help"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Comics", "wgt": 100, "id": 679, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Comics"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Comics/Retailers", "wgt": 100, "id": 680, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Comics/Retailers"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Comics/Manga", "wgt": 100, "id": 789, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Comics/Manga"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's", "wgt": 100, "id": 905, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Pets/Birds", "wgt": 100, "id": 1166, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Pets/Birds"}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "org", "score": 4, "id": "302687", "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "304357", "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "304576", "label": {"eng": "Comics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Comics", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "304577", "label": {"eng": "Marvel Comics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_(arts)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "304816", "label": {"eng": "Character (arts)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superhero", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "304941", "label": {"eng": "Superhero"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gospel_of_Luke", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "310010", "label": {"eng": "Gospel of Luke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entertainment_Weekly", "type": "org", "score": 1, "id": "313045", "label": {"eng": "Entertainment Weekly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_investigator", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "315546", "label": {"eng": "Private investigator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romantic_comedy_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "331553", "label": {"eng": "Romantic comedy film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heroes_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "336496", "label": {"eng": "Heroes (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defenders_(comics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "358975", "label": {"eng": "Defenders (comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessica_Jones", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "364911", "label": {"eng": "Jessica Jones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luke_Cage", "type": "person", "score": 5, "id": "373788", "label": {"eng": "Luke Cage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_Avengers_(comics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "419854", "label": {"eng": "The New Avengers (comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Fist_(comics)", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "431572", "label": {"eng": "Iron Fist (comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_Man_and_Iron_Fist", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "484547", "label": {"eng": "Power Man and Iron Fist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meet_cute", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "543083", "label": {"eng": "Meet cute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misty_Knight", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "547406", "label": {"eng": "Misty Knight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colleen_Wing", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "555508", "label": {"eng": "Colleen Wing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heroes_for_Hire", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "749744", "label": {"eng": "Heroes for Hire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_correctional_facilities_in_comics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "808250", "label": {"eng": "List of correctional facilities in comics"}}]}

The term \"Netflix bloat\" was pretty much exclusively coined for its clutch of Marvel shows. Daredevil, Jessica Jones, Luke Cage and Iron Fist all had interesting stories to tell but they were given far too many episodes to tell them.\n\nThe good news is that The Defenders is just eight episodes. Eight episodes to throw these characters together, watch them reluctantly align, introduce a villain comprehensively enough for us to understand the stakes, and craft and resolve a satisfying conflict. In world of superheroes, where quantity is consistently prized over quality, this brevity is unheard of. Daredevil alone had 26 episodes; a day and night of glowering, mumbling and reminiscing with his stupid friend. Compared with that - and with the 13 witless episodes doled out to Iron Fist earlier this year - an eight-episode ensemble feels like a treat.\n\nThat said, The Defenders is still slow to get going. The first two episodes are agonisingly low-key, with each character contained in their own storyline, and each storyline primarily concerned with murmuring and skulking. Ostensibly, this is to get everyone up to speed on who everybody is. But you know that, because you have already seen full series about each of them. Daredevil is blind and reluctant. Jones speaks solely in offhand quips. Cage is seen only in yellow-tinted scenes soundtracked by hip-hop or R&B. Iron Fist is a whiny baby. This is basically all you need to know. Unless you want to watch an introductory flurry of who-the-hell-are-yous so predictable that you have already guessed them word for word, you could jump straight in at episode three and not miss a thing.\n\nThat is when we properly meet the antagonist. Unlike the films, where they are anaemic and reedy, Marvel TV baddies are traditionally the best part of each show. So it is with Sigourney Weaver. After her first scene (in episode one, admittedly) where she is introduced in a moment of extreme vulnerability, she instantly becomes the best thing about the show; easily the equal of Kingpin or Kilgrave. And since she plays an unintentionally hilarious immortal - who keeps giving away her hand by saying things like: \"You know who was nice? BEETHOVEN\" and \"This food reminds me of ANCIENT CONSTANTINOPLE\" - that's saying something.\n\nEpisode three is also when the series starts coming together. The initial draw of Daredevil was that it would be the TV equivalent of The Raid. If you like punching in hallways, you would love Daredevil. That didn't come to pass but, I am here to tell you that there is punching in hallways in The Defenders. The first fight scene, when it eventually comes, is giddy with excitement. It is fast and fun and tightly choreographed and, like the airport fight in Civil War, there is the undeniable thrill of watching kids fling their action figures together. The punching in hallways is when everything clicks. It is when you will start enjoying yourself.\n\nOnly the first half of the series was up for preview, and it ends on a note that suggests much more punching in hallways to come. Hopefully, that is the case, because The Defenders should be all punching in hallways. Every scene without punching in hallways is wasted. There is no sense of delayed gratification to be had by holding back. There is gratification preceded by long periods of boredom.

But \"Marvel's The Defenders,\" the streamer's newest original series in the street-hero franchise, could be one of its biggest hits ever, independent research indicates.\n\nThe four preceding Marvel series leading up to \"Defenders\" -- \"Daredevil\" season 2, \"Jessica Jones,\" \"Luke Cage\" and \"Iron Fist\" -- were among the top five most-viewed recently released Netflix originals in the first 30 days after their premieres, according to data from marketing-analytics firm Jumpshot, provided exclusively to Variety. Teen-suicide drama \"13 Reasons Why\" took the No. spot.\n\nIt seems safe to predict that \"The Defenders,\" as the culminating mashup with each of the four characters uniting against a common enemy, will turn in similar binge-heavy viewership as well. Netflix released all eight episodes of the limited series at 12:01 a.m. PT Friday. The show stars Charlie Cox (Daredevil), Krysten Ritter (Jessica Jones), Mike Colter (Luke Cage) and Finn Jones (Iron Fist).\n\nThe analysis from Jumpshot shows the relative number of U.S. Netflix viewers who watched at least one episode of each series. The data is presented as a index, benchmarked against the most-viewed Netflix original in the comparison, \"Daredevil\" season 2. For example, \"13 Reasons Why,\" the second most-viewed premier in the first 30 days, garnering 48% of the viewers that \"Daredevil 2\" received.\n\nOf the series studied, \"13 Reasons Why\" was the only Netflix original that showed any growth in week-over-week viewership in the first month of release, with an 18% increase from week one to week two. That reflects strong word-of-mouth buzz for the controversial show.\n\n\"Stranger Things\" was the seventh most-viewed Netflix original premiere in its first 30 days, but it had the lowest week-over-week decline in viewership, per the Jumpshot data. It's not a surprise that shows see a viewing drop-off after the first week, given Netflix's binge-friendly release strategy.\n\nMeanwhile, \"Orange Is the New Black\" season 5 was the least-viewed among the Netflix original series analyzed by Jumpshot, registering just 10% of the viewers \"Daredevil 2\" over the initial 30-day period.\n\n\"OITNB\" has been cited by company execs as consistently being among its most popular series, so why did the latest run apparently turn in weaker results? One potential factor: A hacker who had stolen the first 10 episodes (out of 13 total) released them to piracy networks six weeks ahead of the season 5 debut, after Netflix refused to pay a ransom. In addition, it may be that \"Orange\" fans simply didn't dive in immediately. The season's June 9 release date may have pushed \"OITNB\" farther down the queue for Netflix subs who were in the middle of one of the other series that debuted over the preceding four weeks (\"House of Cards\" season 5, \"Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt\" season 3 and \"Master of None\" season 2).\n\nSan Francisco-based Jumpshot analyzes click-stream data from an online panel of more than 100 million consumers, which amounts to 160 billion individual clicks per month.

However, a mysterious organization in New York City known as The Hand has been causing trouble for at least two of the heroes so far. Since The Hand is a common enemy and this man is one of their core operatives, will Bakuto be in The Defenders? Danny Rand's adversary could still appear.\n\nSpoilers for Iron Fist Season 1! Iron Fist introduced Bakuto (Ramon Rodriguez) as Colleen's mentor. He led a community outreach program that turned out to be recruitment and training for The Hand, the allegedly evil organization that the Iron Fist is supposed to fight. Bakuto is obsessed with the idea of the Iron Fist, but soon reveals himself as a villain after pretending to kidnap Madame Gao and then taking the Meachum family hostage. Colleen becomes disillusioned and heartbroken by her former family, but it isn't until Danny's friend Davos arrives from K'un Lun that Baluto is finally defeated.\n\nAs far as Danny and Colleen know, Bakuto is dead. However, his body vanished after their final fight and was likely dragged off by his Hand colleagues. It's totally possible that the villain has been brought back to life, like Elektra and Harold Meachum before him. It seems likely that Bakuto may return for Iron Fist Season 2, if not sooner.\n\nHere's an interesting piece of information that could be a clue as to whether of not he'll be making an appearance in the crossover series: the IMDb page for The Defenders does list two stunt performers as doubles for Rodriguez in the credits of three episodes. Is a surprise return coming sooner than Iron Fist's sophomore season? As of yet, Rodiguez himself is not yet listed as a cast member. But as IMDB is a mostly user-updated website, it isn't the most telling source and his absence doesn't confirm anything. The final trailer for The Defenders might show Bakuto's return, but that's also difficult to pin down for certain, especially considering his fate.\n\nThe Hand seems to have conquered death, so the unanswered questions about Bakuto's whereabouts do seem to indicate that his story's not yet over.", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television", "wgt": 100, "id": 111, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "wgt": 100, "id": 212, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Metal_Craft", "wgt": 100, "id": 1242, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Metal Craft"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "loc", "id": "233"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Davos"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Davos", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Davos"}, "type": "loc", "id": "94096"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "type": "loc", "id": "218049"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "302687", "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Comics", "type": "org", "score": 4, "id": "304577", "label": {"eng": "Marvel Comics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidnapping", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "305933", "label": {"eng": "Kidnapping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fictional_crossover", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "343622", "label": {"eng": "Fictional crossover"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Movie_Database", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "344970", "label": {"eng": "Internet Movie Database"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daredevil_(Marvel_Comics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "351103", "label": {"eng": "Daredevil (Marvel Comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessica_Jones", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "364911", "label": {"eng": "Jessica Jones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luke_Cage", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "373788", "label": {"eng": "Luke Cage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Fist_(comics)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "id": "431572", "label": {"eng": "Iron Fist (comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hand_(comics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "652996", "label": {"eng": "The Hand (comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Defenders_(1961_TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "676736", "label": {"eng": "The Defenders (1961 TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K'un-L'un", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "1047378", "label": {"eng": "K'un-L'un"}}]}

Instead, the first episode provides some insight on where our characters currently stood since the last time we saw them on their individual series.\n\nDanny Rand aka Iron Fist (Finn Jones) is trying to find members of The Hand around the world until he is told to return to New York City, where the real war is happening. He is still haunted by the horrors from the Hand and the deaths at K'un-Lun. He must deal with the guilt, which drives him throughout the episode to stop the Hand. Danny and Colleen Wing (Jessica Henwick) return to New York.\n\nJessica Jones (Krysten Ritter) is still drinking heavily and doing her PI work. She takes a case to find a missing family man, John Raymond, who may be involved in some shady dealings. She follows clues to an empty apartment belonging to the missing man, where she discovers explosives.\n\nLuke Cage (Mike Colter) just got out of prison and begins a relationship with Claire Temple (Rosario Dawson). Wanting to settle down in Harlem, Luke is pulled back into the crime-fighting game by Misty Knight (Simone Missick) or at least by helping one kid, Cole, who lost both his siblings to the streets. After being rebuffed by Cole, Luke leaves but is determined to help.\n\nMatt Murdock (Charlie Cox) gave up his Daredevil ways and is still practicing law. After a run in with Karen Page (Debra Ann Knoll), Murdock seems content with his new civilian ways until he confesses to the priest that he misses the life. He reminisces about Elektra (Elodie Yung) but is given advice from the priest to move on.\n\nWe are also introduced to the villain (or the antagonist) of the series, Alexandria (Sigourney Weaver). After being given a dire prognosis, Alexandria wants to move the plans faster. Working with Madame Gao (Wai Ching Ho), Alexandria is shown to be the leader of The Hand and begins her takeover by causing an earthquake in New York City and we finally see Elektra has returned, but how? We'll have to wait and see.\n\nThe pacing is a bit slow, like how Marvel series usually start. There wasn't much fighting in the episode, other than the first scene, but it was quickly crushed after Danny used his iron fist to take down the villain, which was obviously Elektra. So, we really didn't get to see anyone kicking ass, but that's fine. The first episode is all about context and with the introduction of our heroes and villain, we now know who and what we're dealing with. At least, the start of it.\n\nThe color sequences in the episode were mind-blowing. Each character has their own color scheme when their story was being told - Luke was yellow, Matt was red, Danny was green, and Jessica had blue. I loved seeing the symbolism and the mix of the colors after the earthquake, which foreshadowed our heroes meeting up soon.

It could have been a throwaway scene. She could have blown them off. One cameo was all I asked.\n\nEvery scene that called for a lawyer led to the very dull Jeryn Hogarth (Carrie-Ann Moss). It was the worst kind of tease.\n\nWith Marvel's new show, The Defenders, the four characters that the comic book company has slowly introduced since Daredevil premiered in April 2015 have all finally come together, teaming up. They will take on the one organization that has served as a connecting thread through all five of the shows so far, the clan of magic ninjas known as The Hand.\n\nUnlike the five seasons that have come before it, The Defenders only has eight episodes. It spends the first three episode giving all four characters a reason to show up in the same corporate tower at the same time, to punch their way through a bunch of ninjas in business suits.\n\nIf you're reading this, there's a good chance that you don't consider yourself a comic book fan, but you've liked the Marvel Netflix shows (enjoy them while they last). This one teases viewers with a familiar trope of superhero narratives: the reluctance to save the day. Much like hip hop stars, \"retirement\" of various forms is one shortcut writers of these tales use to amp up the drama. Heroes hang out the cape. They put the cowl in a trunk. They quit. We sigh, even though we never really believe it.\n\nDaredevil, the first character revealed by Marvel and probably the most popular character in this chunk of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, is retired at the start of the show. We are meant to wonder what could possibly ever bring him back to the fight?\n\nAs if there's any real suspense on this point. Yet, the first season of Daredevil was able to use another obvious inevitability to great effect. Matt Murdock never really becomes Daredevil until the very last episode of the first season. It's a long build. He's finding himself. He doesn't know what he's doing means. And it is (in my opinion) some of the greatest television that's ever been filmed.\n\nThis time, though, using the inevitable to unpack the interesting doesn't seem as artful.\n\nWhich makes the slow opening more frustrating since all of these characters know people in common that it's hard to believe that they wouldn't come together instantaneously after an earthquake rocks New York City (no, New York is not in an especially earthquake prone part of the country). That should have been enough for Claire Temple (Rosario Dawson) to start calling all of her unusual friends and figure out what was going on.\n\nInstead, Netflix spends the first three episodes doing narrative contortions in order to find a way to bring the heroes together \"organically.\"\n\nAll so they can all announce in the next episode (as we know from the trailer) that they don't want to be together at all.\n\nWhat do you think's going to happen?\n\nStill, at least when Matt does meet Jessica for the first time, he does it in exactly the way I hoped he would through the whole first season of Jones' show: by interrupting an interrogation and announcing that he's her lawyer. It's so good.\n\nAnd the characters' reluctance to work as a team reflects a tradition from the same loose team from 1970s comic books. The Defenders was a comic book that brought together ragtag groups to solve specific problems. The only mainstay of that comic to appear on this show is Luke Cage, but the spirit is roughly the same (including the use of a shadowy mystical character to nudge the team to count on each other).\n\nIn case anyone is unclear on this, The Defenders exist in the same universe as the team The Avengers, from the movies. That group has a building, members get paid and they hold press conferences. The Defenders are street level, all volunteer and more improvisational.\n\nI just wish the show had gotten started faster. On the big screen, Marvel had a character similar to Claire Temple in Clark Gregg's Phil Coulson. Coulson had met all the big guns in the first ensemble film previously, so they were able to use his connections to bring them all together quickly and devote more of the film to unfolding Loki's scheme.\n\nIt's too bad Marvel didn't do that here, but at least now you know it's dragging its feet in a way that honors one of several longstanding superhero traditions.", "date": "2017-08-18", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television", "wgt": 100, "id": 111, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "wgt": 100, "id": 212, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Comics", "wgt": 100, "id": 679, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Comics"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Comics/Retailers", "wgt": 100, "id": 680, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Comics/Retailers"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "type": "loc", "id": "218049"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York"}, "type": "loc", "id": "218051"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "org", "score": 4, "id": "302687", "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "302838", "label": {"eng": "Television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "304357", "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Comics", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "304577", "label": {"eng": "Marvel Comics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superhero", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "304941", "label": {"eng": "Superhero"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comic_book", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "305280", "label": {"eng": "Comic book"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_investigator", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "315546", "label": {"eng": "Private investigator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "349437", "label": {"eng": "Marvel Cinematic Universe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daredevil_(Marvel_Comics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "351103", "label": {"eng": "Daredevil (Marvel Comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ninja", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "354796", "label": {"eng": "Ninja"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Avengers_(2012_film)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "363641", "label": {"eng": "The Avengers (2012 film)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krysten_Ritter", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "364912", "label": {"eng": "Krysten Ritter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luke_Cage", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "373788", "label": {"eng": "Luke Cage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosario_Dawson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "409370", "label": {"eng": "Rosario Dawson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elden_Henson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "504480", "label": {"eng": "Elden Henson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Cox", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "574287", "label": {"eng": "Charlie Cox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foggy_Nelson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "641254", "label": {"eng": "Foggy Nelson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrie-Anne_Moss", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "648113", "label": {"eng": "Carrie-Anne Moss"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hand_(comics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "652996", "label": {"eng": "The Hand (comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Defenders_(1961_TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "676736", "label": {"eng": "The Defenders (1961 TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claire_Temple", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "1288996", "label": {"eng": "Claire Temple"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessica_Jones_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "1295284", "label": {"eng": "Jessica Jones (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeryn_Hogarth", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "1325418", "label": {"eng": "Jeryn Hogarth"}}]}

And in the new Marvel's The Defenders, she finds herself reluctantly becoming part of a group project of sorts: to save the whole damn city from an ancient evil organization known as The Hand that wants to level Manhattan. While she's hesitant at first to work with the likes of the Devil of Hell's Kitchen, some dude known as the Iron Fist, and previous fling Luke Cage, the deeper she gets into a case that she took on to help a woman and daughter draws her in to fight the good fight. And we're oh so glad that does.\n\n\"Because she has abilities, even though she doesn't want anything to do with any of this total nonsense that she doesn't even buy, she knows that she has something to offer, so she will,\" Krysten tells Teen Vogue\n\nAnd it's understandable why it takes a little bit of time for Jessica to warm up to the rest of the Defenders. Danny Rand aka The Iron First can come off a little overzealous compared to the rest of the squad. And while Daredevil may only have the best intentions, the tortured soul schtick can get a little old. The two of them plus Luke Cage also makes for a bunch of male egos in one room, but Krysten doesn't think that's what keeps Jessica from joining the team right away.\n\n\"I think Jessica is just such a tortured, like loner,\" Krysten says. \"She doesn't want to be part of any social circle, whether it's dudes or what. Gender doesn't really have anything to do with that.\"\n\nWhen the room is full of all these dudes who are trying to be heroes or what not, Jessica's there to get a job done. Sure, she definitely cares about the people she's helping out. But when some of the other characters are busy waxing dramatically about good versus evil, Jessica has turned out to be quite the spot of comedic lightness and hilarity for the show. She's arguably the funniest of the four Defenders, which is quite the accomplishment for someone who doesn't particularly like playing with others.\n\nWhile investigating a possible lead, Jessica poses as a perky woman entrepreneur looking for an open office complete with all the amenities the stereotypical tech company needs nowadays: yoga ball seats, breathing rooms, etc., clearly skewering the same sorts of industries that shows like Silicon Valley tackle. (It's very reminiscent of Krysten's Chloe from the short-lived Don't Trust the B****\\ in Apartment 23, a serial con woman always with a money-making scheme up her sleeve).\n\nAt one point when she's taking down a henchman of The Hand, he breaks out a bunch ninja moves.

Sadly, the first episode of this crossover miniseries fails deliver on that promise. What we get served instead is a slow-paced and stodgy overture that has to spend far too long putting its pieces into position.\n\nI'm not adverse to a slow build or having these characters come together in an organic way, but I can't help be feel The Defenders - despite always being a part of the plan - wasn't helped by the arcs of the individual shows. Showrunner Marco Ramirez and his writers are placed in the unenviable position where they have to undercut some of those shows simply to put characters back into play. For instance - spoiler warning - the end of Luke Cage sees its protagonist sent back to prison. It was a fairly-dramatic end-of-season cliffhanger for Harlem's Hero. But obviously this show needs Luke to be back in New York, and so Foggy is lazily dispatched to get him out of prison in less than 2 minutes and 3 seconds. (Yes, I timed it.) It just retroactively dulls that ending, robbing it of its impact. It just feels like there was a lack of planning and coordination.\n\nThis is apparent elsewhere. The episode's opening prologue sees Iron Fist and Coleen Wing hunting down The Hand in SE Asia only for Danny to learn - much to his surprise - that the real threat is back in New York - the very place where he spent most of his own series battling The Hand. Once again, Rand is portrayed as feckless, rather than immortal, Iron Fist. So while Luke is fast-tracked back to Manhattan, Danny spends most of the episode looking pensive on a private jet.\n\nIt's not all clumsy. The show more elegantly builds on where we left Daredevil and Jessica Jones. Matt Murdock has hung up his horns and is struggling to be no more than a public defendant. Meanwhile, Jessica is drinking more possibly due to her experiences with The Purple Man, or possibly just to quickly establish that she likes to drink. I think that's the other main problem with this opening episode. There's clearly been some attempt to reintroduce all of these characters, just in case you've seen never watched the previous shows. The only problem there is if you have watched every episode, like myself, these characters almost slip into caricature.\n\nThe first time we meet Jessica she's waking up hungover in a bar; the second time we see Jessica, she's drinking a coffee with whiskey in it. OK, I get it; she likes to drink. It's probably useful if you've never seen an episode of Jessica Jones, but if you've already spent close to 13 hours with this character, it feels laboured and unnecessary. Similarly heavy-handed is the treatment of Luke Cage. Whenever he appears on screen, he's accompanied by hip-hop or RnB. OK, I get it: he's the Hero of Harlem. Again, it just feels a bit clunky and lazy. I don't want to be reintroduced to characters I've spent so much time with. I want the show to play with and reward the familiarity I have with these characters - something the Marvel movies do incredibly well.\n\nSigourney Weaver's Alexandra is also introduced as the leader of The Hand, an ancient organisation that has featured prominently in Netflix's other Marvel shows. Alexandra is wrapped in mystery, and while intriguing it's hard at this point to really regard her as a villainous force. The Hand instigates a major citywide disaster at the end of the episode, but their motivations remain frustratingly unclear beyond the vague destruction of New York. Hopefully she and The Hand grow in presence and threat.\n\nStylistically, each character's scenes possesses a signature colour - Luke's scenes are highlighted in a golden yellow, whereas Jessica's are cold and blue. It's stylish and creates continuity with their respective shows, but it unwittingly underscores the overriding sense of disjointedness that's prevalent in this episode.", "date": "2017-08-18", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television", "wgt": 100, "id": 111, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "wgt": 100, "id": 212, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Harlem"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harlem", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Harlem"}, "type": "loc", "id": "217579"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "type": "loc", "id": "217872"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New York"}, "type": "loc", "id": "218051"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "302687", "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "302814", "label": {"eng": "Film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Comics", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "304577", "label": {"eng": "Marvel Comics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_(arts)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "304816", "label": {"eng": "Character (arts)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Showrunner", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "306565", "label": {"eng": "Showrunner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avengers_(comics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "307118", "label": {"eng": "Avengers (comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhythm_and_blues", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "312542", "label": {"eng": "Rhythm and blues"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigourney_Weaver", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "314952", "label": {"eng": "Sigourney Weaver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miniseries", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "349310", "label": {"eng": "Miniseries"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daredevil_(Marvel_Comics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "351103", "label": {"eng": "Daredevil (Marvel Comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defenders_(comics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "358975", "label": {"eng": "Defenders (comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessica_Jones", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "364911", "label": {"eng": "Jessica Jones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luke_Cage", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "373788", "label": {"eng": "Luke Cage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Fist_(comics)", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "431572", "label": {"eng": "Iron Fist (comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purple_Man", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "531012", "label": {"eng": "Purple Man"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hand_(comics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "652996", "label": {"eng": "The Hand (comics)"}}]}

Spoilers for The Defenders Episodes 1-4! It's a gutsy choice, then, to make the viewers wait until the end of the third episode -- out of only eight! -- to actually see all four \"enhanced\" individuals share a scene together. But it's worth the wait, since their meet-cute quickly turns into another one of the Netflix Marvel franchise's signature hallway brawls. This one takes place in the offices of Midland Financial Circle, which is just about the most innocuous and boring name possible for a nefarious organization... but it's actually a name audiences have heard before. So what is Midland Financial Circle on The Defenders, and what does the organization want?\n\nMost recently, the name of the company was seen in some viral marketing for The Defenders; Netflix released a video titled \"Midland Circle Security Elevator B,\" which depicts Daredevil, Jessica Jones, Luke Cage, and Iron Fist riding down in an elevator inside the titular building, panting after a seemingly hard fight; the one viewers just witnessed at the end of Episode 3, in fact. But that wasn't the first time Midland's name was mentioned, either.\n\nEarlier, in Season 1 of Iron Fist, the name of the company was tossed off casually by Harold Meachum, as he ranted about The Hand's infiltration of Rand Enterprises. \"It's genius how The Hand's been using our company,\" the unstable CEO said. \"Well, not just us. It's everywhere: Roxxon, Midland Circle...\" (Roxxon Oil Corporation is a shady conglomerate that has been referenced across the entirety of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, including in all three Iron Man movies, The Avengers, Agents Of S.H.I.E.L.D., Agent Carter, and Daredevil.)\n\nHowever, Meachum's name-drop of Midland still wasn't the first time the company reared its head in the MCU; rather, its roots go back to Season 2 of Daredevil. Midway through that season, Matt Murdock discovered that Midland Financial Circle was funding a mysterious project in Hell's Kitchen... which turned out to be a giant, literal hole in the ground. After being attacked by The Hand while investigating the project, the hole was literally never seen nor mentioned again. But the resurgence of Midland hints that it may be coming back into play sometime very soon.\n\nSo, it's known that Midland is a shell company used by The Hand and run by Sigourney Weaver's Alexandra, but it's still unclear what exactly their goal is. If the earthquake in the series premiere was any indication, it likely involves using explosives to expand the hole seen in Daredevil... but to what end? Given that Midland Financial Circle is an original creation for the MCU, it's impossible to predict -- but it should be noted that the word \"Midland\" does appear in the Marvel Comics, in the form of Sid Ridley, aka Captain Midlands.\n\nOn the page, Captain Midlands is essentially Britain's version of Captain America, an MI-13 intelligence officer given the Super Soldier serum and turned into a superhero. Is this a hint that the Super Soldier serum will come into play at some point in The Defenders? If so, that would be a neat way to tie Jessica Jones (who is thus far probably the most disconnected of the four heroes from the mythology of The Hand) more personally to the show's threat; Combat Enhancers, a modern variation on the Super Soldier serum, were a major plot point in Jessica Jones Season 1, and will presumably continue to be moving forward.\n\nThere are certainly plenty of questions left surrounding Midland Financial Circle -- and with only five more episodes to go, the answers will probably start coming hard and fast. I just hope the Defenders are ready for them when they do.", "date": "2017-08-18", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "wgt": 100, "id": 212, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Financial_Planning", "wgt": 100, "id": 341, "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Financial Planning"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Financial_Consultants", "wgt": 100, "id": 1121, "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Financial Consultants"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "loc", "id": "76"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hell's Kitchen"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hell's_Kitchen,_Manhattan", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hell's Kitchen"}, "type": "loc", "id": "217604"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "302687", "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superhero", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "304941", "label": {"eng": "Superhero"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avengers_(comics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "307118", "label": {"eng": "Avengers (comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Man", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "309419", "label": {"eng": "Iron Man"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_marketing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "311658", "label": {"eng": "Viral marketing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigourney_Weaver", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "314952", "label": {"eng": "Sigourney Weaver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_America", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "333570", "label": {"eng": "Captain America"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ridley_Scott", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "346855", "label": {"eng": "Ridley Scott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "349437", "label": {"eng": "Marvel Cinematic Universe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daredevil_(Marvel_Comics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "351103", "label": {"eng": "Daredevil (Marvel Comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessica_Jones", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "364911", "label": {"eng": "Jessica Jones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S.H.I.E.L.D.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "373786", "label": {"eng": "S.H.I.E.L.D."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luke_Cage", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "373788", "label": {"eng": "Luke Cage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agent_Carter_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "379420", "label": {"eng": "Agent Carter (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daredevil_(film)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "386870", "label": {"eng": "Daredevil (film)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Fist_(comics)", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "431572", "label": {"eng": "Iron Fist (comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MI-13_(comics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "450423", "label": {"eng": "MI-13 (comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hand_(comics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "652996", "label": {"eng": "The Hand (comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midland_Railway_of_Canada", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "662513", "label": {"eng": "Midland Railway of Canada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Defenders_(1961_TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "676736", "label": {"eng": "The Defenders (1961 TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roxxon_Energy_Corporation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "909156", "label": {"eng": "Roxxon Energy Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weapon_Plus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "1228610", "label": {"eng": "Weapon Plus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Defenders_(miniseries)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "1304371", "label": {"eng": "The Defenders (miniseries)"}}]}

Instead, when the series begins they're all following their own leads. For Jessica, that means trying to track down a man named John Raymond. So who is John on The Defenders? He somehow got sucked into The Hand's schemes. (Warning: spoilers ahead for Episode 3 of The Defenders!)\n\nAt the start of the series, Jessica is approached by a woman and her daughter, asking for her help. The woman is John Raymond's wife and she believes he's missing. Jessica being Jessica isn't at all interested in their plight and tells the woman John is probably cheating on her. That would've been the end of the story, but when Jessica enters her office she gets a phone call from someone using a voice scrambler, telling her not to investigate John's disappearance. Of course, this just makes Jessica more curious and she decides to take the case.\n\nThanks to Malcolm's advice, Jessica is able to trace the call to a pay phone. Malcolm knows the area and directs Jessica to a sketchy building where she then finds John's hideout filled with C-4 explosives.\n\nAfter calling the cops, Jessica heads home only to find John waiting there for her with a gun to Malcolm's head. That's when he begins talking about how \"they\" are after him, and though Jessica has no idea who he's talking about, it's obvious he means the Hand. However, he doesn't say why exactly they're coming after him. All he says is he needs to keep his family safe.\n\nUnfortunately, that's when Elektra shows up and scares John so badly he decides it's best to just kill himself, ending any chance Jessica had at getting more answers and also saving him. Despite that, there are a few things she was able to uncover.\n\nShe later learns John worked in construction and built the Hand's office building. However, there must be more to it than that since they were going to kill him because of it. There's also still the question of what all the C-4 was for (another earthquake perhaps?). When Jessica told John about it he seemed confused. Perhaps the Hand planted the C-4 in an attempt to incriminate John, before he tried to reveal their plans to anyone. That could also explain why Elektra was sent to seemingly kill him.\n\nNow that John is dead, his family may never get the answers they seek.

When Netflix and Marvel announced in 2013 that they'd be bringing the Marvel Cinematic Universe to the streaming service via four series that would culminate in a superpowered team-up known as The Defenders, I was open...and skeptical.\n\nOut of the four series, there's only been one real standout in Jessica Jones. I loved what Luke Cage was all about (and a number of those performances), and Jon Bernthal's Punisher high-key saved a scattered season of Daredevil. Your boy Danny Bland wasn't nearly enough of a hero for me to give a fuck about, and in the four years since Netflix and Marvel announced that there'd be a Defenders, I've wondered to myself if they should've had a redo on many of these series leading into the main event.\n\nWARNING: From this point on, there will spoilers to the first four episodes of The Defenders. Enter at your own risk af.\n\nAfter getting through the first four episodes of The Defenders, I can't front: there's a lot of stuff to enjoy. The shots of the squad together, kicking ninja ass, have been dope. Equally as intriguing is getting to see these heroes finally linking up, whether its Luke Cage and the Iron Fist getting into a fight while pursuing the same bad guy, or the quick reconnection of Luke and Jessica after how they ended things off in Jessica Jones. That said, the best part of the series is without a doubt Krysten Ritter's Jessica Jones, who has zero fucks to give and is ultimately just trying to live.\n\nOne of the biggest issues is the idea of wanting to be a hero versus needing to be the hero. Luke Cage isn't worrying about money; he's trying to put on for Harlem. Matt Murdock doesn't even want to be Daredevil...until it's time to be Daredevil, then he's jacking Jessica's scarf and being the street vigilante he wants to be (and repent for). Danny Rand's trying to stop The Hand on some By Any Means Necessary shit, but after seeing season one, I can't find an iota of a care for him or his mission. Jessica Jones? She's just trying to work her case until she opens up and realizes that these are the only people who truly understand her. AKA she has, like, feelings outside of being a badass.\n\nIt's funny; Jessica's powers in the comics and in Jessica Jones are almost secondary to her work as an investigator, which helps round her character out. Sure, she could just jump extremely high or punch a hole through that door, but hearing her put on a faux voice and con information out of people is way cooler than \"me hit you, you fall down\" action sequences (although that one hallway fight is dope). Hell, one of the best scenes in the four episodes I've seen is of Jessica getting her research on, and no it's not just because they included a shot of her in those jeans that feels like it was made for me (although you'd have to convince me that it wasn't totally made for me).\n\nPOST CONTINUES BELOW\n\nThat's not to say that I don't appreciate other things about The Defenders. Sigourney Weaver's playing the hell out of Alexandra, a mysterious addition to The Hand who is as sophisticated as she is dangerous. It's also dope to see Simone Missick's Misty Knight, although I hope that the later half ups the Simone quotient more than the former. And seeing Luke Cage do any heavy lifting is kinda dope. Not to mention that most of the characters (especially Jessica) waste no time shitting on Danny Rand if they can, which is either a) Marvel knowing that people hated on Danny in season one or b) really odd on Marvel's part, creating a hero that isn't cool and forever gets hated on.\n\nIt's been an interesting two years since the first season of Jessica Jones, and if one thing's for certain, Jessica's sarcasm and lack of fucks being given is truly missed in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The thing is, she left off in a truly troubled point in her life. She'd killed the person who made her life a living hell, and while she definitely decided to pick up the pieces of her life and get back to her work, recovering from that trauma isn't as easy as flipping a light switch for anyone. I want more of that and less of \"bulletproof guy can now be shot\" or \"quirky rich guy reclaims his fortune.\" And with talk of David Tennant returning in some form or fashion in Jessica Jones season two, I'm way more anxious to see that then the Avengers-lite of Netflix, no shade.\n\nUltimately, The Defenders was supposed to be the culmination of years of groundwork being laid during these Marvel series. What the series ended up being a huge tease; all I want right now (aside from The Punisher) is season two of Jessica Jones.

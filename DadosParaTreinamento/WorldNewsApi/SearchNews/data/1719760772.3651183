She\u2019s surrounded by two more Oscar winners \u2014 Expats\u2019 Nicole Kidman and Lessons in Chemistry\u2019s Brie Larson \u2014 who nod in agreement. The True Detective star continues, \u201cand that\u2019s the real beauty of it, having that freshness of doubting yourself.\u201d Over the course of an hour at The Georgian Hotel in Santa Monica, that trio, along with The Morning Show\u2019s Jennifer Aniston, Shogun\u2019s Anna Sawai, Griselda\u2019s Sof\u00eda Vergara and Feud\u2019s Naomi Watts, discuss everything from mentorship to menopause. Who here has ever lied to land a job? NAOMI WATTS Oh, for sure. BRIE LARSON We all lied and said that we knew how to ride a horse, and we couldn\u2019t. NICOLE KIDMAN I can ride a horse, but I did lie about ice skating. Not a good one to lie about. JENNIFER ANISTON I might have not been fully honest. I said I couldn\u2019t ride a horse, just because I didn\u2019t want to ride the horse. WATTS Oh, I definitely added special skills to my r\u00e9sum\u00e9 back in the day. Multiple languages, lots of weird sports. SOF\u00cdA VERGARA I didn\u2019t lie to get a job, but I lied to my agents so they\u2019d take me when I moved to L.A. I said I could sing and dance. Why not? I didn\u2019t think they were going to send me out. Then they sent me to an audition for Chicago on Broadway. EVERYONE No! VERGARA But I got the part. LARSON What?! ANISTON Then what happened? VERGARA I played Mama Morton in Chicago. ANNA SAWAI Oh my gosh. JODIE FOSTER So, lying pays off. Jodie, you\u2019ve been known to reach out to young actresses and offer advice. What prompts the outreach and what do you tell them? FOSTER I guess I fancy myself as some kind of mother figure. If I see somebody drunk and on their face at an event, for example, I might be like, \u201cSo, what\u2019s going on?\u201d Because I feel for them, and I really am grateful for my mom getting me through all of that. Somehow I managed to have a series of rules that allowed me to survive. For the rest of you, what would have been helpful to hear when you were still early in your careers? WATTS Just allow yourself to be you and not compare yourself to other people. I lived very much under the radar for about 10 years, auditioning, and I was always finding myself in a waiting room with 10, 12 people, going, \u201cOh God, she looks sexy, I should be sexier. I wore the wrong outfit.\u201d Or, \u201cShe looks intelligent, let me put some glasses on.\u201d FOSTER That you can say \u201cno\u201d was a big one for me. ANISTON Yes! FOSTER That\u2019s what is good about this new generation. They\u2019re very comfortable saying no, setting boundaries and going, \u201cI don\u2019t like that, and I want to do this.\u201d I didn\u2019t know that was possible. Brie, I\u2019ve heard you talk about your early days as a pop singer, and I\u2019m amazed by the gumption you had as a young teen to push back and say no to things that didn\u2019t feel right or good to you. Where did that come from and how was it received? LARSON Oh, not well. I\u2019m just more comfortable with how uncomfortable it makes people that I\u2019m very clear about what a yes and a no is for me. I\u2019ve learned that if I can understand what a no is and be able to say it before I\u2019m upset about it, it actually just avoids a lot of drama in the end. And the thing I like to remind myself is that you all can have what you want with me on set, but I have to go home and live with myself. Not to say I have a perfect track record. Of course, there were times where I was like, \u201cPlease, someone love me.\u201d But my team used to joke that I was saying no before I was allowed to say no. I was like, \u201cI\u2019m not doing that.\u201d Or, \u201cThat\u2019s inappropriate.\u201d SAWAI And your team was supportive of that? LARSON Yeah, they were. SAWAI Oh, nice. Because I was working in Japan for a while [also as a pop star], and they were like, \u201cTo say yes is the most mature thing that you can do. Always say yes, don\u2019t really tell us what you want. We\u2019ve been doing this for the longest time, so just trust us.\u201d It\u2019s only been in recent years that I\u2019ve started to get used to saying what I want. And it\u2019s so refreshing because my team will be like, \u201cWhat do you want to do?\u201d And I\u2019m like, \u201cMe?\u201d KIDMAN I still have trouble with no. Part of what we do is dive into things that are deeply uncomfortable. And I\u2019ve had to teach myself to not always go, \u201cI can\u2019t do that.\u201d My initial reaction can be that instead of, \u201cOK, ease into it.\u201d Because I need to be coaxed sometimes. I\u2019m still finding that compass. Brie, I\u2019ve also heard you say that if you hear someone\u2019s going to be playing a superhero, you\u2019ll reach out. What kind of tips do you find yourself sharing? WATTS Wait, you\u2019re a superhero mentor? LARSON Always. I\u2019m the first person to email everybody because it\u2019s very specific and very strange. People are like, \u201cI don\u2019t know how to do this.\u201d Yeah, no one does. Why would you? I\u2019ll say, \u201cTrain, because you\u2019ll want to be as prepared in your body as you possibly can because it only gets harder as the job goes on. And really understand how to be able to go to the bathroom in your suit.\u201d The first Captain Marvel, it was a 45-minute thing to get me in and out of that costume. ANISTON There wasn\u2019t even a little secret trapdoor? LARSON No! That\u2019s why I\u2019m like, \u201cGet a plan.\u201d ANISTON Yeah, a little zipper. LARSON I can\u2019t stand when people have to wait for me to go to the bathroom, so I\u2019d have to time it out. WATTS Oh, that would give me anxiety. ANISTON You can\u2019t have a sip of water. LARSON It\u2019s a whole thing, and it\u2019s a lot of pressure. And I think it\u2019s a strange thing, especially when you\u2019re a newcomer and you\u2019re tasked with being the most powerful blah, blah, blah of blah, blah, blah, and you feel scared. It\u2019s so hard to be the cool, confident one when you\u2019re like, \u201cDo I know what I\u2019m supposed to be doing?\u201d For everyone, how would you describe the current era that you\u2019re in, in terms of the projects that are coming your way? Jen, a few years ago, you said you were being offered a lot of dark material \u2026 ANISTON Well, living in that dark space as a comedian, ultimately, when I started, it\u2019s really hard. That\u2019s why I listen to SmartLess on my way to and from work [on Morning Show], just to laugh and get out of that [headspace]. I don\u2019t live in my character, which I know some people do. I choose to just get rid of it as fast as I can. And then I usually say, when I\u2019m done [with the season], \u201cI need a comedy right now.\u201d How about you, Sof\u00eda? VERGARA I feel very awkward here because this is my favorite group of actresses, and I realize I don\u2019t know anything about acting. ANISTON What? No! VERGARA Not in a bad way, it\u2019s just a reality. I did 11\u202fyears on Modern Family, but it was almost playing myself in a way. I never went to an acting class in my life. And when I decide to do something different, it\u2019s hard because this accent is beautiful, but it\u2019s like, I cannot be a scientist, I cannot be an astronaut. FOSTER Sure you can. VERGARA If I produce the movie, maybe, but it\u2019s going to be not great. KIDMAN (To camera) That\u2019s what she wants next. VERGARA Oh no! (Lifts up her breasts) I don\u2019t want to be a scientist with these. (Laughter.) That\u2019s why, for example, when I decided to do Griselda, I wasn\u2019t thinking, \u201cOh, I want [to distance myself from] Gloria. No, it was I know that character. I lived in Colombia in that era. My brother was a drug dealer and got killed. But I\u2019ve never seen it as a woman \u2014 I knew it as many, many men. Then I said, \u201cMaybe I can\u2019t do it. I\u2019m going to find out who Jennifer Aniston [who also transitioned from a sitcom to drama] worked with.\u201d ANISTON I was just going to say, every time I go to work, even when I start the next season of The Morning Show, I\u2019ll think, \u201cI don\u2019t know how to do this.\u201d It\u2019s like I have absolutely zero memory of how to be an actor. VERGARA I was like, \u201c[Which acting coach] did she go to to prepare?\u201d And I found \u2026 ANISTON Nancy Banks? ANISTON Yes! I said, \u201cCan you maybe help me with this thing? I\u2019ve never done this, but I want to.\u201d ANISTON I\u2019m so happy that happened. What comes your way now? VERGARA Comedy, of course, which I love. I don\u2019t want to be Gloria again, but I cannot take this accent away no matter what. I tried at the beginning of my career. When I moved to L.A., I\u2019m like, \u201cI cannot believe Pen\u00e9lope Cruz or Salma Hayek don\u2019t change their accent, they\u2019d have so many more opportunities. I\u2019m going to do it.\u201d Then I spent so much money and time with people teaching me, and it was a fucking waste. (To Kidman and Watts) You know how to do every accent in the world. KIDMAN Oh, with help! WATTS But it\u2019s funny. Nic, do you find if you play Australian, you have to get coached? Is that true? KIDMAN No! (Laughter.) WATTS OK. Well, yeah, she\u2019s much more Aussie than me. She\u2019s a proper Aussie, I\u2019ve got some British in there. KIDMAN Can you hear that? (In a British accent) \u201cI have some British in there.\u201d WATTS But I\u2019ve changed my accent for so many different shows and characters, I forget where my own voice is sometimes. Because you work so hard to be understood. VERGARA Imagine, that\u2019s my life! (Laughter.) Anna, I\u2019ve heard you say you initially feared that Shogun would be another depiction of Japanese women being sexualized by white men. How many other scripts had you read before this where that was what was occurring? SAWAI It wasn\u2019t just Japanese women being sexualized. It was that they were defined by the relationship that they had with the male character, or we didn\u2019t really understand their story enough, they were always just like the sub-character. And oftentimes when you hear Japanese women, you think, \u201cOh, they\u2019re obedient, they\u2019re sexy or they can do just action somehow.\u201d And that\u2019s not who we are \u2014 we\u2019re so much more complex. And even if we appear obedient, it\u2019s because society has made us that way and there\u2019s so much that\u2019s bottled inside. And in Western media, I\u2019d never seen a complex woman who had their own story. So, when I first read the sides, it was my character going into a bath with the white pilot. I was like, \u201cOK, this is going to be the same thing.\u201d I played it in that way and they didn\u2019t call me back. So, what changed? SAWAI I had a conversation with our showrunner and he explained it wasn\u2019t that kind of scene. He wanted it to be just a conversation. So, I taped again and played it like she wasn\u2019t really taking off her kimono and they were just \u2026 VERGARA Equals? SAWAI Yeah, and they liked me. So, once that happened, I was like, \u201cOK, this is the type of women that we haven\u2019t been able to see, that I\u2019m sure Japanese women when they watch it will see themselves reflected in.\u201d And, in the end, with that bath scene, we actually had Blackthorn in the hot spring, but my character just walked in and sat down and gazed outwards. And it\u2019s even more intimate because you know that there\u2019s nothing physical about it. I\u2019m lucky that we\u2019re finally being able to give a portrayal of real Japanese women. WATTS Brilliant. For others, what are triggering terms in character descriptions that make you say, \u201cNot going to do this\u201d? LARSON \u201cBroken but beautiful.\u201d Or \u201cbeautiful but she doesn\u2019t know it.\u201d (Pantomimes a face-palm.) I\u2019ve read that so many times. I read it last week, probably. FOSTER For most of my career, I was always shocked that so many of the scripts that I read, the entire motivation for the female character was that she\u2019d been traumatized by rape. That seemed to be the only motivation that male screenwriters could come up with for why women did things. \u2026 She\u2019s kind of in a bad mood, yeah, there\u2019s definitely some rape in her past. Oh my. FOSTER Yeah, rape or molestation seemed to be the one kind of lurid, big emotional backstory that they could understand in women. And I didn\u2019t take it personally. But once I was old enough, I think I did have a responsibility to come in and say, \u201cYou\u2019re not always going to get the most perfectly fleshed-out female character, but maybe there\u2019s an opportunity for us to work together and create something that way?\u201d KIDMAN Which is why I think now we\u2019re all working hard to put women at the helm because the viewpoint suddenly becomes very different. Anne Hathaway said something recently that surprised and disturbed me. \u201cBack in the 2000s,\u201d she said, \u201cit was considered normal to ask an actor to make out with other actors to test for chemistry. \u2026 I was told, \u2018We have 10 guys coming today and you\u2019re cast. Aren\u2019t you excited to make out with all of them?\u2019\u202f\u201d She wasn\u2019t excited, of course. But who here can relate, and what were your versions of it? KIDMAN To be excited to make out with someone? I think maybe secretly I\u2019ve been excited. (Laughs.) ANISTON I haven\u2019t been told you\u2019re going to have to lay down and \u2026 WATTS Simulate? ANISTON Yes. And if asked, I would never. WATTS I have. Just once, and it was very awkward. I was auditioning and I didn\u2019t get the job, so clearly I did not do a good make-out. It was with a very well-known actor. It was mortifying because we didn\u2019t hear a \u201ccut,\u201d and it just kept going. VERGARA Oh, no. WATTS Then they were like, \u201cOK, OK.\u201d And we both were like, \u201cOh, sorry, we didn\u2019t hear \u2026\u201d I did feel a bit rattled. The very idea of a chemistry read is an uncomfortable thing for a number of reasons, including if you don\u2019t have chemistry, you typically see these people again. KIDMAN Also, you can not have chemistry, and onscreen, it\u2019s made. ANISTON Yes! KIDMAN There\u2019s a way you can shoot things. I think just relying on chemistry is lazy. There\u2019s the writing. There\u2019s the interaction. You can literally be directed through it. ANISTON Also, when you\u2019re in an audition room, you\u2019re already at a disadvantage. Maybe you\u2019d have chemistry with this person if you were in a different environment and not, like, \u201cCreate chemistry. Ready? Go!\u201d And I\u2019m a terrible auditioner, always was. I waitressed forever before I could finally get something, which was a Bob\u2019s Big Boy commercial. So, if you\u2019re a nervous auditioner to begin with, to then say, \u201cNow let\u2019s have you make out with a complete stranger,\u201d it\u2019s very uncomfortable. WATTS It\u2019s impossible. KIDMAN Yeah, direct me! ANISTON Put some music on or something. WATTS Some people are really good at auditioning, but I was shockingly bad too. I could feel the energy in the room where people were like, \u201cHurry this along.\u201d I\u2019d even go, \u201cYeah, don\u2019t worry, I\u2019m out of your way in one second. You don\u2019t even have to look me in the eye and shake my hand.\u201d It took meeting David Lynch, who\u2019s a master of filmmaking, and he just sat and talked to me [for Mulholland Drive]. He said, \u201cTell me about yourself.\u201d And I fell into it, this conversation. I was like, \u201cWait, really? You want to take time with me? You want to know shit about me and how I was raised and all of that?\u201d And then I got the job. I didn\u2019t even have to audition. KIDMAN And then something happened, right? WATTS Oh, yeah, we made the pilot, and then ABC canned it because it was too weird. It was too David Lynch. It took the French producers to come and say, a year later, \u201cCan you make it into a feature?\u201d And he did, and it was a game changer for me. Sof\u00eda, you\u2019ve said you brought Griselda\u2019s rage home with you. How did that manifest and what tricks have you all learned to leave characters and emotions at work? VERGARA I\u2019ve only done Modern Family, really, so I didn\u2019t know what I was walking into. And when I arrived, I realized this is different, and it\u2019s hard when you have to cry and kill and choke and snort cocaine and drink alcohol. And I\u2019d never in my life touched a cigarette. Never. I had to learn, and to learn at 50 years old to smoke and you\u2019re going to be in every single scene smoking. OK. The first three weeks, I\u2019d go home and I didn\u2019t know what was wrong with me. What would it look like? VERGARA I couldn\u2019t fall asleep. I decided to take Xanax because I had to wake up the next day to go again. It was either I start sleeping or I\u2019m going to die. I was talking to Nancy, too. I was like, \u201cNancy, I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m going to survive this.\u201d She\u2019s like, \u201cYou\u2019re an actor now.\u201d ANISTON It\u2019s so interesting because the way she works is that you\u2019re unlocking some stuff that you\u2019ve very wonderfully been [pushing] down into the depths of your body. VERGARA Yeah! And I come from Colombia, I\u2019ve had a lot of crazy stories, it\u2019s why I knew I could do Griselda, but those were the things that my whole life, to keep my sanity, [I buried.] Then here comes this woman who tells me, \u201cOK, bring it out.\u201d I don\u2019t know how you guys do it all the time, those dramas. Comedy is so much nicer. LARSON I agree. FOSTER I\u2019ve done almost no comedies in my life. Would you like to, Jodie? FOSTER I enjoy them for the first two weeks. And then after two weeks, I\u2019m like, \u201cI can\u2019t do this one more minute longer.\u201d (Laughs.) I find drama much easier. WATTS I do, too. I get nervous that I\u2019m going to screw up the joke. \u201cThe joke is coming, oh God, oh God. Panic, panic.\u201d FOSTER For me, I\u2019m genuinely an introverted person, and in order to keep the energy on the set, you need to be a more extroverted person. It\u2019s just not natural to me at all. So, after two weeks, I\u2019m exhausted. Nicole, you once came home from a rough day on Big Little Lies and threw a rock through a door \u2026 KIDMAN Whoa, that\u2019s right! I threw a rock because [the door] was locked and I couldn\u2019t get in. I\u2019d never done that in my life. I obviously [had a lot] pent up. I broke the whole thing. It cost a fortune. (Laughs.) And then I went back the next day and I said to Alexander [Skarsgard] and Jean-Marc [Vall\u00e9e], \u201cI threw a rock through the window,\u201d and they were like, \u201cWhoa \u2026\u201d I said, \u201cI was kind of pissed off.\u201d But there\u2019s a way in which we operate where the show must go on, and so you just keep going \u2014 you show up and you do it and do it and do it and do it. And a lot of times, it\u2019s six months of 12-, 14-hour days and there really isn\u2019t the time to go, \u201cI need to take care of myself.\u201d And yet, you keep playing the darkest of roles. KIDMAN After Expats, I went and did a comedy because I went crazy with my own psychology. I was like, \u201cThis is unhealthy.\u201d And it\u2019s something that I think we need to talk about as actors \u2014 protecting your body so that you can live for as long as you are given on this earth. Because it\u2019s very tough on the psyche. VERGARA The body doesn\u2019t know that what you\u2019re going through [isn\u2019t real]. KIDMAN It doesn\u2019t. But the idea of being able to go and get a massage or a hot bath or even a pat on the back, just someone touching you and going, \u201cIt\u2019s OK.\u201d ANISTON Got a little teared up when you just said that. KIDMAN But the reach out for each other is so important. Brie, you play a character that men inherently distrust and dislike simply because she\u2019s a woman. I couldn\u2019t help but see a correlation with the vitriol you\u2019ve received from the male-dominated superhero world for playing Captain Marvel. Did you see it, too? LARSON I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s specific to Marvel. I only know my experience, and my experience is being underestimated at times. Do you draw from that for a character like this? LARSON Of course. I think the best I\u2019ve been able to find with characters I play is that they\u2019re all me, it\u2019s just a mixing board. It\u2019s like if you\u2019ve ever watched a musician and they\u2019re mixing their music. It\u2019s like, \u201cOh, that\u2019s that lever.\u201d And I\u2019m just messing with those all the time. It\u2019s a wonderful experience. When you\u2019re like, \u201cOh, I can throw a rock through a window, I didn\u2019t know that was in me.\u201d Those are some of the, I hate to say joys, because I\u2019m sorry you threw a rock through the window, but these are the things where you learn. WATTS The discoveries. LARSON Yeah, and these are things that are living inside of you that I don\u2019t know if you would\u2019ve given a life to [otherwise]. And sometimes they\u2019re really beautiful and sometimes they\u2019re sad or scary or keep you up at night, but I feel like my life is enriched by all of those things. The hardest part for me has not been committing to the characters, it\u2019s getting out of them. Do you have tricks? LARSON I basically haven\u2019t done anything as dark as Room since Room, because it took me a year to get out of it. And it was really scary. It took me a long time to be able to just do basic things that I used to enjoy in my life. So, yeah, you hope that you have the grace of a line producer who\u2019s scheduled it so that there are moments where you can offload. With Lessons in Chemistry, I didn\u2019t have that, [and it was made harder because my] character won\u2019t let anybody see her emotions. Eventually, I was like, \u201cYou have to put a pop-up tent on set, and that\u2019s where I\u2019m going to go cry.\u201d Because sometimes it feels so intense and I\u2019m like, \u201cI can\u2019t do it anymore!\u201d So, you have to find ways to offload. I put a lot of board games on set. You have to find what works for you. VERGARA (Holds up her martini) Drinking. (Laughter.) For all of you, who in this industry has helped you navigate the tougher or lonelier parts of this life? WATTS I mean, Nic has definitely been a guiding force for me. KIDMAN You for me, too. WATTS Not to date us, but it\u2019s a 40-year friendship \u2026 KIDMAN And it did not start in acting. WATTS No, it started down at the pub. KIDMAN Can we stop? (Laughter.) LARSON Over the years, I\u2019ve gone out of my way to make friends with other women in the industry because there was usually just one woman on a job. It was just me, and there are things that make me uncomfortable or things that I\u2019d like to change or to laugh about, and connecting with other women has been a game changer because you get to swap stories. ANISTON It\u2019s so true. And not even having to do with the work, but just life. (Turns to Kidman) When we did that movie in Hawaii [2011\u2019s Just Go With It], you helped me out on a lot of hard things that I was going through. Just to have that community, it\u2019s very helpful. WATTS And not all of our mentors are on the set. If I can gush a little, Jodie \u2026 We\u2019re only a few years apart, but your career was obviously so underway for such a long time and you changed my life with your performances. I still remember The Accused. KIDMAN And you were a baby then, and you\u2019re so well adjusted. WATTS How did you do it? FOSTER Well, it gets better, right? The generation before us kept telling us that things were just going to get worse \u2014 we\u2019ll hit 40 and it\u2019s over. And I have to say, I\u2019ve never been as happy as an actor as when I turned 60. There\u2019s just some kind of contentedness about it not being all about me and walking onto a set and saying, \u201cHow can my experience or whatever my wisdom is, how can it serve you?\u201d Bringing that to the table, not only is it more fun and more freeing, but it\u2019s also easy. It\u2019s super easy because you\u2019re not filled with anxiety about the things that maybe younger people are filled with anxiety about. WATTS Did I read you were done doing lead roles? FOSTER I just got bored with it. And I\u2019ve learned so much from new voices \u2014 (to Sawai) from seeing your character, for example, in Shogun \u2014 who\u2019ve finally been given the freedom to air themselves. I want to hear them and I want to support them. It\u2019s so much more fun than being number one on the call sheet and having to carry the burden of the narrative. Anna, have you found those people to guide you yet or are these six women here about to be them? SAWAI I\u2019ve not had enough experience to be like, \u201cmy journey\u201d and \u201cthis person has helped me so much.\u201d It\u2019s little bits of advice from a lot of co-stars and people behind the scenes. But I actually have a question [for Foster] because now you do meet so many females on set, but growing up in the industry, how was that for you? FOSTER I never saw another female face except for the lady who played my mom and possibly in makeup or hair, but in the old days those were also men. SAWAI So, how do you navigate that? FOSTER I had these wonderful brothers and fathers, and I\u2019m always grateful for them because they taught me the lessons of film sets. They were like, \u201cYou write thank-you notes.\u201d I felt like those brothers and fathers, they were a family. And then, little by little, as women came on to movie sets, it was just this fantastic thing. There would be one other female on set and then there would be two and then maybe three. And that kept growing \u2014 except there were never female directors. KIDMAN See, I met Jane Campion. Not a wallflower. And everyone would do what she said, so she was a great role model. FOSTER You were lucky. But there\u2019s this misconception that somehow female actresses are at each other or they don\u2019t like each other or whatever. Even this year, going to the various events [for Nyad], it always just feels so nice because the women really feel like they want each other to succeed. Like, Nicole, I took over a movie that you had to leave. KIDMAN Yes! And thank you. I was in a really bad way. I was like, \u201cI\u2019m having a breakdown.\u201d And Jodie took over, thank the Lord. Naomi, in the past few years, I\u2019ve heard you talk as much about your struggles with menopause as I have your Hollywood projects. And you initially worried about the impact on your career of doing so. How did you ultimately decide it was worth it? WATTS I started late, by Hollywood standards \u2014 I was 31 when Mulholland Drive finally launched. I was also told, \u201cIt\u2019s going to be over by 40, so work, work, work.\u201d And then, when I was at the precipice of wanting to start a family, I was 36, and I was told I was close to menopause. I went into this frantic panic, a lot of shame and fear. I\u2019m skipping over a lot, but I was able to have children and then went straight into menopause with hard-core symptoms in my early 40s. And I felt like if I ever dared to mention that word, I would be branded as redundant, finished, off to pasture. It\u2019d be career suicide to bring that into the room. But then I was like, \u201cThis makes no sense. We\u2019re half the population. Everybody\u2019s going to go into menopause at some point, so why shouldn\u2019t we be talking about it?\u201d ANISTON Mm-hm. WATTS When you learn about the symptoms and how long they can go on for, it\u2019s like, \u201cWhy can\u2019t we find the support?\u201d And it\u2019s not just the physiological support you need, it\u2019s the emotional support. So, I just went, \u201cFuck this, let\u2019s just talk about it.\u201d And in terms of my career, I felt like, \u201cWell, if it spooks everyone, that\u2019s a bummer, but hopefully it actually does the opposite because the longer the life, the richer the stories.\u201d We don\u2019t have to play just the cranky, old, scary ladies anymore. FOSTER (Waves hands) I\u2019ll play all the cranky, scary ladies. (Laughter.) ANISTON That goes back to, \u201cWhat would your earlier self have loved someone to prepare you for?\u201d That would have been a nice bit of information because you go into it sort of blindly. Like, some alien is taking over your body and it doesn\u2019t make sense. It affects you in your life and in your work. WATTS So, for your generation \u2026 (Looks at Sawai and Larson) VERGARA It\u2019s going to happen to you, too! WATTS But it\u2019s going to be OK, because doctors are actually now getting training. ANISTON And it all depends on when your mom went through it, which I didn\u2019t know. And it helps to have that information. OK, let\u2019s not talk about this \u2026 LARSON I like it. It\u2019s a different kind of roundtable now. How do the rest of you decide which pieces of you, whether it\u2019s fertility struggles or the impetus for a divorce, are worth sharing? ANISTON I just think the older you get, the more \u201cfuck it\u201d you get. VERGARA You care less. ANISTON You just do.

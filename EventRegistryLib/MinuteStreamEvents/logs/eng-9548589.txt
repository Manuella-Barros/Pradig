The Irish 'goth goblin' leaving Eurovision fans 'speechless'", "body": "{{ #verifyErrors }}{{ message }}{{ /verifyErrors }}{{ ^verifyErrors }}Something went wrong. Please try again later{{ /verifyErrors }}\n\nIreland's 2024 Eurovision contestant Bambie Thug is undoubtedly one of the favourites of this year's competition, winning over more fans after their astonishing performance at the first semi-final.\n\nThe Cork-born singer, real name Bambie Ray Robinson, was voted through following their rendition of original song \"Doomsday Blue\", a thumping industrial-techno pop song that features dazzling, artistic staging.\n\nBambie, who goes by they/them/their pronouns, is therefore the first Irish contestant to make it through to a Eurovision final since 2018. They been praised for what many have dubbed a flawless performance that will assert them as one to beat.\n\nThey will be competing against singers including the UK's Olly Alexander, Croatia's Baby Lasagna and Ukraine's Alyana Alyana and Jerry Heil at the Malm\u00f6 Arena in Sweden on 11 May.\n\nIreland's Taoiseach Simon Harris hailed their achievement and said it was \"time to bring the Eurovision back to Ireland\".\n\n\"Congratulations to Bambie Thug, who has qualified for the Eurovision final tonight,\" he wrote on X/Twitter.\n\n\"Bambie will become the first Irish act in the Eurovision finals since 2018. It is time to bring the Eurovision back to Ireland and Bambie is the act to do it!\"\n\nHere's everything you need to know about Bambie Thug ahead of the Eurovision 2024 final:\n\nThe self-described \"goth gremlin goblin witch\" and \"Ouija-pop star\" was born in Macroom, County Cork, to a Swedish father and Irish mother. Their aspirations for a career as an avant-garde pop artist began in their home town, they told the Irish Mail on Sunday, explaining that they spent \"so much time in the field pretending I was in Lord of the Rings and talking to trees and making potions, and that was really lovely\".\n\nBambie initially trained as a ballerina, taking local classes before studying at Col\u00e1iste Stiof\u00e1in Naofa, then spending two years with the Cork City Ballet. \"I loved Cork and I still love Cork,\" Bambie told the publication, \"but then I moved to London because I got a partial dance scholarship and musical theatre dance at the Urdang Academy in London, and so I moved over for that.\"\n\nThey completed their degree before deciding to switch to a career in music, spending two years studying the art of writing pop songs and performing at open mics around London. After ditching a talent agency that apparently tried to turn them towards \"bubblegum pop\", they began navigating their own career and \"was lucky enough to meet people who really believed in the project\".\n\nBefore being chosen as the Irish delegate for Eurovision 2024, Bambie had been releasing music under their professional moniker for around three years, and had already attracted a devoted fanbase along with airplay on BBC Radio.\n\nBambie has expressed their excitement about representing Ireland at Eurovision, explaining that it feels \"really beautiful\" to be appreciated at home.\n\n\"There's something that makes my heart so warm about having the country see my art, my stuff, because this is what raised me,\" they said. \"This is my roots, this is the ground that birthed me and is the reason I write the way I do.\"\n\nHowever, Bambie has also not shied away from criticising Eurovision organisers for allowing Israel to participate, amid its ongoing war on Gaza. They have echoed calls to ban Israel from this year's contest, telling the Irish Examiner: \"When things were going on with Ukraine, Russia wasn't allowed to enter, so I don't think there should be a rule for one and a different for another.\"\n\nBambie has also objected to censorship of any displays of pro-Palestine support, after they were allegedly asked to alter their pro-Palestinian message ahead of their performance at the first semi-final.\n\nThey told a press conference in Malm\u00f6 that they were forced to change their body paint in Ogham script (an early Medieval alphabet), which translated to \"ceasefire\" and \"freedom\", a nod to the situation in Gaza and amid Israel's inclusion in the competition.\n\n\"It was very important for me because I'm pro justice and pro peace,\" Bambie said. \"Unfortunately, I had to change those messages today to 'crown the witch' only (which was an) order from the EBU.\"\n\nA spokeswoman for the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) said: \"The writing seen on Bambie Thug's body during dress rehearsals contravened contest rules that are designed to protect the non-political nature of the event.\n\n\"After discussions with the Irish delegation, they agreed to change the text for the live show.\"\n\nOrganisers had previously warned that Palestinian flags and symbols would not be allowed in the Malm\u00f6 Arena.\n\n\"Doomsday Blue\" was written by Bambie Thug with co-writers Cassyette, Sam Matlock and Tyler Rydr, and includes lyrics that reference witchcraft, casting spells, and other nods to the occult.\n\n\"It's a much more mature performance,\" Bambie has said of \"Doomsday Blue\", in comparison to their earlier work. Interviewed by Rock Sound, they explained they put the song forward because \"it met all the requirements\", as well as being \"a bit boundary-pushing\" in the way it melds different genres.\n\n\"They shouldn't really work, but they do, and for me it's a bit chaotic, it's very theatrical,\" they said, emphasising that they want to give Eurovision fans \"a show\".\n\n\"Also, I had three minutes to showcase multiple singing styles and vocal ability that I can do, so I just was kind of like, this is the one.\n\n\"I think it's got something there for everyone,\" they continued. \"There's spoken word at the start, there's a pop chorus then there's a screamy part and there's a soulful, almost croony middle-eight, and then there's the electro-metal breakdown where I get to scream my lungs out. I'm just a show-off, basically!\"\n\nSuffice to say, Eurovision fans are impressed. In the YouTube comments of Bambie's semi-final performance, many declared their jaws were \"on the floor\" during the berserk rendition.\n\nSome also pointed out how Bambie's performance proved just how essential staging is, with the dramatic effects and elaborate costumes ramping up the drama.\n\n\"The production on this performance will win the contest alone,\" one fan declared. \"Huge credit to the lighting and visual engineers.\"\n\n\"The performance was magnificent,\" another fan wrote on X/Twitter after watching Bambie sing in the semi-final. \"Now go and win it Bambie Thug.\"\n\nAnother enthusiastic Bambie stan announced that \"Doomsday Blue\" was \"the most original performance we EVER had in the whole history of Eurovision... I'm so f***ing speechless THIS NEEDS TO WIN.\"\n\nBambie Thug will be competing in the Eurovision Song Contest 2024 grand final on Saturday 11 May. You'll be able to follow live coverage and updates via The Independent, and watch the contest live on BBC One.", "source": {"uri": "independent.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Independent"},

Written in Ogham - an ancient Irish alphabet - the markings on their body translated to \"Ceasefire\" and \"Saoirse Don Phalistin\".\n\nREAD MORE: Social media reacts after Bambie Thug blows roof off Eurovision semi-final\n\nBambie revealed the Eurovision Broadcasting Union told them they would not be allowed on stage to perform Doomsday Blue for Ireland if they did not remove the markings on their face.\n\nSpeaking to Ray D'Arcy on RTE Radio One, they said: \"I mean, I was devastated that I had to take it off but I wasn't going to be allowed on stage if I hadn't and unfortunately, you know, there's a bigger picture here. I have to do the performance to be able to make any impact anywhere.\"\n\nThe artist revealed that all three markings now read \"Crown the Witch\" ahead of their performance in Saturday night's final. Opening up about making it to the grand final on Saturday, Bambie said: \"I personally, I think just on points that I would like to improve on my own performance specifically, but apart from that, I think we're just adding a bit more rhinestones to the dress.\n\n\"I'm happy, I'm very happy, you know. I'm just going to give another great performance.\"\n\nSpeaking about performing in the semi-final with dancer and choreographer Matt Williams, Bambie said: \"We've run the show loads of times before this, you know, my team are incredible. I felt extremely held. And I know there are people around but like it's us on stage together, so intimate with each other, that the rest of the world doesn't really exist for us in those moments.\n\n\"And I think, you know, that's a testament to, I guess, our training and also our friendship and our chemistry together. So I'm so grateful for him to be there.\"\n\nIreland didn't find out if we qualified until ninth place and Bambie said they thought it was done on purpose.\n\n\"I think they did it on purpose... I don't know,\" they said. \"The Swedes were behind me, like the presenter was like 'where's Bambie Thug?'. I don't know, maybe it was just for everyone's rooting for Ireland and you know, to keep up the drama. It's TV.\"\n\nBambie said they love how they are proving people wrong who said they can't sing.\n\n\"It's a whirlwind. I mean, my favourite thing is the family wholesomeness of us as contestants, like I genuinely have made some amazing friends for life. There's such camaraderie, there's such a genuine, loving and care for each other and it's gorgeous. Everyone is so supportive of each other. It's just such a different world. It's gorgeous.\"\n\nBambie's mother Laura also told how proud she is of their performance. Speaking to RT\u00c9's Arts & Media Correspondent Evelyn O'Rourke after the result, Laura - affectionately nicknamed 'Mambie Thug' by fans - said: \"I'm feeling so proud... I think we're going to have a ball. We're having a ball here! There's a huge contingent here and everybody's really supportive - as you can hear!\n\n\"We're never going to get away from this, you know. We will live on with this for so long and we will just celebrate and celebrate. It's fantastic.\"\n\nLaura agreed that Bambie Thug had been very calm on the night.\n\n\"It is a big stage, and a few people asked me, 'How are they feeling?' and I said, 'I think they're fine'. They handled it very well. They always did, they always handle the stage very well. I said, 'That's what they live for'. We all saw that tonight anyway! I thought it was brilliant! Their attention to detail is unbelievable, it is. They just have huge imagination. They always have had. I'm really proud.\"\n\nShe added that it is \"fantastic\" to see how Bambie Thug's message of inclusivity has connected.\n\n\"I have a cousin living in Liverpool and they were all voting tonight. They had a big Eurovision party. One of the things that my cousin Helen texted me was to tell me she has a few friends whose teenagers are transitioning and she said that the support that they feel from Bambie Thug is phenomenal. It made me cry, actually. I thought it was just fantastic. [I'm] very, very proud.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Eurovision legend Johnny Logan has said Bambie Thug was \"much more together\" than he ever was - as the non-binary artist is being backed to win the song contest. Logan, who met Bambie before they took to the stage on Tuesday night for the first semi-final, opened up about how \"talented\" Bambie is.\n\nThe What's Another Year hitmaker said: \"I went to see Bambie...to give them a hug and they gave me a hug back and we did some photographs together.\n\n\"It was the first time in years that when they announced they were in the final, I was sitting in the green room and I let out a shout. I gave a fright to the four or five delegations around me with how loud I was. I went to see Bambie just before Bambie went on and gave them another hug and I said 'Look when it's over, I won't be around because this is going to be about you and I don't want to be in your light and I think you go on and be the best that you can be'.\n\n\"I think Bambie is a very, very talented, very and much more together than I ever was.\"\n\nLogan said going back to the Eurovision stage in 2024 \"took his breath away\" as he performed Loreen's Euphoria in the Malmo Arena.\n\n\"To see the reaction to my performance is just wonderful.\"\n\nDuring the press conference on Tuesday night, Bambie also noted that they are very proud to be the first non-binary person to represent Ireland in a Eurovision grand final, which was met by rapturous applause and shouts of congratulations.\n\nIn a question from online fans, Bambie Thug was asked what they thought \"makes them special?\".\n\nThe Cork artist replied: \"You know what makes me special? I'm a queer.\" Which was again met by loud cheers from the room. Bambie Thug said: \"I'm super proud. Our team is very small and I'm an independent artist. It's incredible that we reached here.\"\n\n\"See you Saturday!\"\n\nFor the latest breaking news and top stories, visit our homepage\n\nJoin the Irish Mirror's breaking news service on WhatsApp. Click this link to receive breaking news and the latest headlines direct to your phone.

We stand united against all forms of hate, including antisemitism and Islamophobia.\n\n\"We firmly believe in the unifying power of music, enabling people to transcend differences and foster meaningful conversations and connections. We feel that it is our duty to create and uphold this space, with a strong hope that it will inspire greater compassion and empathy.\"\n\nBambie Thug added in their own statement that withdrawing from the contest \"would mean one less pro-Palestinian voice\" present at Eurovision.\n\nOlly Alexander, who will perform the UK's entry \"Dizzy\", has similarly decided not to pull out, and addressed the controversy in the BBC documentary Olly Alexander's Road To Eurovision '24.\n\n\"A lot of the contestants and myself have been having a lot of comments that are like, 'You are complicit in a genocide by taking part in Eurovison', which is quite extreme. It's very extreme,\" he said in the documentary.\n\n\"I understand where that sentiment is coming from but I think it's not correct. It's an incredibly complicated political situation, one that I'm not qualified to speak on,\" he added.\n\nThe Eurovision Song Contest's second semi-final airs on Thursday 9 May at 8pm on BBC One,

The United Kingdom, Germany, France, Spain and Italy have already made the final along with Sweden.\n\nThe second semi-final takes place on Thursday night when Armenia, Albania, Austria, Czechia, Denmark, Greece, Malta, Switzerland, Belgium, Estonia, Israel, Georgia, Latvia, Netherlands, Norway, and San Marino will compete.\n\nReacting to Bambie Thug's win, Taoiseach (Ireland's leader) Simon Harris commented that this is the first time Ireland has qualified for Eurovision since 2018.\n\nOn X (formerly Twitter) he wrote \"Congratulations to Bambie Thug, who has qualified for the Eurovision final tonight.\n\n\"Bambie will become the first Irish act in the Eurovision finals since 2018. It is time to bring the Eurovision back to Ireland and Bambie is the act to do it!\"\n\nBambie Thug had planned to use the ancient Irish script, Ogham, to decorate their body with slogans reading \"ceasefire\" and \"freedom for Palestine. However, these slogans were not permitted.\n\nThey told the press \"It was very important for me because I'm pro-justice and pro-peace. Unfortunately, I had to change those messages today to 'Crown the Witch' only - an order from the EBU (European Broadcasting Union).\"\n\nA spokeswoman for the EBU said: \"The writing seen on Bambie Thug's body during dress rehearsals contravened contest rules that are designed to protect the non-political nature of the event.\n\n\"After discussions with the Irish delegation, they agreed to change the text for the live show.\"\n\nJust days before the final tens of activists gathered outside RT\u00c9 in Dublin for a mini-concert in support of the Palestinian people and calling on a boycott of Eurovision 2024. Activists chanted \"from the river to the sea, Palestine will be free\" and hung flags from the overpass. Actor Stephen Rea read Refaat Alareer's poem \"If I Should Die\".\n\nThe Irish Boycott Eurovision 2024 Coalition, spokesperson and Ireland Palestine Solidarity Campaign chairwoman, Zoe Lawlor told the Irish Times \"Israel's President Yitzhak Herzog has stated 'it's important for Israel to appear in Eurovision.' We say the opposite.\"\n\nThe Irish Boycott Eurovision 2024 Coalition is comprised of the Ireland-Palestine Solidarity Campaign, Irish Artists for Palestine, Apartheid-Free Arts and Palfest Ireland.\n\nMs Lawlor said \"Ireland has shown the way in the 1980s in exposing the crimes of apartheid South Africa. It can do the same now, by withdrawing its participation, and standing on the side of humanity, equality and human rights. \"\n\nThe group wrote to RTE's director general, Kevin Bakhurst, and included a petition signed by 16,500 people. They also revealed that some 400 artists have written to Irish participant Bambie Thug requesting that they refuse to perform.\n\nRT\u00c9 confirmed it would go ahead with its coverage of the contest.\n\nA spokeswoman for the national broadcaster said: \"RT\u00c9 has always approached the Eurovision Song Contest in the spirit in which it was founded - which is a non-political contest designed to unite audiences and bring people together through a shared love of music and entertainment.\n\n\"Thirty-seven nations including Ireland will take part in the 2024 Eurovision Song Contest. RT\u00c9 is not aware of any participating public service Broadcaster who is planning to boycott the upcoming Eurovision Song Contest.\"", "source": {"uri": "irishcentral.com", "dataType": "news",

I think we're going to have a ball. We're having a ball here!\n\n'Really supportive'\n\n\"There's a huge contingent here and everybody's really supportive - as you can hear.\n\n\"We're never going to get away from this, you know. We will live on with this for so long and we will just celebrate and celebrate. It's fantastic.\"\n\nShe added: \"I have a cousin living in Liverpool and they were all voting tonight. They had a big Eurovision party.\n\n\"One of the things that my cousin Helen texted me was to tell me she has a few friends whose teenagers are transitioning and she said that the support that they feel from Bambie Thug is phenomenal. It made me cry, actually. I thought it was just fantastic. [I'm] very, very proud.\"\n\n'Super proud'\n\nMeanwhile Bambie held court for foreign press late into the night in Malmo.\n\nThey told the press: \"I am super proud. Our team is very small. I am an independent artist and it is incredible we have reached here. Our country hasn't been here since 2018, and I am the first non-binary artist to qualify.\"\n\nQuizzed by foreign press as to what made them special, Bambie said: \"I am a queer. I love art, I love drama, I am going to give you a show\".\n\nHowever, post show after securing a place in the final, Bambie Thug said: \"I am completely dissociated and right now am having an out of body experience. I am super proud.\"\n\nFinal in sights\n\nIn a nail biting finish to Tuesday's first semi-final, Ireland was announced as the ninth act going through to the final after Bambie delivered a surreal spectacle of witchcraft and ballet.\n\nEmerging from a spell circle to dance with a devil, Bambie, clothed in black feathers and a two horn headdress, they beckoned the audience in with long black nails before delivering an explosion of gothic pop, as jets of flames erupted through the stage in Malmo.\n\nThe Taoiseach Simon Harris congratulated Bambie on qualifying for the final.\n\nHe said: \"Bambie will become the first Irish act in the Eurovision finals since 2018.\n\n\"It is time to bring the Eurovision back to Ireland and Bambie is the act to do it!\" he wrote on X, formerly

Last month, a letter was signed by 400 Irish musicians artists, dancers, writers and poets calling for Bambie to \"heed the call from Palestinians to boycott the competition\".\n\nIn the press conference after their semi-final success, Bambie was questioned by a Swedish reporter about their decision not to follow through with messages written on their face and leg in Ogham writing which read \"Ceasefire\" and \"Freedom for Palestine\".\n\nBambie responded, claiming they are \"pro-justice\" and \"pro-peace\" before explainaing their decision. \"Unfortunately, I had to change those messages today to 'Crown the witch' only in order from the EBU,\" they said.\n\nTheir explanation was met with applause by several members of the press crew.\n\nA spokeswoman for the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) said: \"The writing seen on Bambie Thug's body during dress rehearsals contravened contest rules that are designed to protect the non-political nature of the event.\n\n\"After discussions with the Irish delegation, they agreed to change the text for the live show.\"\n\nSocial media users have been commenting on the news breaking on Tuesday night, with many highly critical of the EBU's order to Bambie. One user wrote: \"Very intense but very relevant question answered by Bambie really really well.

I am super proud.\n\n\"Our team is very small, and I am an independent artist and it is incredible we have reached here.\n\n\"Our country hasn't been here since 2018, and I am the first non-binary artist to qualify. See you Saturday.\"\n\nDuring rehearsals, Bambie was seen with the words \"ceasefire\" and \"freedom for Palestine\" painted on their legs.\n\nIt comes amid calls for Bambie and other Eurovision acts to refuse to perform as Israel is included in the acts.\n\nHowever, Bambie admitted that they were told to change the words for the live performances.\n\n\"It was very important for me because I am pro-justice and pro-peace. Unfortunately, I had to change those messages today to Crown the Witch only due to orders from the EBU [European Broadcasting Union],\" they shared.\n\nThere have been five Eurovision Song Contests where Ireland have failed to qualify for the finals, with Bambie now breaking that curse.\n\nHow did they do that? Bambie said: \"Do you know what makes me special? I'm a queer, I love art , I love drama, I love theatre and I'm going to give you a show.\"\n\nAhead of the semi-final, Bambie was fifth favourite to win the Eurovision outright. Bookmakers odds had them behind Croatian act Baby Lasagna, with their song Rim Tim Tagi Dim, Switzerland's Nemo's The Code, La Noia by Italy's Angelina Mango and Alyona Alyona and Jerry Hei from Ukraine.\n\nThe next Eurovision Song Contest semi-finals will air Thursday May 9th with the final taking place on Saturday May 11th.

Ireland's witchy Eurovision contestant is fast becoming a frontrunner", "body": "They self-describe as a \"goth gremlin goblin witch\", call their own music \"Ouija pop\", practice witchcraft and have cited Lady Gaga as an inspiration.\n\nMeet, Bambie Thug, the 31-year-old artist representing Ireland in this year's Eurovision.\n\nAs well as breaking a spell of Irish bad luck at the contest and becoming their first entry to qualify for the final since 2018, they are also one of Eurovision's first ever non-binary contestants (Germany's Jamie Lee and Switzerland's Rykka, both contestants in 2016, were the first).\n\nBorn in Cork as Bambie Ray Robinson, the Irish singer-songwriter, whose pronouns are they/them, was a stand out from the first Eurovision semi-final, which took place on Tuesday (May 7).\n\nThey performed Doomsday Blue, a track which Bambie Thug has described as \"Ouija pop\", and a \"three-minute musical theatre play piece\": part pop, part rock, part classical, part metal, with visuals imbued with witch and folklore references.\n\nIn the track's music video, the artist sits in a candle lit room, inside a Wiccan star which has been scrawled on the floor. They play with a voodoo doll, scrawl in a book before burning it, and pull slime from a bath, wrapping it round their inch-long black nails. In the semi-final performance, meanwhile, they danced and screamed their way around a circle of candles, while dressed in a black feathered dress along with a pair of horns.\n\n\"When I submitted [Doomsday Blue], I was certain it'd cause a stir and it's done exactly that,\" said Bambie Thug to Eurovision. \"Whether you like it or not, you know the song. You're not going to forget it and that's all I care about.\"\n\n\"For an untrained ear it may be a bit confusing, but if you really appreciate music you'll think it's a masterpiece.\"\n\nBorn to a Swedish father and Irish mother, Bambie Thug first trained as a ballerina and worked for two years with the Cork City Ballet. They moved to London because they were offered a partial scholarship for the Urdang Academy, a high-profile performing arts college.\n\nInspired by their life in Cork where they spent \"so much time in the field pretending I was in Lord of the Rings and talking to trees and making potions\" and a wide range of artists including Paul Simon, Stevie Nicks, Dolly Parton, Barbra Streisand, Snoop Dogg, Bambie eventually made the switch from dance to a full-time music career after completing their degree - though their training still comes through in the full-on performances.\n\nThen followed several years of graft, performing at open mic sessions around London, and finding the right team who would allow Bambie to make their own kind of music - one talent agency was dropped because they wanted Bambie to make \"bubblegum pop\". But Bambie Thug gradually started to build a fanbase and had enjoyed three years of reasonable success, which included being played on BBC Radio, when they were selected as Ireland's Eurovision entrant.\n\n\"Hopefully my performance shines on the night and they crown the witch!\"\n\n\"I'm glad people are betting on me, but I'm just going to give the best performance I can do and try to connect in those three minutes to those millions of viewers,\" they said in one recent interview. \"Hopefully my performance shines on the night and they crown the witch!\"\n\nThe witch reference is more than just a comment on Bambie Thug's aesthetic. The artist does actually practice witchcraft, which they say is inspired by Ireland's pagan roots, and was further developed after they came across a Muswell Hill witch community when they moved to London.\n\n\"It's been a form of therapy, putting an intention or feeling onto certain objects, or putting things into a potion to signify something,\" they said to NME. \"It's all arts and crafts, it's all creating and play. That's been very important for me.\"\n\nSpeaking to the Irish Independent the artist said fans could expect some of this \"romance, magic and storytelling\" during their final performance, adding \"I'm really grateful to have this platform, especially as a non-binary person and as an alt little goth. I'm super proud and I'm just excited to go and kick some a** on stage.\"\n\nThey are thrilled to represent Ireland, too: \"There's something that makes my heart so warm about having the country see my art, my stuff, because this is what raised me,\" they said.\n\nAnd they are also proud to be one of the competition's first non-binary entrants. \"[I've] had loads of lovely messages from parents about their children loving the song and about some queer kids feeling like they can come out,\" they said to the Irish Independent. \"You know just incredible responses.\"\n\nBut it hasn't all been plain sailing. Bambie Thug has attracted a lot of attention, partly because of their unusual look, partly because of their involvement with the competition, as it struggles to navigate the cultural boycott against Israel in the wake of the Israel-Hamas war. Some campaign groups have argued that this year's Israeli entrant, Eden Golan, should not be allowed to perform, and contestants have been asked by Eurovision not to make political statements on stage.\n\nIn a Eurovision press conference in Malm\u00f6 this week, where the competition is taking place after Swedish singer Loreen won for a second time last year, Bambie spoke about the fact they were asked to alter their body paint. It was written in Ogham script, an early medieval alphabet, and had said freedom and ceasefire.\n\n\"It was very important for me because I'm pro justice and pro peace,\" they said. \"Unfortunately, I had to change those messages today to 'crown the witch' only - which was an order from the EBU [the European Broadcasting Union].\"\n\n\"I stand by my statement and I am completely for Palestine,\" Bambie had said to NME in early May. \"When things were going on with Ukraine, Russia wasn't allowed to enter, so I don't think there should be a rule for one and a different for another,\" they also said to the Irish Examiner.\n\nDue to some of the negativity towards her, Bambie Thug also signed out of their X account, where they go by C**TRY Ray, in April, saying, \"Logging off this cesspit for a while. Remember to look after your mental health. Happy healing trolls.\"\n\nBut on the whole it all seems like water of a duck's back, and Bambie Thug is excited, and raring to go. Why hasn't Ireland got this far before? \"Ireland hasn't had me in Eurovision\" said Bambie Thug. \"The question is... is the world ready for the future of music?\"", "source": {"uri":

Unfortunately, I had to change those messages today to 'Crown the Witch' only, in [an] order from the EBU.'\n\n'Crown the Witch' has been a slogan of Bambie Thug's performance since they were chosen to represent Ireland in this year's Eurovision Song Contest, and adorned the screens of the Malmo arena during their rendition of 'Doomsday Blue' on Tuesday.\n\nAnother performer had earlier managed to make a public gesture in support of Palestine without EBU interference. The organisers have said that they \"regret\" that Eric Saade displayed the pro-Palestinian keffiyeh symbol on his arm as he performed his 2011 song Popular.\n\nBambie Thug enters Saturday's final as one of the frontrunners with the bookies'. RT\u00c9 commentator Marty Whelan was ecstatic as he called their progression to the final, saying, 'At last! Ah yes, that's fantastic.'\n\nIreland's representative was one of several performers who signed an open letter in March calling for a lasting ceasefire in Gaza.\n\nIsrael will take to the stage on Thursday with their performance of 'Hurricane,' after controversy over an initially proposed entry called 'October Rain' in an apparent reference to the October 7 attacks by Hamas.", "source": {"uri":

After hanging up their microphone for the night after the semi-finals on Tuesday, Bambie, who is non-binary, took to Instagram, telling fans how they had decided to celebrate.\n\nPosting a snap of their thigh with an intriguing-looking tattoo adorning it, sticking out of the bath, the singer shared: \"No I can't sleep. Having a Doomsday Blue bath.\"\n\nEarlier in the evening, Bambie posed with Irish stars, Jedward, who tagged the photo: \"Crown the witch\". Desperate for the Emerald Isle to qualify for the competition after missing out on the last six Eurovision live finals, the 'goth witch' threw everything at their 2024 semi-final performance, leaving fans \"speechless\".\n\nIreland's Eurovision Song Contest entry, Bambie Thug was joined by Jedward for the semi-finals They celebrated their success by having a soak in the bath\n\nBambie was fourth to grace the stage at the show on Tuesday- and wowed audiences across Europe with a spectacular lights show and dramatic costume change on set. 'Crown The Witch' was the cry from the crowd, as the lights faded on the spellbinding performance.\n\nAfter Ireland finally landed a place in the final for the first time since 2018, fans flocked to X, formerly known as Twitter, congratulating Bambie. \"I can't lie. I initially hated this song but Bambie has done their country so proud. We needed something drastically different for this to work.\"\n\n\"Crown the Witch!!!! They did it,\" another declared adding: \"I can only focus on Ireland and How Good that performance was. Welcome to DUBLIN 2025 everyone.\"\n\nAfter Ireland's previous Eurovision disappointment, Bambie promised they would \"stand out\" from the crowd when they took to the stage in Malmo, Sweden for the first semi-final. Ireland and Sweden have the most wins in Eurovision's history at seven each, ahead of the show being held in the Scandinavian country after Swedish singer Loreen triumphed with Tattoo.\n\nDespite Ireland's previous success, Irish 2018 competitor Ryan O'Shaughnessy was the last to reach the final with Together, finishing in 16th position. Ireland has not won Eurovision since 1996 with Eimear Quinn's The Voice. Bambie previously told the PA news agency: \"Ireland hasn't (got) into the final because the songs haven't been, I guess, standing out. And ours definitely does that this year so I would be very, very encouraging riots if I wasn't in the final.\"\n\nWhen asked if they think they are going to show a different side to Irish music, the singer mused: \"I would say that the thing about Ireland that runs through the Irish musicians, regardless of genre, is lyricism. Ireland is the land of poets, so lyrically, no, I think it a match so I think it just showcases that we're still awesome with words. And is it different from what we've (been) sending? Yes it is.\"\n\nFollow Mirror Celebs on TikTok, Snapchat , Instagram , Twitter , Facebook , YouTube and Threads .", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri": "victoria_johns@mirror.co.uk", "name": "Victoria Johns", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurovision_Song_Contest", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Eurovision Song Contest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jedward", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jedward"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Witchcraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Witchcraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-binary_gender", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Non-binary gender"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanging", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hanging"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microphone", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Microphone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tattoo", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tattoo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goth_subculture", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Goth subculture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loreen", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Loreen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Voice_(American_TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Voice (American TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "TikTok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_O'Shaughnessy", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ryan O'Shaughnessy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riot", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Riot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malm\u00f6", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Malm\u00f6"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scandinavia", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scandinavia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genre", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Genre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snapchat", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Snapchat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Contests", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Contests", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Part-Time_Employment", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Part-Time Employment", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Contests_and_Sweepstakes", "label": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Contests and Sweepstakes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Contests", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Contests", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article32759460.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_MAIN-bambie.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9548589", "eventUri": "eng-9548589", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 187, "relevance": 1}

Taking place on Saturday, 11 May in Malm\u00f6, Sweden, the event is set to be one to remember as Olly Alexander hopes to become the UK's first winner since Katrina and the Waves in 1997.\n\nHowever, it's not just Olly who's got people talking. Contestant Bambie Thug made history earlier this week when they became the first Irish Eurovision Song Contest finalist since 2018.\n\nSo, as Bambie Thug gets set to take to the stage this weekend, let's take a look at what you need to know about the Eurovision star...\n\nBorn in Cork, Bambie Thug, real name Bambie Ray Robinson, was born in 1993. In an interview with the the Irish Mail on Sunday, the 31 year old singer revealed how much of their \"really lovely\" childhood was spent \"talking to trees and making potions\".\n\nMeanwhile, Bambie trained as a ballerina at Col\u00e1iste Stiof\u00e1in Naofa and Cork City Ballet but later moved to London for a dance scholarship. However, after breaking their arm they ended up studying musical theatre instead.\n\nAfter completing their studies, Bambie kickstarted their music career and has since released three EPs.\n\nBambie, who is Ireland's first non-binary Eurovision act, makes what they have dubbed \"ouija-pop\", which is a combination of hyperpop, rock and metal and will bring their Doomsday blue song to the stage on Saturday night.\n\nSpeaking about being part of Eurovision, Bambie has opened up about their desires to reach the top three. \"I try not to think of the odds, because odds can always be beaten. But obviously it's great that we're in the Top 10 - I want to be in the Top 3!,\" they told the Official Charts.\n\n\"For Ireland to not have been in the Grand Final since 2018, to then send their little non-binary witch, this weird goth who's a bit alternative, and for us to be doing so well after years of doing badly, I'm like 'told you!' It's crazy.\"\n\nAfter performing during the semi-finals, Bambie appears to have won over viewers at home and some took to X, formerly known as Twitter, to gush over the elaborate performance.\n\n\"IRELAND IS IN THE FINAL AFTER 6 YEARS !

I am super proud.\"\n\n\"Our team is very small, and I am an independent artist and it is incredible we have reached here. Our country hasn't been here since 2018, and I am the first non-binary artist to qualify.\"\n\nIn recent weeks there have been ongoing calls for Bambie Thug to boycott the contest.\n\nAsked if they would definitely perform at the Grand Final they said; \"See you Saturday.\"\n\nIrish fans were overjoyed with the outcome, and praised the performance.\n\nErin Russell and Michael Foley had travelled from Bambie Thug's hometown in Macroom, Co Cork, and were dressed like the star.\n\n\"They killed it,\" Mr Foley said. \"They absolutely represented.\"\n\nBambie Thug, sitting in front of a tricolour with their catchphrase 'Crown The Witch' written on it, celebrated with the jubilant Irish team when the result was announced.\n\nTheir performance of Doomsday Blue was met with huge applause last night, as they performed in a candlelit spell circle before pretending to exorcise a demon.\n\nThey also performed a costume change to reveal a bespoke ensemble in the colours of the trans flag.\n\nThe singer said they did this as they intended to \"shout from the rooftops about trans rights for ever\".\n\nA total of 15 acts competed in the first of the Eurovision semi-finals last night in Malmo, Sweden, for 10 slots in Saturday's grand final.\n\nThe first semi-final included Sweden's answer to Jedward; some dancing boxers; faux exorcisms; latex bodysuits; a black and white witch; and a pair of pyrotechnic hotpants.\n\nIt was by far the most ambitious and creative staging Ireland has sent to the contest in recent years.\n\nThe favourite to win the overall contest is Croatian act Baby Lasagna, with the song Rim Tim Tagi Dim and they qualified last night.\n\nThe song is a commentary on economic stagnation in Croatia and how many young people are being forced to leave the country.\n\nDespite the serious underlying message, the stage show was spectacularly vibrant and involved pyrotechnics, projections of neon farm animals and musicians in knitted balaclavas thrashing about.\n\nDubbed the Swedish Jedward, twin brothers Marcus and Martinus performed their song Unforgettable representing the host country. It was a slick '90s-inspired pop song with s headache-inducing flashing light show.\n\nThe Finnish act, Windows95Man, commenced the performance with a man hatching out of a giant denim egg before dancing about the stage in \"naked\" trousers, while the Polish act climbed to the top of a giant tower after two costume changes.\n\nAn estimated 100,000 people arrived in Malmo for the contest.\n\nThis year's song contest has become highly political due to the involvement of Israel.\n\nThere have been calls for the organisers of Eurovision, the European Broadcasting Union (EBU), to expel the country.\n\nIn 2022, the EBU suspended Russia from the contest. That suspension was as a result of \"consistent breaches of membership obligations and the violation of public service media values\". Shortly after, Russia withdrew from the EBU.\n\nThere are large organised protests due to take part across Europe this week.\n\nThere have also been calls for individual artists to boycott the event.\n\nSome of the acts spoke about the tense political climate at the opening ceremony on Sunday night.\n\nAlbanian entrant Besa Kokedhima said: \"I wish there would be no war ever\", while non-binary Swiss act Nemo said they thought it was \"really important the protests are happening and there is room for them\".\n\nUkraine also took to the stage last night. The song contest has taken on huge importance for the country in recent years.\n\nIn 2022, Ukraine won the contest following the invasion by Russia. It was a clear message of support from the rest of the countries involved in the contest.\n\nUkrainian duo Alyona Alyona and Jerry Heil's song this year, Teresa & Maria, is about female resilience in their home country.\n\nThe song has been staged by Tanu Muino, who has worked with Cardi B and Dua Lipa, and involves the artists scaling mountains and a projection of bombs falling from the sky.\n\nUK act Olly Alexander gave audiences one of the most sophisticated performances of the night and received a huge reaction from the crowd.\n\nDuring the performance of his single Dizzy, Alexander and male dancers dressed as boxers appeared to defy gravity as they hung upside down and sideways from the walls of a shower room.\n\nThroughout the performance, the camera angles changed so it appeared the room was rotating.\n\nMany excited Irish fans had travelled to Sweden for the performance, including former contestants Jedward, who are friends with Bambie Thug.\n\n\"Bambie was phenomenal. Absolutely amazing - they rocked Europe and it is what Ireland needed at the Eurovision,\" they said.\n\n\"When Bambie came out the atmosphere was electric.\n\n\"The looks they are serving are amazing, they are rocking it.\"\n\nDylan Colley from Dublin attended the dress rehearsal on Monday night with his friends Naoimh N\u00ed Mhaolag\u00e1in and Ronan Watson.\n\n\"It is the best we have sent in years... This is what we have wanted for years,\" he said.\n\nMother and daughter Orla and Angela Reilly had travelled from Kildare to attend Eurovision for the first time ever and had secured tickets for both semi-finals and the grand final on Saturday night.\n\n\"We have watched Eurovision religiously and this has been on the bucket list for years so we are delighted to be here,\" Orla said. \"Bambie is a breath of fresh air.\"\n\nStephen Carlisle is from Co Down and works for Eurovision fan channel Eurovision 365. He believes 31-year-old Bambie will change Irish attitudes to Eurovision.\n\n\"I think they could change perceptions of Eurovision\" he said.\n\n\"In Ireland some artists are scared off Eurovision because it was seen as a career killer whereas they have shown it is something to actively embrace.\n\n\"They could do to Irish Eurovision what Sam Ryder did for the UK.\"\n\nIn 2022, Sam Ryder came second in the Eurovision.\n\nHe was the most successful UK entrant in years and helped to dispel theories that the UK's lack of success was down to external factors such as Brexit or political voting rather than the quality of song.\n\nLast night, Irish fans were delighted when \"Eurovision King\" Johnny Logan performed Loreen's 2012 winning Eurovision song Euphoria accompanied by a string orchestra.\n\nBoth Loreen and Logan are the only people in the history of Eurovision to win the competition twice.\n\nLogan won with What's Another Year?, which was written by Shay Healy, in 1980 and won again in 1987 with Hold Me Now, which he wrote himself.\n\nFor the first time ever, two of the \"Big Five\" countries, the United Kingdom and Germany, also performed during a semi-final.\n\nAll big five countries automatically go through to the grand final.", "source": {"uri": "independent.ie", "dataType": "news", "title": "Irish Independent"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Trying to curse it out of me.\"\n\nAfter shooting to fame with their debut single Birthday in 2021, Bambie Thug has gone on to play big festivals like Download, and Brighton's The Great Escape.\n\nTheir mother is Irish and their father is Swedish, and they have three sisters.\n\nSpeaking to the Irish Mirror about their childhood, they said: \"Growing up in a small place, the furthest I would go was to say I was different.\n\n\"I don't think it was until I moved away, and I came out that I really took agency over myself.\n\nThey went on: \"I moved to London when I was twenty and that's when I really felt I became myself.\n\n\"But learning to stand strong within yourself in the face of everyone else is a constant learning.\"\n\nBambie Thug identifies as non-binary and uses the pronouns they/them.\n\n\"It's important if we are going to be breaking [through] so that younger kids and teens listening to our music, and looking up to us, aren't fed this negative behaviour.\"\n\nBefore Bambie Thug came along, Ireland hadn't qualified for the Eurovision final since 2018.\n\nBut those six years of hurt came to an end on May 7, 2024, when they won a place in the grand final after taking part in the semi-final.\n\nThey were such a hit, that fans started the hashtag #CrownTheWitch, as they championed the singer to win Eurovision.\n\nBambie Thug were previously picked to represent Ireland in the Eurovision semi-finals after winning the Late Late Eurosong contest in January 2024.\n\nEurovision Song Contest final will be held on Saturday, May 11, 2024.\n\nThe action will kick off from 8pm on BBC One and the BBC iPlayer.", "source": {"uri": "thescottishsun.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Scottish Sun"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

We've been having a ball here,\" Bambie's mother Laura told RT\u00c9's Morning Ireland programme.\n\n[ In pictures: Bambie Thug's spellbinding Eurovision semi-final performance ]\n\n\"There's a huge [Irish] contingent here and everybody is really supportive. As you can hear here, we just we're never going to get away from this. You know, we will live on with this for so long. And we will just celebrate and celebrate. It's fantastic.\"\n\nWith cheers from supporters in the background, Laura described how Bambie was quietly calm going into Tuesday's semi-final.\n\n\"It is a big stage. And a few people asked me 'How are they feeling?' And I said, 'I think they're fine'. They handled it very well...

They had a big Eurovision party.

Bambie now has a chance to win the Eurovision for Ireland, which hasn't happened since 1996 with Eimear Quinn's The Voice.\n\nPrior to gracing the Eurovision stage, Bambie addressed remarks made by RTE Radio 1 presenter Louise Duffy, who expressed hesitation in playing their song on her show, citing concerns that it might be \"jarring\" for some listeners. Louise said last month: \"I can appreciate what they (Bambie) are doing and how special that is in it's own area but I wouldn't be playing it on my show because I feel it's too jarring for maybe an older listener.\"\n\nREAD MORE: Who is Bambie Thug? Ireland Eurovision hopeful's real name, family background and personal life\n\nIn response, Bambie fired back at the RTE star, telling RSVP Live: \"I would love to see what Louise's own playlist is like on a daily basis. I would probably be like, 'Next'. Saying it's 'jarring\" is just an excuse not to play the song. We need more support across the board, and more queer artists.\"\n\nDespite going through to the final, Ireland's odds have taken a slight hit off the back of last night's semi-final performance. Having been a 9/1 shot this time yesterday, Bambie Thug is now 14/1 to go all the way. Alex Apati of Ladbrokes said: \"Ireland's chances of winning have taken a slight hit as Bambi Thug now stands at 14/1, with Croatia already beginning to pull away as clear favourites to win in Sweden.\"\n\nHowever, Bambie is not feeling the pressure. They said: \"I beat the odds already, I wasn't favourite to win Eurosong. It's great that we're climbing the odds, but it's not impacting my sense of worth as an artist and my ability to perform. I'm not worried about my performance and I'm not worried about the millions of viewers watching at home. I'm so grateful for this platform.\"\n\nBambie Thug added that they're happy with how things are shaping up for Eurovision, praising their team for their hard work to make this year's Irish entry stand out. They said: \"I've an incredible director working with me and the stage and the props look really good. I'm happy with the concept and I'm happy with the routine. I'm happy with my gorgeous dance partner and choreographer. It's all set to be a really good performance.\"\n\nJoin the Irish Mirror's breaking news service on WhatsApp. Click this link to receive breaking news and the latest headlines direct to your phone.

Ireland has not won Eurovision since 1996 with Eimear Quinn's The Voice. Bambie previously told the PA news agency: \"Ireland hasn't (got) into the final because the songs haven't been, I guess, standing out. And ours definitely does that this year so I would be very, very encouraging riots if I wasn't in the final.\"\n\nWhen asked if they think they are going to show a different side to Irish music, the singer mused: \"I would say that the thing about Ireland that runs through the Irish musicians, regardless of genre, is lyricism. Ireland is the land of poets, so lyrically, no, I think it a match so I think it just showcases that we're still awesome with words. And is it different from what we've (been) sending? Yes it is.\"\n\nJoin the Irish Mirror's breaking news service on WhatsApp. Click this link to receive breaking news and the latest headlines direct to your phone.

Ireland's Eurovision finalist, family and personal life", "body": "After last night's near-flawless performance that put Ireland into the Eurovision final for the first time since 2018 - Eurovision fans are starting to pay a lot more attention to Cork's Bambie Thug.\n\nThe dramatic delivery of their song Doomsday Blue - with main choreographer/dancer Matt Williams - and the spectacular, witchcraft-inspired staging - was a huge hit with fans inside the Malmo arena and watching around the world.\n\nThere was even some political controversy around the Gothic drama onstage as Euroivison bosses ordered the Macroom-born singer to change their face make up - after finding out that it included ancient Ogham alphabetic script, spelling out 'Freedom for Palestine' in Gaelic.\n\nThere was also controversy just before last night's performance when Bambie reacted to 2FM's Louise Duffy saying she wouldn't programme their song on her show.\n\nNow Ireland awaits Saturday night and a final appearance for the self-described Ouji-pop star will perform their hyper-electro-metal tune Doomsday Blue ion front of an audience of over 100 million people around the world.\n\nThey are the first Irish act to qualify since 2018 with Ryan O'Shaughnessy, and will also be able to battle it out to secure Ireland's most Eurovision wins title, which we now share with Sweden.\n\nSo who is Bambie Thug?\n\nBambie Thug's real name is Bambie Ray Robinson. They were born in 1993 and grew up in Macroom, Co Cork. Bambie's mother is Irish and their father is Swedish. Bambie has three sisters.\n\nBambie was diagnosed with ADHD - attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. In their spare time, the singer used to sometimes work as a party princess at events for children with special needs.\n\nThe non-binary artist moved to London on a scholarship for dance as they were training to become a ballerina, Bambie previously told Cork Beo.\n\nHowever, they broke their arm during college, which led Bambie to study musical theatre instead.\n\nTheir mother, who Bambie describes as \"my biggest champion\" stayed at home with them while their father crafted metal parts and \"didn't have a note in his head\".\n\nBambie said they always wanted the spotlight while growing up in Macroom.\n\n\"Growing up in a small place, the furthest I would go was to say I was different. I definitely wanted the spotlight. I wanted to assert myself, but the closest I got was wearing brown clothes with pink tights.\n\n\"I don't think it was until I moved away, and I came out that I really took agency over myself. I moved to London when I was twenty and that's when I really felt I became myself. But learning to stand strong within yourself in the face of everyone else is a constant learning.\" his year my resolution was to back myself completely and be my own strongest cheerleader.\n\n\"This creative world is amazing but, at the same time, it's also tough. You have to have thick skin.\"\n\nWho is on the team in Malmo?\n\nIn an interview with Rolling Stone, the artist revealed that they have teamed up with choreographer Matt Williams and Director Sergio Jaen for their performance in Sweden.\n\nWilliams has worked on several Broadway shows including Gypsy and Will Ferrell's You're Welcome America. Queer Spanish director Sergio Jaen directed a wide range of films and commercials for diverse artists internationally. Jaen produced the music video for \"Doomsday Blue\".\n\nAbout the staging of their Eurovision performance, Bambie Thug said:\n\n\"My choreographer Matt Williams, my director Sergio Jaen and I have created a truly beautiful concept and piece for the big stage. I feel in a way it's Bambie Thug as you've never seen before. I'm really excited and working very hard to deliver something that stands out on that big stage.\"\n\nMusical style\n\nBambie has used the term \"ouija-pop\" to describe their music.\n\nIn a 2023 interview, they stated \"my stuff is hyperpunk avant electro-pop. We call it grit pop or rot but recently I've been coining the term 'Ouija pop'\".\n\nThey stated that they coined the term due to a reluctance of being \"put in a box\", instead com-bining numerous genres, with Bambie \"never having anything in mind\" whenever making music.\n\nOne of their major influences musically is a reluctance to be stuck to a style or genre; in an in-terview with NME, Bambie claimed that they could do \"everything\" creatively, stating their belief that the heavy metal music community had expanded to include more genres and be more ac-cepting of the LGBTQ+ community.\n\nHowever, they also stated that the heavy metal community was \"under attack\", with Robinson considering themselves a \"rebel\".\n\nBambie has stated an emphasis on trying to be \"good role models\" with music, stating a belief that many within the industry \"glamourise\" drug addiction.\n\nThey stated in an interview with Gay Times that \"We need to parade healthy behaviour. It's im-portant if we are going to be breaking [through] so that younger kids and teens listening to our music, and looking up to us, aren't fed this negative behaviour.\"\n\nIn interviews, Bambie said that their favourite artists were Dolly Parton, Britney Spears, Nina Simone, Paul Simon, Joni Mitchell, and Led Zeppelin.\n\nBambie's had a big hit with Tsunami in 2022 and has reached more than 700,000 listeners.\n\nBambie's debut song Birthday premiered in 2021, shortly followed by their first EP Psilocyber including three singles.\n\nSince then, they released another 2 EPs: High Romancy in 2021 and Cathexis in 2023.\n\nThe self-described \"Nightcore Barbie\" could be seen performing at the packed-out Download Festival in June 2023, and The Great Escape in Brighton in May 2023.\n\nThey also performed live at BBC Maida Vale Studios on Christmas Eve in 2022.\n\nBambie is a prolific songwriter whose songs written for other artists of varying genres have amassed 50 million streams. These artists include Cassyette, KID BRUNSWICK, and Fa-biCH.\n\nTheir instrumentals were also included in some of the UK's biggest nu-gen hits like Dear Goth or Petrichor, and HBO's Sex And The City reboot Just Like That.\n\n\"Bambie Thug is your witchy king antidote to the world,\" Bambie told Mike James Rock Show on YouTube.\n\n\"I make Ouija pop music, it's a fusion of everything,\" they said.\n\nDIY Magazine has described them as \"Lady Gaga's final boss form\", whereas Metal Hammer Magazine said that \"Bambie Thug is an artist in every sense\".\n\nBambie has described themself in their personal life as \"not a very angry person\", instead bot-tling up anger for their musical performances.\n\nBambie has already been given the thumbs up by Eurovision legends Johnny Logan and Linda Martin\n\nLogan, who won the Eurovision Song Contest for Ireland in 1980 and 1987 with What's Another Year?, And Hold Me Now respectively, recently predicted Doomsday Blue \"could win the Eurovision\", praising the song's uniqueness and the staging visuals.\n\nHe said: \"It's probably the best and most original entry that Ireland has had for as long as I can remember.\n\n\"I think it's a very good choice and it will definitely get attention. What I saw last night is that it was eye-catching and different.\n\n\"The people who were watching obviously related to it and that's why it was chosen.\n\n\"If it doesn't end up doing really well at Eurovision I will be quite surprised. I've always hoped that the Irish songs would do well over the last few years, but I never really felt that they would.\n\n\"This one I think has a really good chance. It just depends on the make up of the jury and the other songs that are in the contest.\"\n\nJohnny said Bambie's song stands out because it is \"different\".\n\n\"There are so many countries involved in it and the jury has to listen to all of those songs. So the ones they'll remember are the ones that stand out as being different and Bambie Thug's song is different. Even if they don't like them they'll listen to what stands out as being different.\n\n\"The thing about Bambie Thug is that it works...it's a very visual thing the way they presented themselves. It's different enough to be eye-catching.", "source": {"uri": "corkbeo.ie", "dataType": "news", "title": "Cork Beo"}, "authors": [{"uri": "joe_o_shea@corkbeo.ie", "name": "Joe O'Shea", "type":

Bambie made a big impression on in Tuesday's semi-final - becoming the first Irish act to make it to the final since 2018.\n\nAnd the Cork crooner is fifth favourite with the bookies to take the Eurovision title. But this year's contest isn't without controversy due to Israel's participation, following a seven-month attack on Gaza which resulted in more than 34,000 Palestinians losing their lives.\n\nRead more: Number of tents along Grand Canal jumps to 100\n\nRead more: Gardai probe if Drimnagh gun victim was killed accidentally by his own side\n\nBambie faced a considerable amount of backlash from a cross-section of Irish society, and a letter calling for Bambie to boycott the competition together with the Palestinian appeal had been signed by 400 Irish artists, reports the Irish Mirror. Bambie insisted they stand for \"pro-justice\" and \"pro-peace\" before detailing the reason behind their change of message.\n\n\"Unfortunately, I had to change those messages today to 'Crown the witch' only in order from the EBU,\" they explained. The press pack responded with a round of applause to their statement.\n\nA rep for the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) clarified: \"The writing seen on Bambie Thug's body during dress rehearsals contravened contest rules that are designed to protect the non-political nature of the event.

Trying to curse it out of me.\"\n\nAfter shooting to fame with their debut single Birthday in 2021, Bambie Thug has gone on to play big festivals like Download, and Brighton's The Great Escape.\n\nSpeaking to the Irish Mirror about their childhood, they said: \"Growing up in a small place, the furthest I would go was to say I was different.\n\n\"I don't think it was until I moved away, and I came out that I really took agency over myself.\n\nThey went on: \"I moved to London when I was twenty and that's when I really felt I became myself.\n\n\"But learning to stand strong within yourself in the face of everyone else is a constant learning.\"\n\nBambie Thug identifies as non-binary and uses the pronouns they/them.\n\n\"It's important if we are going to be breaking [through] so that younger kids and teens listening to our music, and looking up to us, aren't fed this negative behaviour.\"\n\nBefore Bambie Thug came along, Ireland hadn't qualified for the Eurovision final since 2018.\n\nBut those six years of hurt came to an end on May 7, 2024, when they won a place in the grand final after taking part in the semi-final.\n\nThey were such a hit, that fans started the hashtag #CrownTheWitch, as they championed the singer to win Eurovision.\n\nBambie Thug were previously picked to represent Ireland in the Eurovision semi-finals after winning the Late Late Eurosong contest in January 2024.", "source": {"uri": "thesun.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Sun"}, "authors": [{"uri": "joanne_kavanagh@thesun.co.uk", "name": "Joanne Kavanagh",

My delegation and I fought against this and the EBU eventually agreed to let the ceasefire remain.\n\n\"About an hour before my call time I was informed that they had an internal meeting and ceasefire was no longer acceptable, and if I didn't remove this I would not be allowed on stage.\"\n\nBambie made their stance clear and expressed their deepest sympathies with the people of Palestine as they added: \"I am pro justice and pro peace and this will never change, I only hope with a platform I can reach more peoples ears.\n\n\"My heart and prayers are with the people of Palestine #eyesonrafah and to be clear - being pro-Palestinian does not mean I am anti-semitic, it means I am anti-war, anti-occupation, anti-oppression and anti-killing of innocent civilians and children!!\"", "source": {"uri": "thesun.ie", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Irish Sun"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurovision_Song_Contest", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Eurovision Song Contest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ogham", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ogham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceasefire", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ceasefire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Irish people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polish_people", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Polish people"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestine_(region)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Palestine (region)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_nationalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Palestinian nationalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Broadcasting_Union", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "European Broadcasting Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-war_movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anti-war movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Antisemitism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cork_(city)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cork (city)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cork (city)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macroom", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Macroom"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Macroom"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Contests", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Contests", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Contests_and_Sweepstakes", "label": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Contests and Sweepstakes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Contests", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Contests", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Songwriting", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Songwriting", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 80}], "image": "https://www.thesun.ie/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/05/newspress-collage-21jtwyuoo-1715273571603.jpg?1715277192&strip=all&quality=100&w=1920&h=1080&crop=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9548589", "eventUri": "eng-9548589", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4274509803921569, "wgt": 177, "relevance": 1}

My delegation and I fought against this and the EBU eventually agreed to [let] ceasefire remain.\"\n\nBut, the star continues: \"About an hour before my call time, I was informed they had an internal meeting and 'ceasefire' was no longer acceptable, and if I didn't remove this I would not be allowed on stage.\"\n\n\"I am pro-justice and pro-peace and this will never change, I only hope with a platform I can reach more people's ears. My heart and prayers are with the people of Palestine. To be clear, being pro-Palestinian does not mean I am antisemitic, it means I am anti-war, anti-occupation, anti-oppression and anti-killing of innocent civilians and children.\n\n\"Everyone born into this world should have the right to a home, safety, water, food, freedom and compassion. We must continue to strive to lead with love and look past our differences and remember that under our skin we are one human race and one spirit.\"\n\nSpeaking at a press event after the semi-final, Bambie Thug said: \"It was very important for me [to have these messages on my costume].

After the show, Bambie confirmed the European Broadcasting Union asked them to change the markings as it translates to a pro-Palestinian message.\n\nWritten in Ogham - an ancient Irish alphabet - the markings on their body translated to \"Ceasefire\" and \"Saoirse Don Phalistin\".\n\nSpeaking at the semi-final winner's press conference, they said: \"Unfortunately, I had to change those messages today to 'crown the witch' only (which was an) order from the EBU.\" When asked why they included those \"hidden\" messages in their performance, they said it was important to them as they are \"pro-justice\" and \"pro-peace\".\n\nA spokeswoman for the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) said: \"The writing seen on Bambie Thug's body during dress rehearsals contravened contest rules that are designed to protect the non-political nature of the event.\n\n\"After discussions with the Irish delegation, they agreed to change the text for the live show.\"\n\nBambie wasn't the only person on stage last night attempting to send a message for peace in Palestine last night. The European Broadcasting Union has said it \"regrets\" Swedish singer Eric Saade wearing a keffiyeh on his arm during the opening act of the semi-final in Malmo.\n\nThe former Swedish entrant was not competing and had the symbol, commonly used by people who want to show they are pro-Palestinian, on his arm.\n\nA spokesperson said: \"The Eurovision Song Contest is a live TV show. All performers are made aware of the rules of the contest, and we regret that Eric Saade chose to compromise the non-political nature of the event.\" Saade had earlier seemed to hit out at the boycott around flags from the country.\n\nHe wrote on Instagram questioning if freedom is \"controversial\" and why people keep asking if it is \"political\".\n\nIrish Eurovision superstar Johnny Logan, who now shares his record double-win at the contest with Sweden's Loreen, took to the stage at Malmo Arena to belt out her hit Euphoria.\n\nLoreen, who was crowned for a second time in Liverpool with Tattoo, first won the competition in 2012 for Sweden with Euphoria.\n\nIrish winner Logan, 69, had a full orchestra as he made the lyrics more emotional and was greeted by applause from the audience.\n\nFinland's Windows95man has appeared not to wear underwear on stage as he competes in Eurovision.\n\nThe DJ and artist, whose real name is Teemu Keisteri, used clever camera angles to make it look like he was in the nude at Malmo Arena during Tuesday's semi-final.\n\nPerforming his track No Rules!, Windows95man first emerged from an egg-shaped patchwork blue jean enclosure before later in the song being given short cut-off denims that were attached to ropes that had sparks coming out of them.", "source": {"uri": "irishexaminer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Irish Examiner"},

Ireland held the record number of wins until Sweden won last year.\n\nBut what else is there to know Bambie Thug as they progress to the Grand Final? Read on to find out.\n\nSelf-professed \"goth gremlin goblin witch\" and \"ouija pop star\", Bambie Thug is an Irish singer-songwriter who has been smashing through gender and socio-political stereotypes with their unique take on pop, rock and electronic music.\n\nHaving performed in various festivals, including Download, The Great Escape and Trans Musicales, it came as no surprise that Bambie has found themselves in the Eurovision 2024 final!\n\nBambie Thug entered the Eurovision 2024 competition with Doomsday Blue, which has been described as \"the feeling of having your potential overlooked, and is an ode to the queer community\".\n\nYou can listen to the full song here:\n\nBambie has said it feels \"really beautiful\" to be appreciated by fans from Ireland during the contest.\n\n\"There is something that makes my heart so warm about having the country see my art, my stuff, because this is what raised me,\" they said (via The Independent).\n\nThey continued: \"This is my roots, this is the ground that birthed me and is the reason I write the way I do.\"\n\nIn 2023, Ireland was represented by Wild Youth and came in 12th place at the first semi-final, not making it into the Grand Final.\n\nThe Eurovision Song Contest has faced significant criticism over its decision to allow Israel to compete in this year's competition in light of the current situation in Gaza and the Middle East, with some fans and members of the music industry calling for a boycott of the ceremony.\n\nNoel Curran - director general of the European Broadcasting Union (EBU), which organises Eurovision - has said in a statement: \"We understand the concerns and deeply held views around the current conflict in the Middle East. We can't fail to be moved by the profound suffering of all those caught up in this terrible war.\n\n\"However, the Eurovision Song Contest is a non-political music event and a competition between public service broadcasters who are members of the EBU. It is not a contest between governments.\n\n\"As a member-led organisation, our governing bodies - the Eurovision Song Contest Reference Group and the Executive Board - did review the participants list for the 2024 Contest and agreed that the Israeli public broadcaster KAN met all the competition rules for this year and can participate as it has for the past 50 years.\"\n\nThe artists taking part in this year's contest have also faced backlash for not pulling out of the ceremony, including the UK's act Olly Alexander, who signed a joint statement alongside other entrants explaining they \"do not feel comfortable being silent\".\n\n\"It is important to us to stand in solidarity with the oppressed and communicate our heartfelt wish for peace, an immediate and lasting ceasefire, and the safe return of all hostages,\" the statement read. \"We stand united against all forms of hate, including anti-Semitism and Islamophobia.\n\n\"We firmly believe in the unifying power of music, enabling people to transcend differences and foster meaningful conversations and connections.

Last night, Bambie Thug smashed it out of the park in the semis and officially qualified for the Eurovision grand final.\n\nThey subsequently claimed that the European Broadcasting Union made them remove messages in solidarity with Palestine shortly before their semi-final performance.\n\nBambie Thug's music has been inspired by various subjects, including witchcraft, and drug addiction. A \"hex\" is another word for a magic curse: an evil spell that brings bad luck and trouble, in other words.\n\nThis - combined with the fact that Bambie Thug is non-binary, led president of the far-right Irish Freedom Party Hermann Kelly to complain, tweeting: \"Bambie Thug must be the biggest turkey since Dustin the Turkey. Seems celebrating satanism and 'non-binary' Woke nonsense is the fashion of the Irish Establishment\".\n\nA petition was then launched demanding that Bambie Thug be disqualified from Eurovision. In response, they released a statement that said: \"If you don't want to be part of the Haus Of Thug you are not obligated to come on this journey with me... don't waste your life hung up [on] hate.\"\n\nThe subject of hexes in Bambie Thug's Eurovision song came up on Reddit recently, with one user writing: \"I recently came across a comment where the commenter said when they listened to 'Doomsday Blue', they knew Bambie Thug placed a hex in the lyrics.\n\n\"When I looked at Bambie Thug's Wikipedia article, it did mention that numerous spells and hexes are included in various songs they have created.\n\n\"So it got me curious and thinking what the Eurovision fans' (those who are spiritual and/or religious and those who aren't) opinions on this? If there has been a hex or a spell placed on the song does it change anyone's thoughts and feelings on it? How do you feel about a hex or spell... being placed on the song?\"\n\nThe commenters didn't seem too phased about the alleged \"hex\", with one writing: \"I'd feel honoured to be hexed by Bambie.\"\n\nAnother quipped: \"It damn well better have a spell in it or I've been sacrificing all these children for nothing.\"\n\nA third said: \"I'm someone who happens to know a s**t ton of witches and occasionally dabbles with them (I don't believe in magic but rituals are fun and I've learned a ton by osmosis). If there's a hex in the song, it will be targeting one single person who probably isn't you.\"\n\nFunnily enough, \"Doomsday Blue\" actually starts with a Harry Potter quote: \"Avada Kedavra, I speak to destroy.\" Avada Kedavra was the so-called \"killing curse\" in JK Rowling's series of fantasy novels.\n\nAs Bambie Thug is non-binary, and Harry Potter author JK Rowling is famously outspoken about trans and non-binary rights, often criticising gender-neutral language and advocating for cisgender-women-only spaces, it's certainly an interesting choice of opening line.\n\nThe song starts: \"Avada Kedavra, I speak to destroy / The feelings I have, I cannot avoid / Through twisted tongues, a hex deployed on you / That all the pretties in your bed / Escape your hands and make you sad\n\n/ And all the things you wish you had you'd lose.\"\n\nYou can read the rest of the lyrics here.\n\nThe 2024 Eurovision Song Contest Grand Final will take place on Saturday 11 May.", "source": {"uri": "thepinknews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "PinkNews | Latest lesbian, gay, bi and trans news | LGBTQ+ news"}, "authors": [{"uri": "hilary_mitchell@thepinknews.com", "name": "Hilary Mitchell", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-binary_gender", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Non-binary gender"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurovision_Song_Contest", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Eurovision Song Contest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Curse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outernet_London", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Outernet London"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_(supernatural)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Magic (supernatural)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Broadcasting_Union", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "European Broadcasting Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Addiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Witchcraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Witchcraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woke", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Woke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_Freedom_Party", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Irish Freedom Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermann_Kelly", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hermann Kelly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wikipedia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satanism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Satanism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reddit", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Reddit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far-right_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Far-right politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Turkey"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Turkey"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender-neutral_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gender-neutral language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_in_Harry_Potter", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Magic in Harry Potter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ritual", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ritual"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Potter", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Harry Potter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._K._Rowling", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "J.

They impressed the European fans with an unusual performance and a spectacular song Doomsday Blue.\n\nAt first, the representative came on stage in a black grunge dress with feathers, and dark horns could be seen on the head of the \"witch\" Bambie. Later, they shed the costume and appeared in an extravagant outfit.\n\nDuring the performance, there was a real \"demonic\" thing going on on stage: Bambie Thug lit candles around the pentagram, dancing with a mysterious mythical creature - a faun.\n\nThe competition track Doomsday Blue is an ensemble of different genres. According to Eurovision.TV, Bambie Thug breaks down gender and socio-political stereotypes, creating an era-defining sound that borders on elements of pop, rock, electronica, and more. The song of the Irish representative tells about the feeling of being overlooked for your potential and is also an ode to the queer community.\n\nThroughout Bambie's performance, the Malm\u00f6 Arena hall was filled with screams of European fans who were amazed by what was happening on stage. At the end of the song, the audience gave the participant a generous ovation. According to bookmakers' forecasts, Ireland has a good chance to take a high place in the Eurovision Grand Final. Popular bookmakers estimated the chances of the Irish \"witch\" at 5%, suggesting that they will take sixth place among the finalists.\n\nEuro fans actively share their impressions on social network X (Twitter):\n\n\"I can't believe I just witnessed the best 30 seconds in the history of Eurovision, and this is from Ireland?\"\n\n\"I don't care if Ireland doesn't win, this is the best Eurovision performance ever.\"\n\n\"That was awesome!!! Ireland shows why they won 7 times... That's how you win back. One of the best performances I've ever seen.\"", "source": {"uri": "eng.obozrevatel.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Obozrevatel"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurovision_Song_Contest", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Eurovision Song Contest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malm\u00f6_Arena", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Malm\u00f6 Arena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eschatology", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Eschatology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-binary_gender", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Non-binary gender"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_horn", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "French horn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eccentricity_(behavior)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eccentricity (behavior)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malm\u00f6", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Malm\u00f6"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grunge", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Grunge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Witchcraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Witchcraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentagram", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pentagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faun", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Faun"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Demon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronica", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electronica"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereotype", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stereotype"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gender"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pop music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rock music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bookmaker_(gambling)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bookmaker (gambling)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT_community", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "LGBT community"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_network", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social network"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Contests", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Contests", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Contests_and_Sweepstakes", "label": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Contests and Sweepstakes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Contests", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Contests", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Weddings/Music", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Weddings/Music", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Songwriting", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Songwriting", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://i2.obozrevatel.com/news/2024/5/8/filestoragetemp-2024-05-07t232038-798.jpg?size=2010x1050", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9548589", "eventUri": "eng-9548589", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 168, "relevance": 1}

Back then, I didn't know it would one day be called a 'political symbol by EBU. It's like calling the 'Swedish Dala horse' a political symbol...

The performer responded to the letter via Instagram on March 29, saying that \"stepping back now would mean one less pro-Palestinian voice at the contest.\" The performer ended up qualifying for the contest's grand final Tuesday, the first time Ireland has advanced to the final round since 2018.\n\nThis year's competition has generated a lot of controversy related to the war in Gaza. Many activists and viewers have criticized organizers for allowing Israel to participate in the contest, so much so that the official Eurovision website includes a page of Frequently Asked Questions dedicated to addressing this issue. Officials have increased security in Malmo because of the thousands of people expected to protest Israel's participation in the contest. Pro-Palestinian protests are expected to coincide with the competition's second semi-final and the grand final Thursday and Saturday, respectively.", "source": {"uri": "time.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TIME"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Saade", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Eric Saade"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keffiyeh", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Keffiyeh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurovision_Song_Contest", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Eurovision Song Contest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Broadcasting_Union", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "European Broadcasting Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_nationalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Palestinian nationalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hijab", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hijab"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malm\u00f6", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Malm\u00f6"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "BBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnicity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ethnicity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ogham", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ogham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceasefire", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ceasefire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Irish_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Irish Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celts", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Celts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Racism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boycott", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boycott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Witchcraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Witchcraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Contests", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Contests", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Lumberjack", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Lumberjack", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Contests_and_Sweepstakes", "label": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Contests and Sweepstakes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Contests", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Contests", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Strength_Sports/Strongman", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Strength Sports/Strongman", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Eric-Saade-Eurovision.jpg?quality=85&w=1024&h=628&crop=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9548589", "eventUri": "eng-9548589", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-03-29", "textStart": 3152, "textEnd": 3160}], "sentiment": -0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 163, "relevance": 1}

described their song as \"explosive\" and \"hard-hitting\".\n\nThe artist does not shy away from heavy-hitting topics, and found themselves caught up in controversy on Tuesday after they revealed the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) had mandated the removal of a pro-Palestinian message from their performance just before they performed.\n\nBambie Thug had attempted to display a messages in Ogham script on their face and leg, messages advocating for a \"Ceasefire\" and \"Freedom for Palestine\".\n\nA spokeswoman for the EBU later clarified that the written statements on Bambie Thug's body during dress rehearsals breached contest regulations, which aim to preserve the apolitical essence of the event.\n\nThis decision came amidst significant backlash from various segments of Irish society when 400 Irish musicians, artists, dancers, writers, and poets had penned a letter urging Bambie to honour the Palestinian call for a competition boycott as Israel's war on Gaza continues.\n\nWho is Bambie Thug?\n\nRobinson is from Cork, in Ireland and initially pursued ballet and studied dance at Col\u00e1iste Stiof\u00e1in Naofa, then transitioning to musical theatre studies at the Urdang Academy in London after receiving a partial scholarship.\n\nAfter graduating, Robinson ditched the leotard and pursued songwriting and singing, spending two years honing their skills before their music career took off in 2020 with their feature on the song \"Mean\" by Fike and Fabich.\n\nIn 2021, Robinson released their debut single \"Birthday,\" a reflection of their tumultuous experiences, followed by several other singles throughout the year, each delving into themes of self-discovery, sexuality, and substance use.\n\nPersonal struggles intertwined with artistic expression as Robinson navigated a toxic relationship which inspired the release of \"Merry Christmas Baby\" in 2022.\n\nHow did Bambie Thug get selected for Eurovision?\n\nIn 2024, Robinson's journey reached a turning point as they clinched victory in Ireland's Eurovision Song Contest with \"Doomsday Blue.\"\n\nDespite criticism from some sections of conservative Ireland for identifying as they/their, Robinson triumphed in both national jury and televote, securing Ireland's nomination for Eurovision.\n\nAdvancing to the Eurovision semi-final, Robinson secured a spot in the final alongside nine others and is an outside favourite to win the competition at 14/1.\n\nWhat are the lyrics to 'Doomsday Blue'?\n\nAvada Kedavra, I speak to destroy\n\nThe feelings I have, I cannot avoid\n\nThrough twisted tongues, a hex deployed on you\n\nThat all the pretties in your bed\n\nEscape your hands and make you sad\n\nAnd all the things you wish you had you'd lose\n\nAvada Kedavra, the thoughts in my head\n\nThe places I touch when lying in bed\n\nThe visions of you, the words that you said, undo\n\nMy heartbeat buried in the ground\n\nAnd to the strings I bind, you're bound\n\nSo when you sleep, you'll hear the sound (ah!)\n\nFor your romance, I'd beg, steal and borrow\n\nIt's draining me hollow, you\n\n(I guess you'd rather have a)\n\n(Star than the moon) you slow dance me out of my sorrow\n\n(I guess you'd rather have a star than the moon) but your favourite colour\n\nCompared to the others is doom, doomsday blue", "source": {"uri": "inews.co.uk", "dataType":

They appeared on stage in a witch's costume: a dark outfit with a corset and a fluffy skirt.\n\nAccording to Metro, Bambie Thug were forced to change the inscription on their body, which was encrypted using the Ogham script, an early medieval alphabet. It was used in early Irish and later in Old Irish. Its Ogham script was translated as \"ceasefire,\" a direct reference to the war between Israel and Hamas.\n\n\"The inscriptions seen on Bambie Thug's body during the dress rehearsals contradict the contest rules aimed at protecting the non-political nature of the event. After discussions with the Irish delegation, they agreed to change the text for the live broadcast,\" the European Broadcasting Union said.\n\nIt is worth noting that Bambie Thug has previously spoken out about the need to boycott Israel both in political discourse and at Eurovision. According to the star, the Palestinian-Israeli conflict can be compared to the war in Ukraine.\n\n\"When the events with Ukraine were happening, Russia was not allowed to enter, so I don't think there should be one rule for some and another for others,\" the singer said, thus comparing Palestine to Ukraine.\n\nWe also know about the star's orientation. Bambie Thug uses the pronouns they/them, becoming the first non-binary artist to represent Ireland in a song contest. Last November, they admitted that realizing their non-binary allowed them to \"be freer as a person and therefore freer in music.\"\n\nThe song of the Australian duo Electric Fields, who performed One Milkali (One Blood), was also special.

All pretty metal, basically. The performance peaked with Bambie shedding their black, feathered garb to reveal a tattered two-piece decked in the colours of the trans pride flag.\n\nBambie Thug, who identifies as non-binary, has openly supported trans rights from the start of their career, telling Metal Hammer in 2022: \"The only way to help other people is to share your own problems. When I was 14 or 15, I would have really liked that. Being gender dysmorphic is a very hard place to be.\"\n\n\"I want to have massive stadium tours\", they added of their ambitions for the future. \"I want to use all of my theatre kid training to build massive sets and put on an absolute show.\"\n\nStadium tours may have to wait for now, but The Macroom, Cork native took a huge step forwards in their career last night by being voted through to the Eurovision final on Saturday, alongside artists representing Serbia, Portugal, Slovenia, Ukraine, Lithuania, Finland, Cyprus, Croatia and Luxembourg.\n\nWatch Bambie Thug's Eurovision semi-final performance of Doomsday Blue below.

I'm just a show-off, basically!' they said.\n\nThe performer and song have also got the full support of Johnny, who said it was 'probably the best and most original entry that Ireland has had for as long as I can remember'.\n\n'I think it's a very good choice and it will definitely get attention. What I saw last night is that it was eye-catching and different.'\n\nHe added he would be 'quite surprised' if it didn't do well but said this 'has a really good chance'.\n\nAfter Bambie qualified for the final on Tuesday night, Ireland's Taoiseach Simon Harris hailed their achievement and said it was 'time to bring the Eurovision back to Ireland'.\n\nEurovision 2024 is being broadcast by the BBC. The second Semi-Final airs Thursday at 8pm on BBC1.\n\nIf you've got a celebrity story, video or pictures get in touch with the Metro.co.uk entertainment team by emailing us celebtips@metro.co.uk,

Now Ireland's 2024 entry Bambie Thug is hoping to push boundaries even further\n\nPowered by sequins, glitter and cheese, Eurovision once felt like the antithesis of metal - but that's all changing. Over the past two decades, the annual song contest has warmed up to the heavier side of life. In 2006, Finnish monster-men Lordi bagged the win with Hard Rock Hallelujah, their pyro-enhanced performance serving as a watershed moment for metal in the competition.\n\nIt opened the floodgates for the likes of string-loving Finns Apocalyptica to join in, along with their countrymen The Rasmus, while Italian glamrockers M\u00e5neskin even took the crown in 2021. Last year, Australia's synthhappy prog-metallers Voyager and German industrial-glam goths Lord Of The Lost participated in the final, held in Liverpool.\n\nThis year's competition, in Malm\u00f6, Sweden, is set to welcome even more alternative acts, pushing the boundaries for what alternative music can look and sound like in 2024. San Marino's entry, Megara, will be raising a defiant middle-finger with their flamenco-infused rock anthem, 11:11. Elsewhere, Norway's G\u00e5te are a Nordic folk group in the vein of Wardruna and Heilung, who are offering a modern interpretation of a 1,000-year-old medieval Scandinavian ballad with Ulveham.\n\nIrish nu gen star Bambie Thug is also set to challenge public perceptions - not only when it comes to music and image, but to the gothic subculture as a whole. \"I don't think goths get enough of a spotlight,\" says Bambie. \"Just like with metal, the public love to assume we're Satanists, or say my track would be so much better without the screaming.\"\n\nBambie has coined the term 'ouija-pop' to describe their music, and their entry, Doomsday Blue - taken from their 2023 EP, Cathexis - combines the grit of industrial torment with a feather-light, alt pop sheen. \"I think it highlights a lot of different facets of my sound,\" Bambie explains. \"It's like a three-minute burst of musical theatre with separate acts.\"\n\nWith their glam outfits and elaborate make-up looks, Bambie is the perfect fit for Eurovision - loads of children have already fallen in love with them, considering them to be a living, breathing goth-Barbie. \"I keep getting sent videos of kids dressed up in my make-up, or toddlers dancing along to Doomsday Blue,\" the singer laughs.\n\nFor the sake of their younger fans, Bambie even made sure the music video wasn't too scary. \"We tried to make the monster look a bit more kind,\" Bambie smiles. \"He's a lot less demonic and gory than when I first envisioned him.\"\n\nAlongside their youthful fans, Bambie has been championed by the drag and queer community, as Ireland's first non-binary participant in the competition. \"I think me and Nemo, this year's Switzerland entry, are the first people to enter Eurovision while identifying as non-binary,\" they explain.\n\nLots of national support has been thrown Bambie's way, including praise from Ireland's 2022 entrant, Brooke Scullion. But while BBC commentator Graham Norton is from Bambie's home county of Cork, they aren't expecting any preferential treatment. \"If Graham Norton ripped into me, I would totally respect it,\" they say with a chuckle. \"But I'm hoping that he'll be kind - Cork solidarity.\"\n\nFor all the backing they've received, there are always people who will question why any alternative act - explicitly metal or otherwise - would want to participate in Europe's biggest pop contest. Putting aside the fact that Eurovision gives artists a chance to reach scores of viewers around the world - in 2023, it reached 162 million viewers with record-breaking online engagement - it also serves as an amazing proving ground for up-andcoming acts.\n\nFinland's Blind Channel know this all too well - they reached number six in the contest in 2021, and found their online streams and live audiences exploding afterwards. As vocalist Joel Hokka explains, Eurovision was just the challenge they needed.\n\nHe fondly recalls the experience as an important \"school\", pushing them to become better performers, as well as earning them a record deal. \"The whole experience felt like a fairytale,\" he says. \"We now know how to handle pressure more than many other bands. We've had over 200 million eyes on us - after that, almost any show feels like a nice picnic with friends!\"\n\nWhile not all metal acts have succeeded in Eurovision - Lord Of The Lost came last in 2023 - Bambie is going into the competition with their head held high, quietly hopeful that they'll impress. \"I'd love to win, obviously,\" they laugh. \"But just being seen by so many people will be amazing. Knowing I've got the support of my country is going to make it a lot less scary.\"\n\n\"Honestly, I feel ready,\" Bambie concludes. \"It's going to be an honour to represent the alt scene and nonbinary people on such a big stage. It's about time Eurovision represented the European population more accurately. Not everyone is a pop girlie who can do ballet, y'know?\"", "source": {"uri": "loudersound.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "loudersound"}, "authors": [{"uri": "metal_hammer@loudersound.com",

History repeats in rhyme until we learn the lesson.\n\n\"An important piece of music that needs to be remembered and is sadly still so relevant to our world today.\"\n\nThe singer from Macroom, Cork, has been criticised by some due to Israel's participation in the competition whilst the bombardment of Gaza continues.\n\nThey had planned on having an Ogham script on their face and legs, which translated \"Ceasefire\" and \"Freedom for Palestine\", during their performance.\n\nHowever, Eurovision bosses asked Bambie to change hidden pro-Palestinian messages on their costume during rehearsal.\n\nBambie explained how they're doing \"everything\" they can to support Palestine.\n\nThey said: \"I know many of you have varying opinions on my position at the moment but I am truly doing everything in my power that I can to support.\n\n\"After my first dress rehearsal I was asked to remove both free Palestine and ceasefire in ogham from my outfit. My delegation and I fought against this and the EBU eventually agreed to let the ceasefire remain.\n\n\"About an hour before my call time I was informed that they had an internal meeting and ceasefire was no longer acceptable, and if I didn't remove this I would not be allowed on stage.\"\n\nBambie made their stance clear and expressed their deepest sympathies with the people of Palestine as they added: \"I am pro justice and pro peace and this will never change, I only hope with a platform I can reach more peoples ears.\n\n\"My heart and prayers are with the people of Palestine #eyesonrafah and to be clear - being pro-Palestinian does not mean I am anti-semitic, it means I am anti-war, anti-occupation, anti-oppression and anti-killing of innocent civilians and children!!\n\n\"Everyone born into this world should have the right to a home, safety, water, food, freedom and compassion.\n\n\"We must continue to strive to lead with love and look past our differences and remember that under our skin we are one human race and one spirit.\n\n\"Wake up world it is never too late to regain your conscience and admit that change must be made in the name of love.\"\n\nBambie Thug's fans all praised her for having the courage to speak up and called her a \"role model\".\n\nRose commented: \"Thank you Bambie for standing up for what's right! I'll vote for you in the final on Saturday.\"\n\nElendil wrote: \"Thank you for not allowing them to silence you and for speaking the truth when others would hide out - speaking up for what is right, for values and ethics just shows the world once again what a beautiful soul you are.\n\n\"Your Eurovision performance is already legendary, but it is also your words and deeds that will be remembered for eternity.\"\n\nJosh said: \"You are a role model and a voice this world needs.

But the \"ouija pop\" sensation has come under increasing scrutiny since they burst onto the scene back in January.\n\nLast month, more than 400 Irish artists signed a letter to Bambie Thug calling on the singer to boycott the contest over Israel's participation in the event. As the war in Gaza escalates, there have been calls for the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) to have Israel removed from the competition, as Russia was in the wake of its invasion of Ukraine in 2022.\n\nIn the run-up to Saturday's final, Bambie Thug said those who want them to boycott the contest said they should \"be contacting the EBU and RT\u00c9 more than me\". \"We are easy targets as artists. I don't think it's entirely fair to bully us so much,\" said the singer.\n\nToday on The Indo Daily, Fionn\u00e1n Sheahan is joined by the podcast's own Garrett Mulhall and Dave Hanratty, and Kirsty Blake Knox, features writer with the Irish Independent, to debate and discuss Ireland's divisive finalist and to ask whether or not they - and we - should instead be boycotting the competition.", "source": {"uri": "independent.ie", "dataType": "news", "title": "Irish Independent"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurovision_Song_Contest", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eurovision Song Contest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malm\u00f6", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Malm\u00f6"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cork_(city)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cork (city)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cork (city)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Russian invasion of Ukraine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Broadcasting_Union", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "European Broadcasting Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boycott", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boycott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RT\u00c9", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "RT\u00c9"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_Independent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Irish Independent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullying", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bullying"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Contests", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Contests", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Part-Time_Employment", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Part-Time Employment", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Contests_and_Sweepstakes", "label": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Contests and Sweepstakes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Contests", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Contests", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Songwriting", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Songwriting", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.independent.ie/extra/assets/img/dummy-social.gif", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9548589", "eventUri": "eng-9548589", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 148, "relevance": 1}

I was holed up in a room trying not to have a breakdown.\n\n'Normally, you get on stage and turn it on, but I felt really unable to do that.\n\n'It was tough - I just could not get it together and then I felt ashamed of myself and embarrassed.\n\n'Obviously there are a lot of things I wish were different and this is so much bigger than me and Eurovision, it really is.\n\nThis year's competition is taking place in Malmo after Swedish singer Loreen's song Tattoo won the contest last year\n\n'Obviously, I wish there wasn't a war or this insane humanitarian crisis.

'Unfortunately, I had to change those messages today to \"crown the witch\" only (which was an) order from the EBU.'\n\nA spokeswoman for the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) said: 'The writing seen on Bambie Thug's body during dress rehearsals contravened contest rules that are designed to protect the non-political nature of the event.\n\n'After discussions with the Irish delegation, they agreed to change the text for the live show.'\n\nThe body had previously warned that Palestinian flags and symbols would not be allowed in Malmo Arena.\n\nDespite this, former Swedish Eurovision contestant and opening act Eric Saade had a symbol, commonly used by people who want to show they are pro-Palestinian, on his arm.\n\nThe EBU said that it 'regrets' that Saade chose to wear the keffiyeh pattern material and 'chose to compromise the non-political nature of the event'.\n\nCroatia\n\nBaby Lasagna\n\nCroatian singer Marko Purisic, aka Baby Lasagna, representing Croatia with his song 'Rim Tim Tagi Dim' at the first semi final\n\nCroatian singer-songwriter Baby Lasagna's infectious electro number 'Rim Tim Tagi Dim' is the current favourite to win.\n\nHis real name is Marko Puri\u0161i\u0107 and he aims to convey a deeper message about the worries and suffering of the environment within his music.\n\nHis track is about a young Croatian who leaves his home aspiring to become a 'city boy' with better opportunities.\n\nThe singer, from Umag, Croatia, often performs as part of duo Mono Inc. with his younger brother Martin, who is also in the music industry.\n\nPuri\u0161i\u0107 took part in the Croatian selection process for Eurovision with the song that has got him through to the final and it became the first track of his to enter the charts in Croatia.\n\nAccording to Croatia outlet Vecernji List, Puri\u0161i\u0107 got the name Baby Lasagna when he was walking around the supermarket looking for pills to take to cure his headache.\n\nIt suddenly popped into his head and it stuck, despite him not being a fan of the Italian dish.

I think I'm really just very excited about everything.\n\n'And I mean, from the first moment I stepped into this I just wanted to create something that really reflects the song on stage and that enhances the song and just have fun with it and create something beautiful that means a lot to me and I think we really managed to do that.'\n\nNemo also said that if they 'knew the recipe' to be a strong contender, then they would make 'a lot of money' out of writing Eurovision songs.\n\nThey added: 'I think all that you can do as an artist in general, like even outside of Eurovision, is just listen to your heart and write about things that really mean something to you.\n\n'And if you write about something that means a lot to you. And it's personal, I think chances are there that people can relate to the feeling and people.\n\n'And I'm super grateful for all the amazing reception and all the love people give me and the song and to see how many people really, truly connect with it has been amazing.'\n\nThey were also part of several competitors who called for a ceasefire in the Gaza strip ahead of Eurovision, but rejected calls to boycott the event over Israel competing.\n\nNemo said that 'it was very important to not just stay silent' and they hope that people are encouraged to 'inform themselves about the whole situation and not just turn a blind eye on it and ignore it or try to push it away'.\n\n'Really, just remember information is power and inform yourself,' they added. 'I think it's important to, to use our platform to raise awareness, in all kinds of... all kinds of things.\n\n'For me, it's a lot of what I talk about... being queer, being non binary and, just honestly, like being myself at Eurovision in hopes that it inspires other people to be themselves as well and feel seen.\n\n'And I think it's amazing that we have lots of queer representation this year, for people to see, I think it's a lot about seeing other people that are like you.\n\n'I mean, it helped me in my life to truly realise who I am, like, through seeing other people that I that I could admire or like that I could look up to. So I think that's a big part of what I'm trying to do here.'\n\nSweden\n\nMarcus & Martinus of Sweden perform the song Unforgettable during the first semi final\n\nMarcus & Martinus are competing in the Eurovision contest on behalf of Sweden with their song 'Unforgettable'.\n\nThe pair are no stranger to fame and have achieved a top 10 hit in Norway aged just nine years old called Dr\u00e5per Vann.\n\nThe twins already have a large following in Scandinavia as they had a second consecutive hit, 'Elektrisk', which was in the Norwegian charts for a whopping 66 weeks.\n\nThis isn't the first time that the duo - who are used to playing at sold out arenas and have more than 1.5 billion streams - have tried to represent their Swedish neighbours at Eurovision.\n\nThey attempted to get onto the show last year but were beaten by Loreen and her song 'Tattoo' which went on to win Eurovision.\n\nThey told the Independent: 'To get through and represent Sweden is amazing, it's a dream come true to represent a country with such a big legacy at Eurovision.'\n\nUkraine\n\nalyona alyona & Jerry Heil of Ukraine perform the song Teresa & Maria during the dress rehearsal for the first semi final\n\nAlyona Alyona, a 32-year-old rapper is collaborating with singer Jerry Heil, 28, for Ukraine in this year's contest.\n\nThe pair will sing a song called Teresa & Maria, which was written to remind people that everyone is capable of achieving great heights and that 'all the divas were born as human beings.'\n\nAlyona - real name Aliona Olehivna Savranenko - is a co-founder of the local major label that Eurovision Song Contest 2022 winners Kalush Orchestra are signed with.\n\nAmong her numerous awards, Alyona also won a Public's Choice Award in 2021 at the Music Moves Europe Talent Awards contest.\n\nJerry and Alyona also created a fundraiser through UNITED24 to rebuild the Velykokostromska School in Dnipro after it was destroyed by Russian missiles in October 2022.\n\nJerry told Euronews that education is crucial to the long-term war effort because it will be the 'children who rebuild the country after us. So we have to provide them with a childhood.'\n\nRussia was excluded from Eurovision in 2022 shortly after they invaded Ukraine.\n\nThe pair spoke to the outlet about why it is important for Russia to remain out of the competition.

Bambie - the stage name of Macroom, Co Cork artist Bambie Ray Robinson - had inked the phrase on their skin using the ancient Celtic language of Ogham (pronounced \"ohm\"), having been ordered by the organisers to remove messages of solidarity with Palestine.\n\nThe evocation of witchcraft and Irish paganism was front and centre of Bambie's dramatic staging, which was steeped in pre-Christian imagery. The ancient triskelion Celtic swirl symbol had been pencilled on their forehead. At their feet stared the image of an unblinking eye. This was presumably a reference to Balor of the Evil Eye, a mythological baddie widely understood to have inspired Tolkien's one-eyed villain Sauron.\n\nBambie has given Ireland its first Eurovision finalist since 2018. The non-binary singer's success has been widely hailed as a rare good news story as the country grapples with cost-of-living headaches and an accommodation crisis.\n\nTrue, there were early grumblings about Ireland sending a \"pagan witch\" to one of the biggest stages in music. These voices have been drowned out, however, as the Bambie bandwagon picks up speed.\n\nBambie Thug is something new from a country whose previous Eurovision candidates have included Jedward and a rubber turkey named Dustin. But they are also something old - a thrilling throwback to Ireland's pre-Christian heritage.\n\nThat isn't to say Irish people are all card-carrying pagans. However, recent years have seen an enthusiastic engagement with an older Ireland. One in which national identity wasn't bound up with the narrow morality of the Church - an imposition from abroad rather than genuinely Irish. It is surely no fluke that Bambie's emergence has coincided with the new prominence of St Brigid - a pagan deity representing fire, fertility, poetry and nature whose legacy was shamelessly hijacked by the early Church.\n\nSt Brigid's Day was declared an official public holiday in 2023 and has already become established as a sort of anti-St Patrick's Day. Where 17 March is an excuse for Americans to wear leprechaun beards, St Brigid's Day is a celebration of a more authentic and ancient Irishness - and a symbol of a natural world threatened, as never before, by the climate crisis.\n\nBambie Thug has explored pagan beliefs since growing up outside Macroom, a market town in Co Cork. They recall \"making potions with intentions to untangle my brain when I didn't know how to untangle it. I got into that as a kid. I was out in the sticks, and I had nothing to do!\"\n\nColonialism and the Church did their best to eradicate Ireland's bygone traditions. But they've never quite died off and have lived on in superstitions. Each night before bed, my grandmother would leave out a cup of water - always a cup, never a glass - for the restless spirits she believed wandered the world at night.\n\nShe was a hardcore Catholic. Yet she saw no contradiction between believing in Jesus and in unhappy ghosts. Years later, when my grandfather died, another family member swore they had heard the Banshee howl the night he passed away. In Celtic myth, the Banshee is a spirit who heralds the death of a family member by keening. The person in question was a devoted atheist and did not believe in the supernatural. Still, they insisted, they heard what they heard.\n\nThe noise the Banshee supposedly makes - a sort of supernatural, angst-filled yodel - is not all that far removed from the fantastic \"Ouija pop\" din conjured by Bambie Thug at Eurovision. Ahead of Saturday's final, hopes for a top-10 place for Ireland are rising. But regardless of how well Bambie performs on the night, one thing is beyond question. They are the most \"Irish\" Eurovision act in years.", "source": {"uri": "inews.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "inews.co.uk"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ed_power@inews.co.uk", "name": "Ed Power", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurovision_Song_Contest", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Eurovision Song Contest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paganism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paganism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Witchcraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Witchcraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestine_(region)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Palestine (region)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ogham", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ogham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triskelion", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Triskelion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celtic_languages", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Celtic languages"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Balor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myth", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Myth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._R._R._Tolkien", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "J.

I think the European Broadcasting Union has been incredibly inconsistent when it comes to deciding what is political and what is not political.\n\n\"A couple of years ago they made the decision to expel Russia from the Eurovision Song Contest because of the invasion of Ukraine. They have refused to do the same when it comes to Israel despite the fact more than 34,000 people have been killed since October in Gaza.\n\n\"I know there's a lot of different views on how to proceed with something like this but to even argue the Eurovision Song Contest isn't political is a bit of a fallacy at this point.\n\n\"Of course Eurovision's political, everybody knows it's political.

The 'It's A Sin' singer is currently rated a huge outsider at 80/1 to be crowned champion on Saturday.\n\nThe odds also look to be stacked against Israel (33/1) as debate around boycotting the competition over their participation continues to rage on, according to Boylesports.", "source": {"uri": "independent.ie", "dataType": "news", "title": "Irish Independent"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bookmaker_(gambling)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bookmaker (gambling)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurovision_Song_Contest", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Eurovision Song Contest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croatia", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Croatia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Croatia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BoyleSports", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "BoyleSports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eimear_Quinn", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eimear Quinn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oslo", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oslo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oslo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Norway"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cork_(city)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cork (city)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cork (city)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macroom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Macroom"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Macroom"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olly_Alexander", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Olly Alexander"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Contests", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Contests", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Contests_and_Sweepstakes", "label": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Contests and Sweepstakes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Food/Contests", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Food/Contests", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Contests", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Contests", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Strength_Sports/Strongman", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Strength Sports/Strongman", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 49}], "image": "https://www.independent.ie/extra/assets/img/dummy-social.gif", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9548589", "eventUri": "eng-9548589", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4823529411764707, "wgt": 136, "relevance": 1}

But before Bambie Thug took the stage in Malm\u00f6, Sweden on Tuesday night, they were ordered by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) to change the markings before their performance.

Additionally, musicians have brought political messages to the Eurovision stage for decades, as noted by The Guardian in February.\n\nEurovision faced widespread calls to ban Israel from competition this year, including separate open letters from hundreds of Swedish and Belgian musicians.

Originally, they wore body paint in Ogham script - an early Medieval alphabet - which translated to ceasefire and freedom. It came as a nod to the ongoing conflict in Gaza and in light of Israel's inclusion in the competition.\n\nAccording to a spokesperson for the European Broadcasting Union (EBU), the paint \"contravened contest rules that are designed to protect the non-political nature of the event\" (via Evening Standard).\n\nSpeaking of the change, Bambie Thug said: \"It was very important for me because I'm pro-justice and pro-peace. Unfortunately, I had to change those messages today to 'crown the witch' only (which was an) order from the EBU.\"\n\nThe grand final of the Eurovision Song Contest will be held in Malm\u00f6, Sweden this Saturday (May 11). Ireland has not won the contest in nearly 30 years, taking home the victory in 1996 with Eimear Quinn's song 'The Voice'.\n\nThe nation last reached the final six years ago, when it was represented by Ryan O'Shaughnessy, who placed 16th in Lisbon, Portugal.\n\nThey have been listed as in the top 10 favourites to win the competition this year, and told NME that they are hoping to \"give the best performance I can and try to connect in those three minutes to those millions of viewers\".\n\nThere has been pressure on contestants, including Bambie Thug and UK representative Olly Alexander to boycott the event in solidarity with Palestine. However, in a collective statement, the two reaffirmed their pro-Palestine stance whilst announcing they would not boycott.\n\nRobinson posted an additional statement due to being \"an Irish person with a shared history of occupation and a queer individual\", writing: \"My heart and solidarity has and always will lie with the oppressed, and I remain committed to supporting and using my platform to raise awareness and advocate for change\".\n\nThey also spoke to NME about navigating the controversy, saying: \"It's a lot when I know that my heart is in the right place and when it's not my decision. I have had to take a break from social media because it is weighing on me. A lot of stuff is completely nasty and uncalled for.\n\n\"People should be coming for the EBU and for the broadcasters, not us as artists,\" they added. \"I stand by my statement and I am completely for Palestine, and I think it's ridiculous that it's gone on for so long. I think the world is quite removed from its heart and its consciousness right now.\"\n\nIsrael is set to compete in the 2024 event still, although stirred controversy with their entry song. Originally titled 'October Rain', the song - performed by Eden Golan - appeared to contain references to the victims of Hamas' October 7 attacks and was barred from performance due to breaking rules on political neutrality.\n\nThough Israel originally threatened to withdraw from the competition if any changes were to be made, a call from Israeli president Isaac Herzog for \"necessary adjustments\" to ensure Israel's participation has prompted their public broadcaster KAN to agree to amend the song. On March 9, Israel was confirmed to compete after changes were made to the lyrics and the song's title was changed to 'Hurricane'.\n\nMore recently Eurovision organisers have confirmed that they reserve the right to remove Palestinian flags and pro-Palestinian symbols during this year's final, and have again defended their decision not to boycott Israel over the war in Gaza.\n\nJean Philip De Tender, the deputy director general of the European Broadcasting Union (EBU), said: \"I fully agree it is a family event and the great thing about this music competition is that it's all about values. It's about uniting onstage all of these young talents, these participants, and they do great. It's about diversity and inclusion.\n\n\"But there are competition rules and you need to follow the competition rules and take decisions based on these competition rules. If you were to exclude Kan outside of these competition rules, that would have been a political decision, as such, which we cannot take.\"", "source": {"uri": "nme.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

faced a barrage of boos and chants of 'Free Palestine' when taking to the stage for the competition's Jury Show on Wednesday night.\n\nThe show, which takes place the night before the televised semi-final, is where entries are reviewed and scored by the respective national juries.\n\nIsrael's inclusion in the competition has come under intense scrutiny since the attacks started on Gaza last year.\n\nOne of those in attendance of the show last night posted about their experience on X, saying that the atmosphere inside the venue during Israel's performance was 'horrible'.\n\nThey added that you could 'feel the tension'.\n\nVideos were shared across social media which show loud boos and chants during the entirety of Israel's performance.\n\nThis year, 20-year-old Israeli-Russian singer Eden Golan is representing Israel with her song 'Hurricane',\n\nThe song's original title 'October Rain' received heavy scrutiny as it was inspired by the Hamas attack on Israel last year, which has since led to the killing of over 34,000 Palestinians by Israeli troops.\n\nSince the song was viewed as a political message, the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) demanded it be rewritten and re-worded in February.\n\nAfter multiple re-writes, 'Hurricane' was eventually accepted on March 7 by the EBU.\n\nThere have been a number of protests in Sweden (the host country for this year's contest) over Israel's participation, and a pro-Palestinian march is expected to take place on Thursday, May 9.\n\nIrish entry Bambie Thug has also come under criticism for taking part in the competition this year, despite positioning themself as pro-Palestine.\n\nLast month, over 400 Irish artists called for Bambie Thug to boycott the event in solidarity with Palestine, including Derry Girls actor Siobh\u00e1n McSweeney and singer-songwriter Erica-Cody, who competed against Bambie Thug for a place at Eurovision this year.\n\nThe Cork singer was ordered by the EBU to change their pro-Palestinian message for their semi final performance on Tuesday night.\n\nFollowing their performance, the 31-year-old told a press conference they were forced to change their body paint in Ogham

There were also petitions to withdraw when the contest was staged in Tel Aviv in 2019.\n\nHowever, he said the broadcaster would never take such action.\n\n\"No, because we are a public service broadcaster we don't take political stands on issues when it comes to things like this. The BBC don't, French television don't, STV don't, no public service broadcaster in Europe would,\" he said.\n\n\"Because if we withdraw, that's the end of the Olympics, that's the end of the Euros, that's the end of the World Cup. All the fun in our lives would be taken away.\"\n\nHe also spoke about the pressure placed on Ireland's representative Bambie Thug to withdraw from the contest.\n\n\"There was always going to be a movement there, there was when the Eurovision was in Tel Aviv a few years ago. I saw the protest outside RT\u00c9.\n\n\"Look, this is a song contest. And at the end of the day I think it is very unfair to put pressure on artists to the extent that Bambie has had to endure over the last few months.\n\n\"Some of the abuse that has been directed at them has been pretty vile to be perfectly honest. I don't think there is a place for that.\"\n\nIn Malmo there have been protests and demonstrations taking place in a show of solidarity with Palestine. There is also a pro-Israeli event happening.\n\nThis evening, there is heightened security around the venue as Israel perform in the second semi-final.\n\nAt the dress rehearsal yesterday there was loud booing in the arena when Israel's act performed.\n\nIt is the first time Ireland has qualified for the Grand Final since 2018.\n\nKealy said they were confident this was going to be the year we moved out of semi-final limbo.\n\n\"It is amazing. I always thought Bambie has what it takes to be in the final and now they are in the final I definitely think they have what it takes to win,\" he said.\n\n\"I think our act is so different and unique and it is clearly not everyone's cup of tea just judging by what people say online but you can't ignore it. You cannot ignore it. It is a piece of art, it is a piece of theatre.

Users called them \"the best performer in Eurovision\", and @Emilyyy praised the singer both wearing and waving the trans flag as a highly important move for the moment.\n\nAnother point of praise came from Bambie's subtle protest during the performance. Eurovision has faced criticism this year (including from Bambie) for Israel's inclusion in the competition this year amidst ongoing conflict in Gaza.\n\nBambie revealed that the European Broadcasting Union would not let them put the words 'Ceasefire' and 'Freedom for Palestine' at the end of their performance, and so they instead wrote the words on their body in the ancient Celtic language Ogham.\n\nPerhaps predictably, Bambie's performance is being decried by conservatives on Twitter/X for its visuals and lyrics, as well as the singer's non-binary identity and self-declaration as a 'witch.'\n\nConservative Irish political candidate Rebecca Barrett labelled the performance as \"literally demonic\", saying \"our National broadcaster RT\u00c9 are supporting this open witchcraft. Disgusting.\"\n\nCriminally convicted far-right figurehead Tommy Robinson called it a \"sick\" Satanic ritual, and Oli London (best known for getting plastic surgery to look like Jimin from BTS) was clearly decrying the song for being about \"witchcraft, casting spells and satanic sacrifice.\"\n\nAnother user asked \"Why is this being normalised?! How are we at the stage of literally minimising actual Satanic worship and witchcraft?!\"\n\nHowever, many users mocked the \"pearl-clutching\" reaction to the performance, saying that those reacting to it couldn't see it as a performance.\n\n\"It's a song. It's an act,\" said user Justin Deegan, while Conor Magahy said: \"It is such a joy to witness all these soft headed Christofacists melting like snowflakes because of Bambie Thug.\"\n\nThe controversy is one that Bambie has experienced before - in an interview with Rolling Stone from March, when the song's music video elicited similar responses, they said: \"I think it was iconic to have created such uproar.\n\n\"I'm pissing off the right type of people - people who suppress love, compassion, understanding, people who are slaves to their programming, transphobes, the far-right and a few priests so it seems.\n\n\"These are all things that need a reform of consciousness and the heart. I will never silence my voice or my creativity for anyone. I'm not hurting anyone with my art and frankly the love I've received has far outweighed the hate tenfold.\"\n\nThe grand final for Eurovision airs in Australia on SBS on Sunday May 12th at 5am, and

Thug's Tuesday performance won Ireland a spot in the Eurovision final, a coveted spot that Ireland hasn't gotten since 2018.\n\nThug's performance, singing and dancing to a pop and industrial metal song called \"Doomsday Blue,\" began with the self-described \"ouija pop\" musician wearing a black feathered tutu and a hairdo resembling antlers sprouting from their head. Surrounded by candles and sitting in the middle of a pentagram, they then mimicked the conjuring of a demonic spirit: a shirtless, tattooed man with horns and sharpened fangs wearing tattered leather pants and blue body makeup.\n\nOur newsletter bridges borders to bring you LGBTQ+ news from around the world.\n\nTrained in ballet, Thug and the man seductively danced before the song's mid-point. Then, Thug removed their black outfit to reveal a skimpy, torn bikini in the pink, white, and blue colors of the trans flag. The audience erupted into cheers, strobe lights flashed, and flames shot up from the stage as the couple finished their dramatic and screeching performance.\n\nThug said their Eurovision performance drew inspiration from Conchita Wurst, the Austrian drag performer who won Eurovision 2014 while performing in an elegant gown and beard. Thug told PinkNews that they hoped to similarly inspire other views by \"being authentically them[selves] and not really caring\" what others think.\n\n\"When someone sees something [that represents them], it allows you to open yourself more,\" Bambie told the publication. \"Representation is always important, [but] especially now. It's not the safest world for non-binary and trans people, for any of our community.\"\n\nThe musician said that parents have begun writing to them about their own non-binary children or their queer kids. \"The best messages are always from little queer kids who have been able to feel more comfortable in themselves from having a representative like [me],\" Thug added.\n\n\"I always say that culture starts within the queer community. We definitely deserve more light on us, all of us. To have [numerous] nonbinaries in the competition, it's an amazing feat,\" Thug continued.\n\nThug's outfit for the semi-finals initially included the words \"Freedom for Palestine\" and \"Ceasefire.\" However, the European Broadcasting Union forced them to remove the words. Some people have called for countries to boycott Eurovision this year for allowing Israel to compete as the country has led a deadly military campaign against Palestine that has reportedly killed nearly 35,000 Palestinians and injured over 78,000 more.\n\nSome conservative broadcasters in Ireland have also opposed Thug's presence at the international singing competition, accusing them of promoting \"Satanism\" since their performance and music incorporates themes of witchcraft.\n\nBut in January 29 press statement, the singer said, \"If you don't want to be part of the Haus Of Thug you are not obligated to come on this journey with me...

Daragh Brophy reports from Malm\u00f6\n\nTHE SENIOR RT\u00c9 producer tasked with overseeing Ireland's Eurovision entry has said withdrawing from this year's contest was never something that was considered by the broadcaster.\n\nMichael Kealy, who has served as Head of Delegation for Ireland in the contest for over a decade, said that if a decision was made to withdraw it could set a precedent that put participation in other international events, including major sporting contests, at risk.\n\n\"We're a public service broadcaster - we don't take political stands on issues when it comes to things like this. The BBC don't. French television don't ... no public service broadcaster in Europe would,\" Kealy said, speaking to reporters at the delegation hotel in Malm\u00f6.\n\n\"If we withdraw from it that's the end of the Olympics, that's the end of the Euros, that's the end of the World Cup - all the fun in our lives would be taken away.\"\n\nCampaigners have called on RT\u00c9 and its act in this year's contest, Bambie Thug, to pull out of this year's Eurovision due to the presence of Israel in the lineup. The European Broadcasting Union, which produces the Eurovision each year, has said that to exclude Israel would be a political act and that the contest has always been non-political.\n\nBambie Thug, who qualified from the semi-finals on Tuesday night and is set to compete in the final on Saturday, has said they stand with those calling for a boycott but plan to stay in the competition to act as a pro-Palestine voice.\n\nSpeaking earlier in the week, the singer said they had been subjected to hateful comments online in the buildup to the Eurovision. A number of pro-Gaza performers within the Irish music industry have called on campaigners not to direct their criticism at the competitor and to instead focus their attention on RT\u00c9 and the EBU.\n\n\"Look at the end of the day this is a song contest,\" Kealy said today.\n\n\"I think it's very unfair to put pressure on artists to the extent that Bambie has had to endure over the last few months.\n\n\"Some of the abuse that's been directed at them has been pretty vile to be perfectly honest. I don't think there's a place for that. I don't think it does a service either to the cause of the people who are sending that kind of stuff.\"\n\nAsked about the singer's chances of winning the final on Saturday, Kealy said:\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"I always thought Bambie had what it takes to get to the final and now that we're in the final I think that they have what it takes to win.\n\n\"Our act is so different, so unique - it's clearly not everyone's cup of tea judging by what you read online but you can't ignore it. You absolutely can't ignore it.\n\nHe added: \"I think they're going to be a global star no matter what happens here on Saturday.\"\n\nA number of delegations, including the Irish one, are staying at a large hotel in the city itself. The arena is out in the suburbs. There's a heightened security presence at both locations and throughout the city this week. A circling police helicopter is a constant presence.\n\nA major pro-Palestine protest is taking place elsewhere today, with another one planned for Saturday.\n\n\"It is a bit of a fortress here,\" Marty Whelan, who's marking 25 years in the commentary box for RT\u00c9 at the contest this week, noted.\n\n\"There are drones here at nighttime. There are police and army around here constantly. There are armed police walking around the venue. The security at this event is taken very seriously.\"\n\nThe Journal / YouTube\n\nWhelan was in the commentary box last night at the arena as an 'as live' dress rehearsal of the semi-final show took place. The Israeli singer's performance was met with significant booing and shouting, footage filmed within the venue showed.\n\nThe broadcaster said that \"of course\" he would note anything unplanned that was taking place during the contest.\n\n\"I have never ignored what I see,\" he said. \"Of course if there's reaction one will react. I hope it just goes smoothly and people just get on with what they have to do.\"\n\nThe Netherlands, Norway and one of the favourites, Switzerland, will be among 16 acts competing alongside Israel tonight for the remaining ten places in Saturday's final.\n\nMaking a difference A mix of advertising and supporting contributions helps keep paywalls away from valuable information like this article.

K. Rowling, who has attracted criticism in recent years over her stance on the rights of transgender people - and so people have loved the subversive nature of the lyric.\n\nIn a reply to one Twitter/X user back in January, Bambie explained: \"Its origins can be traced back thousands of years to the Aramaic language - it means 'to destroy'. I was a Harry Potter fan as a kid but obviously as a non-binary person I am not a JK Terf fan. I am however a fan of being clever with language.\"\n\nBut all this wittiness has angered those on the right, who are furious over the song's imagery.\n\nOne fumed: \"Bambie Thug's performance was blatantly satanic. She wore trans flag colours and referenced a 'ceasefire' for the Islamists who want to eradicate the world of Jews and Christianity.\n\n\"At least it's clear what force is behind these causes.\"\n\nFar-right convicted criminal Tommy Robinson (real name Stephen Yaxley-Lennon) branded it a \"sick\" satanic ritual, while former British National Party leader and far-right member of European Parliament Nick Griffin claimed the song \"glorifies satanic sacrifice\".\n\nSpeaking toRolling Stoneabout how they feel being branded a 'satanist', Bambie Thug said: \"Honestly, I think it was quite iconic to have created such uproar.

It was Johnny Logan's second win and I was with Larry Gogan and it was special and those moments... it is hard to recapture that.\"\n\nHowever, he was \"high as a kite\" when Ireland's act Bambie Thug made it through to the grand final on Tuesday night with their song Doomsday Blue.\n\nBambie is making a statement about who they are and I think that is very refreshing\n\nAs a commentator, he says it is much more rewarding when \"you have a part to play\" in the grand final.\n\n\"The buzz is different because we are now in the final. But for me it is always a buzz. When you are not in it, you don't care who wins,\" he said.\n\nWhen asked how Bambie Thug's performance differs from previous entrants, such as 2008 contestant Dustin the Turkey, he replied: \"We have tried to put the turkey behind us.\"\n\n\"Bambie is making a statement about who they are and I think that is very refreshing... think the fact that Bambie is representing us is a good thing.

With lost voices but re-found spirit, Ireland fans gathered at a Eurovision pub quiz in Fagan's Pub, Malm\u00f6 (organised by Ireland's official fan club, OGAE Ireland) to reel in the glory.\n\n\"My pants exploded, I was so excited,\" joked Cork Eurovision fan Karl Fradgley when ask how they felt when Ireland made it through.\n\n\"Because they were called out ninth, it was pretty traumatic.\n\nAs soon as Slovenia was called out people started to panic a little bit because there can't be two witches in the final guys -- but there are and it's great.\n\n19-year-old Dillon Collie described the feeling as an \"out-of-body experience\" while Keeva Lennon from Offaly is still in disbelief.\n\n\"I couldn't believe it. I still don't believe it.\n\n\"As long as I've been watching it, there's never been an act as good as Bambie qualifying for Ireland. I can't believe we're doing as well as we are.\"\n\n\u00c1ine Whelan from Dublin praised Bambie's message of 'being who you are' and feels that the sentiment has touched the hearts of fans and official fan clubs everywhere, such as OGAE Ireland, the Irish branch of the Eurovision national fan clubs.\n\n\"OGAE Ireland are fantastic ambassadors for all things Eurovision but this year, we've really got behind Bambie. If you saw the WhatsApp chat, I'm not joking. I went off while I was at the semi-final and there were 894 messages. It was unbelievable.\"\n\nScott Downey, who also hails from Bambie's hometown of Macroom, echoed the sentiment of most fans, saying that it's been too long since we've been in the final.\n\n\"It's just fantastic. To get back into a final again after six years. We deserve it.\" Ireland has not qualified for the final since Ryan O'Shaughnessy performed Together in 2018, a final, fans Martin and Miche\u00e1l from Carrigaline and Passage West respectively, attended.\n\n\"We were over in Lisbon at the time, it was just fantastic but this time it's just special,\" said Martin.\n\n\"I think it's bigger this time. The fans are just so excited. It's just an elation. We're in a bubble,\" added Michael.\n\nWhispers of 'Dublin 2025' continue to swirl around Malm\u00f6. Could Ireland have the potential of winning this year's contest? President of OAGE Ireland, Frank Dermody believes it's a very open horse race this year.\n\nThere are about six or seven songs that could win, and Ireland is one of them.\n\n\"It's so phenomenal to have the feeling of 'we're back' and in Sweden of all places\".\n\nBut where would we host it? Could Ireland compete with the infrastructure of other European countries for a competition this big? Are we getting ahead of ourselves?\n\nThe European Broadcasting Union has strict rules when it comes to hosting the competition. One is that the venue must be enclosed.\n\nAnd as a Cork man, Dermody has already called for a tarpaulin to be placed across the top of P\u00e1irc U\u00ed Chaoimh, just in case.", "source": {"uri": "irishexaminer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Irish Examiner"}, "authors": [{"uri": "anna_o_donoghue@irishexaminer.com", "name": "Anna O'Donoghue", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurovision_Song_Contest", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Eurovision Song Contest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malm\u00f6", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Malm\u00f6"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OGAE", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "OGAE"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pub", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pub"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovenia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Slovenia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Slovenia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronnie_Whelan", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ronnie Whelan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offaly_GAA", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Offaly GAA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Lennon", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "John Lennon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WhatsApp", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "WhatsApp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Witchcraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Witchcraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cork_(city)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cork (city)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cork (city)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dublin", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dublin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dublin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_O'Shaughnessy", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ryan O'Shaughnessy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Dermody", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Frank Dermody"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P\u00e1irc_U\u00ed_Chaoimh", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "P\u00e1irc U\u00ed Chaoimh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Broadcasting_Union", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "European Broadcasting Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Horse racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrigaline", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Carrigaline"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Carrigaline"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macroom", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Macroom"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Macroom"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passage_West", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Passage West"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Passage West"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisbon", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lisbon"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Lisbon"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Portugal"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Contests", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Contests", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Part-Time_Employment", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Part-Time Employment", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Gaelic", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Gaelic", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Contests_and_Sweepstakes", "label": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Contests and Sweepstakes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 64}], "image": "https://www.irishexaminer.com/cms_media/module_img/8210/4105483_11_articlelarge_Bambie_20Thug_20006.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9548589", "eventUri": "eng-9548589", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3254901960784313, "wgt": 120, "relevance": 1}

Daragh Brophy reports from Malm\u00f6\n\nTHERE'S BEEN A sizeable police presence around Malm\u00f6's Eurovision venue all week. Most of the officers patrolling the streets around the arena are armed and there are dozens of police vans and motorbikes on standby including at least one armoured vehicle.\n\nIf you'd landed in the city and somehow hadn't heard of the controversy around Israel's involvement in the contest this year, however, it's possible nothing about the police presence would strike you as unusual - particularly for a large international event. The police on patrol are unfailingly polite and helpful and there's no particular sense of any underlying tension.\n\nAuthorities are leaving nothing to chance, however. Security is a major concern, especially since Sweden raised its terror alert level last year following a spate of Koran-burning events last summer.\n\nPolice reinforcements have been called in from neighbouring Denmark and Norway. Jail cells in the city have been emptied and prisoners transferred in case of a surge in arrests.\n\nA circling police helicopter serves as a constant reminder of the precautions being taken. A no-fly zone has been established over the port city for the duration of the contest to allow for the flying of police drones to monitor the streets.\n\nThere's likely to be an increased focus on security for the remaining days of the contest. Israel are set to perform in the second semi-final at Malm\u00f6 Arena this evening. Given the current odds being offered on the contest, it's likely they'll also make a return appearance to compete in Saturday's Grand Final.\n\nIt was reported that the head of Israel's Shin Bet security agency visited last week to coordinate security for Eden Golan, the country's 20-year-old singer. The young performer - who sealed her place in the contest by winning a longrunning talent show back in February - is accompanied by a large security presence of her own and has been attending only essential events like rehearsals and live performances.\n\nEden Golan of Israel performs during rehearsals. Alamy Stock Photo Alamy Stock Photo\n\nA large pro-Gaza protest is set to take place in a separate part of the city this afternoon, organised by the umbrella group Stop Israel. It follows campaigns across Europe calling on the European Broadcasting Union to exclude the country from the competition due to the ongoing bombardment of Gaza.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe EBU has refused, consistently stating that the contest is a non-political one.\n\n\"They shouldn't be allowed to compete at all in this competition while they are committing genocide,\" Pia Jacobsen, one of the protest's organisers, told The Journal.\n\nJacobsen said she was planning for thousands to turn out for the protests in the city, which has a sizeable Palestinian population.\n\n\"We want to highlight the Palestinian people's right to live freely and in peace,\" she added.\n\nSome Eurovision fans are also expected to take part in today's march - including at least a small number of Irish fans who have set up a group and had a banner created with the slogan 'Eurovision Fans Against Genocide'.\n\nSpeaking yesterday morning, one of the group, Rory Flynn, said he knew of some longtime Irish Eurovision fans who had chosen to boycott the competition entirely this year. Others, he said, had decided to travel but to register their dissatisfaction with the EBU in other ways.\n\n\"We want to stand up and make the point that this is wrong - and shame on the EBU for their inaction here.\"\n\nIsrael, he said, is carrying out a genocide within Gaza, \"and clearly they're using Eurovision as a propaganda instrument\".\n\nArtists from within various Eurovision nations have been signing letters and joining demonstrations calling for Israel's expulsion from the contest since late last year - citing an apparent hypocrisy after the EBU took just days to ban Russia two years ago in the wake of the invasion of Ukraine.\n\nCampaigners have also called on competing broadcasters and performers to withdraw unless Israel is excluded - often leaving pro-Palestine artists, including Ireland's Bambie Thug, in an awkward position. (The Cork-born singer's stance on the subject has been well covered elsewhere - but, essentially, they've said they plan to stay in the competition to act as a pro-Palestine voice during the contest).\n\nThe debate has already spilled out onto the stage. The EBU said on Tuesday night that former Swedish contestant Eric Saade, one of the opening acts during the first semi-final, had compromised the contest's non-political nature by displaying the keffiyeh symbol as he performed.\n\nRead Next Related Reads Eurovision: Bambie Thug confirms they will perform in final after qualifying from semis tonight How a president's intervention set the stage for the most contentious Eurovision in years\n\nEric Saade displays the keffiyeh symbol - commonly used by people who want to show they are pro-Palestinian - on his arm as he performs his 2011 entry Popular. Alamy Stock Photo Alamy Stock Photo\n\nAnd while attempts by Bambie Thug to take to the stage while wearing make-up that spelled out pro-Palestine phrases in Ogham writing also fell afoul of the EBU, it's likely producers will be faced with an even bigger headache tonight as Israel take to the stage.\n\n\"We could well see protests in the arena, we could see booing,\" Paul Jordan, a former member of the Eurovision communications team, told CNN this week.\n\n\"I would imagine the scale of it in Malm\u00f6 would be bigger than anything we've ever seen before.\"\n\nRory Flynn, the Irish fan taking part in today's protest, said he expected \"significant booing\" at the venue. Many fans reported a short but noticeable burst of booing and other negative reactions when promo footage displaying the names of tonight's competing countries was played during Monday's 'as live' dress rehearsal for the Tuesday show.\n\nOthers who spoke to The Journal last week said there had been discussion of other forms of 'targeted' boycotts that might see fans leave their seats as Israel take to the stage or even simply refuse to wave their LED wristbands as the cameras pan the crowd.\n\nSo far there's been no signs of any banners or other acts of protest outside the venue - although a small, ad hoc protest did take place during a Eurovision Village concert by Austria's former winner Conchita Wurst at Folkets Park towards the centre of the city.\n\nThe Journal's Daragh Brophy is in Malm\u00f6 covering the contest and surrounding events - you can follow him here on Twitter/X\n\nMaking a difference A mix of advertising and supporting contributions helps keep paywalls away from valuable information like this article.

We recognise and appreciate the perseverance required to create a successful niche brand of art and are very proud of Bambie Thug's achievements to date.\n\n'The sheer energy and power of their performance at Tuesday's first semi-final qualifiers, was off-the-scale and the resonance of their dynamism and vitality is sure to put them in good stead for the final.\n\n'Bambie's music translates as a voice of inspiration and platform for people worldwide by exploring diverse and current themes of inclusivity, clothing, dance, and imagery.\u202f We wish Bambie Thug every success imaginable and celebrate with them on their achievement.\n\n'They can be guaranteed a vote from all Cork College of FET, Tramore Road Campus, for the Eurovision Final at the weekend,' they concluded.", "source": {"uri": "southernstar.ie", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Southern Star"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dance", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cork_(city)", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cork (city)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cork (city)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tramore", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tramore"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tramore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurovision_Song_Contest", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eurovision Song Contest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballet", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ballet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Cork", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "West Cork"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Icon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Icon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folklore", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Folklore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Classical music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archaeology", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Archaeology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resonance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Resonance"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Dance", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Dance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Schools_of_Pharmacy", "label": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Schools of Pharmacy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Disabled/Education", "label": "dmoz/Society/Disabled/Education", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 71}], "image": "https://img.resized.co/southernstar/eyJkYXRhIjoie1widXJsXCI6XCJodHRwczpcXFwvXFxcL2ltYWdlcy5zb3V0aGVybnN0YXIuaWVcXFwvdXBsb2Fkc1xcXC8yMDI0XFxcLzA1XFxcLzA5MTIwNzAzXFxcL0V1cm92aXNpb24tQmFtYmllLVByZXNzLUNvbmZlcmVuY2UtMDAxLWUxNzE1MjUyODM3ODExLmpwZ1wiLFwid2lkdGhcIjoxMjAwLFwiaGVpZ2h0XCI6NjMwLFwiZGVmYXVsdFwiOlwiaHR0cHM6XFxcL1xcXC93d3cuc291dGhlcm5zdGFyLmllXFxcL2ltYWdlc1xcXC9wbGFjZWhvbGRlci5wbmdcIixcIm9wdGlvbnNcIjpbXX0iLCJoYXNoIjoiN2YzNmQwNWI2MjUyYjA4MGQxZWMxN2FjYzI3MjY5M2VkYjNlOTY5OCJ9/bambie-thug-was-exemplary-student-in-cork-college.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9548589", "eventUri": "eng-9548589", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4745098039215687, "wgt": 114, "relevance": 1}

It should be noted that hundreds of fans praised the realization (and staging) of the performance, which was devised by a Spaniard named Sergio Ja\u00e9n.\n\nIn a matter of a few days, Bambie Thug's candidacy has become one of the big favorites to win the coveted crystal microphone. When their qualification was announced, the Irish team were genuinely excited to have the opportunity to perform in the grand final on Saturday.\n\nOnce the gala was over, the artists gave a joint press conference to share their feelings. At that moment, a journalist asked Bambie about an alleged pro-Palestinian makeup that she would have had to remove on orders from the EBU. Far from dodging the question, Thug answered bluntly: ''I am a person in favor of freedom and justice, but the EBU has forced me to withdraw from my proposal the messages I had in which I asked for a ceasefire and freedom for Palestine.\n\nAccording to what has been learned, the makeup included the words Saor Don Phalaistin (Freedom for Palestine) and Ceasefire (Ceasefire) on the face. Both messages were written in Ogham, a Celtic language used by the druids.\n\nAs expected, hundreds of users on the network have shown their support for the non-binary gender performer and have denounced the poor treatment of the EBU towards artists who want to freely position themselves on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict that is causing so much international noise. .\n\nIt should be noted that the singer Eric Saade came out to give the opening show of the event with a Palestinian scarf on his arm, another gesture that has been harshly criticized by the EBU, which quickly released a statement and removed the performance from the official social networks of the event. music contest.", "source": {"uri": "usanews.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "USANews Press Release Network"},

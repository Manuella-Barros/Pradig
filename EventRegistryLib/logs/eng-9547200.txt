What she did not know, the report says, was that the man she thought was a killer-for-hire was an undercover agent.\n\nHer son, 16-year-old Manuel Marcos Cardona from Lake Worth, pleaded guilty in February to second-degree murder and was sentenced to 15 years in prison in the 2022 killing, court records show. Palm Beach deputies say Manuel, then 14, stabbed 19-year-old Andres Perez-Alvarado during a brawl at the birthday party. He died the next day at the hospital.\n\nPalm Beach County Sheriff's Office detectives first heard about the woman's alleged plot through an informant on April 17 of this year, according to her arrest report.\n\nThe informant told detectives that a woman, whom he knew as \"Maria,\" was inquiring about finding someone to kill the people she blamed for her son's imprisonment. The informant gave detectives the woman's photo and phone number, which they later determined belonged to Cardona-Cardona.\n\nOn April 18, following the detectives' instructions, the informant called Cardona-Cardona and she agreed to meet with the informant and the undercover agent she thought was a hit man. Later that day, they met near a high school in Lake Worth Beach.\n\nCardona-Cardona, detectives say, identified the people she wanted killed as \"Catalina\" and \"Alonso,\" and showed photos of them to the undercover agent. Further investigation revealed their names: Catarina Jimenez and Alonzo Perez-Ramirez, the two witnesses.\n\nDetectives say Cardona-Cardona was captured on video agreeing to pay $8,000 for the murders, telling the undercover agent she would call her family members in Guatemala to send her money for the hits.\n\nOn April 23, five days after they first met, Cardona-Cardona showed the agent where the two witnesses lived and the places they frequented. Outside Jimenez's apartment, detectives say Cardona-Cardona agreed to pay half of the money upfront.\n\nTwo weeks later, Cardona-Cardona met with the undercover agent and told him she would have $2,000 next week to pay for the killings. When the agent asked for collateral, she gave him a $100 gold chain, her arrest report says.\n\nCardona-Cardona was arrested Monday, two blocks from her Lake Worth Beach home. She is charged with two counts of solicitation to commit murder and is being held at the county's Main Detention Center. Her first court appearance was Tuesday, when a judge set her bail at $550,000 and ordered her to stay away from the witnesses.\n\nAround 10:30 p.m. on June 18, 2022, Palm Beach County deputies rushed to a house at an undisclosed location where a man had been stabbed.\n\nThe man was taken to St. Mary's Hospital in West Palm Beach, where he died the next day.\n\nJimenez told detectives she was hosting a party for her 5-year-old when a man later identified as Gonzalo Cardona hit a woman with a bottle over a \"romantic relationship\" she was involved in.\n\nAfter the woman was struck, witnesses say Gonzalo Cardona and another man started throwing punches. When Perez-Alvarado tried to separate them, Gonzalo Cardona punched him in the face.\n\nWitnesses told detectives Manuel then stabbed Perez-Alvarado with a knife. Five people, including Manuel, his parents, Gonzalo Cardona and his wife, kicked Perez-Alvarado while he was on the ground, witnesses said. A witness told investigators she saw Manuel run away with his parents.\n\nOn June 21, 2022, three days after the party, Perez-Alvarado's family called deputies to report they had spotted Manuel and his mother and they were following them on Interstate 95. A Brevard County Sheriff's Office deputy stopped them sometime later.\n\nManuel was arrested the following month in North Carolina, extradited to Florida and charged with second-degree murder.

During the altercation, one individual stepped in to break it up but was quickly surrounded by several others attending the party.\n\nWhile attempting to break up the altercation, the individual was stabbed several times by Cardona. Cardona's parents also got involved, beating the victim, WPTV-TV reported.

What she did not know, the report says, was that the man she thought was a killer-for-hire was an undercover agent.\n\nHer son, 16-year-old Manuel Marcos Cardona, from Lake Worth, pleaded guilty in February to second-degree murder and was sentenced to 15 years in prison in the 2022 killing, court records show. Palm Beach deputies say Manuel, then 14, stabbed 19-year-old Andres Perez-Alvarado during a brawl at the birthday party. He died the next day at the hospital.\n\nInformant tips off detectives\n\nPalm Beach County Sheriff's Office detectives first heard about the woman's alleged plot through an informant on April 17 of this year, according to her arrest report.\n\nThe informant told detectives that a woman, whom he knew as \"Maria,\" was inquiring about finding someone to kill the people she blamed for her son's imprisonment. The informant gave detectives the woman's photo and phone number, which they later determined belonged to Cardona-Cardona.\n\nOn April 18, following the detectives' instructions, the informant called Cardona-Cardona and she agreed to meet with the informant and the undercover agent she thought was a hit man. Later that day, they met near a high school in Lake Worth Beach.\n\nCardona-Cardona, detectives say, identified the people she wanted killed as \"Catalina\" and \"Alonso,\" and showed photos of them to the undercover agent. Further investigation revealed their names: Catarina Jimenez and Alonzo Perez-Ramirez, the two witnesses.\n\nDetectives say Cardona-Cardona was captured on video agreeing to pay $8,000 for the murders, telling the undercover agent she would call her family members in Guatemala to send her money for the hits.\n\nOn April 23, five days after they first met, Cardona-Cardona showed the agent where the two witnesses lived and the places they frequented. Outside Jimenez's apartment, detectives say Cardona-Cardona agreed to pay half of the money upfront.\n\nTwo weeks later, Cardona-Cardona met with the undercover agent and told him she would have $2,000 next week to pay for the killings. When the agent asked for collateral, she gave him a $100 gold chain, her arrest report says.\n\nCardona-Cardona was arrested Monday, two blocks from her Lake Worth Beach home. She is charged with two counts of solicitation to commit murder and is being held at the county's Main Detention Center. Her first court appearance was Tuesday, when a judge set her bail at $550,000 and ordered her to stay away from the witnesses.\n\nDeadly stabbing at birthday party\n\nAround 10:30 p.m. on June 18, 2022, Palm Beach County deputies rushed to a house at an undisclosed location where a man had been stabbed.\n\nThe man was taken to St. Mary's Hospital in West Palm Beach, where he died the next day.\n\nJimeneztold detectives she was hosting a party for her 5-year-old when a man later identified as Gonzalo Cardona hit a woman with a bottle over a \"romantic relationship\" she was involved in.\n\nAfter the woman was struck, witnesses say Gonzalo Cardona and another man started throwing punches. When Perez-Alvarado tried to separate them, Gonzalo Cardona punched him in the face.\n\nWitnesses told detectives Manuel then stabbed Perez-Alvarado with a knife. Five people, including Manuel, his parents, Gonzalo Cardona and his wife, kicked Perez-Alvarado while he was on the ground, witnesses said. A witness told investigators she saw Manuel run away with his parents.\n\nOn June 21, 2022, three days after the party, Perez-Alvarado's family called deputies to report they had spotted Manuel and his mother and they were following them on Interstate 95. A Brevard County Sheriff's Office deputy stopped them sometime later.\n\nManuel was arrested the following month in North Carolina, extradited to Florida and charged with second-degree murder. He pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 15 years behind bars, with 561 days credited as time served. The 16-year-old remains at the Suwannee Correctional Institution Annex, northwest of Gainesville, state prison records show.\n\nBoth Manuel and his mom, Josefina Cardona-Cardona, could be deported, the Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office said.

He is now 16.\n\nCardona had faced life in prison but in a plea deal for second-degree murder, he received a shorter sentence on Feb 8.

At one point, the undercover agent suggested they could make their death seem accidental or like a robbery, but Cardona-Cardona declined.\n\n\"'Maria' requested that the undercover agent 'shoot' (the victim) in the body so it can be painful, where (the victim) could think about it, because a mother shouldn't be without her son,\" the affidavit said.\n\nHusband charged with murdering hospitalized wife, citing medical bills and care burden\n\nCardona-Cardona said she would reach out to family in Guatemala to send her money to help pay for the murders-for-hire, the affidavit said.

An immigration judge in Miami, Florida, ordered Cardona-Cardona to be removed from the U.S. in absentia, meaning she never showed up to her immigration hearing, the spokesperson added.\n\nCardona-Cardona was arrested by Palm Beach County law enforcement on Monday after she allegedly agreed to pay an undercover agent, whom she thought was a hitman, to kill two cooperating witnesses in her teenage son's murder trial. She offered to pay $4,000 for each hit, according to the arrest report.\n\nHer son, Manuel Marcos Cardona, was at a five-year-old's birthday party in June 2022 when a fight broke out. An individual stepped in to break up the fight, but then Marcos Cardona stabbed him five times, with the victim succumbing to his wounds the following day.\n\nMarcos Cardona -- who was 14 years old at the time of crime, but charged as an adult -- was subsequently handed a 15-year prison sentence after agreeing to a plea deal.\n\nICE confirmed to the DCNF that their Enforcement and Removal Operations division has since lodged a detainer for Cardona-Cardona. She is currently being held in a Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office detention center, and local officials said she is subject to deportation following the completion of her prosecution.\n\nThe discovery of Cardona-Cardona's referral into Alternatives to Detention (ATD) marks the latest blemish in what has become a controversial program.\n\nEstablished in 2004, the ATD program allows migrants to move freely in the country and avoid physical detention while they await their immigration court dates. This is done by using GPS monitoring, phone applications or other forms of tracking services to remain aware of their whereabouts.\n\nAs the current border crisis rages on, participation in the program has increased, with hundreds of thousands of migrants enrolled in the program, according to ICE. However, a previous DCNF investigation found the Biden administration has increased its reliance on a phone application that only tracks the location of an illegal immigrant at specific times, in lieu of relying on GPS monitoring, which can track them most or even all of the time.", "source": {"uri": "dailycallernewsfoundation.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "dailycallernewsfoundation.org"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Immigration_and_Customs_Enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Immigration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guatemala", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Guatemala"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Guatemala"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contract_killing", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Contract killing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illegal_immigration", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Illegal immigration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palm_Beach_County,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Palm Beach County, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Palm Beach County, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refugee", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Refugee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial_in_absentia", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Trial in absentia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Border_Patrol", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Border Patrol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recognizance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Recognizance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parole", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Parole"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Office_for_Immigration_Review", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Executive Office for Immigration Review"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plea_bargain", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Plea bargain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deportation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Deportation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Positioning_System", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Global Positioning System"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Unsolved", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Unsolved", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 52}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9547200", "eventUri": "eng-9547200", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2019-04-04", "textStart": 1191, "textEnd": 1204}, {"amb": false, "date": "2019-04-08", "textStart": 1278, "textEnd": 1291}], "sentiment": -0.2862745098039216, "wgt": 183, "relevance": 1}

He later plead guilty to second-degree murder and is serving a 15-year sentence.\n\nAccording to Palm Beach County Sheriff's detectives, Cardona-Cardona was driven by revenge and offered $8,000 to someone she believed was a hitman to kill two witnesses who contributed to her son's arrest. However, the hitman turned out to be an undercover sheriff's agent, leading to her arrest before any harm could be done.\n\n\"These are obviously very serious and egregious charges,\" said a spokesperson from the sheriff's office. \"The circumstances, had they been different and it was not reported and an undercover agent became involved, the likelihood is two people would've been dead.\"\n\nCardona-Cardona was arrested and is currently behind bars, according to officials.

She could also be deported, the Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office said in a news release. Court documents say she entered the U.S. illegally from Guatemala.\n\nThe case stems from the prosecution of her son, Miguel Marcos Cardona, who pleaded guilty to second-degree murder and was sentenced to 10 years in prison for fatally stabbing a 19-year-old man who tried to break up a fight at a 5-year-old child's birthday party on June 18, 2022, court record show. Miguel Marcos Cardona was 14 years old at the time of the killing but was tried as an adult.\n\nAuthorities said they learned in April of this year that his mother had allegedly been arranging to try to have two witnesses from that case killed.\n\nAn affidavit details allegations beginning on April 17, when detectives responded to a sheriff's office substation about a murder-for-hire investigation. There, a confidential informant told investigators a woman identified as \"Maria\" was inquiring about hiring someone for murder, the affidavit said.\n\n\"Maria\" gave the informant her cellphone number and said she'd provide information about potential targets at a meeting the next day, on April 18, the affidavit said.\n\nThrough the phone number, police quickly identified \"Maria\" as Cardona-Cardona and learned her son was arrested and charged on July 19, 2022. He is currently housed in the Florida Department of Corrections.\n\nOn April 18, the suspect allegedly met with the agent in his vehicle. She allegedly described the circumstances of her son's arrest, saying her son had gone to a party where the party's hosts conspired against him, resulting in his being sent to prison, the affidavit said.\n\nShe allegedly showed the agent a photo of the two would-be targets. She said she wanted \"Alonso\" and\" Catalina\" murdered, the document said. \"Maria\" told the agent she wanted \"Alonso\" killed first and said she'd pay $4,000 for each hit, the affidavit said.\n\nWhen the agent said he could make the murder appear like an accident or a robbery, \"Maria\" told the agent to use the \"best method in murdering/killing them,\" court documents said.\n\nShe had one request for her supposed hitman -- \"shoot 'Alonso' in the body so it can be painful, where 'Alonso' could think about it because a mother shouldn't be without her son,\" the affidavit said she told the agent. She allegedly said she'd contact family in Guatemala for money to help with the cost of the hits.\n\nThe two discussed keeping it a secret, and \"Maria\" placed her finger against her lips, indicating quiet, according to the affidavit. The two agreed to meet later, when \"Maria\" could give the undercover agent more information on the intended targets and an update on the money coming from Guatemala.\n\nDays later, the agent picked up \"Maria\" and drove to an apartment complex in Lake Worth Beach, where she allegedly pointed out \"Alonso's\" unit and identified his gray sedan parked in front, court documents said.\n\nWhen the agent asked about money, she said she and her family were working out the details before she directed the agent to where the other intended target lived.\n\nOn Monday night, the agent picked up Cardona-Cardona at her residence. She was arrested after allegedly agreeing to a collateral payment of a $100 gold chain, the affidavit said.", "source": {"uri": "lawandcrime.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Law & Crime"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affidavit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Affidavit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palm_Beach_County,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Palm Beach County, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Palm Beach County, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contract_killing", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Contract killing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solicitation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Solicitation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deportation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Deportation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covert_operation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Covert operation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Informant", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Informant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guatemala", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Guatemala"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Guatemala"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_Department_of_Corrections", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Florida Department of Corrections"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_phone", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mobile phone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Worth_Beach,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lake Worth Beach, Florida"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robbery", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Robbery"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Unsolved", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Unsolved", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://lawandcrime.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Cardona-Cardona.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9547200", "eventUri": "eng-9547200", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-17", "textStart": 1151, "textEnd": 1159}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-18", "textStart": 1545, "textEnd": 1553, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "date": "2018-06-", "textStart": 827, "textEnd": 834}, {"amb": false, "date": "2019-07-", "textStart": 1703, "textEnd": 1710}], "sentiment": -0.4117647058823529, "wgt": 163, "relevance": 1}

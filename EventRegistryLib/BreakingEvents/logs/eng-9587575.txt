It is a Department of Justice policy that is standard to include in such documents.\n\n''The FBI followed standard protocol in this search as we do for all search warrants, which includes a standard policy statement limiting the use of deadly force,'' the agency said in a statement. ''No one ordered additional steps to be taken and there was no departure from the norm in this matter.''\n\nAs it appears in the operations order, the policy stipulates in part that Department of Justice officers ''may use deadly force only when necessary, that is, when the officer has a reasonable belief that the subject of such force poses an imminent danger of death or serious physical injury to the officer or to another person.'' The policy is in the department's Justice Manual with only minor differences in wording to what is included in the order and is summarized on the FBI's website.\n\nFrank Figliuzzi, a former assistant director for counterintelligence at the FBI, reiterated in an X post what the agency said in its statement.\n\n''Yep, every FBI operations order contains a reminder of FBI deadly force policy,'' he wrote. ''Even for a search warrant. Deadly force is always authorized if the required threat presents itself.''\n\nA motion that Trump's lawyers filed in his federal classified documents case, also unsealed Tuesday, asserted that the August 2022 search was unconstitutional and ''illegal,'' misquoting the operations order as saying that ''law enforcement officers of the Department of Justice may use deadly force when necessary.''\n\nTrump wasn't at Mar-a-Lago, which was shuttered for the season, at the time of the search. The Associated Press reported at the time that the FBI reached out to the Secret Service detail that provides protection to the former president and his homes shortly before serving the warrant.\n\nThe facts did not stop Trump and his allies from spreading the erroneous allegation.\n\nA Trump campaign fundraising email with the subject line, ''They were authorized to shoot me!'' was sent soon after he posted on social media and made even more outrageous claims.\n\n''I nearly escaped death,'' it reads. ''You know they're just itching to do the unthinkable. ... Joe Biden was locked & loaded ready to take me out & put my family in danger.''\n\nThe Trump campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment from the AP about the false claims.\n\nHard-right Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a Republican, wrote in an X post that ''the Biden DOJ and FBI were planning to assassinate Pres Trump and gave the green light.''\n\nKari Lake, a Republican Senate candidate in Arizona, wrote in her own X post: ''The sicko Biden FBI were ready to use deadly force during the Mar-a-Lago BS raid. That tells you everything you need to know about this criminal Biden admin.''\n\nTrump was charged in June 2023 with illegally retaining classified documents taken with him from the White House to Mar-a-Lago after he left office in January 2021, and then obstructing government demands to give them back. Additional related charges were filed a month later.

I just came out of the Biden Witch Hunt Trial in Manhattan, the 'Icebox,' and was shown Reports that Crooked Joe Biden's DOJ, in their illegal and UnConstitutional Raid of Mar-a-Lago, AUTHORIZED THE FBI TO USE DEADLY (LETHAL) FORCE,\" Trump wrote in a post on his social media platform Truth Social Tuesday night. \"NOW WE KNOW, FOR SURE, THAT JOE BIDEN IS A SERIOUS THREAT TO DEMOCRACY. HE IS MENTALLY UNFIT FOR OFFICE -- 25TH AMENDMENT!\"\n\nThe claim was also boosted online by his supporters.\n\nBut the language Trump referenced is a standard policy statement used for issuing search warrants and was not unique to the FBI's search of his property. It is actually meant to limit the use of deadly force.\n\nHere's a closer look at the facts.\n\nThe Biden administration authorized the use of \"deadly force\" against former President Donald Trump during an FBI search of his Mar-a-Lago estate in 2022.\n\nThe policy statement on the \"use of deadly force,\" which appeared in an operations order for the Mar-a-Lago search, is not evidence of a plot to kill Trump. It is a Department of Justice policy that is standard to include in such documents.\n\n\"The FBI followed standard protocol in this search as we do for all search warrants, which includes a standard policy statement limiting the use of deadly force,\" the agency said in a statement. \"No one ordered additional steps to be taken and there was no departure from the norm in this matter.\"\n\nAs it appears in the operations order, the policy stipulates in part that Department of Justice officers \"may use deadly force only when necessary, that is, when the officer has a reasonable belief that the subject of such force poses an imminent danger of death or serious physical injury to the officer or to another person.\" The policy is in the department's Justice Manual with only minor differences in wording to what is included in the order and is summarized on the FBI's website.\n\nFrank Figliuzzi, a former assistant director for counterintelligence at the FBI, reiterated in an X post what the agency said in its statement.\n\n\"Yep, every FBI operations order contains a reminder of FBI deadly force policy,\" he wrote. \"Even for a search warrant. Deadly force is always authorized if the required threat presents itself.\"\n\nA motion that Trump's lawyers filed in his federal classified documents case, also unsealed Tuesday, asserted that the August 2022 search was unconstitutional and \"illegal,\" misquoting the operations order as saying that \"law enforcement officers of the Department of Justice may use deadly force when necessary.\"\n\nTrump wasn't at Mar-a-Lago, which was shuttered for the season, at the time of the search. The Associated Press reported at the time that the FBI reached out to the Secret Service detail that provides protection to the former president and his homes shortly before serving the warrant.\n\nThe facts did not stop Trump and his allies from spreading the erroneous allegation.\n\nA Trump campaign fundraising email with the subject line, \"They were authorized to shoot me!\" was sent soon after he posted on social media and made even more outrageous claims.\n\n\"I nearly escaped death,\" it reads. \"You know they're just itching to do the unthinkable. ... Joe Biden was locked & loaded ready to take me out & put my family in danger.\"\n\nThe Trump campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment from the AP about the false claims.\n\nHard-right Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a Republican, wrote in an X post that \"the Biden DOJ and FBI were planning to assassinate Pres Trump and gave the green light.\"\n\nKari Lake, a Republican Senate candidate in Arizona, wrote in her own X post: \"The sicko Biden FBI were ready to use deadly force during the Mar-a-Lago BS raid. That tells you everything you need to know about this criminal Biden admin.\"\n\nTrump was charged in June 2023 with illegally retaining classified documents taken with him from the White House to Mar-a-Lago after he left office in January 2021, and then obstructing government demands to give them back. Additional related charges were filed a month later. The FBI searched Mar-a-Lago as part of a probe that led to the indictment.", "source": {"uri": "apnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "AP NEWS"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Pictured: Authorities standing outside Mar-a-Lago\n\nThat raid on the ex-president's home ended with the FBI seizing hundreds of documents containing classified information.\n\nTrump, 77, is now criminally charged for mishandling top secret documents taken to his Florida estate after he left office.\n\nIn the former president's motion challenging the legality of the FBI's raid filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida, the filing notes an 'Operation Order' produced in discovery which contained a 'Policy Statement' regarding 'Use of Deadly Force.'\n\nThe filing says the Order states 'for example, 'Law enforcement officers with the Department of Justice may use deadly force when necessary...\"\n\nIt also says 'the agents planned to bring \"Standard Issue Weapon[s],\" \"Ammo,\" \"Handcuffs,\" and \"medium and large sized bolt cutters,\" but they were instructed to wear \"unmarked polo or collared shirts\" and to keep \"law enforcement equipment concealed.'\"\n\nThe agents started the raid around 9am on August 8, 2022 and stayed until around 6:40pm.\n\nTrump's legal team has previously argued that the raid of Mar-a-Lago was unconstitutional.\n\nThe ex-president pleaded not guilty to 37 criminal charges in the case, some of which carry a penalty of up to 20 years in prison.\n\nTrump is accused of enlisting aides and lawyers to help him hide the records officials requested he return.\n\nUnsealed documents on Tuesday also revealed that Trump's lawyers found additional classified documents in the ex-president's bedroom months after the August raid.\n\nThe revelation was detailed in an unsealed opinion from Judge Beryl Howell from March 2023 where she found prosecutors brought sufficient evidence that Trump mishandled classified documents.\n\nThe opinion states that even after the raid, more classified-marked documents were uncovered in November 0222 in a leased storage unit, in the office at Mar-a-Lago in December 2022 and 'apparently sometime thereafter in the former president's own bedroom at Mar-a-Lago.'\n\nThe judge wrote further down 'Notably, no excuse is provided as to how the former president could miss the classified-marked documents found in his own bedroom at Mar-a-Lago.'\n\nEarlier this month, Trump-appointed District Judge Aileen Cannon postponed the classified documents trial indefinitely.\n\nShe cited a number of outstanding pre-trial issues to be resolved.", "source": {"uri": "expressdigest.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "expressdigest.com"}, "authors": [],

While no president has yet to test that bold legal theory, Trump and his MAGA allies are now baselessly attempting to accuse Joe Biden of authorizing the assassination of Trump during the FBI's 2022 raid of Mar-a-Lago.\n\nDocuments unsealed Tuesday revealed that more classified material was found at the former president's Palm Beach estate after the FBI's August 2022 raid. Republicans, however, have zeroed in on standard language in FBI search warrants authorizing the use of deadly force in appropriate circumstances, claiming Biden and the DOJ wanted Trump dead -- even though he wasn't even present on the property that day.\n\n\"WOW! I just came out of the Biden Witch Hunt Trial in Manhattan, the 'Icebox,' and was shown Reports that Crooked Joe Biden's DOJ, in their Illegal and UnConstitutional Raid of Mar-a-Lago, AUTHORIZED THE FBI TO USE DEADLY (LETHAL) FORCE,\" Trump wrote Tuesday of the FBI's boilerplate authorization to use deadly force. \"NOW WE KNOW, FOR SURE, THAT JOE BIDEN IS A SERIOUS THREAT TO DEMOCRACY. HE IS MENTALLY UNFIT TO HOLD OFFICE -- 25TH AMENDMENT!\"\n\nIn a campaign fundraising email, Trump further claimed that he \"nearly escaped death\" and that Biden was \"locked & loaded ready to take me out.\"\n\nChristina Bobb, an attorney for the former president who ahead of the raid signed a statement falsely asserting there was no more classified material at Mar-a-Lago, also reacted with incredulity to the filing. \"WTF?!! They were prepared to kill me?! A few dozen FBI agents v. me and they were ready to kill me?!!! What in the world happened to the United States of America?!\" she wrote. Earlier this month, Bobb and 17 others were indicted in relation to a pro-Trump scheme to meddle with the results of Arizona's 2020 election.\n\nTrump's allies in Congres further boosted the idea that he was targeted for assassination.\n\n\"The Biden DOJ and FBI were planning to assassinate Pres Trump and gave the green light. Does everyone get it yet???!!!!\" Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) wrote on X, formerly Twitter. \"What are Republicans going to do about it? I tried to oust our Speaker who funded Biden's DOJ AND FBI, but Democrats stopped it.\"\n\nRep. Paul Gosar (R-Ariz.) even claimed that \"Biden ordered the hit on Trump at Mar-a-Lago.\"\n\nGreene and Gosar's posts both have community notes attached to them -- and for good reason.\n\nTrump's attorneys wrote in a May filing that the FBI's operations order for the search included a policy statement stating that \"law enforcement officers of the Department of Justice may use deadly force when necessary....\" The filing omitted the full policy statement of the bureau and the Justice Department, which can be found on their websites.\n\n\"Law enforcement officers and correctional officers of the Department of Justice may use deadly force only when necessary, that is, when the officer has a reasonable belief that the subject of such force poses an imminent danger of death or serious physical injury to the officer or to another person.\"\n\nThe policy statement is a standard written reminder of agency policy given to law enforcement executing search warrants. No deadly force was used at Mar-a-Lago, and the raid was executed without incident -- other than Trump's public protestations on social media.\n\nOn Tuesday, the FBI pushed back on the claim that the authorization had been specifically granted for the Mar-a-Lago raid. \"The FBI followed standard protocol in this search as we do for all search warrants, which includes a standard policy statement limiting the use of deadly force,\" the agency wrote. \"No one ordered additional steps to be taken and there was no departure from the norm in this matter.\"\n\nFormer FBI Assistant Director of Counterintelligence Frank Figliuzzi added on X that \"every FBI operations order contains a reminder of FBI deadly force policy. Even for a search warrant. Deadly force is always authorized if the required threat presents itself.\"\n\nClearly, no such threat presented itself during the raid, and the FBI took pains to ensure that the operation was executed smoothly and without incident. In June of last year, former FBI Assistant Director Steven D'Antuono sat for testimony before the House Judiciary Committee and explained the agency's strategy.\n\n\"We didn't do a show of force, right? I was adamant about that, and that was something that we agreed on [...] No raid jackets, no blazed FBI. We made sure we interacted with the Secret Service to make sure we could get into Mar-a-Lago with no issues. We're not banging down any doors. We weren't bringing any FBI vehicles, everything that was reported about helicopters and a hundred people descending on [it], like a Die Hard movie, was completely untrue. That is not how we played it,\" he said.\n\n\"We didn't want a spectacle,\" D'Antuono added, noting that the agency had specifically sought to execute the warrant on a day when Trump was not present on the property. \"Who wants the subject of the search present at any search you do? You don't normally want that It just makes it easier and less of a spectacle at that point. And honestly, I didn't want the spectacle for obvious reasons of why we're sitting here today.\"\n\nBut creating spectacle is a Republican specialty, and regardless of any steps that the FBI may have taken to stave off accusations of excessive force, the former president's victim complex will always take center stage.", "source": {"uri": "rollingstone.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Rolling

I just came out of the Biden Witch Hunt Trial in Manhattan, the \"Icebox,\" and was shown Reports that Crooked Joe Biden's DOJ, in their Illegal and UnConstitutional Raid of Mar-a-Lago, AUTHORIZED THE FBI TO USE DEADLY (LETHAL) FORCE. NOW WE KNOW, FOR SURE, THAT JOE BIDEN IS A SERIOUS THREAT TO DEMOCRACY. HE IS MENTALLY UNFIT TO HOLD OFFICE -- 25TH AMENDMENT!\n\n\"The FBI followed standard protocol in this search as we do for all search warrants, which includes a standard policy statement limiting the use of deadly force. No one ordered additional steps to be taken and there was no departure from the norm in this matter,\" the statement said, according to ABC News.\n\nHowever, Dan Bongino, conservative radio show host and former law enforcement officer, argued that that assertion was \"bullsh-t.\" He posted on X:\n\nThis is absolutely a big deal. Don't buy the bullshit otherwise.\n\nIt was not a standard op. The MAL raid was an unprecedented action with significant potential for confusion and blue on blue issues and conflict. It also involved competing equities between federal agencies (FBI & USSS) with equal statutory claims to interrupt the other's activities.\n\nAnyone telling you otherwise is either dumb, or playing dumb. I've done more deconfliction with Russians in a foreign op I did for the USSS than the FBI did in their search warrant at MAL.\n\nOnly a dumbass would pitch the \"it's the standard paperwork\" line. Go serve a search warrant at the White House in the cocaine case while filling out your \"standard paperwork\" and see how that works out for you. Wake up.\n\nMike Cernovich, a conservative commentator, argued that standard procedures would not apply to a former president under Secret Service protection.\n\n\"It's sketchy as hell to see people acting like this was an ordinary raid and that usual policies would apply,\" he said on X.\n\nThe filings also showed that FBI agents were instructed on what to do if Trump arrived at Mar-a-Lago.\n\n\"Should FPOTUS arrive at MAL, FBI MM EM and OSCs will be prepared to engage with FPOTUS and USSS Security Team,\" it said. It also instructed FBI agents on what to do if Trump's Secret Service team provided \"resistance\" or interfered with \"FBI timeline or accesses.\"\n\nThe filings also suggested that FBI agents were prepared to search each guest room as well.\n\nThe FBI also had a medic on the scene, and identified a local trauma center in the case anyone was \"injured\" during the raid.\n\nKelly noted that Biden Attorney General Merrick Garland had authorized the raid, which had the potential of ending in a deadly confrontation.\n\nMike Davis, legal expert and founder of the Article 3 Project, argued that Garland authorizing a raid on Mar-a-Lago knowing the use of deadly force would be \"standard protocol\" \"makes it worse for Biden and Garland.\"\n\n\"It's even worse Biden and Garland authorized this raid on Trump, knowing deadly force is 'standard protocol,'\" he posted.\n\nRep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) called the authorization of deadly force \"grounds for impeachment\" of FBI Director Christopher Wray and Garland.\n\n\"Trump and team was cooperating the entire time with the FBI. Was deadly force authorized against Biden for his docs? Were they going to shoot SS then Pres Trump, Melania, and Barron too???\"\n\nShe then slammed Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) for funding the Justice Department and the FBI, as well as a new FBI building.\n\n\"Speaker Mike Johnson fully funded the DOJ and FBI plus new building and tied our hands behind our backs to hold them accountable. We have the power of the purse and Johnson has handed the purse to Chuck Schumer. All of this is unforgivable.\"\n\nRep. Jim Banks (R-IN) a U.S. Senate candidate, called Biden a \"threat to democracy.\"\n\nSen. Josh Hawley (R-MO) suggested he could call Garland to testify to the Senate.\n\nThe Justice Department signed off on the FBI raid to search for allegedly classified materials it suspected that Trump had taken to Mar-a-Lago after leaving office.\n\nSpecial Counsel Jack Smith has charged Trump with 37 counts that include willfully retaining national defense information in violation of the Espionage Act, making false statements, obstruction of justice, and conspiracy to obstruct justice.

Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) claimed on social media that the FBI and DOJ were \"planning to assassinate Pres. Trump and gave the green light.\"\n\nHowever, some noted that the FBI's policy is to use deadly force even for the execution of a search warrant.\n\n\"Every FBI operations order contains a reminder of FBI deadly force policy,\" former assistant director of counterintelligence at the FBI Frank Figliuzzi wrote on X. \"Even for a search warrant. Deadly force is always authorized if the required threat presents itself.\"\n\nBut, according to the former president's lawyers, there was no reason for agents to bring weapons to Mar-a-Lago.\n\n\"There were no threats and no risk to agents' safety arising from their allegations relating to possession of documents at a premises already guarded by the Secret Service,\" the lawyers said in a filing that was made public this week.\n\nThe defense lawyers wrote in a new motion that the August 2022 search of Mar-a-Lago was illegal and the FBI affidavit used as the basis of the raid wasn't accurate. In the case, President Trump is accused of illegally retaining classified records after he left the White House and obstructing federal officials' efforts to retrieve them; he has pleaded not guilty to the charges.\n\nBut officials under special counsel Jack Smith's office, which brought the case against the former commander-in-chief, said in their own filing that President Trump's lawyers are wrong, defending the methods used during the investigation. The warrant, they argued, was obtained after their investigations got surveillance video footage showing that there were alleged efforts to conceal the classified documents at the heart of the case.\n\n\"The warrant was supported by a detailed affidavit that established probable cause and did not omit any material information. And the warrant provided ample guidance to the FBI agents who conducted the search. Trump identifies no plausible basis to suppress the fruits of that search,\" Mr. Smith's team wrote.\n\nEarlier this month, U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon indefinitely postponed the classified documents trial date.

Officials said the raid would likely uncover evidence of obstruction of justice.\n\nAgents arrived at Mar-a-Lago at 8:59 a.m. on Aug. 8, 2022, and initiated the search at 10:33 a.m.. A summary of what transpired stated that FBI leaders coordinated with local Secret Service leaders and that Secret Service agents \"facilitated entry onto the premises, provided escort and access to various locations within, and posted USSS personnel in locations where the FBI team conducted searches.\"\n\nIn addition to 25 FBI employees from the bureau's Miami office, the group of DOJ personnel included five officials from Washington and two DOJ lawyers.\n\nThe group took numerous photographs, including pictures in the bedroom of former First Lady Melania Trump and a \"child's bedroom suite,\" according to picture logs that were released on Tuesday.\n\nPresident Trump's lawyers said in the motion that the search was \"roving and highly inappropriate,\" citing how it covered a gym, a kitchen, and the bedrooms where the pictures were taken. They said the warrant was too broad and authorized agents to seize virtually any document from Mar-a-Lago.\n\nGovernment officials have acknowledged they improperly seized passports and some other materials.\n\nAgents remained on the scene until 6:39 p.m. They flew the seized evidence to Washington the following day.\n\nPresident Trump after the execution of the warrant was charged with mishandling of national defense information, concealing documents, and making false statements.\n\nThe documents included a statement on the use of deadly force, which quoted government policy in stating that \"law enforcement officers of the Department of Justice (DOJ) may use deadly force only when necessary, that is, when the officer has a reasonable belief that the subject of such force poses an imminent danger of death or serious physical injury to the officer or to another person.\"\n\nThe FBI also brought a medic and paramedic along on the raid, according to the documents, and listed the nearest trauma center in case anyone was injured during the execution of the warrant.\n\nAgents were equipped with standard issue weapons, ammunition, handcuffs, and badges, and brought medium and large bolt cutters.\n\nThere was no basis for the FBI to bring guns into Mar-a-Lago, according to President Trump's lawyers.\n\n\"There were no threats and no risk to agents' safety arising from their allegations relating to possession of documents at a premises already guarded by the Secret Service,\" the lawyers said.\n\nThe lawyers also argued that an FBI agent omitted relevant information from the affidavit submitted to the judge as part of the request to authorize the warrant.\n\nThe agent, for instance, \"failed to disclose that presidents are not required to obtain clearances and that sensitive briefings including classified information had been provided to President Trump at Mar-a-Lago and other residences before and during his presidency,\" the lawyers said.\n\nIn a DOJ filing in response to the motion, government attorneys countered the arguments.\n\n\"Regardless of Trump's authority during his presidency, he lacked authority to possess classified documents at Mar-a-Lago after it ended and he became a private citizen. Trump's authority to access or possess classified documents during his presidency was both obvious and immaterial to the probable cause determination regarding the retention of the documents after his presidency,\" they wrote in part.", "source": {"uri": "zerohedge.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Zero Hedge"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mar-a-Lago", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mar-a-Lago"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secret_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Secret Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanitization_(classified_information)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sanitization (classified information)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_procedure", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Criminal procedure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_warrant", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Search warrant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadly_force", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Deadly force"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutionality", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Constitutionality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obstruction_of_justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Obstruction of justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melania_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Melania Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_magistrate_judge", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States magistrate judge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passport", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Passport"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probable_cause", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Probable cause"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Making_false_statements", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Making false statements"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classified_information", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Classified information"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handcuffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Handcuffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramedic", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paramedic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ammunition", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ammunition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affidavit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Affidavit"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/16_9_max_700/public/2024-05/image%20%2859%29.jpg?itok=CsRwI9mV", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9587575", "eventUri": "eng-9587575", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-21", "textStart": 1146, "textEnd": 1152}], "sentiment": 0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 197, "relevance": 1}

Others have also pointed out that the Trumps were out of state at the time of the raid, which was coordinated with U.S. Secret Service in advance.\n\nAccording to a motion for relief filed on Trump's behalf, FBI agents were directed by an \"Operations Order\" to seize \"classified information, [National Defense Information], and US Government records as described in [the] warrant.\"\n\n'Law enforcement officers of the Department of Justice may use deadly force when necessary.'\n\nWhen executing the raid -- which was personally authorized by Attorney General Merrick Garland -- agents were apparently cleared to go in hot.\n\nThe order said, \"Law enforcement officers of the Department of Justice may use deadly force when necessary,\" according to the filing.\n\nThe filing, which argued the raid was unconstitutional, indicated further that \"the agents planned to bring 'Standard Issue Weapon[s],' 'Ammo,' 'Handcuffs,' and 'medium and large sized bolt cutters,' but they were instructed to wear 'unmarked polo or collared shirts' and to keep 'law enforcement equipment concealed.'\"\n\nRealClearInvestigations' Julie Kelly highlighted that among the stated \"contingencies,\" armed FBI agents were instructed to be \"prepared to engage with [Former President of the United States] and [U.S. Secret Service] Security Team.\"\n\nTrump and several of his allies seized upon the filing, suggesting that the deadly force authorization amounted to clearance for a hit.\n\n'BIDEN'S DOJ WAS AUTHORIZED TO SHOOT ME!'\n\nTrump noted on Truth Social, \"WOW! I just came out of the Biden Witch Hunt Trial in Manhattan, the 'Icebox,' and was shown Reports that Crooked Joe Biden's DOJ, in their Illegal and UnConstitutional Raid of Mar-a-Lago, AUTHORIZED THE FBI TO USE DEADLY (LETHAL) FORCE. NOW WE KNOW, FOR SURE, THAT JOE BIDEN IS A SERIOUS THREAT TO DEMOCRACY. HE IS MENTALLY UNFIT TO HOLD OFFICE -- 25TH AMENDMENT!\"\n\nThe Washington Post indicated that the Trump campaign also circulated a fundraising email claiming that \"BIDEN'S DOJ WAS AUTHORIZED TO SHOOT ME!\"\n\nIn the first of a series of greatly ridiculed tweets, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) asked, \"Was deadly force authorized against Biden for his docs? Were they going to shoot SS then Pres Trump, Melania, and Barron too?\"\n\n\"I made sure that he knew,\" Greene said in a subsequent tweet, which has received a community note. \"The Biden DOJ and FBI were planning to assassinate Pres Trump and gave the green light. Does everyone get it yet???!!!!\"\n\nRep. Paul Gosar (R-Ariz.) asserted, \"Biden ordered the hit on Trump at Mar-a-Lago.\"\n\nFormer Trump adviser Steve Bannon said on his show \"War Room\" that this was an \"assassination attempt on Donald John Trump or people associated with him. They wanted a gun fight. ... They had use of deadly force authorized by the director of the FBI and Merrick Garland. They brought a medic, a combat medic. They brought -- they had a triage plan for the injured and they had a trauma center.\"\n\n\"The FBI followed standard protocol in this search as we do for all search warrants, which includes a standard policy statement limiting the use of deadly force,\" the bureau said in a statement obtained by the New York Post. \"No one ordered additional steps to be taken and there was no departure from the norm in this matter.\"\n\n'Deadly force is always authorized if the required threat presents itself.'\n\nFrank Figliuzzi, the FBI's former assistant director of counterintelligence, noted that \"every FBI operations order contains a reminder of FBI deadly force policy. Even for a search warrant. Deadly force is always authorized if the required threat presents itself.\"\n\nCommunity notes on Gosar and Greene's tweets also indicated the deadly force authorization \"is standard language by the DOJ relating to their policy on use of force and has nothing to do with President Biden.\"\n\nIn 2023, former FBI assistant director in charge Steve D'Antuono testified to Congress that it \"wasn't even a show of force,\" reported Axios.\n\n\"It wasn't even a show of force, right, because we were all in agreement,\" D'Antuono told the House Committee on the Judiciary. \"We didn't do a show of force, right. I was adamant about that, and that was something that we agreed on, right, the FBI agreed on, right. No raid jackets, no blazed FBI. We interact. We made sure we interacted with the Secret Service to make sure we could get into Mar-a-Lago with no issues.

Marjorie Taylor Greene and Lauren Boebert, are being called out for raising a major fuss about the FBI search of Mar-a-Lago in August 2022, turning a standard procedure into an alleged personal attack against the former president.\n\nOn Tuesday, Trump shared on his social media platform Truth Social the information revealed by an unsealed search warrant in his classified documents case which said that federal agents were prepared to use \"deadly force\" when executing the raid of his Florida resort.\n\n\"I just came out of the Biden Witch Hunt Trial in Manhattan, the 'Icebox,' and was shown Reports that Crooked Joe Biden's DOJ, in their illegal and Unconstitutional Raid of Mar-a-Lago, AUTHORIZED THE FBI TO USE DEADLY (LETHAL) FORCE,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social on May 21.\n\nHe added: \"NOW WE KNOW, FOR SURE, THAT JOE BIDEN IS A SERIOUS THREAT TO DEMOCRACY. HE IS MENTALLY UNFIT TO HOLD OFFICE -- 25TH AMENDMENT!\"\n\nThe FBI has since responded to the post saying that it \"followed standard protocol in this search as we do for all search warrants, which includes a standard policy statement limiting the use of deadly force,\" as in a statement reported by several news companies. \"No one ordered additional steps to be taken and there was no departure from the norm in this matter,\" the FBI said.\n\nNewsweek contacted the FBI for comment by email early on Wednesday.\n\nDespite the fact that the agency followed standard procedure -- and knew that the former president wasn't at Mar-a-Lago at the time of the raid -- Trump's post inflamed his supporters and his allies in the Republican Party.\n\nGreene, a Trump loyalist known for her previous support for several QAnon conspiracy theories, immediately escalated the former president's accusations and wrote on X, formerly Twitter, that \"the Biden DOJ and FBI were planning to assassinate Pres. Trump and gave the green light.\" These are baseless accusations.\n\n\"Why was deadly force authorized in the Mar-a-Lago raid when all they were expecting to encounter was papers? This needs to be answered now,\" Boebert wrote on X on Tuesday.\n\nSeveral journalists and experts on social media called out Greene and Trump for their misleading accusations.\n\n\"Every FBI operations order contains a reminder of FBI deadly force policy,\" Frank Figliuzzi, former assistant director of counterintelligence at the FBI, wrote on X.\n\n\"This is wildly irresponsible, even for professional trolls like Marjorie Taylor Greene.

This is a complete lie and she knows it. The DOJ and the FBI were not planning any such thing. What the hell is wrong with MAGA? They just lie, lie, lie,\" wrote Gen Z activist and NYU student Harry Sisson on X.\n\n\"MAGA is just now finding out the FBI is an armed law enforcement agency and will shoot back if threatened,\" added Patriot Takes, an account monitoring right-wing extremism online.\n\nThe FBI seized hundreds of documents containing classified information from Mar-a-Lago in August 2022 which the embattled former president had failed to turn over after leaving the White House.

The FBI seized several documents during the raid. On Tuesday, newly unsealed court files revealed that four more secret documents were found in Trump's bedroom following the FBI search at Mar-a-Lago.\n\nThe former president is currently facing 40 felony charges for allegedly mishandling top-secret materials taken to his home after leaving office. He disputes all charges brought against him.\n\nGreene's claim comes following Trump's Tuesday post on his Truth Social website, stating that he had been \"shown Reports that Crooked Joe Biden's DOJ, in their Illegal and UnConstitutional Raid of Mar-a-Lago, AUTHORIZED THE FBI TO USE DEADLY (LETHAL) FORCE.\"\n\nHe even wrote a fundraising email to his Maga followers, with the subject line \"They were authorized to shoot me!\"\n\nCalling Biden \"a serious threat to democracy\", the GOP leader suggested he should be removed from office via the Constitution's 25th Amendment.\n\nLater, Trump's staunch supporter Greene took to X and shared a screenshot of Trump's post and wrote: \"The Biden DOJ and FBI were planning to assassinate Pres Trump and gave the green light.\"\"\n\n\"Does everyone get it yet???!!!! What are Republicans going to do about it? I tried to oust our Speaker who funded Biden's DOJ AND FBI, but Democrats stopped it.\"\n\nReacting to Greene's post, one X user wrote: \"He's not dead. If they wanted him dead, he'd be dead\".\n\n\"Trump wasn't even there. The FBI went there August 8, 2022. Trump was in New York. Calm down drama queen!\" another wrote.\n\nIn a statement to The Washington Post, the FBI argued that the term \"use of deadly force\" is common practice in all of its search operations.\n\nThe federal agency further stated that the Mar-a-Lago raid briefing followed conventional protocol like other search warrants, including a customary policy statement prohibiting the use of lethal force. \"No one ordered additional steps to be taken and there was no departure from the norm in this matter.\"\n\nAlso Read: AOC, MTG engage in verbal battle over fake eyelashes and butch body jab: 'Are your feelings hurt?'\n\nFrank Figliuzzi, the agency's former associate director for counterintelligence, supported the FBI's stance in an X post. \"Yep, every FBI operations order contains a reminder of FBI deadly force policy. Even for a search warrant. Deadly force is always authorized if the required threat presents itself.\"\n\nAccording to Justice Department regulation, law enforcement agents are allowed to use lethal force in situation when it seems \"necessary\" or \"when the officer has a reasonable belief that the subject of such force poses an imminent danger of death or serious physical injury to the officer or another person.", "source": {"uri": "hindustantimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hindustan Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mar-a-Lago", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mar-a-Lago"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadly_force", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Deadly force"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marjorie_Taylor_Greene", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marjorie Taylor Greene"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Felony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth_Social", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Truth Social"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty-fifth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Speaker of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandria_Ocasio-Cortez", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counterintelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Counterintelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Washington_Post", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Washington Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_warrant", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Search warrant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal government of the United States"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2024/05/22/1600x900/US-VOTE-POLITICS-TRUMP-41_1716383100124_1716383117530.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9587575", "eventUri": "eng-9587575", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 195, "relevance": 1}

Is it not? Is it not? IS IT NOT?\"\n\nRep.

That's how many White House documents the government has recovered in total from Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate alone, more than 100 of which have classified markings.\n\nTrump has pleaded not guilty to the charges against him in the documents case, claiming the case against him is a \"witch hunt\" and arguing he was legally allowed to hang onto the documents under the Presidential Records Act -- an argument that legal experts have rejected.\n\nWhen the classified documents case will actually go to trial. Trump's trial in the case was initially supposed to begin this week, but got delayed as U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon, who's overseeing the trial, kept pushing back deadlines. Cannon ultimately indefinitely delayed the trial earlier in May as the parties still work out discovery issues in the case, and it's unclear when the trial could begin -- though it's certain not to be before the November election.\n\nTrump faces 40 felony charges in his documents case, for willful retention of national defense information, obstruction and destroying evidence. Under federal law, presidential documents remain property of the federal government once presidents leave office, with the National Archives taking possession of them. Trump brought documents back to Mar-a-Lago back with him, and while he turned over a few boxes of documents voluntarily to the National Archives in early 2022, the government then subpoenaed him to provide all remaining classified materials after having reason to believe that more remained at Mar-a-Lago. Prosecutors allege Trump intentionally concealed documents from his lawyers as they searched for documents to comply with the subpoena, including by directing aides -- who have now also been indicted -- to move documents on his behalf.

'If we tolerate this, we tolerate the end of this republic.'\"\n\nThe post included a video with Bannon and Davis in which they discuss the search of Mar-a-Lago. During the video, Bannon said \"They authorized deadly force, they had a medic, they had a plan to triage the wounded, they had a trauma center 18 miles away on a map. This was an attempted assassination on Donald John Trump or people associated with him. They wanted a gun fight.\n\n\"They had use of deadly force, authorized by the director of the FBI and [U.S. Attorney General] Merrick Garland. They brought a medic, a combat medic, they had a triage plan for the injured and they had a trauma center.\"\n\nThe Facts\n\nThere is no evidence that the FBI search of the Mar-a-Lago was part of an \"attempted assassination\" on Trump.\n\nThe story comes from the release of a recent court filing connected to the search of Mar-a-Lago in August 2022. An unsealed search warrant in that case revealed that federal agents were prepared to use \"deadly force\" when executing the raid of his Florida resort.\n\nAn \"operations order\" of the 9 a.m. raid that was produced in discovery contained a \"policy statement\" regarding the \"use of deadly force,\" which said in part: \"Law enforcement officers of the Department of Justice may use deadly force when necessary.\"\n\nA contingencies plan was also created in cohesion with the raid, showing that a paramedic should be at the scene in case someone is injured. The name of the nearest local trauma center, complete with an address and a phone number, was included on the same form.\n\nHowever, the use of deadly force is standard FBI procedure as per the bureau's online resources that state \"FBI special agents may use deadly force only when necessary -- when the agent has a reasonable belief that the subject of such force poses an imminent danger of death or serious physical injury to the agent or another person.\n\n\"If feasible, a verbal warning to submit to the authority of the special agent is given prior to the use of deadly force.\"\n\nAn FBI spokesperson sent Newsweek a statement issued in response to claims about the search warrant that said: \"The FBI followed standard protocol in this search as we do for all search warrants, which includes a standard policy statement limiting the use of deadly force.\n\n\"No one ordered additional steps to be taken and there was no departure from the norm in this matter.\"\n\nRetired FBI Assistant Director Frank Figliuzzi wrote on X in response to the \"deadly force\" comments \"Yep, every FBI operations order contains a reminder of FBI deadly force policy. Even for a search warrant. Deadly force is always authorized if the required threat presents itself.\"\n\nAs noted in a recent report by Axios, former FBI Assistant Director in Charge Steven D'Antuono told Congress last year that the Secret Service interacted with the FBI to make sure it could get into Mar-a-Lago \"with no issues,\" saying \"it wasn't even a show of force.\"\n\nNewsweek has contacted a representative for Steve Bannon via email for comment.\n\nTrump helped spread news about the FBI search warrant, writing on Truth Social on May 21, \"I just came out of the Biden Witch Hunt Trial in Manhattan, the 'Icebox,' and was shown Reports that Crooked Joe Biden's DOJ, in their illegal and Unconstitutional Raid of Mar-a-Lago, AUTHORIZED THE FBI TO USE DEADLY (LETHAL) FORCE.\"\n\nHe added: \"NOW WE KNOW, FOR SURE, THAT JOE BIDEN IS A SERIOUS THREAT TO DEMOCRACY. HE IS MENTALLY UNFIT TO HOLD OFFICE -- 25TH AMENDMENT!\"\n\nTrump's post inflamed his supporters and his allies in the Republican Party, who repeated the assassination claims.\n\nMarjorie Taylor Greene, a Trump loyalist known for her previous support for several QAnon conspiracy theories, immediately escalated the former president's accusations and wrote on X, formerly Twitter, that \"the Biden DOJ and FBI were planning to assassinate Pres. Trump and gave the green light.\"\n\nThere was no \"assassination attempt\" on Donald Trump by the FBI. The use of \"deadly force\" as contained in now unsealed search warrant documents is boiler-plate procedural text used by the bureau.", "source": {"uri": "newsweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

This is standard policy.\"\n\nTrump and two co-defendants have pleaded not guilty to all charges against them and denied wrongdoing.\n\nFor their part, Trump's attorneys in their filing Tuesday made no such accusation that the inclusion of the policy showed Biden was preparing to assassinate Trump, and it's not immediately clear whether they had shared the information - part of a vast trove of discovery in his case -- with Trump prior to it being unsealed.\n\nWhile Trump said he first learned of the filing after being \"shown Reports\" about it after court proceedings were finished in his New York state criminal hush money case, Georgia GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene later posted on X she \"made sure\" Trump knew about the false claim the \"Biden DOJ and FBI were planning to assassinate\" him.\n\nThe operations order further shows how agents were well aware Trump would not be present at the property during the search, as it was carried out during Mar-a-Lago's off-season when Trump normally resides at his property in Bedminster, New Jersey.\n\nThey did, however, include a contingency plan in the event Trump showed up at the property mid-search, at which time they said FBI personnel on site would be prepared \"to engage with\" him and his Secret Service security detail. The full context shows there's no suggestion of the situation escalating into violence, and that it was more about assigning points of contact responsible for speaking with members of Trump's detail.\n\nThe order also further bolsters testimony from the former director of the FBI's Washington, D.C,. field office Steve D'Antuono, who previously testified to Congress he was \"adamant\" agents executing the warrant \"didn't do a show of force.\"\n\n\"It wasn't even a show of force, right, because we were all in agreement,\" D'Antuono said in an exchange with Rep. Jim Jordan, the Ohio Republican who chairs the House Judiciary Committee. \"No raid jackets, no blazed FBI ... We weren't bringing any like FBI vehicles, everything that was reported about helicopters and a hundred people descending on, like, a Die Hard movie, was completely untrue, right.

This is standard policy.\"\n\nTrump and two co-defendants have pleaded not guilty to all charges against them and denied wrongdoing.\n\nFor their part, Trump's attorneys in their filing Tuesday made no such accusation that the inclusion of the policy showed Biden was preparing to assassinate Trump, and it's not immediately clear whether they had shared the information - part of a vast trove of discovery in his case -- with Trump prior to it being unsealed.\n\nWhile Trump said he first learned of the filing after being \"shown Reports\" about it after court proceedings were finished in his New York state criminal hush money case, Georgia GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene later posted on X she \"made sure\" Trump knew about the false claim the \"Biden DOJ and FBI were planning to assassinate\" him.\n\nThe operations order further shows how agents were well aware Trump would not be present at the property during the search, as it was carried out during Mar-a-Lago's off-season when Trump normally resides at his property in Bedminster, New Jersey.\n\nThey did, however, include a contingency plan in the event Trump showed up at the property mid-search, at which time they said FBI personnel on site would be prepared \"to engage with\" him and his Secret Service security detail. The full context shows there's no suggestion of the situation escalating into violence, and that it was more about assigning points of contact responsible for speaking with members of Trump's detail.\n\nThe order also further bolsters testimony from the former director of the FBI's Washington, D.C,. field office Steve D'Antuono, who previously testified to Congress he was \"adamant\" agents executing the warrant \"didn't do a show of force.\"\n\n\"It wasn't even a show of force, right, because we were all in agreement,\" D'Antuono said in an exchange with Rep. Jim Jordan, the Ohio Republican who chairs the House Judiciary Committee. \"No raid jackets, no blazed FBI ...

They were ready to kill me?!\"\n\n\"A few dozen FBI agents against me and they were ready to kill me?!!!\" Bobb wrote to X, formerly Twitter, while sharing a link to the New York Post report. \"What happened to the United States of America?!\"\n\nKari Lake, an Arizona Senate candidate and staunch Trump ally, also reacted to reports of the FBI's \"operation order\" during the raid, writing on use deadly force in Mar-a-Lago BS raid. tells you everything you need to know about this criminal Biden admin. \"\n\nAccording to Frank Figliuzzi, retired deputy director of counterintelligence at the FBI, all of the bureau's operation orders contain \"a reminder of the FBI's deadly force policy.\"\n\n\"Even for a search warrant,\" Figliuzzi posted on X. \"Deadly force is still authorized if the required threat presents itself.\"\n\nNewsweek contacted the FBI by email for additional comment Tuesday evening.\n\nAnd after\n\nTrump and Biden, the presumptive 2024 presidential nominees for their respective political parties, are expected to face off in two debates in the coming months. Many early polls have shown the race for the White House to be a bit tough, although recent surveys compiled by RealClearPolling and FiveThirtyEight showed Trump narrowly ahead in a few key battleground states.\n\nUpdated 5/21/24, 7:35 p.m. ET: This article has been updated with additional information and context.\n\nUncommon knowledge\n\nNewsweek is committed to challenging conventional

(Richard Baker / In Pictures via Getty Images Images)\n\nIn the latest attempt to portray himself as the victim of political persecution, former President Donald Trump posted Tuesday evening on Truth Social that \"Crooked Joe Biden's DOJ, in their Illegal and UnConstitutional Raid of Mar-a-Lago, AUTHORIZED THE FBI TO USE DEADLY (LETHAL) FORCE\" in the search for classified documents at his Florida home.\n\nThe search, part of a Department of Justice investigation into Trump's allegedly intentional mishandling of government records, including national security information, uncovered over 13,000 files stashed away in his private club.\n\nTrump's post came after a filing by his legal team, made public earlier Tuesday, that highlighted the FBI's authorization to use deadly force in its August 2022 raid. U.S. Judge Aileen Cannon also unsealed documents that provided additional details on the raid, revealing that Trump's attorneys found more classified documents hidden in his bedroom following the FBI search.\n\nTrump's campaign also sent an email to supporters asserting that Biden was \"locked & loaded ready to take me out.\"\n\nThe FBI, which is led by a Trump appointee, issued a rare statement to refute the claim, clarifying that they \"followed standard protocol in this search as we do for all search warrants, which includes a standard policy statement limiting the use of deadly force ... no one ordered additional steps to be taken and there was no departure from the norm in this matter.\"\n\nThe protocol, posted on the FBI's website, stipulates that agents may use deadly force only \"when the agent has a reasonable belief that the subject of such force poses an imminent danger of death or serious physical injury to the agent or another person.\"\n\nFBI agents carried out their search of Mar-a-Lago in 2022 without any violence or presence of helicopters and armored vehicles. That fact has not stopped Trump's Republican allies from echoing his false statements, with Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., claiming that the DOJ and FBI were \"planning to assassinate Pres.

Looking for one.\n\nOf course, President Trump and his staff was far too wise and far too calm and collected to give that to them.\n\nMAGA is the side of peace!\n\nIf you'd like to see more of the unsealed documents, here is a good link: https://www.lawfaremedia.org/current-projects/the-trump-trials/trump-prosecuted-in-the-southern-district-of-florida/docket-watch-trump-prosecuted-in-the-southern-district-of-florida\n\nWe'll continue to monitor the story and bring you updates.", "source": {"uri": "100percentfedup.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "100 Percent Fed Up"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mar-a-Lago", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mar-a-Lago"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aileen_Cannon", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Aileen Cannon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_district_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States district court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classified_information", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Classified information"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_America_Great_Again", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Make America Great Again"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 71}], "image": "https://100percentfedup.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/trump-serious-1200x630-1-1600x900.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9587575", "eventUri": "eng-9587575", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2941176470588236, "wgt": 183, "relevance": 1}

FBI agents recovered classified material from Trump's time in the White House - which the former president is now charged with illegally retaining. One page in the document includes a \"policy statement\" on the use of deadly force, which says officers may resort to lethal force only when the subject of such force poses an \"imminent danger of death or serious physical injury\" to an officer or another person.\n\nTrump, the presumptive GOP nominee for president, and some of his allies suggested Tuesday that this was evidence that Biden's Justice Department was prepared to fatally shoot him. In fact, Trump was not at his Florida property the day of the search. FBI agents specifically sought to avoid a confrontation with Trump, choosing a day when Trump would not be at the property and giving the Secret Service a heads-up, The Washington Post previously reported.\n\nA former president falsely accusing his successor and rival of posing a threat to his life is without precedent in modern U.S. history. The comments marked a sharp escalation of Trump's baseless attacks on Biden, as the former president faces 88 criminal charges across four indictments in federal and state courts. Trump has frequently accused Biden of weaponizing the legal system against him in coordination with the Justice Department and local prosecutors. There is no evidence of such coordination.\n\nA Tuesday evening fundraising email from the Trump campaign that was signed in the candidate's name arrived with the subject line, \"They were authorized to shoot me!\" and said of the Biden administration, \"You know they're just itching to do the unthinkable ... Joe Biden was locked & loaded ready to take me out & put my family in danger.\"\n\nTrump also wrote Tuesday on his social media site, Truth Social, that \"Joe Biden's DOJ, in their Illegal and UnConstitutional Raid of Mar-a-Lago, AUTHORIZED THE FBI TO USE DEADLY (LETHAL) FORCE.\"\n\nThe FBI said in a statement Tuesday that it \"followed standard protocol in this search as we do for all search warrants, which includes a standard policy statement limiting the use of deadly force.\"\n\n\"No one ordered additional steps to be taken and there was no departure from the norm in this matter,\" the agency said.\n\nFBI agents got approval from a federal magistrate judge in Florida to search Mar-a-Lago after months of efforts to get Trump to hand over the documents at issue. Agents also arrived in deliberately casual outfits to lower their profile - khakis and polo shirts - to comb the area and left with more than 100 classified records, some of which were top secret.\n\nIn response to a question about the differences between the policy in the law enforcement document and Trump's claims, his campaign spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt accused The Washington Post of waging a \"sickening attempt to run cover for Joe Biden.\"\n\n\"The good news is, Americans don't buy the pro-Democrat, Election Interfering pro-Biden propaganda the Washington Post is constantly selling,\" she wrote in an email.\n\nThe Biden campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Some of Trump's allies echoed the former president's claims on social media.\n\nRep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.), a staunch Trump ally, went even further than Trump on social media, writing on X that \"The Biden DOJ and FBI were planning to assassinate Pres Trump and gave the green light.\"\n\nThroughout his campaign, Trump has used the charges against him to rally his political base and raise millions of dollars. He has pleaded not guilty to the charges.\n\nTrump is currently on trial in New York on allegations of falsifying business records to cover up hush money to a porn actress and awaits trial in the other three cases.\n\n[Defense rests without Trump taking the witness stand in his New York hush money trial]\n\nTrump's Tuesday comments add to a long history of false and incendiary claims against his political opponents, which Democrats and some Republicans have denounced, and has alarmed historians who have studied political rhetoric. Some of his supporters, including Republican members of Congress, conservative media personalities and others have often repeated or amplified his claims.\n\nIt is not clear if Trump will stand trial before the election on the charges of mishandling classified documents. Prosecutors say Trump improperly kept top-secret documents from his presidency and then obstructed the government's attempts to retrieve them.\n\n- - -", "source": {"uri": "adn.com", "dataType":

However, newly released documents associated with the raid empowered the FBI and DOJ agents present on the scene to shoot Donald Trump and his Secret Service detail if necessary. We don't know if this was standard operating procedure or not, but it's certainly concerning on its face.\n\nThis new information emerged in newly unsealed documents in Judge Aileen Cannon's courtroom. The invaluable Julie Kelly writes:\n\nAn exhibit filed today by Donald Trump in a motion to suppress evidence seized during the FBI's August 2022 raid of Mar-a-Lago revealed shocking new details about the bureau's plans to use deadly force and even engage the former president and his security detail that day if necessary. The document is just one of many court filings recently ordered unsealed by Judge Aileen Cannon, who is presiding over the matter in southern Florida.\n\nAs noted above, the FBI and DOJ planned the raid for a time when they knew that Donald Trump would be away. However, the best laid plans don't always go as expected, so there had to be a contingency plan...and what a plan it was. Per Julie Kelly:\n\nOne section of the plan described how agents should handle the potential for use of deadly force:\n\nThe FBI also considered various scenarios should the former president unexpectedly arrive at his residence during the raid. Agents were also prepared to go door-to-door to terrorize Mar-a-Lago guests if staff refused to turn over room keys:\n\nAssuming that the use of deadly force statement is not the FBI's standard operating procedure, its inclusion in the raid plan is disturbing. And even if it is SOP, the additional \"contingencies\" plan has sufficient ambiguity to suggest that the agents on the scene had a lot of latitude.\n\nThus, paragraph 2 of the \"Contingencies\" document states, \"Should FPOTUS arrive at MAL, FBI MM EM and OSCs will be prepared to engage with FPOTUS and USSS Security Team.\" In the context of a plan that explicitly authorizes the use of deadly force, the concept of \"engaging\" can have myriad meanings, some of them deeply disturbing. Indeed, the FBI also planned to bring along a medic in case anyone was \"injured,\" and it identified the closest trauma center. Again, SOP? We don't know now.\n\nI don't need to repeat at length here that the entire classified document case is completely bogus. We now know that it was the National archivists who dumped the boxes with Trump.\n\nMoreover, as president of the United States, Donald Trump had plenary power over all classification schemes. Neither the employees of the administrative state (who work for the president and not vice versa) nor the legislature (which cannot infringe on the executive's constitutional authority) can alter the president's final say over document classification. Also, as a reminder, Biden was not president when he mishandled classified documents.\n\nThe raid and the ensuing indictment were intended to embarrass Trump, sideline him, and potentially imprison him. It's possible, too, that the raid was also meant to locate documents showing criminal acts that the Democrats committed during and after Obama's presidency.\n\nWith this new information about the authorization for the use of deadly force and the contingency plan in case Trump and/or his Secret Service got in the way, it's just so easy to let your imagination run wild. Can't you just see some fervently partisan bureaucrat in the DOJ or the FBI fantasizing that Trump will arrive at Mar-a-Lago unexpectedly, get feisty, and be taken out by an over-zealous agent?\n\nIn this fantasy, the agent, of course, will go to prison, a sacrificial lamb on the altar of making the obscene look respectable.

Even without knowing all the details regarding the documents and items seized (we still don't), the show of force by Joe Biden's DOJ seemed like a gross abuse of power -- and highly political.\n\nIt left me with a sick pit in my stomach -- and I was in the camp of those willing to entertain the possibility that the former president did break the law. Please note: I said \"possibility.\" To be clear, I did not want that to be the case.\n\nNor did I want it to be the case that our government was so corrupt -- so far gone -- that any rule could be broken so long as it was in the service of \"getting Trump.\" Yet, I have to acknowledge what we've seen play out over and over again in the past eight years. And watching the circus that's unfolded in a Manhattan courtroom over the past six weeks hasn't disabused me of the belief that that is exactly where we are at this moment in time: Anything goes, and all means are justified for the ends of ending Trump's political career.\n\nBut does it even go beyond that, with the aim of ending Trump himself?\n\nOne interpretation of documents unsealed on Tuesday in the case arising out of that raid at Mar-a-Lago is that, indeed, that was the aim of that raid -- or, at least, the Biden administration would have been fine had that been a byproduct of its unprecedented action against the former president.\n\nSo, we've seen a number of headlines along these lines: Biden administration authorized 'Use of Deadly Force' in Mar-a-Lago raid.\n\nTechnically, that's accurate.\n\nThe Biden administration authorized the use of deadly force during the FBI's raid on former President Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida in August 2022 as part of its investigation into classified records, court documents revealed.\n\nAn \"Operations Order\" produced in discovery as part of Special Counsel Jack Smith's investigation into Trump's alleged improper retention of classified records revealed that the \"FBI believed its objective for the Mar-a-Lago raid was to seize 'classified information, NDI, and US Government records,'\" as described in the search warrant.\n\nThe order, according to a court filing, contained a \"Policy Statement\" regarding \"Use of Deadly Force,\" which stated, for example, \"Law Enforcement officers of the Department of Justice may use deadly force when necessary.\"\n\nFrom the unsealed Motion for Relief Relating to the Mar-a-Lago Raid and Unlawful Piercing of Attorney-Client Privilege, we see the following:\n\nAccording to an \"Operations Order\" produced in discovery, the FBI believed its objective for the Mar-a-Lago raid was to seize \"classified information, NDI, and US Government records as described in [the] search warrant.\" Ex. 3 at USA-01285174. The Order contained a \"Policy Statement\" regarding \"Use Of Deadly Force,\" which stated, for example, \"Law enforcement officers of the Department of Justice may use deadly force when necessary . . . .\" Id. at USA01285183. The agents planned to bring \"Standard Issue Weapon[s],\" \"Ammo,\" \"Handcuffs,\" and \"medium and large sized bolt cutters,\" but they were instructed to wear \"unmarked polo or collared shirts\" and to keep \"law enforcement equipment concealed.\" Id. at USA-01285184.\n\nHere's the thing: The language reflected in the Operations Order and related documents was standard language -- the sort of language you'd find in most orders of that nature. Don't take my word for it -- let's see what those who've actually executed such warrants and/or been present at briefings involving them have to say:\n\nIn other words, while the thought of \"deadly force\" being contemplated in any way in connection with a former president or his residence is abhorrent, the \"Operations Order\" and briefing documentation related to the Mar-a-Lago raid were neither unique nor enhanced because of their target. If anything, what they show is that Biden's Justice Department was determined to treat \"citizen Trump\" just like any other old schmoe they'd set their sights on and not give him any deference.\n\nWhich, again, to be perfectly clear, in no way justifies the raid or his prosecution. This is simply to point out that the \"deadly force\" authorization language was not extraordinary, even while the raid itself was.\n\nOne more point on this: Questions have been raised about language in the \"Contingencies\" section of the documents pertaining to the FBI and Miami field agents \"engaging\" with the Secret Service. Some have interpreted this to contemplate a physical confrontation between the Secret Service and the FBI agents.\n\nBut what that interpretation appears to overlook is the full sentence at issue: \"Should USSS provide resistance or interfere with FBI timeline or accesses, FBI MM EM will engage with [redaction] and [redaction] will engage with USSS POC's per existing liaison relationship.\"\n\nThe reference to \"POC's\" (points of contact) and \"existing liaison relationship\" make it clear that the provision is describing how the agents conducting the raid should use existing relationships with the Secret Service to address any resistance or interference -- not instructing them to engage the Secret Service with deadly force.\n\nOf course, the next \"contingency\" in that section references the search team going door-to-door to determine the \"occupant status\" of any Mar-a-Lago guests if the resort's Guest Reception personnel declined to provide them with that information. So, characterizing the entire enterprise as overkill, heavy-handed, ridiculous, unconscionable -- and a few other choice adjectives -- is wholly justified.\n\nBut, no, to those -- including a sitting Congressman -- characterizing the revelations in these documents as meaning the Biden administration \"ordered a hit\" on former President Trump, that simply isn't the case. Was it a disgusting political hit? Absolutely.\n\nRELATED:\n\nWhen Even Andrew Cuomo and Andrew Yang Raise the Alarm About Trump Raid, You Know It Stinks", "source": {"uri": "redstate.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Redstate"}, "authors": [{"uri": "susie_moore@redstate.com", "name": "Susie Moore", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mar-a-Lago", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mar-a-Lago"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadly_force", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Deadly force"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abuse_of_power", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Abuse of power"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classified_information", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Classified information"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_warrant", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Search warrant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal government of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Smith_(lawyer)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jack Smith (lawyer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mueller_special_counsel_investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mueller special counsel investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handcuffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Handcuffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ammunition", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ammunition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secret_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Secret Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Yang", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Andrew Yang"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redaction", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Redaction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Cuomo", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Andrew Cuomo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2022/221/17e72754-f749-43c1-b55c-51329ca9c399.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9587575", "eventUri": "eng-9587575", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.03529411764705892, "wgt": 181, "relevance": 1}

Officials said the raid would likely uncover evidence of obstruction of justice.\n\nAgents arrived at Mar-a-Lago at 8:59 a.m. on Aug. 8, 2022, and initiated the search at 10:33 a.m.. A summary of what transpired stated that FBI leaders coordinated with local Secret Service leaders and that Secret Service agents \"facilitated entry onto the premises, provided escort and access to various locations within, and posted USSS personnel in locations where the FBI team conducted searches.\"\n\nIn addition to 25 FBI employees from the bureau's Miami office, the group of DOJ personnel included five officials from Washington and two DOJ lawyers.\n\nThe group took numerous photographs, including pictures in the bedroom of former First Lady Melania Trump and a \"child's bedroom suite,\" according to picture logs that were released on Tuesday.\n\nPresident Trump's lawyers said in the motion that the search was \"roving and highly inappropriate,\" citing how it covered a gym, a kitchen, and the bedrooms where the pictures were taken. They said the warrant was too broad and authorized agents to seize virtually any document from Mar-a-Lago.\n\nGovernment officials have acknowledged they improperly seized passports and some other materials.\n\nAgents remained on the scene until 6:39 p.m. They flew the seized evidence to Washington the following day.\n\nPresident Trump, after the execution of the warrant, was charged with mishandling national defense information, concealing documents, and making false statements.\n\nThe documents included a statement on the use of deadly force, which quoted government policy in stating that \"law enforcement officers of the Department of Justice (DOJ) may use deadly force only when necessary, that is, when the officer has a reasonable belief that the subject of such force poses an imminent danger of death or serious physical injury to the officer or to another person.\"\n\nThe FBI also brought a medic and paramedic along on the raid, according to the documents, and listed the nearest trauma center in case anyone was injured during the execution of the warrant.\n\nAgents were equipped with standard-issue weapons, ammunition, handcuffs, and badges and brought medium and large bolt cutters.\n\nThere was no basis for the FBI to bring guns into Mar-a-Lago, according to President Trump's lawyers.\n\n\"There were no threats and no risk to agents' safety arising from their allegations relating to possession of documents at a premises already guarded by the Secret Service,\" the lawyers said.\n\nThe lawyers also argued that an FBI agent omitted relevant information from the affidavit submitted to the judge as part of the request to authorize the warrant.\n\nThe agent, for instance, \"failed to disclose that presidents are not required to obtain clearances and that sensitive briefings including classified information had been provided to President Trump at Mar-a-Lago and other residences before and during his presidency,\" the lawyers said.\n\nIn a DOJ filing in response to the motion, government attorneys countered the arguments.\n\n\"Regardless of Trump's authority during his presidency, he lacked authority to possess classified documents at Mar-a-Lago after it ended and he became a private citizen. Trump's authority to access or possess classified documents during his presidency was both obvious and immaterial to the probable cause determination regarding the retention of the documents after his presidency,\" they wrote in part.\n\nThe attorneys also said that while some FBI officials did suggest seeking the consent of former President Trump to search Mar-a-Lago before seeking a warrant, his \"prior obfuscation and deception up to that point\" meant there was \"ample reason to avoid seeking Trump's consent, which would simply invite more deception.\"", "source": {"uri": "ntd.com",

He is mentally unfit to hold office - 25th amendment,\" said Trump, who is the current Republican frontrunner to challenge Biden in November's presidential election.\n\nIn a rare and apparently direct response to the former president's post, the FBI said in a statement that its agents had followed \"standard procedure\" during the raid.\n\n\"The FBI followed standard protocol in this search as we do for all search warrants, which includes a standard policy statement limiting the use of deadly force,\" the statement read. \"No one ordered additional steps to be taken and there was no departure from the norm in this matter.\"\n\nThe FBI's search of Mar-a-Lago found that dozens of classified documents remained in the residence. Trump, however, has claimed that he was within his rights as a former president to possess the documents.", "source": {"uri": "rt.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "RT"}, "authors": [{"uri": "rt@rt.com", "name": "RT", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mar-a-Lago", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mar-a-Lago"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadly_force", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Deadly force"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classified_information", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Classified information"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RT_(TV_network)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "RT (TV network)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Witch-hunt", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Witch-hunt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coming_out", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coming out"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth_Social", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Truth Social"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fox News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FBI_search_of_Mar-a-Lago", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FBI search of Mar-a-Lago"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty-fifth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ammunition", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ammunition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_warrant", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Search warrant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Document_Management", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Document Management", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Publications", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Publications", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2024.05/article/664e003420302707f6769a69.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9587575", "eventUri": "eng-9587575", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1058823529411764, "wgt": 180, "relevance": 1}

The FBI have denied the accusation, saying that \"standard protocol\" was followed.\n\nThat raid on the former president's Florida residence on 8 August 2022 ended with the FBI seizing hundreds of documents. On Tuesday, newly-unsealed court filings showed that four additional classified documents were discovered in Mr Trump's bedroom in the months following the bureau's search at Mar-a-Lago.\n\nMr Trump faces 40 felony counts for allegedly mishandling top secret documents taken to his estate after he left office. He denies all the charges against him.\n\nIn a fiery response, Mr Trump accused the Biden administration of soliciting the use of \"deadly force\" during the raid - which he called \"unconstitutional\" on Truth Social. He also sent his Maga followers a fundraising email with the subject line: \"They were authorized to shoot me!\"\n\nCiting an operating order, the newly-unsealed filing stated: \"Law enforcement officers of the Department of Justice may use deadly force when necessary.\"\n\n\"The agents planned to bring 'Standard Issue Weapon[s],' 'Ammo,' 'Handcuffs,' and 'medium and large sized bolt cutters',\" it read.\n\nMs Greene claimed that Mr Trump's post showed there was a plan to \"assassinate\" him at his Florida estate.\n\n\"The Biden DOJ and FBI were planning to assassinate [president] Trump and gave the green light,\" the Georgia representative wrote on X Tuesday evening.\n\nThe FBI promptly gave a statement that denied allegations of wrongdoing, and said that its agents had followed \"standard protocol\" during the Mar-a-Lago raid.\n\n\"The FBI followed standard protocol in this search as we do for all search warrants, which includes a standard policy statement limiting the use of deadly force,\" the statement read.\n\n\"No one ordered additional steps to be taken and there was no departure from the norm in this matter,\" it added.\n\nAccording to Justice Department policy, law enforcement officers are allowed to use force only when no other safe alternatives appear to exist.

FBI agents recovered classified material from Trump's time in the White House - which the former president is now charged with illegally retaining. One page in the document includes a \"policy statement\" on the use of deadly force, which says officers may resort to lethal force only when the subject of such force poses an \"imminent danger of death or serious physical injury\" to an officer or another person.\n\nTrump, the presumptive GOP nominee for president, and some of his allies suggested Tuesday that this was evidence that Biden's Justice Department was prepared to fatally shoot him. In fact, Trump was not at his Florida property the day of the search. FBI agents specifically sought to avoid a confrontation with Trump, choosing a day when Trump would not be at the property and giving the Secret Service a heads-up, The Washington Post previously reported.\n\nA former president falsely accusing his successor and rival of posing a threat to his life is without precedent in modern U.S. history. The comments marked a sharp escalation of Trump's baseless attacks on Biden, as the former president faces 88 criminal charges across four indictments in federal and state courts. Trump has frequently accused Biden of weaponizing the legal system against him in coordination with the Justice Department and local prosecutors. There is no evidence of such coordination.\n\nA Tuesday evening fundraising email from the Trump campaign that was signed in the candidate's name arrived with the subject line, \"They were authorized to shoot me!\" and said of the Biden administration, \"You know they're just itching to do the unthinkable ... Joe Biden was locked & loaded ready to take me out & put my family in danger.\"\n\nTrump also wrote Tuesday on his social media site, Truth Social, that \"Joe Biden's DOJ, in their Illegal and UnConstitutional Raid of Mar-a-Lago, AUTHORIZED THE FBI TO USE DEADLY (LETHAL) FORCE.\"\n\nThe FBI said in a statement Tuesday that it \"followed standard protocol in this search as we do for all search warrants, which includes a standard policy statement limiting the use of deadly force.\"\n\n\"No one ordered additional steps to be taken and there was no departure from the norm in this matter,\" the agency said.\n\nFBI agents got approval from a federal magistrate judge in Florida to search Mar-a-Lago after months of efforts to get Trump to hand over the documents at issue. Agents also arrived in deliberately casual outfits to lower their profile - khakis and polo shirts - to comb the area and left with more than 100 classified records, some of which were top secret.\n\nIn response to a question about the differences between the policy in the law enforcement document and Trump's claims, his campaign spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt accused The Washington Post of waging a \"sickening attempt to run cover for Joe Biden.\"\n\n\"The good news is, Americans don't buy the pro-Democrat, Election Interfering pro-Biden propaganda the Washington Post is constantly selling,\" she wrote in an email.\n\nThe Biden campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Some of Trump's allies echoed the former president's claims on social media.\n\nRep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.), a staunch Trump ally, went even further than Trump on social media, writing on X that \"The Biden DOJ and FBI were planning to assassinate Pres Trump and gave the green light.\"\n\nThroughout his campaign, Trump has used the charges against him to rally his political base and raise millions of dollars. He has pleaded not guilty to the charges.\n\nTrump is currently on trial in New York on allegations of falsifying business records to cover up hush money to a porn actress and awaits trial in the other three cases.\n\nTrump's Tuesday comments add to a long history of false and incendiary claims against his political opponents, which Democrats and some Republicans have denounced, and has alarmed historians who have studied political rhetoric. Some of his supporters, including Republican members of Congress, conservative media personalities and others have often repeated or amplified his claims.\n\nIt is not clear if Trump will stand trial before the election on the charges of mishandling classified documents. Prosecutors say Trump improperly kept top-secret documents from his presidency and then obstructed the government's attempts to retrieve them.", "source": {"uri": "bostonglobe.com", "dataType":

Mar-a-Lago Raid", "body": "President Joe Biden's Justice Department was prepared to use \"deadly force\" during the August 2022 FBI raid of former President Donald Trump's south Florida club and home, according to a report.\n\nNew documents obtained and shared on the social media platform X purport to show agents were not only authorized to use their firearms at the Palm Beach Mar-a-Lago club owned by Trump but had staged medical personnel to treat anyone who might have been wounded.\n\nNo shots were fired when a search warrant was executed during the unprecedented Aug. 8, 2022, raid of the home of a former president during the beginning of the federal government's classified documents investigation.\n\nBut the DOJ was apparently ready to open fire on anyone who stood in its way in what reads as though it could have been a Waco-like siege.\n\nJulie Kelly with RealClear Investigations shared unsealed documents relating to instructions agents were given before they raided Mar-a-Lago.\n\nOne such document declared, \"Law enforcement officers of the Department of Justice may use deadly force when necessary ...\"\n\nIt added that agents \"planned to bring 'Standard Issue Weapon[s],' 'Ammo,' 'Handcuffs,' and 'medium and large sized bolt cutters,' but they were instructed to wear 'unmarked polo or collared shirts' and to keep 'law enforcement equipment concealed.'\"\n\nAnother document shared by Kelly purported to show agents were told to be cautious that media cameras might be present.\n\nIt added that they should also prepare for a firefight with Trump and his Secret Service detail.\n\n\"Should [Trump] arrive at [Mar-a-Lago], [federal agents] will be prepared to engage with [Trump] and [Secret Service] Security Team.\"\n\nTwo medics were also on-scene for \"HANDLING OF INJURED\" while an area hospital was indemnified for anyone who might have been wounded.\n\nThe FBI calculated the drive time to the hospital from Trump's exclusive home and resort was 18 minutes.\n\nAdditionally, per Kelly, agents were given directives on when to use \"deadly force.\"\n\nA document obtained by Kelly read, \"Deadly force should not be used against persons whose actions are a threat solely to themselves or property unless an individual poses an imminent danger of death or serious physical injury to the officer or others in close proximity.\"\n\nTrump was not home on the day of the raid.\n\nKelly's reporting caught the attention of House Republicans but has not been independently verified by The Western Journal.\n\nThe documents obtained by Kelly were reportedly unsealed on Tuesday by Judge Aileen Cannon, who is presiding over the classified documents case against the former president.", "source": {"uri": "westernjournal.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

However in a statement the FBI insisted it followed \"standard protocol\" during the operation which \"includes a standard policy statement\" on the use of force.\n\nA court filling was unsealed on Tuesday showing briefing notes for the August 2022 Mar-a-Lago raid, which said: \"Law enforcement officers of the Department of Justice may use deadly force when necessary.\"\n\nTrump is facing 40 felony charges related to claims he deliberately held onto classified documents after leaving the White House in January 2021 and obstructed efforts to get them returned to the proper authorities. He has pleaded not guilty to all counts and denies any wrongdoing.\n\nIn his Truth Social post on Tuesday Trump said he had been \"shown Reports that Crooked Joe Biden's DOJ, in their Illegal and UnConstitutional Raid of Mar-a-Lago, AUTHORIZED THE FBI TO USE DEADLY (LETHAL) FORCE.\"\n\nHe said this means Biden is \"A SERIOUS THREAT TO DEMOCRACY\" and suggested he should be removed from office via the Constitution's 25th Amendment.\n\nHowever, in a statement provided to The Washington Post, the FBI insisted the reference to \"use of deadly force\" is standard practice in all their search operations.\n\nThey said the Mar-a-Lago raid briefing \"followed standard protocol in this search as we do for all search warrants, which includes a standard policy statement limiting the use of deadly force. No one ordered additional steps to be taken and there was no departure from the norm in this matter.\"\n\nNewsweek contacted the FBI, Washington D.C. office of Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene and Donald Trump representatives for comment on Wednesday outside of usual office hours.\n\nThe FBI's statement was supported by Frank Figliuzzi, formerly the agency's assistant director for counterintelligence, in an X post. He wrote: \"Yep, every FBI operations order contains a reminder of FBI deadly force policy. Even for a search warrant. Deadly force is always authorized if the required threat presents itself.\"\n\nA similar point was made by former U.S. attorney Joyce Vance who wrote: \"This 'controversy' about Garland 'authorizing' deadly force when the judicially authorized search warrant at Mar-a-Lago was executed is a lot of sounding off over something that's a standard practice, controlled by long-standing policy. A little dose of facts goes a long way here.\"\n\nOn May 16 Greene was involved in a bitter clash with Democrats Jasmine Crockett and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez during a House committee hearing.\n\nThe Georgia Republican claimed Crockett's \"fake eyelashes are messing up your reading\" leading the Democrat to hit back with a barely coded reference to \"somebody's bleach blonde, bad-built butch body.\"\n\nIn an interview with Newsweek Thomas Gift, who runs the Centre on U.S. Politics at University College London, said: \"By any reasonable standard, Marjorie Taylor Greene's recent behavior confirms what most Americans already know: Capitol Hill is a clown show. Making a spectacle, rather than governing, seems to be the main objective for many House members.\"", "source": {"uri": "newsweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsweek"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Trump trial in Manhattan.\n\nThe conservative Heritage Foundation says Americans of any political leaning should be \"outraged\" and \"shaken to the bone\" over the Biden administration's authorized use of deadly force when the FBI raided former President Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida.\n\nThe August 2022 raid was part of the Department of Justice (DOJ) investigation into Trump's alleged handling of classified records.\n\nSpecial Counsel Jack Smith's investigation into Trump's alleged improper retention of classified records included an \"Operations Order\" that was produced during discovery. The order revealed that the \"FBI believed its objective for the Mar-a-Lago raid was to seize \"classified information, NDI, and US Government records,\" as described in the search warrant.\n\nThe order also contained, according to a court filing, a \"Policy Statement\" regarding \"Use of Deadly Force,\" which stated, \"Law Enforcement officers of the Department of Justice may use deadly force when necessary.\"\n\nThe FBI told Fox News in a statement on Tuesday that it \"followed standard protocol\" when executing the search warrant at Mar-a-Lago, as it does with all search warrants. The standard protocol, the agency added, includes a standard policy statement limiting the use of deadly force. \"No one ordered additional steps to be taken and there was no departure from the norm in this matter,\" the FBI said.\n\nNEW REVELATIONS IN FLORIDA DOCUMENTS TRIAL PUT TRUMP ON OFFENSE AGAINST 'DERANGED' SPECIAL COUNSEL\n\nThe filing also shows the DOJ and FBI agents \"planned to bring 'Standard Issue Weapons,' 'Ammo,' 'Handcuffs,' and 'medium and large sized bolt cutters,' but they were instructed to wear 'unmarked polo or collared shirts' and to keep 'law enforcement equipment concealed.'\"\n\nOn Wednesday, a person familiar with Special Counsel Robert Hur's investigation into Biden's handling of classified documents after his departure as vice president during the Obama administration, confirmed that the standard DOJ policy statement regarding the use of deadly force was also included in the operations order for the searches at Biden's residences in Delaware.\n\nThe Heritage Foundation -- a nonprofit conservative think tank in Washington, D.C., that promotes and develops conservative public policies -- issued a statement on Wednesday about the FBI's authorization to use deadly force during the Mar-a-Lago raid.\n\n\"Americans of all political leanings should be outraged, and frankly shaken to the bone, by the latest details concerning the FBI's raid of Mar-a-Lago,\" the foundation and Heritage Action President Kevin Roberts said. \"President Biden's Attorney General gave the FBI the green light to use deadly force in storming the home of a former and potential future president without advance notice and without regard to who might have been in the residence.\n\nFLASHBACK: TRUMP SAYS MAR-A-LAGO HOME IN FLORIDA 'UNDER SIEGE' BY FBI AGENTS\n\n\"For his entire term, President Biden's weaponization of the federal government against not just his political opponent, but against parents, people of faith, and conservatives is unprecedented and a grave threat to our constitutional republic,\" the statement continued. \"Our political leaders in Washington must step up to the plate to hold this administration accountable, and as I have said before, the FBI should be started over from scratch and rebuilt from the ground up. The very fabric of our nation depends upon it.\"\n\nThe Trump campaign called out other media outlets for attempting to justify Biden's authorization of the use of force against his political opponent.\n\n\"This is a sickening attempt to run cover for Joe Biden who is the most corrupt president in history and a threat to our democracy,\" Trump Campaign National Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told Fox News Digital on Wednesday. \"The good news is, Americans don't buy the pro-Democrat, Election Interfering pro-Biden propaganda the Washington Post is constantly selling, and that is why President Trump continues to dominate Crooked Joe Biden in the polls.\"\n\nFEDERAL JUDGE POSTPONES TRUMP'S CLASSIFIED RECORDS TRIAL WITH NO NEW DATE\n\nSen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, spoke about authorization of deadly force on his podcast Wednesday, saying the FBI was anticipating potential conflicts with the Secret Service.\n\nCruz read through the unsealed document on his podcast, which painted a picture of the FBI being prepared to engage with deadly force, should agents encounter resistance.\n\n\"So, they're anticipating Secret Service may actively resist the FBI, and they're prepared to engage,\" Cruz said. \"And they're prepared to engage with an order that explicitly authorizes deadly force. Like, what in the hell?\"\n\nPam Bondi, the former Florida attorney general, appeared on Fox News on Wednesday morning, and also expressed shock and outrage over the FBI's authorization to use deadly force during the Mar-a-Lago raid.\n\nBondi said she was in a New York City courtroom with Trump all day Tuesday, and when they walked out, they received the news.\n\n\"How upsetting is that, especially to all the great men and women in the Secret Service who were in Mar-a-Lago,\" she said. \"It was a safe place. I've been part of executing multiple search warrants, and nothing about this was standard. It was a siege by land, by sea, by air, of Mar-a-Lago.\n\n\"Nothing about this was normal, yet, we've heard now that they even had medics and EMS there, in case there could have been a shootout. Can you believe that,\" Bondi added. \"No. Nothing about this was standard. What you do is you coordinate with other federal agencies before you go in there.\"\n\nTrump was charged as a result of Smith's investigation into his retention of classified materials. Trump pleaded not guilty to all 37 felony charges from Smith's probe, including willful retention of national defense information, conspiracy to obstruct justice, and false statements.\n\nTrump was also charged with an additional three counts as part of a superseding indictment out of the investigation: a count of willful retention of national defense information and two obstruction counts.\n\nThe federal judge presiding over the case, Judge Aileen Cannon of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida, postponed the trial stemming from Smith's case indefinitely. The trial was set to begin May 20.", "source": {"uri": "foxnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fox News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "greg_wehner@foxnews.com", "name": "Greg Wehner", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mar-a-Lago", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mar-a-Lago"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadly_force", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Deadly force"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_warrant", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Search warrant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mueller_special_counsel_investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mueller special counsel investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Heritage_Foundation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "The Heritage Foundation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classified_information", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Classified information"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Treaty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Smith_(lawyer)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jack Smith (lawyer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fox News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_Attorney_General", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Florida Attorney General"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pam_Bondi", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pam Bondi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_&_Friends", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fox & Friends"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal government of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_counsel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Special counsel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_K._Hur", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Robert K.

Fox News Ran Wild With It.", "body": "The cable network hasn't sunk to the lowest depths of MAGA media, but the network has still gone all-in on suggesting a standard FBI document signals an assassination plot.\n\nAfter Donald Trump accused President Joe Biden of ordering federal law enforcement to use \"deadly force\" on him during 2022's Mar-a-Lago raid, right-wing provocateurs and MAGA lawmakers have quickly seized on the opportunity to cook up a wild assassination plot.\n\nAnd though Fox News didn't sink nearly to the depths of the Trumpiest edges of the conservative media universe, the network still wondered whether a standard FBI policy document meant Biden was saying it \"would be okay to kill Donald Trump.\"\n\nTrump set MAGA world ablaze on Tuesday afternoon when he took to his failing Truth Social platform to blare in all-caps that Biden's Department of Justice had \"AUTHORIZED THE FBI TO USE DEADLY (LETHAL) FORCE. NOW WE KNOW, FOR SURE, THAT JOE BIDEN IS A SERIOUS THREAT TO DEMOCRACY.\"\n\nThe ex-president's over-the-top claim came after a judge unsealed two motions in the criminal classified documents case on Tuesday. While the filing shows prosecutors waving off the Trump legal team's claims that the case should be dismissed and even suggesting additional evidence of the former president's alleged obstruction, the documents also included a generic \"policy statement\" laying out the rules that apply to officers regarding when they can use lethal force on a subject.\n\nEven before Trump's social media post, the ex-president's most strident allies pounced on the document's inclusion in the filing as \"mind-blowing\" proof that the FBI was looking to \"exact their political revenge\" on Trump with a possible assassination attempt,\" calling the bureau \"a domestic terrorist organization.\"\n\nEventually, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) chimed in, straight up alleging that the \"Biden DOJ and FBI were planning to assassinate Pres Trump and gave the green light,\" wondering what \"are Republicans going to do about it.\" Other Republicans soon followed suit, conflating the basic FBI policies to a scheme to kill the ex-president.\n\nTrump only poured more gasoline on the fire by sending out a campaign fundraising email that claimed Biden was \"locked & loaded ready to take me out\" during the classified documents raid. Issuing a rare statement, the FBI pushed back and said it was merely following normal procedure during the search and seizure of Trump's property.\n\n\"The FBI followed standard protocol in this search as we do for all search warrants, which includes a standard policy statement limiting the use of deadly force. No one ordered additional steps to be taken and there was no departure from the norm in this matter,\" the bureau's statement said.\n\nAdditionally, when former FBI official Steve D'Antuono testified to Congress last year about the raid, he noted that there \"wasn't even a show of force\" because a day was chosen when Trump would not be at the property and the Secret Service was given a heads-up. \"We weren't bringing any like FBI vehicles, everything that was reported about helicopters and a hundred people descending on, like a Die Hard movie, was completely untrue, right,\" he said. \"That is not how we played it.\"\n\nRather than contextualize the nuances of the FBI's own policies and how the raid was actually handled, Fox News hosts and pundits instead decided to lean hard into Trump world's spin on the whole thing.\n\nAfter the network push-alerted a digital story claiming the \"Biden DOJ authorized 'deadly force' in Mar-a-Lago raid,\" Fox News chief political anchor Bret Baier discussed the story with correspondent Kevin Corke on Tuesday evening's broadcast of the \"hard news\" program Special Report.\n\nWith Corke describing the FBI's standard instructions as \"quite shocking,\" Baier suggested that the inclusion of the policy document was anything but normal.\n\n\"There may be some people, Kevin [Corke], who say that this is just a policy statement of standard operating procedures put inside this operations order for this specific raid,\" he proclaimed. \"But obviously it's not standard operating procedure when you're going into the house of the former president, who happens to be protected by the Secret Service.\"\n\nDuring a panel discussion later in the show, Fox News commentator Byron York added that it was \"worrisome\" that the bureau's agents were \"loaded for bear and prepared for the possibility of some sort of violent confrontation with the Secret Service,\" contradicting D'Antuono's congressional testimony.\n\nThe network's pro-Trump opinion stars took the ball and ran with it from there.\n\n\"Biden unleashed armed agents into Trump's house, authorizing them to use deadly force,\" primetime host Jesse Watters exclaimed. Watters also featured fellow MAGA sycophant Jeanine Pirro, who said there was \"absolutely\" no justification for the order before theorizing why the FBI agents wore unmarked polo shirts rather than tactical gear.\n\n\"My mind as a prosecutor goes to maybe they wanted the engagement of physical force. Maybe they wanted to come in without FBI, without DOJ, without all of that identifying so that they could engage in deadly physical force,\" she continued, while Watters wondered: \"Maybe they were looking for a little action.\"\n\nCalling it a \"shocking new revelation,\" Fox News star and Trump confidant Sean Hannity fumed that \"Biden's politicized Attorney General Merrick Garland\" at \"Joe Biden's weaponized DOJ\" had \"authorized, get this, the use of deadly force\" during the raid. Though he acknowledged the language in the policy statement was \"boilerplate,\" Hannity still wondered why was Garland \"prepping for a possible shootout.\"\n\nThe outrage merely ramped up on Wednesday morning, especially on MAGA-boosting host Maria Bartiromo's Fox Business Network show.\n\nThroughout her three-hour program, even as she read off the FBI's statement on the matter, Bartiromo repeatedly and dramatically suggested that the Biden administration attempted to have the presumptive GOP presidential nominee killed.\n\n\"This is so extraordinary. Over and over again, we see that the Democrats charge the Republicans with things that they are actually doing, and they have, this happens over and over again,\" she noted at one point. \"Now the FBI and the Democrats keep saying things like Trump is a threat to democracy, but Biden is authorizing deadly force against his political opponent?\"\n\nThe conspiratorial Fox host also continually asked her guests, including Sen. Mike Rounds (R-SD), whether the policy statement meant that Biden was letting the FBi know \"it would be OK to kill Donald Trump\" if he offered any resistance during the raid. (A raid that took place when the ex-president was not on the premises.)\n\nFellow Fox Business anchor Stuart Varney also covered the story multiple times on his show, noting that \"new court documents show the administration authorized the use of deadly force during the FBI's raid.\" For the most part, Varney's segments were centered around GOP lawmakers and former Trump administration officials asserting that the instructions were \"completely unnecessary\" and \"potentially endangered\" Trump.\n\nBack on the Fox News mothership, the hosts and commentators of Fox & Friends and its AM predecessor Fox & Friends First also gave ample coverage to the \"deadly force\" claims, describing the details as \"shocking\" while wondering aloud if \"this is normal.\" Fox News contributor Joe Concha, grousing about former FBI Director James Comey's warning that Trump is a threat to elected officials, called the policy statement \"third-world stuff.\"\n\nDespite the hyperbolic and overheated rhetoric coming from some of the conservative cable giant's most outspoken Trump acolytes, the network's coverage of Biden's supposed authorization to take down the ex-president almost completely stopped once its morning opinion shows ended.", "source": {"uri": "thedailybeast.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Daily Beast"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

I've done more deconfliction with Russians in a foreign op I did for the USSS than the FBI did in their search warrant at MAL,\" Bongino added.\n\n\"Only a dumbass would pitch the \"it's the standard paperwork\" line.

The new revelation is among those in a new filing by a federal judge in the case.\n\nIn the spring of 2022, the Justice Department subpoenaed Trump and directed him to return the classified documents he had taken. However, in June that year, Trump's attorneys falsely insisted to law enforcement that there were no such materials at Mar-a-Lago. When Trump subsequently refused to comply with the subpoena, the FBI executed the search warrant in August 2022 to retrieve the classified documents.\n\nIn December 2022, Trump's legal team swept his properties and found even more classified documents - this time in the former president's bedroom. U.S. District Judge Beryl Howell expressed bewilderment at this. \"Notably, no excuse is provided as to how the former president could miss the classified-marked documents found in his bedroom at Mar-a-Lago,\" she wrote.\n\nAfter the Mar-a-Lago raid, Republicans went on the offensive and tried to suggest a political motivation for the raid.\n\nTrump took to Truth Social to accuse that the Justice Department \"AUTHORIZED THE FBI TO USE DEADLY (LETHAL) FORCE\" in the execution of the court-approved search warrant at his Mar-a-Lago residence. He further claimed this to be proof that President Joe Biden is \"MENTALLY UNFIT TO HOLD OFFICE.\"\n\nTrump's allies jumped at the chance to criticize Biden. Rep. Paul Gosar (R-Arizona), for example, claimed that the incumbent Democratic president \"ordered the hit on Trump at Mar-a-Lago.\" Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Georgia) added that the Justice Department and the FBI had plans to \"assassinate\" the former president. Trump even issued an outlandish fundraising appeal that falsely claimed Biden was \"locked & loaded\" and \"ready to take me out\" during the FBI's search of his glorified country club.\n\nA Trump adviser connected to his Save America PAC acknowledged scanning the contents of the box containing the classified materials in 2021 and storing them on a personal laptop.\n\nA witness recently came forward to say the FBI did not examine a locked closet in Trump's bedroom during the raid.\n\nThe Florida judge overseeing the case recently postponed the trial indefinitely, meaning that it will not start before the election.\n\nLeave a comment Cancel reply Read more about: Donald Trump Joe Biden Trump Trials", "source": {"uri": "uinterview.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "uInterview"}, "authors": [{"uri": "baila_eve_zisman@uinterview.com", "name": "Baila Eve Zisman", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mar-a-Lago", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mar-a-Lago"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classified_information", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Classified information"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subpoena", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Subpoena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_federal_judge", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States federal judge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_warrant", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Search warrant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth_Social", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Truth Social"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_district_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States district court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wealth_of_Donald_Trump", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wealth of Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marjorie_Taylor_Greene", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marjorie Taylor Greene"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Gosar", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paul Gosar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incumbent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Incumbent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Research", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Research", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://uinterview.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Mar-a-lago-files-c.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9587575", "eventUri": "eng-9587575", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 175, "relevance": 1}

Joe Biden was locked & loaded ready to take me out & put my family in danger.\" Meanwhile, Trump wrote on Truth Social: \"Crooked Joe Biden's DOJ, in their Illegal and UnConstitutional Raid of Mar-a-Lago, AUTHORIZED THE FBI TO USE DEADLY (LETHAL) FORCE.\"\n\n\"The Biden DOJ and FBI were planning to assassinate Pres Trump and gave the green light,\" Marjorie Taylor Greene outrageously echoed on X.\n\nTrump and Greene, as the Post noted, appear to have been referring -- albeit in a completely twisted manner -- to a law enforcement document that was released in court filings on Tuesday, which detailed the FBI's plans for the court-authorized search of Mar-a-Lago, where it was believed (and proven) that the ex-president had been hoarding classified documents. (He has since been charged with willful retention of national defense information and conspiracy to obstruct justice, to which he has pleaded not guilty.) One page of the document contains a \"policy statement\" concerning the use of deadly force, and it notes that such force can only be used if an officer or another person faces \"imminent danger of death or serious physical injury.\" In other words, the document is saying the FBI could not use deadly force unless threatened with death or significant injury.\n\nIn a statement, the FBI told the Post that it \"followed standard protocol in this search, as we do for all search warrants, which includes a standard policy statement limiting the use of deadly force.... No one ordered additional steps to be taken, and there was no departure from the norm in this matter.\"\n\nBeyond the fact that the document in question does not at all back up what Trump has claimed, the ex-president has also left out some extremely key details in his ravings, like the fact that he wasn't actually at Mar-a-Lago on the day of the search. And that, as the Post previously reported, the FBI purposely chose a day when he would not be there in order to avoid a confrontation. The Secret Service, which still provides Trump with a security detail, was also given advance warning of the search.\n\nIs it at all surprising that Trump and his allies are saying something that is blatantly untrue? Of course not; it's par for the course. But this particular lie is extra disturbing because of the lengths to which the ex-president's supporters can go when they believe -- because he told them -- that he's been wronged.\n\nAsked about the document laying out the policy for deadly force and what the ex-president said in the email and online, a Trump spokeswoman accused the Post of engaging in a \"sickening attempt to run cover for Joe Biden,\" adding in her email: \"The good news is, Americans don't buy the pro-Democrat, Election Interfering pro-Biden propaganda the Washington Post is constantly selling.\"", "source": {"uri": "vanityfair.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Vanity Fair"}, "authors": [{"uri": "conde_nast@vanityfair.com", "name": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mar-a-Lago", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mar-a-Lago"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadly_force", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Deadly force"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth_Social", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Truth Social"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marjorie_Taylor_Greene", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marjorie Taylor Greene"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classified_information", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Classified information"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obstruction_of_justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Obstruction of justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquittal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Acquittal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Washington_Post", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Washington Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secret_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Secret Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_warrant", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Search warrant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propaganda", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Propaganda"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Fraud", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Fraud", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/66394200911842dc89432512/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/vf0524-2024-campaign-trump.jpg?mbid=social_retweet", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9587575", "eventUri": "eng-9587575", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 175, "relevance": 1}

Fox News Ran Wild With It.", "body": "After Donald Trump accused President Joe Biden of ordering federal law enforcement to use \"deadly force\" on him during 2022's Mar-a-Lago raid, right-wing provocateurs and MAGA lawmakers have quickly seized on the opportunity to cook up a wild assassination plot.\n\nAnd though Fox News didn't sink nearly to the depths of the Trumpiest edges of the conservative media universe, the network still wondered whether a standard FBI policy document meant Biden was saying it \"would be okay to kill Donald Trump.\"\n\nTrump set MAGA world ablaze on Tuesday afternoon when he took to his failing Truth Social platform to blare in all-caps that Biden's Department of Justice had \"AUTHORIZED THE FBI TO USE DEADLY (LETHAL) FORCE. NOW WE KNOW, FOR SURE, THAT JOE BIDEN IS A SERIOUS THREAT TO DEMOCRACY.\"\n\nThe ex-president's over-the-top claim came after a judge unsealed two motions in the criminal classified documents case on Tuesday. While the filing shows prosecutors waving off the Trump legal team's claims that the case should be dismissed and even suggesting additional evidence of the former president's alleged obstruction, the documents also included a generic \"policy statement\" laying out the rules that apply to officers regarding when they can use lethal force on a subject.\n\nGreg Gutfeld Welcomes Bill Maher to Fox News With Cringey 'I'm Sorry' Song\n\nEven before Trump's social media post, the ex-president's most strident allies pounced on the document's inclusion in the filing as \"mind-blowing\" proof that the FBI was looking to \"exact their political revenge\" on Trump with a possible assassination attempt,\" calling the bureau \"a domestic terrorist organization.\"\n\nEventually, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) chimed in, straight up alleging that the \"Biden DOJ and FBI were planning to assassinate Pres Trump and gave the green light,\" wondering what \"are Republicans going to do about it.\" Other Republicans soon followed suit, conflating the basic FBI policies to a scheme to kill the ex-president.\n\nTrump only poured more gasoline on the fire by sending out a campaign fundraising email that claimed Biden was \"locked & loaded ready to take me out\" during the classified documents raid. Issuing a rare statement, the FBI pushed back and said it was merely following normal procedure during the search and seizure of Trump's property.\n\n\"The FBI followed standard protocol in this search as we do for all search warrants, which includes a standard policy statement limiting the use of deadly force. No one ordered additional steps to be taken and there was no departure from the norm in this matter,\" the bureau's statement said.\n\nAdditionally, when former FBI official Steve D'Antuono testified to Congress last year about the raid, he noted that there \"wasn't even a show of force\" because a day was chosen when Trump would not be at the property and the Secret Service was given a heads-up. \"We weren't bringing any like FBI vehicles, everything that was reported about helicopters and a hundred people descending on, like a Die Hard movie, was completely untrue, right,\" he said. \"That is not how we played it.\"\n\nRather than contextualize the nuances of the FBI's own policies and how the raid was actually handled, Fox News hosts and pundits instead decided to lean hard into Trump world's spin on the whole thing.\n\nAfter the network push-alerted a digital story claiming the \"Biden DOJ authorized 'deadly force' in Mar-a-Lago raid,\" Fox News chief political anchor Bret Baier discussed the story with correspondent Kevin Corke on Tuesday evening's broadcast of the \"hard news\" program Special Report.\n\nWith Corke describing the FBI's standard instructions as \"quite shocking,\" Baier suggested that the inclusion of the policy document was anything but normal.\n\nDesperate Fox News Proposes VP Debate That Trump Camp Quickly Accepts\n\n\"There may be some people, Kevin [Corke], who say that this is just a policy statement of standard operating procedures put inside this operations order for this specific raid,\" he proclaimed. \"But obviously it's not standard operating procedure when you're going into the house of the former president, who happens to be protected by the Secret Service.\"\n\nDuring a panel discussion later in the show, Fox News commentator Byron York added that it was \"worrisome\" that the bureau's agents were \"loaded for bear and prepared for the possibility of some sort of violent confrontation with the Secret Service,\" contradicting D'Antuono's congressional testimony.\n\nThe network's pro-Trump opinion stars took the ball and ran with it from there.\n\n\"Biden unleashed armed agents into Trump's house, authorizing them to use deadly force,\" primetime host Jesse Watters exclaimed. Watters also featured fellow MAGA sycophant Jeanine Pirro, who said there was \"absolutely\" no justification for the order before theorizing why the FBI agents wore unmarked polo shirts rather than tactical gear.\n\n\"My mind as a prosecutor goes to maybe they wanted the engagement of physical force. Maybe they wanted to come in without FBI, without DOJ, without all of that identifying so that they could engage in deadly physical force,\" she continued, while Watters wondered: \"Maybe they were looking for a little action.\"\n\nCalling it a \"shocking new revelation,\" Fox News star and Trump confidant Sean Hannity fumed that \"Biden's politicized Attorney General Merrick Garland\" at \"Joe Biden's weaponized DOJ\" had \"authorized, get this, the use of deadly force\" during the raid. Though he acknowledged the language in the policy statement was \"boilerplate,\" Hannity still wondered why was Garland \"prepping for a possible shootout.\"\n\nThe outrage merely ramped up on Wednesday morning, especially on MAGA-boosting host Maria Bartiromo's Fox Business Network show.\n\nThroughout her three-hour program, even as she read off the FBI's statement on the matter, Bartiromo repeatedly and dramatically suggested that the Biden administration attempted to have the presumptive GOP presidential nominee killed.\n\n\"This is so extraordinary. Over and over again, we see that the Democrats charge the Republicans with things that they are actually doing, and they have, this happens over and over again,\" she noted at one point. \"Now the FBI and the Democrats keep saying things like Trump is a threat to democracy, but Biden is authorizing deadly force against his political opponent?\"\n\nThe conspiratorial Fox host also continually asked her guests, including Sen. Mike Rounds (R-SD), whether the policy statement meant that Biden was letting the FBi know \"it would be OK to kill Donald Trump\" if he offered any resistance during the raid. (A raid that took place when the ex-president was not on the premises.)\n\nFellow Fox Business anchor Stuart Varney also covered the story multiple times on his show, noting that \"new court documents show the administration authorized the use of deadly force during the FBI's raid.\" For the most part, Varney's segments were centered around GOP lawmakers and former Trump administration officials asserting that the instructions were \"completely unnecessary\" and \"potentially endangered\" Trump.\n\nBack on the Fox News mothership, the hosts and commentators of Fox & Friends and its AM predecessor Fox & Friends First also gave ample coverage to the \"deadly force\" claims, describing the details as \"shocking\" while wondering aloud if \"this is normal.\" Fox News contributor Joe Concha, grousing about former FBI Director James Comey's warning that Trump is a threat to elected officials, called the policy statement \"third-world stuff.\"\n\nDespite the hyperbolic and overheated rhetoric coming from some of the conservative cable giant's most outspoken Trump acolytes, the network's coverage of Biden's supposed authorization to take down the ex-president almost completely stopped once its morning opinion shows ended.\n\nGet the Daily Beast's biggest scoops and scandals delivered right to your inbox.

Trump was not there at the time. Close to two years after the raid, and less than six month away from the 2024 presidential election, we know now that the FBI was authorized to use \"deadly force.\"\n\nCoverage from The New York Post cites court documents unsealed on Tuesday in a motion to dismiss and suppress from Trump's attorneys in the case of United States v. Trump. As the report mentioned:\n\nThe Department of Justice authorized \"the use of deadly force\" when FBI agents swarmed former President Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago residence in August 2022 looking for classified documents, according to court filings Tuesday.\n\n...\n\nThe authorities also were told to conceal their \"law enforcement equipment\" and come armed with \"ammo,\" \"handcuffs\" and \"medium and large sized bolt cutters,\" notes the filing by lawyers for the former president.\n\nAccording to the lawyers, Todd Blanche and Christopher Kise, the nearly 10-hour \"unconstitutional\" search swept through the Palm Beach estate's gym and kitchen, as well as the bedroom suite of former first lady Melania Trump and the bedroom of the couple's teenage son Barron Trump.\n\n...\n\nDeputy Assistant Attorney General George Toscas, in a phone call in the days leading up to the raid, allegedly said he \"frankly [didn't] give a damn about the optics\" of the recovery operation.\n\nAttorney General Merrick Garland has said he \"personally approved the decision to seek a search warrant.\"\n\nEvidence in the court filing reveals an earlier back-and-forth between Trump's lawyer and a prosecutor working for special counsel Jack Smith over retrieving the documents.\n\nSuch revelations from the court documents have sparked considerable chatter over social media, with \"Mar-a-Lago\" and \"Use of Deadly Force\" trending over X.\n\nRealClearInvestigation's Julie Kelly also posted the documents from her X account in a thread from earlier on Tuesday. As part of her candid reaction, she referred to such a move as \"Gestapo.\"\n\nIn response, Trump fired off a Truth Social post referring to President Joe Biden as \"A SERIOUS THREAT TO DEMOCRACY.\" He also referred to Biden as \"MENTALLY FIT UNFIT TO HOLD OFFICE\" and even referenced using the 25th Amendment.\n\nThe Trump campaign sent out an ICYMI email alert about the post as well as a fundraising pitch to \"STOP THE WITCH HUNT.\"\n\nWhen it comes to Special Counsel Jack Smith's case against Trump for the former president's alleged mishandling of classified documents, earlier this month Judge Aileen Cannon had indefinitely postponed the trial, as Spencer covered at the time.\n\nThe court determined \"that finalization of a trial date at this juncture -- before resolution of the myriad and interconnected pre-trial and CIPA issues remaining and forthcoming -- would be imprudent and inconsistent with the Court's duty to fully and fairly consider the various pending pre-trial motions before the Court, critical [Classified Information Procedures Act (CIPA)] issues, and additional pretrial and trial preparations necessary to present this case to a jury.\"\n\nThe trial date, which Cannon vacated, had been set for May 20, 2024, and so would have just started. Meanwhile, the hush money case against Trump brought by Manhattan DA Alvin Bragg is currently going on.\n\nAt the time of the Mar-a-Lago raid, Matt predicted that this sealed the fate with the 2024 Republican nomination, declaring how the primaries were \"over.\" Trump has since become the presumptive Republican nominee, despite facing a crowded Republican primary. We'll see if this news about \"deadly force\" helps the narrative about President Joe Biden and his administration weaponizing and politicizing the Department of Justice against his political opponents, and thus help Trump for the November election.", "source": {"uri": "townhall.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Townhall"}, "authors": [{"uri": "rebecca_downs@townhall.com", "name":

The document is just one of many court filings recently ordered unsealed by Judge Aileen Cannon, who is presiding over the matter in southern Florida.\n\nIn an August 3, 2022 operations order for \"Plasmic Echo,\" the FBI's code name for the government's investigation into Trump's alleged mishandling of national defense material, FBI officials furnished instructions on to proceed with the unprecedented raid. \"FBI [Washington Field Office] and FBI [Miami] agents and [Evidence Response Team] will effect a search of designated locations within Mar-a-Lago (MAL) to locate and seize classified information, NDI, and US Government records as described in captioned search warrant,\" the document read.\n\nThe raid involved 25 Miami FBI agents, four Washington FBI agents, one unidentified individual from FBI Headquarters, one DOJ attorney, and the assistant U.S. Attorney from the Southern District of Florida.\n\nBut according to the operations order, law enforcement was not preparing a routine search for presidential papers. One section of the plan described how agents should handle the potential for use of deadly force:\n\nThe FBI also considered various scenarios should the former president unexpectedly arrive at his residence during the raid. Agents were also prepared to go door-to-door to terrorize Mar-a-Lago guests if staff refused to turn over room keys:\n\nIn addition to lock-picking equipment, FBI agents were armed with \"Standard Issue Weapon, Ammo, [and] Handcuffs\" as well as \"medium and large sized bolt cutters.\"\n\nPerhaps most shockingly, the FBI team included a medic to tend to anyone \"injured\" during the raid. The operations order identified a nearby trauma center with directions how to get there:\n\nAdditional exhibits in the unsealed motion today also indicate agents ransacked the bedrooms of Melania and Barron Trump.\n\nThe head of the Washington FBI Field Office at the time was Steven D'Antuono. In addition to spearheading the criminal investigation into the events of January 6, which included his inability to identify and charge the so-called pipe bomber, D'Antuono led the Detroit FBI Field office in 2020 when the FBI manufactured an entrapment scheme to make it appear that Trump supporters plotted to kidnap and kill Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer in 2020. D'Antuono retired in November 2022.\n\nAttorney General Merrick Garland approved the FBI raid of Mar-a-Lago.\n\n- - -", "source": {"uri": "theminnesotasun.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Minnesota Sun"}, "authors": [{"uri": "julie_kelly@theminnesotasun.com", "name": "Julie Kelly", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mar-a-Lago", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mar-a-Lago"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadly_force", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Deadly force"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aileen_Cannon", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aileen Cannon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_name", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Code name"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Florida", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "South Florida"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assistant_United_States_Attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assistant United States Attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_District_Court_for_the_Southern_District_of_Florida", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._Edgar_Hoover_Building", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "J.

The Department of Justice, he said, was ready to kill him.\n\nThe wild distortion came against the backdrop of Trump's hush-money trial in New York and amid fears of rising political violence around the coming presidential election, predominantly from the far right. The comments cement an inverted picture Trump and his allies have painted, in which a patriotic Trump is pitted against anti-democratic deep-state foes.\n\nRelated: Donald Trump removes video on Truth Social with 'unified reich' reference\n\nThe outlandish claims could ratchet up anger among his supporters and stoke conspiracy theories. \"You know they're just itching to do the unthinkable,\" read the Trump campaign fundraising email, signed with the former president's name. \"Joe Biden was locked & loaded ready to take me out & put my family in danger.\"\n\nOn his social media website, Truth Social, Trump echoed the claim. \"Crooked Joe Biden's DoJ, in their Illegal and UnConstitutional Raid of Mar-a-Lago, AUTHORIZED THE FBI TO USE DEADLY (LETHAL) FORCE,\" he alleged.\n\nTrump was apparently referencing the order for a search warrant executed in August 2022, when plainclothes agents of the FBI raided Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate in search of classified documents Trump had allegedly refused to turn over to the government.\n\nA May court filing by Trump's legal team, under a section titled \"The Illegal Raid\", quotes from a line in the search warrant.\n\n\"The Order contained a 'Policy Statement' regarding 'Use Of Deadly Force,' which stated, for example, 'Law enforcement officers of the Department of Justice may use deadly force when necessary,'\" attorneys representing Trump wrote.\n\nThe language cited in the filing was apparently taken from DoJ policy outlining the use of force in executing search warrants. The unabridged text of the policy reads: \"Law enforcement officers and correctional officers of the Department of Justice may use deadly force only when necessary, that is, when the officer has a reasonable belief that the subject of such force poses an imminent danger of death or serious physical injury to the officer or to another person.\"\n\nThe agency executed the warrant to search Trump's Florida home while Trump was in New York and reportedly communicated with the Secret Service agents present to ensure a smooth operation.\n\nIn a statement, the FBI described the language as \"a standard policy statement limiting the use of deadly force. No one ordered additional steps to be taken and there was no departure from the norm in this matter.\"\n\nThe Washington Post has previously reported that FBI agents picked a day for the raid when Trump would not be at Mar-a-Lago and told the Secret Service ahead of time.\n\nBut Trump's statements about the filing have unleashed a frenzy. Christina Bobb, an attorney for the former president who signed documents before the search claiming Trump had complied with the subpoena for documents, reacted with similar hyperbole.\n\n\"WTF?!! They were prepared to kill me?! A few dozen FBI agents v. me and they were ready to kill me?!!! What in the world happened to the United States of America?!\" wrote Bobb, on X.\n\n\"These people are sick,\" wrote Paul Gosar, an Arizona congressman and staunch Trump ally, also on X. \"Biden ordered the hit on Trump at Mar-A-Lago,\" he added in a subsequent post.\n\nThe rhetorical redirection - from the content of Trump's legal battles, which range from alleged financial improprieties to the mishandling of classified documents to his brazen attempt to overturn the 2020 election - form part of a strategy Trump and his allies are embracing before the 2024 presidential election.\n\nThe public relations strategy turns Trump's anti-democratic tendencies back at his critics - \"enemies\", in the former president's parlance - as allegations. In communications shared widely with his followers, it is the Department of Justice, the media, the Democrats and Rinos - Republican in name only - who dare to criticize him who threaten democracy.\n\nTrump, who has warned of \"death and destruction\" if charged with crimes and who defended supporters calling for the assassination of former vice-president Mike Pence for refusing to join the plot to overturn the election, urges his supporters to see him as the victim.\n\n\"NOW WE KNOW, FOR SURE,\" Trump added in his post accusing the D0J of preparing to use lethal force, \"THAT JOE BIDEN IS A SERIOUS THREAT TO DEMOCRACY.\"", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadly_force",

Critics, including law enforcement experts, are blasting Trump and his MAGA associates for the \"dangerous\" lie.\n\nOn Tuesday a U.S. District Judge unsealed court documents in Special Counsel Jack Smith's Espionage Act case against Trump where he faces 40 felony counts, most over his alleged unlawful removal, retention, and refusal to return classified documents including some of the nation's top nuclear secrets.\n\nOne of those filings, as The Washington Post reported, was a law enforcement documents that included a standard statement reminding FBI agents on the Bureau's policy on the use of deadly force, \"which says officers may resort to lethal force only when the subject of such force poses an 'imminent danger of death or serious physical injury' to an officer or another person.\"\n\nBut on Tuesday, Trump explosively posted on Truth Social, \"WOW! I just came out of the Biden Witch Hunt Trial in Manhattan, the 'Icebox,' and was shown Reports that Crooked Joe Biden's DOJ, in their Illegal and UnConstitutional Raid of Mar-a-Lago, AUTHORIZED THE FBI TO USE DEADLY (LETHAL) FORCE.

Joe Biden was locked & loaded ready to take me out & put my family in danger.\"\n\nAttorney and former FBI Special Agent Asha Rangappa observed, \"Including the deadly force policy [in] an ops plan is SOP [standard operating procedure]. But just so I make sure I'm following the plot, according to Trump's position in court, what he is accusing Biden of would be perfectly legal and within the scope of his 'official' powers, right?\"\n\nTrump repeatedly has insisted presidents must have complete and total \"absolute immunity.\" His attorneys have argued in federal court and before the U.S. Supreme Court a president could order Seal Team Six to assassinate his political rival and it would be lawful, as was noted here:\n\nU.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) was among the top allies who falsely characterized the court filing.\n\n\"The Biden DOJ and FBI were planning to assassinate Pres Trump and gave the green light,\" she posted to her official federal government account on X. \"Does everyone get it yet???!!!! What are Republicans going to do about it?\"\n\nShe also wrote: \"This is grounds for impeachment of Wray and Garland. Trump and team was cooperating the entire time with the FBI,\" Greene claimed, both of which are false.\n\nREAD MORE: 'Incomprehensible': More Classified Docs Were Found at Mar-a-Lago, Unsealed Court Filing Reveals\n\n\"Was deadly force authorized against Biden for his docs?

Speaker Mike Johnson fully funded the DOJ and FBI plus new building and tied our hands behind our backs to hold them accountable. We have the power of the purse and Johnson has handed the purse to Chuck Schumer. All of this is unforgivable.\"\n\nFox News Business host Maria Bartiromo also promoted the false claims Wednesday morning:\n\nNBC News' Ryan Reilly mockingly explained the situation: \"GOP members of Congress think the feds wanted to assassinate Trump and so they did a raid on his place in Florida when they knew him to be in New Jersey because Mar-A-Lago was closed for the season.\"\n\nMeanwhile, critics are sounding the alarm on Trump's and the GOP's lies.\n\n\"This is wildly irresponsible, even for professional troll like Marjorie Taylor Greene,\" wrote conservative columnist Jonah Goldberg. \"FBI knew Trump wasn't there. It was all coordinated with Secret Service in advance. This is deeply dangerous bullshit.\"\n\n\"Trump wasn't there,\" said talk radio host Joe Walsh, a former GOP U.S. Congressman, responding to U.S. Rep. Greene's remarks. \"Everything was coordinated with Secret Service & local law enforcement. Even for you, this is a deeply irresponsible and dangerous thing to say.\"\n\nDavid Axelrod, the former top Obama strategist and White House advisor, remarked, \"This is patently nuts...and

But it's just Trump trying to raise money", "body": "(CNN) -- Followers of former President Donald Trump were meant to be startled when they were sent an email Tuesday, addressed from \"President Trump,\" with this arresting subject line:\n\n\"I nearly escaped death. Biden's DOJ was locked and loaded for deadly force at Mar-a-Lago ...\"\n\nLiteral readers of Trump's message might wonder: Is this a cry for help from physical harm?\n\nBut everyone should know it is just Trump asking, again, for money.\n\nWriting fundraising emails for politicians these days frequently seems like an exercise in clickbait, but alleging a life in danger is something new. It also feels like a twist on the outrageous \"absolute immunity\" argument Trump's lawyer made before the US Supreme Court last month that presidents should, at least in theory, be able to call out a hit on a political rival and not face prosecution.\n\nThe actual facts of the \"authorized to shoot me\" allegation, as reported by CNN, are these:\n\nA recently unsealed document outlining the FBI's procedure for searching Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort in 2022 for classified documents included standard language about the \"use of force\" in searches.\n\nFrom CNN's report by Tierney Sneed, Katelyn Polantz, Holmes Lybrand and Hannah Rabinowitz:\n\nThe document, called a law enforcement operations order, explains what agents were permitted to bring with them when they searched Trump's estate and how they were allowed to operate as part of the search. It also includes boilerplate language from the Justice Department manual about use of force, including the limited circumstances in which agents are authorized to use deadly force.\n\nThe FBI coordinated the search with the Secret Service and took pains to be as low profile as possible, according to testimony on Capitol Hill last year by Stephen D'Antuono, former FBI assistant director in charge of the Washington field office.\n\n\"We made sure we interacted with the Secret Service to make sure we could get into Mar-a-Lago with no issues,\" D'Antuono said. \"We're not banging down any doors. We weren't bringing any like FBI vehicles, everything that was reported about helicopters and a hundred people descending on, like a Die Hard movie, was completely untrue, right.\"\n\nTrump was not at Mar-a-Lago when the search occurred, and he actually announced the search was occurring with a post to social media. Read CNN's original report on the search of Mar-a-Lago in August 2022.\n\nThose details don't fit into the subject line of an email, and they certainly don't fit Trump's narrative that he is being persecuted.\n\nThe more important headline from the unsealed documents, according to CNN's report from Tuesday, was that a federal judge in Washington, DC, found \"strong evidence\" of crimes before Trump was charged with mishandling classified data. The judge, Beryl Howell, cited the discovery of additional documents with classified markings found in Trump's Mar-a-Lago bedroom months after the FBI search.\n\nTrump is a master sensationalist, so place the email subject line where he says he's in physical harm within his oeuvre of over-the-top and untrue allegations.\n\nThe email address where I get fundraising pitches from politicians received seven such messages from Trump on Tuesday.\n\nOn any given day, there will likely be at least one that is misleading. Like this one from Tuesday:\n\n\"YOU, have you seen my mugshot? I put it on a mug for you.\" (In related news, Trump's former attorney Rudy Giuliani is now selling his own brand of coffee.)\n\nThere are sweepstakes to win trips to Las Vegas and London. (You can enter to win with a $20.24 contribution).\n\nTrump's allegations about the FBI document were not just contained in the fundraising email.\n\nIn a post to social media, he weaved the \"deadly force\" allegation in with other, ongoing complaints: The temperature in his Manhattan criminal trial courtroom was too cold. Trump thinks President Joe Biden is unfit for office, and he thinks Biden's Cabinet should remove him from the presidency.\n\nThe social media post looked like this:\n\n\"WOW! I just came out of the Biden Witch Hunt Trial in Manhattan, the 'Icebox,' and was shown Reports that Crooked Joe Biden's DOJ, in their Illegal and UnConstitutional Raid of Mar-a-Lago, AUTHORIZED THE FBI TO USE DEADLY (LETHAL) FORCE. NOW WE KNOW, FOR SURE, THAT JOE BIDEN IS A SERIOUS THREAT TO DEMOCRACY. HE IS MENTALLY UNFIT TO HOLD OFFICE -- 25TH AMENDMENT!\"\n\nThe truth is that voters will get to weigh in on Biden's fitness for office. The New York criminal trial judge, Juan Merchan, explained to Trump at trial that raising the thermostat would turn the ice box into an oven. And there's absolutely no indication whatsoever that anyone in Biden's Cabinet is now considering or ever has considered invoking the 25th Amendment to remove him from office.\n\nOn that last point, the same cannot be said for Trump - some of whose Cabinet members did discuss but did not act on using the 25th Amendment after the riot at the Capitol in 2021.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

The Department of Justice, he said, was ready to kill him.\n\nThe wild distortion comes against the background of Trump's hush-money trial in New York and amid fears of rising political violence around the coming presidential election, usually from the far right. The comments cement an inverted picture Trump and his allies have painted, in which a patriotic Trump is pitted against anti-democratic deep-state foes.\n\nThe outlandish claims were characteristically blunt and could ratchet up anger among his supporters and stoke conspiracy theories. \"You know they're just itching to do the unthinkable,\" read the Trump campaign fundraising email, signed with the former president's name. \"Joe Biden was locked & loaded ready to take me out & put my family in danger.\"\n\nOn his social media website, Truth Social, Trump echoed the claim. \"Crooked Joe Biden's DOJ, in their Illegal and UnConstitutional Raid of Mar-a-Lago, AUTHORIZED THE FBI TO USE DEADLY (LETHAL) FORCE,\" he alleged.\n\nTrump was apparently referencing the order for a search warrant executed in August 2022, when plainclothes agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation raided Trump's Mar-a-Lago compound in search of classified documents Trump had allegedly refused to turn over to the government.\n\nA May court filing by Trump's legal team, under a section titled \"The Illegal Raid\", quotes from a line in the search warrant.\n\n\"The Order contained a 'Policy Statement' regarding 'Use Of Deadly Force,' which stated, for example, 'Law enforcement officers of the Department of Justice may use deadly force when necessary,'\" wrote attorneys representing Trump.\n\nThe language cited in the filing was apparently pulled from DoJ policy outlining the use of force in executing search warrants. The unabridged text of the policy reads: \"Law enforcement officers and correctional officers of the Department of Justice may use deadly force only when necessary, that is, when the officer has a reasonable belief that the subject of such force poses an imminent danger of death or serious physical injury to the officer or to another person.\"\n\nThe agency executed the warrant to search the former president's Florida home while Trump was in New York and reportedly communicated with the Secret Service agents present to ensure a smooth operation.\n\nIn a statement, the FBI described the language as \"a standard policy statement limiting the use of deadly force. No one ordered additional steps to be taken and there was no departure from the norm in this matter.\"\n\nThe Washington Post has previously reported that FBI agents picked a day for the raid when Trump would not be at Mar-a-Lago and told the Secret Service ahead of time.\n\nBut Trump's statements about the filing have unleashed a frenzy. Christina Bobb, an attorney for the former president who signed documents before the search claiming Trump had complied with the subpoena for documents, reacted with similar hyperbole.\n\n\"WTF?!! They were prepared to kill me?! A few dozen FBI agents v. me and they were ready to kill me?!!! What in the world happened to the United States of America?!\" wrote Bobb, on X.\n\n\"These people are sick,\" wrote Paul Gosar, an Arizona representative and staunch Trump ally, also on X. \"Biden ordered the hit on Trump at Mar-A-Lago,\" he added in a subsequent post.\n\nThe rhetorical redirection - from the content of Trump's legal battles, which range from alleged financial improprieties to the mishandling of classified documents to his brazen attempt to overturn the 2020 election - form part of a strategy Trump and his allies are embracing before the 2024 presidential election.\n\nThe public relations strategy turns Trump's anti-democratic tendencies back at his critics - \"enemies\", in the former president's parlance - as allegations. In communications shared widely with his followers, it is the Department of Justice, the media, the Democrats and Rinos - Republican in name only - who dare to criticize him who threaten democracy.\n\nTrump, who has warned of \"death and destruction\" if charged with crimes and who defended supporters calling for the assassination of former vice-president Mike Pence for refusing to join the plot to overturn the election, urges his supporters to see him as the victim.\n\n\"NOW WE KNOW, FOR SURE,\" Trump added in his post accusing the D0J of preparing to use lethal force, \"THAT JOE BIDEN IS A SERIOUS THREAT TO DEMOCRACY.\"", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [{"uri": "alice_herman@theguardian.com", "name": "Alice

But that's false.\n\nDuring a May 1 Facebook livestream of \"The Benny Show\" podcast, host Benny Johnson claimed: \"Those classified documents, those stolen documents, the nuclear codes'\" he said, gesturing with air quotes, \"they were all placed there by the government.\" He added: \"The government had possession of them, and they shipped them to Trump. ... They are planting the evidence.\"\n\nThe livestream's caption claimed Biden was responsible: \"Bombshell: Biden had pallets of classified docs sent to Mar-a-Lago before FBI raid!. Trump was setup.\"\n\nThe Facebook video was flagged as part of Meta's efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Meta, which owns Facebook, Threads, and Instagram.)\n\nPolitiFact messaged Johnson by email and through an online contact form for \"The Benny Show,\" but received no response.\n\nSimilar claims to Johnson's have surfaced on TikTok. One post claimed Special Counsel Jack Smith, who is prosecuting Trump in Florida for allegedly retaining classified documents, \"redacted this information knowing it shows that Biden could have sent the documents to Trump instead of Trump taking the documents.\"\n\nThis claim is not new: Trump said in a 2022 Fox News interview that he wasn't responsible for the classified documents found at his Florida home because the General Services Administration shipped them there, giving the impression that the agency knew its contents and was culpable. (The General Services Administration is a federal agency, composed of civil servants, that handles presidential transition logistics.)\n\nBut this claim has been debunked by news outlets after a review of emails, between Trump's transition team and the civil servants, which Bloomberg News obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request.\n\nPolitiFact also read the emails related to the documents' packing and transportation. The emails show the agency did not pack the boxes, but rather handled shipping costs from a warehouse just outside of Washington, D.C., to Palm Beach, Florida.\n\nIt is unclear from the emails whether the items shipped contained classified documents. However, in the emails, the General Services Administration's officials told Trump transition officials that if they had items that were \"considered property of the Federal Government then it should go to NARA or GSA.\" (NARA stands for National Archives and Records Administration.)\n\nIn a statement, the General Services Administration told PolitiFact: \"Consistent with the typical division of responsibilities between GSA and outgoing Presidents, members of the outgoing presidential transition team and their volunteers were responsible for packing items from the outgoing transition space into boxes. ... GSA did not examine the contents of the boxes and, accordingly, had no knowledge of the contents prior to shipping.\"\n\nAside from logistics concerning shipment, the emails also show the General Services Administration officials discussing with Trump's team the limitations on the use of public funds. In one exchange, officials declined to pay for the shipment of a large portrait of Trump because that was considered \"personal property.\"\n\nThe Presidential Transition Act, which governs the presidential transfer of power, allows the General Services Administration to serve the outgoing team for seven months, which ended July 21, 2021, for Trump.\n\nThe emails show that the Trump transition team signed a memorandum of understanding with the General Services Administration on Jan. 11, 2021, and the team was allocated about $2 million to pay for the logistics and other services needed for \"concluding the affairs of their terms of office.\"\n\nThe General Services Administration is \"at the heart of presidential transition,\" said Martha Joynt Kumar, emeritus professor of political science at Towson University and director of the White House Transition Project, a nonpartisan, nonprofit group of presidency scholars.\n\n\"GSA would be involved in getting the office space, making sure that the nominated candidates ... have their space and that the spaces are secure. They provide supplies and technology,\" she said. But when it comes to presidential records, that role belongs to the National Archives, she added.\n\nThe FBI searched Mar-a-Lago, Trump's Palm Beach, Florida, estate, Aug. 8, 2022, after the National Archives and Records Administration's repeated attempts to retrieve classified documents from Trump proved futile.\n\nIn June 2023, a grand jury indicted Trump for alleged mishandling of classified documents. It is unclear when the case will go to trial, and it's possible it won't be before Election Day, Nov. 5.\n\nJohnson claimed, \"Bombshell: Biden had pallets of classified docs sent to Mar-a-Lago before FBI raid! Trump was setup.\"\n\nEmail records do not show that Biden was involved in shipping boxes of documents to Mar-a-Lago.\n\nWe rate the claim that Biden set up Trump with classified documents sent to his

Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) wrote on X.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY.) condemned Trump for making the claim, calling it \"the stuff that leads to political violence.\"\n\n\"What Donald Trump is doing [is] using conspiracy theories to spin the hard right into a frenzy, and it's despicable for members of Congress to spread Donald Trump's lies. This is how people get killed, how the seeds of political violence are sowed, and how people lose faith in democracy,\" he said.\n\nThe policy statement on force was raised by Trump as he seeks to strike his Mar-a-Lago case by claiming that Biden coordinated with the Justice Department to bring the charges to hinder his electoral prospects.\n\nThere is no evidence of any improper coordination with prosecutors and the bulk of documents unsealed in the Wednesday filings indicate an earlier judge weighing the case deemed Trump to be legally culpable for concealing classified records.\n\nNew details unearthed in the filings indicate Trump even had classified documents in his bedroom after the initial search of his home and that he directed boxes to be returned by his two codefendants without their being spotted on camera.\n\nTrump's complaints about the case come as his own attorneys have argued in his other federal case that a president ordering the assassination of a rival would be covered by presidential immunity, barring prosecutions from bringing charges on the matter once a president leaves office.\n\nTrump's legal team made the argument as he's tried to toss charges related to his efforts to remain in power after losing the election, most recently asking the Supreme Court to block the case.", "source": {"uri": "thehill.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The

Majorie Taylor Greene (R) and calls for accountability.\n\n\"Does everyone get it yet???!!!!\"\n\nAt the time former President Donald Trump's indefinitely delayed trial was meant to have been underway, new filings were unsealed that included details about the \"Operations Order\" the FBI was working with when they raided Mar-a-Lago in August 2022. That it contained the Department of Justice's policy on \"Use Of Deadly Force\" had the congresswoman concluding the current administration had green lit a plan \"to assassinate Pres Trump.\"\n\nTuesday on X, Greene had made the assertion while captioning a Truth Social post from the president that read, \"WOW! I just came out of the Biden Witch Hunt Trial in Manhattan, the 'Icebox,' and was shown Reports that Crooked Joe Biden's DOJ, in their illegal and UnConstitutional Raid of Mar-a-Lago, AUTHORIZED THE FBI TO USE DEADLY (LETHAL) FORCE. NOW WE KNOW, FOR SURE, THAT JOE BIDEN IS A SERIOUS THREAT TO DEMOCRACY. HE IS MENTALLY UNFIT TO HOLD OFFICE -- 25TH AMENDMENT!\"\n\nShe remarked, \"I made sure that he knew. The Biden DOJ and FBI were planning to assassinate Pres Trump and gave the green light. Does everyone get it yet???!!!! What are Republicans going to do about it? I tried to oust our Speaker who funded Biden's DOJ AND FBI, but Democrats stopped it.\"\n\nEarlier in the afternoon, the Georgia lawmaker had reacted to a post from commentator Julie Kelly who had begun working her way through the unsealed filings. In addition to indicating that \"Armed FBI agents were preparing to confront Trump and even engage Secret Service if necessary,\" she had zeroed in on one section that read, \"The Order contained a 'Policy Statement' regarding 'Use of Deadly Force,' which stated, for example, 'Law enforcement officers of the Department of Justice may use deadly force when necessary...'\"\n\nGreene reacted with slams to President Joe Biden, FBI Director Christopher Wray, Attorney General Merrick Garland and even House Speaker Mike Johnson (R) as she wrote, \"This is grounds for impeachment of Wray and Garland. Trump and team were cooperating the entire time with the FBI. Was deadly force authorized against Biden for his docs?\"\n\n\"Were they going to shoot [U.S. Secret Service] then Pres. Trump, Melania, and Barron too???\" she posited before turning on the speaker days after her motion to vacate him failed to be brought to a vote, \"Speaker Mike Johnson fully funded the DOJ and FBI plus new building and tied our hands behind our backs to hold them accountable. We have the power of the purse and Johnson has handed the purse to Chuck Schumer. All of this is unforgivable.\"\n\nIn addition to receiving a Community Notes message that contended, \"This is false. Neither the DOJ nor the FBI were planning to assassinate Mr. Trump,\" directing users to the DOJ Policy on Use Of Force and stating, \"That language in question is standard procedure,\" others reminded that Trump had not been at the Palm Beach, Florida resort the day that it had been raided.\n\nWe have no tolerance for comments containing violence, racism, profanity, vulgarity, doxing, or discourteous behavior.

Contingencies also suggested that agents on the scene \"will be prepared to engage with\" both the former president and his Secret Service detail if he had returned to Mar-a-Lago while they were still on the property.\n\nThe FBI responded to reports concerning the newly unsealed documents, saying that the agents who were part of the raid at the former president's home were acting under SOPs.\n\n\"The FBI followed standard protocol in this search as we do for all search warrants, which includes a standard policy statement limiting the use of deadly force. No one ordered additional steps to be taken and there was no departure from the norm in this matter.\"\n\nBut according to Bongino, the fact that the raid took place on the home of a former president made it anything but standard -- and potentially pitted two federal agencies with equal and competing authorities against each other: the FBI/DOJ who were charged with executing the search warrant and the Secret Service, charged with protecting the former president.\n\n\"This is absolutely a big deal. Don't buy the bulls**t otherwise,\" Bongino posted via X. \"It was not a standard op. The MAL raid was an unprecedented action with significant potential for confusion and blue on blue issues and conflict. It also involved competing equities between federal agencies (FBI & USSS) with equal statutory claims to interrupt the other's activities. Anyone telling you otherwise is either dumb, or playing dumb. I've done more deconfliction with Russians in a foreign op I did for the USSS than the FBI did in their search warrant at MAL. Only a dumba** would pitch the 'it's the standard paperwork' line. Go serve a search warrant at the White House in the cocaine case while filling out your 'standard paperwork' and see how that works out for you. Wake up.\"\n\nTrump responded to the report, which broke while he was in court in Manhattan for his ongoing hush-money trial, sharing his reaction to the news in a post on Truth Social.\n\n\"WOW! I just came out of the Biden Witch Hunt Trial in Manhattan, the 'Icebox,' and was shown Reports that Crooked Joe Biden's DOJ, in their Illegal and UnConstitutional Raid of Mar-a-Lago, AUTHORIZED THE FBI TO USE DEADLY (LETHAL) FORCE.

Take just 30 seconds and sign up for WND's Email News Alerts!\n\nA lot.\n\nInvestigative journalist Julie Kelly, who has pursued the misbehaviors of the Biden administration diligently, has discovered from government documents that the FBI agents in the raid were authorized to use \"deadly force when necessary.\"\n\nThat would have been one way, although extreme, to assure the Democrats victory in their lawfare campaign to try to prevent Trump from challenging the \"diminished\" Joe Biden for the White House this year.\n\nActually, that could have made the subsequent \"lawfare\" cases unnecessary.\n\nTwitchy explained, \"It sounds like the FBI and other government officials went into Mar-a-Lago like they were going on the Bin Laden raid. But wait, it gets even worse.\"\n\nShe continued, \"Oh my God. Armed FBI agents were preparing to confront Trump and even engage Secret Service if necessary. They were going to go door to door to terrorize MAL guests and even pick the locks. Gestapo.\"\n\nEvidence now shows that the White House was in contact with those trying to resolve the disputes over the Trump presidency papers. And it's known that in virtually every other such situation, there were negotiations over the possession of papers, not armed SWAT raids.\n\nIn fact, Joe Biden was found by a special counsel to have likely willfully and knowingly kept classified government papers from his days as senator and vice president. Yet the special counsel recommended no charges against him because of his \"diminished\" capabilities.\n\nAlso, former Vice President Mike Pence was given a pass for also having government papers.\n\nKelly pointed out that the government papers, opened up during one of the multiple lawfare cases against Trump, noted, \"FBI had a medic on the scene and identified a local trauma center for anyone 'injured' during the raid.\"\n\nShe noted the FBI's Steven D'Antuono pushed the rules and pointed out that Merrick Garland authorized the raid.\n\n\"FBI risked the lives of Donald Trump, his family, his staff, and MAL guests for a publicity stunt to make it look like Trump stole national security files. People need to be arrested for this.\"\n\nFor 25 years, WND has boldly brought you the news that really matters.

Aileen Cannon and highlighted how the FBI had prepared for a violent confrontation with Trump and his Secret Service detail during the raid in the classified documents case.\n\nThe Feds even brought along a medic and alerted a nearby Level One trauma centre at nearby St Mary's Medical Center in West Palm Beach to be on standby, according to the documents.\n\nThey raided Trump's wife and son's rooms, leading some to ask if they were part of the 'deadly force' authorisation.\n\nThe FBI has responded, claiming that all of this is \"standard protocol\":", "source": {"uri":

Last June, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee pleaded not guilty to 37 charges associated with his alleged lack of returning classified material after his term in the White House concluded.\n\nThe former president's motion in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida challenges the legality of the FBI's raid, in addition to the Special Counsel's Office allegedly violating his attorney-client privilege.\n\nAn \"operations order\" of the 9 a.m. raid that was produced in discovery contained a \"policy statement\" regarding the \"use of deadly force,\" which said in part: \"Law enforcement officers of the Department of Justice may use deadly force when necessary.\"\n\nAgents at the scene of the raid, who were instructed to wear unmarked polo or collared shirts, had planned to bring \"standard issue weapons, ammo, handcuffs and medium and large sized bolt cutters.\"\n\nA contingencies plan was also created in cohesion with the raid, showing that a paramedic be at the scene in case someone is \"injured.\" The name of the nearest local trauma center, complete with an address and a phone number, was included on the same form.\n\nContingencies also said that agents \"will be prepared to engage with\" Trump and U.S. Secret Service should he have arrived at Mar-a-Lago.\n\nThe criminal case, one of four currently involving the former president, has led to tense back-and-forth exchanges between Trump, his legal team and Special Counsel Jack Smith of the Department of Justice (DOJ). The ex-president has been in a Manhattan courtroom as his hush money criminal trial continues.\n\nThe filing also included Trump's lawyers arguing that the August 8, 2022, raid at Mar-a-Lago was \"unconstitutional\" and that evidence obtained at the property was an \"unlawful violation of President Trump's attorney-client privilege by the Special Counsel's Office.\"\n\nThey called the raid an armed \"storming\" of a private residence, meant to aid \"chief political rival\" President Joe Biden while being \"personally authorized by Attorney General [Merrick] Garland, and supported over FBI objections by DOJ leadership who did not 'give a damn about the optics' of these unprecedented steps.\"\n\nAnother concern presented by the Trump legal team is that the warrant for the raid itself was flawed and did not meet the criteria of the Fourth Amendment, in that the general warrant allowed a complete search of the 17-acre estate containing 58 bedrooms and 33 bathrooms instead of being confined to specific areas where documents were believed to be stored.\n\nAgents purportedly looked at rooms including a gym, a kitchen, former first lady Melania Trump's master bedroom suite, and a child's bedroom suite used by Trump's son, Barron.\n\nDocuments allegedly discovered during the raid, which did not conclude until about 6:40 p.m. that day, were only found in a storage room and in or near a \"45 office.\"", "source": {"uri": "newsweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsweek"}, "authors": [{"uri": "nick_mordowanec@newsweek.com", "name": "Nick Mordowanec", "type": "author",

You know they're just itching to do the unthinkable,\" Trump said Tuesday in a fundraising email shared by US media.\n\n\"Joe Biden was locked & loaded ready to take me out & put my family in danger. He thinks he can frighten me, intimidate me, and KNOCK ME DOWN!\"\n\nThe wild remarks add to the pile of false claims made by Trump against Biden, whom he has repeatedly accused without evidence of weaponizing the justice system to target him.\n\nDemocratic Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer called for all lawmakers to condemn Trump's \"outlandish and dangerous\" remarks in a speech in the upper chamber of Congress.\n\n\"We cannot let this man, Donald Trump, or anybody else, throw these kinds of matches to light flames that could burn our democracy,\" he said.\n\nDavid Axelrod, a White House aide under Barack Obama, called Trump's comments \"patently nuts...and dangerously provocative\" in a post on X.\n\nBut several of Trump's staunchest allies joined Trump in misrepresenting the court filing.\n\nGeorgia congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene posted on X that the Justice Department and the FBI \"gave the green light\" to assassinate Trump.\n\nOn the day of the raid, Trump was not on Florida but at his Bedminster golf club in New Jersey.\n\nThe FBI issued a rare statement, saying \"there was no departure from the norm in this matter.\"\n\nThe bureau -- which recovered more than 100 classified documents, including some marked top secret -- got the go-ahead for the raid from a federal judge after the government tried for months to get the records back.\n\nThe billionaire is accused of willfully retaining national defense information and obstructing government efforts to recover it.\n\nHe denies 40 felony charges, but the trial has been indefinitely postponed.\n\nIn a statement to AFP, the Trump campaign said reporting of the fundraising email was \"a sickening attempt to run cover for Joe Biden who is the most corrupt president in history and a threat to our democracy.\"", "source": {"uri": "today.rtl.lu", "dataType": "news", "title": "RTL Today"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5,

No one ordered additional steps to be taken and there was no departure from the norm in this matter,\" the statement said.\n\nAccording to Justice Department policy, law enforcement officers are allowed to use force only when no other safe alternatives appear to exist. The policy further states that deadly force is permitted only \"when necessary, that is, when the officer has a reasonable belief that the subject of such force poses an imminent danger of death or serious physical injury to the officer or to another person.\"\n\nA Trump campaign spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment Tuesday night, and spokespeople for Greene and Gosar did not elaborate on the lawmakers' posts.\n\nTrump has pleaded not guilty to charges that he willfully retained national defense information in connection with classified documents that were uncovered at his Florida estate after leaving office and allegedly ordered a Mar-a-Lago staffer to delete security video at the property.

This form, which also must be read by the team leader to all assisting agents, is a reminder of the FBI's deadly force policy.

It was not a standard op. The MAL raid was an unprecedented action with significant potential for confusion and blue on blue issues and conflict. It also involved competing equities between federal agencies (FBI & USSS) with equal statutory claims to interrupt the other's activities. Anyone telling you otherwise is either dumb, or playing dumb. I've done more deconfliction with Russians in a foreign op I did for the USSS than the FBI did in their search warrant at MAL. Only a dumba** would pitch the 'it's the standard paperwork' line. Go serve a search warrant at the White House in the cocaine case while filling out your 'standard paperwork' and see how that works out for you. Wake up.\"\n\nThe revelation about the deadly force authorization was found in court papers in one of the Democrats' lawfare cases against Trump, which were released by Judge Aileen Cannon.\n\nThe so-called \"standard\" papers demanded, \"Should FPOTUS [Trump] arrive at MAL [Mar-a-Lago], FBI MM EM and OSCs will be prepared to engage with FPOTUS and USSS Security Team. Should USSS provide resistance or interfere with FBI timeline or accesses, FBI MM EM will engage with [redacted] and [redacted] will engage with USSS POC's per existing liaison relationships.\n\n\"Law enforcement officers of the Department of Justice may use deadly force only when necessary, that is, when the officer has a reasonable belief that the subject of such force poses an imminent danger of death or serious physical injury to the officer or to another person.\"\n\nThe documents also cited a local medical response facility, should it be needed.\n\nTrump's response was blunt: \"Wow! I just came out of the Biden Witch Hunt Trial in Manhattan, the \"Icebox,\" and was shown Reports that Crooked Joe Biden's DOJ, in their Illegal and Unconstitutional Raid of Mar-a-Lago, AUTHORIZED THE FBI TO USE DEADLY (LETHAL) FORCE. NOW WE KNOW, FOR SURE, THAT JOE BIDEN IS A SERIOUS THREAT TO DEMOCRACY. HE IS MENTALLY UNFIT TO HOLD OFFICE - 25th AMENDMENT!\"\n\nThe FBI's shocking raid on Trump's home remains one of the stunners of the Joe Biden era in that agency.\n\nOfficers marched onto the property, demanded compliance with their orders for privacy and a video security system, scattered government documents on the floor and photographed them, and then took boxes and boxes - apparently snatching some of Trump's private belongings.\n\nThis all happened because the leftists at the National Archives apparently colluded with the Biden White House to assemble a criminal case against Trump - at a time when his representatives apparently were trying to work out all of the disputes that were involved in ownership of documents from his presidency.\n\nInvestigative journalist Julie Kelly, who has pursued the misbehaviors of the Biden administration diligently, revealed the FBI agenda and authorization to use \"deadly force when necessary.\"\n\nTwitchy explained, \"It sounds like the FBI and other government officials went into Mar-a-Lago like they were going on the Bin Laden raid. But wait, it gets even worse.\"\n\nShe continued, \"Oh my God. Armed FBI agents were preparing to confront Trump and even engage Secret Service if necessary.

FBI agents recovered classified material from Trump's time in the White House -- which the former president is now charged with illegally retaining. One page in the document includes a \"policy statement\" on the use of deadly force, which says officers may resort to lethal force only when the subject of such force poses an \"imminent danger of death or serious physical injury\" to an officer or another person.\n\nTrump, the presumptive GOP nominee for president, and some of his allies suggested Tuesday that this was evidence that Biden's Justice Department was prepared to fatally shoot him. In fact, Trump was not at his Florida property the day of the search. FBI agents specifically sought to avoid a confrontation with Trump, choosing a day when Trump would not be at the property and giving the Secret Service a heads-up, The Washington Post previously reported.\n\nRead more: https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/05/21/trump-mar-a-lago-raid-fbi-deadly-force/", "source": {"uri": "democraticunderground.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Democratic Underground"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classified_information", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Classified information"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mar-a-Lago", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mar-a-Lago"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Washington_Post", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Washington Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secret_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Secret Service"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 89}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9587575", "eventUri": "eng-9587575", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1686274509803921, "wgt": 159, "relevance": 1}

A \"policy statement\" within this document discusses the use of \"deadly force\" which indicates officers could utilise lethal force when there's an \"imminent danger of death or serious physical injury\" to an officer or other individuals.\n\nIn a blatant exaggeration of typical FBI procedures concerning deadly force during such operations, the presumptive Republican nominee for president, along with several allies proposed on Tuesday that this showed Biden's Justice Department was prepared to shoot him fatally.\n\nREAD MORE: Biggest bombshells from Donald Trump's hush money case as defence rests and trial nears end\n\nContrarily, Trump was not present at his Florida property during the search, which led to the discovery of classified material from his presidential era that he has since been charged with illegally keeping\n\nInstead, the FBI aimed to avoid a showdown with Trump, selecting a day he would not be at the site and informing the Secret Service beforehand, as reported by The Washington Post. Consequently, the former president wrongly alleged his successor planned a violent encounter all while publicly denying reality.\n\nIn an instance without any modern US historical precedent, Trump has levelled grave allegations against his political rival, accusing him of endangering his life. The outburst signified a dramatic surge in Trump's unfounded onslaughts against Biden, all the while dealing with 88 criminal charges stretched across four indictments in federal and state courts.\n\nTrump has repeatedly blamed Biden for manipulating the legal system against him, supposedly working together with the Justice Department and local prosecutors. However, there isn't a shred of evidence to back such claims.\n\nOn Tuesday evening, a fundraising email emerging from the Trump campaign, authenticated with the candidate's signature no less, had a provocative subject line reading \"They were authorised to shoot me!\" Inside, it contained accusations attributing sinister intentions to the Biden administration, claiming \"You know they're just itching to do the unthinkable ... Joe Biden was locked & loaded ready to take me out & put my family in danger.\"\n\nFor all the latest news, politics, sports, and showbiz from the USA, go to The Mirror US\n\nIn another rant on his social media platform, Truth Social, Trump instigated further, alleging: \"Joe Biden's DOJ, in their Illegal and Unconstitutional Raid of Mar-a-Lago, AUTHORIZED THE FBI TO USE DEADLY (LETHAL) FORCE.\"\n\nIn defence, the FBI issued a statement on Tuesday clarifying: \"No one ordered additional steps to be taken and there was no departure from the norm in this matter,\" they asserted that it \"followed standard protocol in this search as we do for all search warrants, which includes a standard policy statement limiting the use of deadly force.\"\n\nThe agency approved a federal magistrate judge in Florida to raid Mar-a-Lago after enduring months of unsuccessful attempts at procuring crucial documents from Trump. Agents also arrived in the casual attire of khakis and polo shirts, deliberately chosen to lower their profile as they combed the area, leaving with over 100 classified records, some of which were top secret.\n\nWhen questioned about the disparity between the policy in the law enforcement document and Trump's claims, his campaign spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt responded to The Washington Post accusing the publication of a \"sickening attempt to run cover for Joe Biden.\" She wrote in an email, \"The good news is, Americans don't buy the pro-Democrat, Election Interfering pro-Biden propaganda the Washington Post is constantly selling.\"\n\nThe Biden campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Some of Trump's allies echoed the former president's claims on social media.\n\nRep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga. ), a staunch Trump ally, went even further than Trump on social media, writing on X that \"The Biden DOJ and FBI were planning to assassinate Pres Trump and gave the green light.\" Throughout his campaign, Trump has used the charges against him to rally his political base and raise millions of dollars.\n\nHe has pleaded not guilty to the charges. Trump is currently on trial in New York on allegations of falsifying business records to cover up hush money to a porn actress and awaits trial in the other three cases.\n\nTrump's Tuesday comments add to a long history of false and incendiary claims against his political opponents, which Democrats and some Republicans have denounced, and have alarmed historians who have studied political rhetoric. The rhetoric of Donald Trump has been echoed and amplified by some of his supporters, including Republican members of Congress, conservative media personalities and others.\n\nIt remains uncertain whether Trump will face trial before the election on charges of mishandling classified documents. Prosecutors allege that Trump improperly retained top-secret documents from his presidency and subsequently hindered the government's efforts to recover them.", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk",

The dueling briefs signal a new stage in the case.\n\nMr. Trump contends that the \"raid of Mar-a-Lago was unconstitutional\" and that \"what was unthinkable with respect to President Clinton's recordings, and deemed unwarranted with respect to Hillary Clinton's destruction of evidence, was determined to be appropriate by the Biden Administration.\"\n\nMr. Smith's 29-page response aspires to persuade Judge Cannon that the government handled the evidence it collected in an appropriate fashion. The 45th president accuses Mr. Smith of \"spoliation,\" and the special counsel has admitted to providing the judge with an \"inconsistent\" account of the state of the secret documents. He did not address that issue on Tuesday.\n\nThe special counsel writes that the \"investigation in this case adopted a measured, graduated approach\" in the face of \"obstruction and deceit\" from Mr. Trump and his camarilla, whom he accuses of stashing more than 180 classified documents at Palm Beach. Mr. Smith maintains that Mr. Trump \"identifies no plausible basis to suppress the fruits\" of the FBI's search.\n\nThe 45th president disputes that assessment, pointing out that agents took 42 pictures of wife Melania Trump's bedroom and 27 of son Barron's -- no documents were found at those quarters -- and venturing that the \"warrant conferred extraordinary and improper discretion on FBI agents to seize essentially every document at Mar-a-Lago.\"\n\nMr. Trump challenges the warrant under whose aegis the search was conducted. The Fourth Amendment ordains that \"no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.\" The former president argues that Mr. Smith's underlying affidavit was not sufficiently detailed to meet this standard.\n\nMr. Smith defends his omission of a discussion of presidential prerogative by arguing that Mr. Trump's \"authority to access or possess classified documents during his presidency was both obvious and immaterial to the probable cause determination regarding the retention of the documents after his presidency.\" He defends leaving out a discussion of whether Mr. Trump's consent should have been sought by estimating that such a step \"would simply invite more deception.\"\n\nMr. Trump, though, adduced evidence that at least one FBI agent \"firmly believed\" that \"the best scenario would have been consent,\" for \"the FBI, for former President Trump, and for the country.\" A deputy attorney general, though, was captured on tape reflecting that he didn't \"give a damn about the optics\" of the FBI searching the home of a former president.\n\nThe special counsel argues that \"none of the omissions alleged by Trump, either singly or together, would have had an impact on the magistrate's common-sense finding of probable cause,\" and that his warrant went \"well beyond\" the constitutional requirements. If a court finds that the government has defaulted on its warrant obligations, evidence could be suppressed.\n\nMr. Trump shares that what he calls a \"roving and highly inappropriate\" search -- \"illegal raid\" is his preferred term -- explored the \"Former First Lady Master Bedroom Suite\" and the \"Child's bedroom suite\" used by Barron Trump. He calls the manner in which the evidence was collected \"egregious\" and the documentation deficient because it did not disclose that the \"FBI had taken the position -- in writing, apparently -- that it was not necessary to execute a search warrant at Mar-a-Lago.\"\n\nMr. Smith, though, tells Judge Cannon that the evidence collected at Mar-a-Lago meets a prima facie showing of a crime because it \"demonstrates that Trump intentionally took possession of a vast trove of some of the Nation's most sensitive documents and stored them in unsecured locations at his heavily trafficked social club.\" He promises to \"prove the allegations at trial beyond a reasonable doubt,\" though the judge has delayed the trial date indefinitely.\n\nThat delay -- and a series of rulings that appear to have tilted the field in favor of Mr. Trump -- could be behind Mr. Smith's declaration that \"dismissal of an indictment would be an extraordinary and inappropriate remedy\" for the types of missteps the defendants allege.", "source": {"uri": "nysun.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Sun"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Smith_(lawyer)",

The FBI authorized the use of deadly force during the Mar-a-Lago raid. This according to documents filed by Trump's legal team. Agents in unmarked polo shirts planned to bring standard-issue weapons, ammo, handcuffs, medium and large-size bolt cutters, and even lock-picking equipment as they prepared to go door-to-door at Mar-a-Lago.\n\nBIDEN ADMINISTRATION AUTHORIZED 'USE OF DEADLY FORCE' IN MAR-A-LAGO RAID\n\nAnd they did, ransacking Melania Trump's bedroom along with Barron Trump's bedroom. The FBI also took extensive photographs of Melania and Barron's rooms for no apparent reason. Think about this for a second. Joe Biden sent men with guns to his political opponent's house and turned their bedrooms upside down. That's never happened in the history of the United States. And we've had some crazy presidents.\n\nThis was the former first lady and a professional model. These people are sick. And Biden complains about his son's privacy? Hunter's? He had armed men rummage through Barron's bedroom. The FBI even allegedly had a medic on site in case someone was shot.\n\nTrump reacting: \"Wow. I just came out of the Biden witch hunt trial in Manhattan, the ice box, and was shown reports that Crooked Joe Biden's DOJ and their illegal and unconstitutional raid of Mar-a-Lago authorized the FBI to use deadly, lethal force. Now, we know for sure that Joe Biden is a serious threat to democracy. He is mentally unfit to hold office-- 25th amendment.\" Trump's lawyers claim that the former president's constitutional rights were violated. It was an illegal search and seizure. The FBI misled the judge to obtain the warrant, and the raid was executed in an egregious fashion and in bad faith.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nNor was there any basis for the FBI to bring firearms into Mar-a-Lago. What was life-threatening about pieces of paper? The FBI improperly seized Trump's passports, tax and accounting information, and even medical records. Think about that. The Biden administration seized his political opponent's medical records!", "source": {"uri": "foxnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fox News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fox News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesse_Watters", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jesse Watters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mar-a-Lago", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mar-a-Lago"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Email"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barron's_(newspaper)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Barron's (newspaper)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terms_of_service", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Terms of service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privately_held_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Privately held company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melania_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Melania Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handcuffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Handcuffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Lady_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "First Lady of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_of_Donald_Trump", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Family of Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty-fifth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bad_faith", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bad faith"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_and_seizure", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Search and seizure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutionality", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Constitutionality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Witch-hunt", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Witch-hunt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutional_right", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Constitutional right"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coming_out", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coming out"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firearm", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Firearm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passport", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Passport"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Privacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 75}], "image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/cf-images.us-east-1.prod.boltdns.net/v1/static/694940094001/f2fbf414-2fe7-492c-acd9-534d21112714/6f9f16c8-48e0-4bb8-84e9-0a5cd7324e95/1280x720/match/1024/512/image.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9587575", "eventUri": "eng-9587575", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.01960784313725483, "wgt": 158, "relevance": 1}

He thinks he can frighten me, intimidate me, and KNOCK ME DOWN!\"\n\nThe wild remarks add to the pile of false claims made by Trump against Biden, whom he has repeatedly accused without evidence of weaponizing the justice system to target him.\n\nDemocratic Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer called for all lawmakers to condemn Trump's \"outlandish and dangerous\" remarks in a speech in the upper chamber of Congress.\n\n\"We cannot let this man, Donald Trump, or anybody else, throw these kinds of matches to light flames that could burn our democracy,\" he said.\n\nDavid Axelrod, a White

the raid, Trump was not on Florida but at his Bedminster golf club in New Jersey.\n\nThe FBI issued a rare statement, saying \"there was no departure from the norm in this matter.\"\n\nThe bureau -- which recovered more than 100 classified documents, including some marked top secret -- got the go-ahead for the raid from a federal judge after the government tried for months to get the records back.\n\nThe billionaire is accused of willfully retaining national defense information and obstructing government efforts to recover it.\n\nHe denies 40 felony charges, but the trial has been

We will update this article if we get a response from the FBI.\n\nRegardless, an additional tweet from Kelly at the end of her thread suggests that the deadly force stipulation is indeed a blanket policy.\n\nBut hold on; it gets better. In the next tweet, Kelly showed additional documents that said, \"FBI, MM (evidently referring to Miami agents), and [Office of Special Counsel] will be prepared to engage with [Former] POTUS and [Secret Service].\"\n\nAs she described, agents were apparently prepared to physically fight Trump and his Secret Service detail if necessary and sweep every room, evidently forgetting the issue of making martyrs. Still, they did have a medic on hand and had notified a nearby hospital about potential incoming patients if anyone was injured.\n\nThat does not make the situation better, but it does lead to two troubling implications. Did they genuinely believe that Trump and the Secret Service would put up a fight, or was there a chance that Biden's handlers were thinking they could get rid of their foremost political rival permanently through this raid for \"classified documents\"?\n\nBoth of them are equally disturbing to think about, but if Donald Trump should win back the White House in November, he better do some serious fumigation and purging in the Department of Justice once he's sworn back in come January.", "source": {"uri": "pjmedia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "PJ Media"}, "authors": [{"uri": "grayson_bakich@pjmedia.com", "name": "Grayson Bakich", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mar-a-Lago", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mar-a-Lago"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadly_force", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Deadly force"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classified_information", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Classified information"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merrick_Garland", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Merrick Garland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawfare", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lawfare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contract_killing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Contract killing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journalist", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Journalist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PJ_Media", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "PJ Media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secret_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Secret Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Office_of_Special_Counsel", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Office of Special Counsel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2022/221/1ff280b8-015a-4ae0-9354-5acf607a1dab.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9587575", "eventUri": "eng-9587575", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 156, "relevance": 1}

Despite that fact and the FBI's statement about the allegation, at least one Trump ally and his campaign staff amplified the false claim, the Washington Post reports. Trump appeared to be misrepresenting a standard Justice Department policy released Tuesday in a court filing.\n\nThe FBI said Tuesday its search followed the usual protocol, per Axios, which it said \"includes a standard policy statement limiting the use of deadly force.\" Every order contains a reminder of the policy, a former FBI official posted on X. The policy says agents may only use lethal force if there's an \"imminent danger of death or serious physical injury\" to someone. \"They were authorized to shoot me!\" Trump wrote in the email, also saying \"Joe Biden was locked & loaded ready to take me out.\" He put something similar on Truth Social. Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene escalated the accusation to a government plan to assassinate Trump. A Trump campaign spokesman stuck to the accusation, per the New York Times.\n\nThe FBI had contacted Mar-a-Lago's Secret Service agents ahead of time to ensure there'd be no confrontations, and the agents discussed the search first with the Justice Department, per the AP. The FBI's Steve D'Antuono testified before the House Judiciary Committee last year that agents did not go into Trump's club, which was closed that day, like gangbusters. \"We're not banging down any doors,\" he said. \"We weren't bringing any like FBI vehicles, everything that was reported about helicopters and a hundred people descending on, like a Die Hard movie, was completely untrue, right.

This form, which also must be read by the team leader to all assisting agents, is a reminder of the FBI's deadly force policy.

It was not a standard op. The MAL raid was an unprecedented action with significant potential for confusion and blue on blue issues and conflict. It also involved competing equities between federal agencies (FBI & USSS) with equal statutory claims to interrupt the other's activities. Anyone telling you otherwise is either dumb, or playing dumb. I've done more deconfliction with Russians in a foreign op I did for the USSS than the FBI did in their search warrant at MAL. Only a dumba** would pitch the 'it's the standard paperwork' line. Go serve a search warrant at the White House in the cocaine case while filling out your 'standard paperwork' and see how that works out for you. Wake up.\"\n\nThe revelation about the deadly force authorization was found in court papers in one of the Democrats' lawfare cases against Trump, which were released by Judge Aileen Cannon.\n\nThe so-called \"standard\" papers demanded, \"Should FPOTUS [Trump] arrive at MAL [Mar-a-Lago], FBI MM EM and OSCs will be prepared to engage with FPOTUS and USSS Security Team. Should USSS provide resistance or interfere with FBI timeline or accesses, FBI MM EM will engage with [redacted] and [redacted] will engage with USSS POC's per existing liaison relationships.\n\n\"Law enforcement officers of the Department of Justice may use deadly force only when necessary, that is, when the officer has a reasonable belief that the subject of such force poses an imminent danger of death or serious physical injury to the officer or to another person.\"\n\nThe documents also cited a local medical response facility, should it be needed.\n\nTrump's response was blunt: \"Wow! I just came out of the Biden Witch Hunt Trial in Manhattan, the \"Icebox,\" and was shown Reports that Crooked Joe Biden's DOJ, in their Illegal and Unconstitutional Raid of Mar-a-Lago, AUTHORIZED THE FBI TO USE DEADLY (LETHAL) FORCE. NOW WE KNOW, FOR SURE, THAT JOE BIDEN IS A SERIOUS THREAT TO DEMOCRACY. HE IS MENTALLY UNFIT TO HOLD OFFICE - 25th AMENDMENT!\"\n\nThe FBI's shocking raid on Trump's home remains one of the stunners of the Joe Biden era in that agency.\n\nOfficers marched onto the property, demanded compliance with their orders for privacy and a video security system, scattered government documents on the floor and photographed them, and then took boxes and boxes - apparently snatching some of Trump's private belongings.\n\nThis all happened because the leftists at the National Archives apparently colluded with the Biden White House to assemble a criminal case against Trump - at a time when his representatives apparently were trying to work out all of the disputes that were involved in ownership of documents from his presidency.\n\nInvestigative journalist Julie Kelly, who has pursued the misbehaviors of the Biden administration diligently, revealed the FBI agenda and authorization to use \"deadly force when necessary.\"\n\nTwitchy explained, \"It sounds like the FBI and other government officials went into Mar-a-Lago like they were going on the Bin Laden raid. But wait, it gets even worse.\"\n\nShe continued, \"Oh my God. Armed FBI agents were preparing to confront Trump and even engage Secret Service if necessary. They were going to go door to door to terrorize MAL guests and even pick the locks. Gestapo.\"\n\nFor 25 years, WND has boldly brought you the news that really matters.

It's no secret that law enforcement will come armed when enforcing a search warrant. But the FBI has already testified that it chose to search Mar-a-Lago on a day that Trump would not be there in order to prevent any conflict.\n\nSo why make such a post? The former president is probably trying to distract from the news Tuesday from an unsealed legal opinion that classified documents were found in his bedroom at Mar-a-Lago four months after the FBI's initial search.\n\nTrump faces 42 felony charges in his classified documents case related to willful retention of national security information, corruptly concealing documents, and conspiracy to obstruct justice. But the judge in the case, Trump appointee Aileen Cannon, seems to be stalling the trial on purpose. Earlier this month, she ordered a stay on Trump's legal requirement to give the government advance notice of which classified materials will be discussed -- but offered no expiration date for the reprieve.\n\nCannon faces a growing backlash due to her handling of the case, with online petitions calling for her removal or recusal from the case. Even some of her clerks have quit because of her conduct, as well as for creating a hostile work environment. At least one potential witness, former Mar-a-Lago worker Brian Butler, has publicly come forward and criticized Cannon's handling of the case.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mar-a-Lago", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mar-a-Lago"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classified_information", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Classified information"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth_Social", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Truth Social"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bribery", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bribery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Washington_Post", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Washington Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_warrant", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Search warrant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aileen_Cannon", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aileen Cannon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obstruction_of_justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Obstruction of justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Felony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National security"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_new_republic_521/6802991b25e58800fcc1d25523a9d736", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9587575", "eventUri": "eng-9587575", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2862745098039216, "wgt": 154, "relevance": 1}

Trump was not present at the raid, which the FBI knew ahead of time. After the outrage spread from Greene to Trump himself, the FBI was forced to provide context to the use of deadly force, which is standard protocol in search warrants.\n\nNevertheless, even while including the FBI statement, Bartiromo used the opportunity to attack law enforcement and suggest Biden tried to have Trump killed:\n\nThis is so extraordinary. Over and over again, we see that the Democrats charge the Republicans with things that they are actually doing, and they have, this happens over and over again. Now the FBI and the Democrats keep saying things like Trump is a threat to democracy, but Biden is authorizing deadly force against his political opponent? And then you've got FBI, the former director, Jim Comey, back on television now with a new warning of what he thinks a second Trump term would look like.\n\nShe played a clip of Comey on MSNBC, telling host Alex Wagner that a second Trump term would have \"serious\" implications for \"the Justice Department and the FBI, because Trump is coming for those institutions.

Julie Kelly has the DETAILS HERE.\n\nI am not surprised in the least. Remember, the objective of the FBI raid was to resecure the physical evidence that President Trump had showing how the DOJ and FBI action in 2016 was targeting him using the power of their law enforcement and intelligence agencies. The origination of all the DOJ/FBI/IC issues goes back to the '15/'16 FBI exploitation of the NSA database; this is not a contested discussion issue - it's just continually forgotten.\n\nTRUTH LIVES on at https://sgtreport.tv/\n\nThe FBI was using their access to the NSA metadata of all Americans, to conduct surveillance on political candidates that might be a threat to the power structures that exploited the secrets within the electronic records of all Americans. The FBI was/is conducting domestic surveillance and tracking just like the German Stasi or Soviet KGB. It's still happening, but we are not supposed to remember or something.\n\nThe raid on Mar-a-Lago, just like the Robert Mueller investigation, was part of the long standing coverup operation. The FBI was looking for what Trump took with him as evidence of the weaponized system that targeted him. The FBI wanted that back. The FBI was willing to use deadly force to get it back if that's what it took.\n\nThe raid involved 25 Miami FBI agents, four Washington FBI agents, one unidentified individual from FBI Headquarters, one DOJ attorney, and the assistant U.S. Attorney from the Southern District of Florida. (MORE)\n\nYes, apparently the FBI was prepared to engage in a gun battle or kill people in Mar-a-Lago in order to retake the evidence against them. I know it sounds scarey, but that's the reality of our modern FBI. These are not good people. Remember also that AG Merrick Garland said he authorized every facet of the raid.\n\nI keep trying to drive the point home, these are not good people.... yet, many refuse to accept, pretend it just can't be that bad, or keep forgetting the real examples that prove how bad the FBI is.\n\nThe modern FBI is the police agency of a weaponized U.S government, with a direct and purposeful mandate to keep the American people under control through strict surveillance and a violent police state.\n\nUnderstand and accept this with great seriousness, there are no honorable \"rank and file\" inside this organization.\n\nEvery member of the FBI is a participant in the weaponization of power and government. The members are jackboots recruited from ideological college campuses for exactly the purpose of supporting a Stasi-like police state.\n\nThrough the past several years, we have discovered how the FBI worked inside Twitter, Facebook and social media to control information, remove content and manipulate opinion on behalf of the U.S. government - all activity political.\n\nWe have also learned the FBI took active measures to suppress information about the Hunter Biden laptop and control any negative consequences for the Biden regime - again, political. These are not disputed realities.\n\nThe U.S. Dept of Justice and FBI are now political institutions that have abandoned their originating mission in order to become the domestic equivalent of the Soviet-era FSB. Their joint targeting mechanisms have been redesigned to support the interests of corrupt DC politicians, specifically the interests of Democrats.\n\nIt was in June 2022, when Senator Chuck Grassley sent a letter [pdf HERE] to Attorney General Merrick Garland and FBI Director Chris Wray, notifying them of whistleblower allegations from within the FBI that senior leadership in both Main Justice and FBI are involved in a coordinated effort to cover up criminal activity related to Hunter Biden.", "source": {"uri": "sgtreport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SGT Report"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mar-a-Lago", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mar-a-Lago"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Surveillance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Security_Agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National Security Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence_agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Intelligence agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secret_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Secret Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mueller_special_counsel_investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mueller special counsel investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_District_Court_for_the_Southern_District_of_Florida", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cover-up", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cover-up"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_state", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Police state"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stasi", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stasi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nazi Germany"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KGB", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "KGB"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merrick_Garland", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Merrick Garland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hunter Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_measures", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Active measures"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_A._Wray", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Christopher A.

Trump claimed, \"I've received reports that Joe Biden's Department of Justice authorized the FBI to use lethal force during the illegal and unconstitutional raid at Mar-a-Lago,\" asserting, \"We now have confirmation. Joe Biden poses a significant threat to democracy.\"\n\nThe raid on Trump's Florida residence in August 2022 resulted in the seizure of over a hundred documents, 17 of which were classified as \"top secret.\" Subsequently, criminal charges were filed against the former president in a Miami court for the \"mishandling\" of classified information. Trump potentially faces up to 400 years in prison along with a hefty fine.\n\nHowever, despite facing legal challenges, Trump remains eligible to participate in the 2024 presidential elections. He contends that the urgency of his duties and heavy workload prevented him from promptly returning the classified documents to the White House.\n\nH.H", "source": {"uri": "saba.ye", "dataType": "news", "title": "\u0633\u0628\u0623\u0646\u062a - \u0648\u0643\u0627\u0644\u0629 \u0633\u0628\u0623"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marjorie_Taylor_Greene", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marjorie Taylor Greene"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mar-a-Lago", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mar-a-Lago"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth_Social", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Truth Social"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Speaker of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impeachment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Impeachment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Johnson_(Louisiana_politician)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mike Johnson (Louisiana politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutionality", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Constitutionality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Research", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Research", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://www.saba.ye/storage/larage/692a12af3637e24d8e647a56c3ed9052.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9587575", "eventUri": "eng-9587575", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-22", "textStart": 1, "textEnd": 7, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": 0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 153, "relevance": 1}

I just came out of the Biden Witch Hunt Trial in Manhattan, the 'Icebox,' and was shown Reports that Crooked Joe Biden's DOJ, in their Illegal and UnConstitutional Raid of Mar-a-Lago, AUTHORIZED THE FBI TO USE DEADLY (LETHAL) FORCE. NOW WE KNOW, FOR SURE, THAT JOE BIDEN IS A SERIOUS THREAT TO DEMOCRACY. HE IS MENTALLY UNFIT TO HOLD OFFICE -- 25TH AMENDMENT!\"\n\nInvestigative journalist Julie Kelly first reported that the FBI's operational instructions for the raid on Mar-a-Lago included the \"use of deadly force when necessary.\"\n\n\"Armed FBI agents were preparing to confront Trump and even engage Secret Service if necessary,\" according to Kelly, who obtained the instructions.\n\nHarrington noted: \"You'd be forgiven for not knowing they always have a combat medic at the scene when they send the Gestapo out to seize papers, except, of course, if they're kept in an unlocked garage behind a corvette. Then they don't send anybody at all.\"\n\nSteve Bannon said in his Tuesday \"War Room\" broadcast: \"Good God in Heaven, what more do we need to shut this down? What is it going to take? Are we going to send a sharply-worded letter? If we tolerate this, we're tolerating the end of the republic.\"\n\nHarrington noted: \"Likewise, it's standard operating procedure to fake evidence and photograph it for pure propaganda purposes.\n\n\"Relax. Pre-dawn raids on nonviolent, innocent political foes (and their lawyers) are totally normal in the Trump era. It happens all the time. You can even watch live on CNN. Trade advisors are put in leg irons at the airport, and thrown in prison. Members of Congress have their phones seized. The My Pillow CEO is boxed in at a Hardee's drive-thru for questioning an election.\n\n\"And don't worry. Deadly force is to be used 'only when necessary.' In case you're wondering, the DOJ deems it 'necessary' to surveil a 300-pound 75-year-old man, who uses a cane, for months and send dozens of armored agents to break down his door, drive through his window, shoot him, and drag him out to bleed out on the sidewalk for mouthing off on social media and criticizing the Biden regime.\"\n\nRelated: FBI tactics questioned in shooting death of elderly Utah man, August 11, 2023\n\nHarrington concluded: \"The bottom line is this: Legitimate regimes claiming to have received the most votes in history don't need to send armed feds to raid the home of their political opponents, especially the home of a former president who beat them twice and is getting ready to beat them for a third time. They don't need to bring in troops and lock down the Capitol for their inauguration, either.\n\n\"They're illegitimate. They know it, and we know it. When will Republicans finally do something about it?\"\n\nKelly revealed more documents from the raid on Wednesday, including invoices showing FBI agents ransacked the bedrooms of Melania Trump and Barron Trump.", "source": {"uri": "worldtribune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "World Tribune: Window on the Real World"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Here are some of the things. This is TPM's Morning Memo. Sign up for the email version.\n\nU.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon has screwed up the Mar-a-Lago case in so many ways it defies easy categorization. Her slow rolling of the trial is obviously her single gravest sin. But there's another layer of malfeasance going on here that came more clearly into view yesterday.\n\nOver the objection of Special Counsel Jack Smith, Cannon ordered the unsealing of previous filings in the case. In some of those filings, it's becoming apparent, Trump has tucked in information about the case that he wants to seed in the public imagination and use as fodder for his presidential campaign and for fighting the criminal charges outside of court.\n\nCannon has given him a green light to do so, and the results became apparent yesterday.\n\nIn one of the filings, Trump drew attention to the FBI's deadly force policy, which was in effect during the search of Mar-a-Lago, as it is in every FBI field operation. As soon as the filing was unsealed, right-wing news outlets seized on it and accused Biden of being responsible for gunning for Trump.\n\nTrump himself later in the day amplified these bogus attacks on social media:\n\nCrooked Joe Biden's DOJ, in their Illegal and UnConstitutional Raid of Mar-a-Lago, AUTHORIZED THE FBI TO USE DEADLY (LETHAL) FORCE. NOW WE KNOW, FOR SURE, THAT JOE BIDEN IS A SERIOUS THREAT TO DEMOCRACY. HE IS MENTALLY UNFIT TO HOLD OFFICE -- 25TH AMENDMENT!\n\nIt became a campaign fundraising email, too: \"BIDEN'S DOJ WAS AUTHORIZED TO SHOOT ME!\"\n\nOf course none of this is true. The same deadly force policy that is in effect for every FBI operation was in effect for the Mar-a-Lago search. The FBI doesn't need special authority to use deadly force; it has standing authority to use deadly force when circumstances warrant it. This is a standard operating policy, and Biden had nothing to do with its promulgation in general or its application in the Mar-a-Lago search in particular.\n\nBut you can see the dynamic plainly from what I just had to do to explain this to you: Trump wants to use the criminal justice process to generate more disinformation, Cannon facilitates him doing so with her rulings, right-wing media go apeshit, Trump gooses the reaction some more, and then a day later I come along and try to unpack it all for you, including the underlying falsity, with a put-the-toothpaste-back-in-the-tube futility. The FBI issued an unusual statement in similarly futile fashion.\n\nThis is all bad enough, but there's another even darker layer here: It feeds the right-wing animosity toward federal law enforcement that has already led to two attacks on FBI field offices in the past two years. As former FBI agent Asha Rangappa points out:\n\nCannon's unsealing of court filings in the Mar-a-Lago case is a blunt instrument, and that means it's doesn't yield only good things for Trump.\n\nAmong the new revelations yesterday was a dramatic March 17, 2023 decision from U.S. District Judge Beryl Howell that came during the investigative phase of the Mar-a-Lago case. The 87-page decision, attached as an exhibit to one of Trump's motions, offered new evidence of Trump's obstruction of the effort to retrieve the classified documents that he unlawfully withheld and stowed at Mar-a-Lago.\n\nSo along with the bogus FBI deadly force headlines, Trump got these headlines, too:\n\nThe jury is not supposed to draw any inference from the defendant not testifying in their own defense, but that doesn't mean we can't - especially when the defendant is running for president.\n\nFrom a legal strategy point of view, testifying would have been a disaster. But from a political point of view, not testifying should by all rights be its own disaster.\n\nTrump bragged that he would testify, but we knew he wouldn't and he didn't and now the question is whether he will be held to account for it.\n\nI hate the framing of \"imagine what the reaction would be if [insert name of prior, usually Democratic, president] did this thing Trump did.\" But his failure to testify is exactly the kind of thing that would rightly be hung around the neck of any other presidential candidate from now until Election Day.\n\nIn the meantime, closing arguments are scheduled for Tuesday.\n\nAn unrepresented Rudy Giuliani appeared via video at his arraignment in the Arizona fake electors scheme and pleaded not guilty. Because he had dodged service of the indictment for weeks, Giuliani was required to post a cash bond of $10,000, the only defendant in the case forced to do so.\n\nIn a new filing in Rudy Giuliani's bankruptcy case, he has reached an agreement with Georgia election workers Ruby Freeman and Shaye Moss to cease serially defaming them even after they won a $148 million defamation judgment against him, forcing him into the bankruptcy.\n\nBloomberg's Josh Green:\n\nAs far-fetched as it may sound, the prospect of Trump overriding or simply ignoring the constitutional provision that limits a president to serving two terms seems to be pushing some undecided voters toward Biden, despite significant reservations about the incumbent's age, turmoil in the Middle East and high inflation. Now strategists in both parties are probing to see how widely this sentiment has spread, particularly among the undecided voters likely to sway the election.\n\nLaw Dork Chris Geidner found an interesting detail in Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito's Federal Judicial Financial Disclosure report: Last August, at the peak of the Bud Light faux controversy ginned up by the right wing over a trans influencer touting the watery beer, Alito sold some of his Anheuser-Busch stock and on the same day bought Molson Coors stock:\n\nWas that Alito's personal participation in the Bud Light boycott? It's not clear, but it is curious.\n\nAmong the best, most-detailed videos of a tornado ever captured. This was yesterday afternoon in Iowa via a drone. This tornado went on to cause severe damage in Greenfield, where there were an unconfirmed number of casualties.", "source": {"uri": "talkingpointsmemo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Talking

Judge Cannon has been presiding over the case involving former President Donald Trump's handling of classified documents and the FBI's search of his Mar-a-Lago estate. The decision to unseal these documents is part of the legal proceedings and the public's interest in the case, balancing the need for transparency with the need to protect ongoing investigations and national security interests.\n\nBut that wasn't all we learned...\n\nJulie Kelly has been doing some excellent reporting on this and here is a summary of the high points of the newest revelations:\n\nZoom in:\n\nCall me crazy, but if I didn't know any better I would almost think they were HOPING for a confrontation.

Nothing that Joe Biden does is really within the bounds of normal (Afghanistan withdrawal) or Constitutional (college loans) any more. The Biden Regime believes in the Divine Right of Kings. Shut it, peasants.\n\nThe August, 2022 raid on Mar-A-Lago by the FBI was allegedly part of an investigation into the handling of classified and sensitive material. Archivists got mad and sent out the cops. Too long:didn't read version is that Donald Trump was still President when he arrived in Florida on January 20, 2021 and that he declassified everything. The Democrat Media Industrial Complex version is that Trump took documents to sell to competing world powers and for other dastardly nefarious purposes.\n\nAmazing reporter Julie Kelly has actually been reading the court filings on the Jack Smith documents case and found this standard operating procedure:\n\nFrom the New York Post:\n\nThe Department of Justice authorized \"the use of deadly force\" when FBI agents swarmed former President Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago residence in August 2022 looking for classified documents, according to court filings Tuesday.\n\nAgents in the Aug. 8 raid were tasked with seizing \"classified information, [National Defense Information], and US Government records,\" reads to an operations order revealed in evidence as part of Trump's criminal case involving the allegedly mishandled documents in Florida.\n\nThe authorities also were told to conceal their \"law enforcement equipment\" and come armed with \"ammo,\" \"handcuffs\" and \"medium and large sized bolt cutters,\" notes the filing by lawyers for the former president.\n\n\"The FBI followed standard protocol in this search as we do for all search warrants, which includes a standard policy statement limiting the use of deadly force,\" the agency said in a statement. \"No one ordered additional steps to be taken and there was no departure from the norm in this matter.\"\n\nAnd I bought all of the standard operating procedure booshite. Especially after I saw this headline on RedState: \"Yes, the Mar-a-Lago Raid Was Extraordinary, but the 'Deadly Force' Language in the Ops Order Wasn't\":\n\nOne interpretation of documents unsealed on Tuesday in the case arising out of that raid at Mar-a-Lago is that, indeed, that was the aim of that raid -- or, at least, the Biden administration would have been fine had that been a byproduct of its unprecedented action against the former president.\n\nSo, we've seen a number of headlines along these lines: Biden administration authorized 'Use of Deadly Force' in Mar-a-Lago raid.\n\nHere's the thing: The language reflected in the Operations Order and related documents was standard language -- the sort of language you'd find in most orders of that nature. Don't take my word for it -- let's see what those who've actually executed such warrants and/or been present at briefings involving them have to say:\n\nIt's just standard operating procedure:\n\nIn the Divine Right of Kings, this is standard operating procedure.

But wait, it gets even worse.\"\n\nShe continued, \"Oh my God. Armed FBI agents were preparing to confront Trump and even engage Secret Service if necessary. They were going to go door to door to terrorize MAL guests and even pick the locks. Gestapo.\"\n\nEvidence now shows that the White House was in contact with those trying to resolve the disputes over the Trump presidency papers. And it's known that in virtually every other such situation, there were negotiations over the possession of papers, not armed SWAT raids.\n\nIn fact, Joe Biden was found by a special counsel to have likely willfully and knowingly kept classified government papers from his days as senator and vice president. Yet the special counsel recommended no charges against him because of his \"diminished\" capabilities.\n\nAlso, former Vice President Mike Pence was given a pass for also having government papers.\n\nKelly pointed out that the government papers, opened up during one of the multiple lawfare cases against Trump, noted, \"FBI had a medic on the scene and identified a local trauma center for anyone 'injured' during the raid.\"\n\nShe noted the FBI's Steven D'Antuono pushed the rules and pointed out that Merrick Garland authorized the raid.\n\n\"FBI risked the lives of Donald Trump, his family, his staff, and MAL guests for a publicity stunt to make it look like Trump stole national security files. People need to be arrested for this.\"\n\nPresident Trump immediately turned it into an accusation against Biden, writing on social media:\n\n\"Wow! I just came out of the Biden Witch Hunt Trial in Manhattan, the 'Icebox,' and was shown Reports that Crooked Joe Biden's DOJ, in their Illegal and Unconstitutional Raid of Mar-a-Lago, AUTHORIZED THE FBI TO USE DEADLY (LETHAL) FORCE.

What are they mad at now? I'm glad you asked. It all started with a Truth Social post from Lumpy claiming that \"Joe Biden's DOJ\" authorized the FBI to use deadly force during the raid at Mar-a-Lago.\n\n\"WOW! I just came out of the Biden Witch Hunt Trial in Manhattan, the \"Icebox,\" and was shown Reports that Crooked Joe Biden's DOJ, in their Illegal and UnConstitutional Raid of Mar-a-Lago, AUTHORIZED THE FBI TO USE DEADLY (LETHAL) FORCE,\" Captain Caps Lock wrote. \"NOW WE KNOW, FOR SURE, THAT JOE BIDEN IS A SERIOUS THREAT TO DEMOCRACY. HE IS MENTALLY UNFIT TO HOLD OFFICE -- 25TH AMENDMENT!\"\n\nCalm your tits, Mr. Man. That's standard procedure.\n\n\"The FBI followed standard protocol in this search as we do for all search warrants, which includes a standard policy statement limiting the use of deadly force,\" the FBI said in a statement. \"No one ordered additional steps to be taken, and there was no departure from the norm in this matter.\"\n\nStill, Trump supporters are freaking the fuck out.\n\nBut wait, I thought Trumpers were OK with a president killing his opponent.\n\nWe really are stuck in the dumbest timeline. I've had my home raided before. It was in London. Still, the police were not fucking around. I was all, \"Yes, sir. Whatever you say, sir.\" And then, the charges were dropped when they discovered that the white powder was Vitamin C and not an illegal drug. It's a long story, but I didn't cry about it. Trump is the whiniest bitch in politics.\n\nAnd watch your back, Lumpy. You never know when Merrick will sneak up to go all Second Amendment on you. He's so scary-looking!

Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA), who claimed President Joe Biden was \"planning to assassinate\" Donald Trump.\n\nAfter his criminal trial in New York adjourned for the day, Trump claimed on Truth Social that when the FBI executed a search warrant at his Mar-a-Lago residence in August 2022, agents were authorized to use deadly force. Greene highlighted the post and stated, \"I made sure that he knew. The Biden DOJ and FBI were planning to assassinate Pres Trump and gave the green light.\"\n\nKaitlan Collins dismissed the allegation on Tuesday's edition of The Source.\n\n\"The FBI to put out a statement today saying this is standard procedure, that the FBI always has lethal force,\" she said. \"They showed up to Mar-a-Lago knowing Donald Trump wasn't there. They didn't show up at six o'clock in the morning. They didn't come with the lights flashing and the guns blazing. It was a very chill scene for a scene where they were showing up to find classified documents.\"\n\nHonig, a former federal prosecutor, scoffed at the charge and explained that the Mar-a-Lago search warrant was basically standard fare:\n\nThis is ridiculous. There's nothing to see here. And I looked even at what specifically they're talking about. If you look at the search warrant documentation, there is a standard form. It's page 11 of the sheet and it gives the FBI and the generally-acknowledged standard for use of lethal force. It says essentially, you can only fire your weapon, you can only use lethal force if there is imminent danger of death or serious bodily injury to somebody else. If you see somebody else about to shoot somebody, about the stab somebody. It is, if anything, a very tight limit on when you can use lethal force. almost never.\n\nIt appears in every search warrant, every operational plan, every ops plan. There is nothing to this. The notion that there's something dangerous, wrong, I'm hesitant to even dignify the assassination talk by even mentioning it, but completely out of line.\n\nIn addition to the state charges in New York, Trump is under indictment in federal court in Florida for what prosecutors say was the former president's retention of classified documents after he left office. Trump also faces criminal charges in two other cases stemming from his attempt to overturn the 2020 presidential election results. He has pleaded not guilty to the 88 counts he faces.", "source": {"uri": "mediaite.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mediaite"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mar-a-Lago", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mar-a-Lago"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_warrant", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Search warrant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elie_Honig", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Elie Honig"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth_Social", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Truth Social"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marjorie_Taylor_Greene", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marjorie Taylor Greene"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classified_information", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Classified information"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempts_to_overturn_the_2020_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Attempts to overturn the 2020 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_judiciary_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal judiciary of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquittal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Acquittal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indictment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indictment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://www.mediaite.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Screen-Shot-2024-05-21-at-7.29.04-PM.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9587575", "eventUri": "eng-9587575", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.01960784313725483, "wgt": 143, "relevance": 1}

Let's start with the latter.\n\nThe former president, referencing newly available materials, claimed by way of his social media platform that the Justice Department \"AUTHORIZED THE FBI TO USE DEADLY (LETHAL) FORCE\" while executing a court-approved search warrant at Mar-a-Lago. This, according to Trump, is proof that President Joe Biden is \"MENTALLY UNFIT TO HOLD OFFICE.\"\n\nIt wasn't at all clear how or why the Republican made this leap, but his allies were similarly hysterical. Rep. Paul Gosar of Arizona, for example, claimed that the incumbent Democratic president \"ordered the hit on Trump at Mar-a-Lago.\" Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia added that the Justice Department and the FBI had plans to \"assassinate\" the former president. Even some Fox News personalities parroted the line.\n\nTrump even issued an outlandish fundraising appeal, falsely claiming that Biden was \"locked & loaded\" and \"ready to take me out\" during the FBI's search of his glorified country club.\n\nAll of this was utterly bonkers. As NBC News reported, Trump and allies appeared to be misconstruing \"standard operating procedure at the FBI.\" In fact, the bureau took the unusual step of issuing a public statement yesterday, explaining reality, and leaving no doubt that the former president and his allies simply had no idea what they were talking about.\n\nBut as truly ridiculous as the Republican rhetoric was, it would be a mistake to assume that there were no revelations of note in the newly unsealed court documents. NBC News also reported:\n\nThe timeline of events helps clarify matters. In the spring of 2022, the Justice Department subpoenaed Trump, directing him to return the documents he took. In June 2022, the Republican's attorneys insisted to law enforcement that there were no classified materials at Mar-a-Lago.\n\nWhen Trump refused to comply with the subpoena, and his lawyer's claims proved false, the FBI showed up at the venue in August 2022 to retrieve the classified documents the former president wasn't supposed to have. In December 2022, Trump's legal team arranged for a sweep of the Republican's properties to ensure there were no remaining sensitive documents in his possession.\n\nIt was at that point when personnel found even more classified documents -- in Trump's bedroom. U.S. District Judge Beryl Howell wondered how, exactly, this happened, and in a 2023 ruling, she wrote, \"Notably, no excuse is provided as to how the former president could miss the classified-marked documents found in his own bedroom at Mar-a-Lago.\"\n\nIn case this weren't quite enough, a Politico report went on to note, \"In a footnote, Howell also noted that another Trump adviser connected to his Save America PAC had acknowledged scanning the contents of the box that contained the classified materials in 2021 and storing them on a personal laptop provided by the PAC.\"\n\nThere's a reason the former president and his allies were fixated on absurd \"assassination\" claims: They were no doubt aware that the reality-based revelations from yesterday made Trump look even worse.", "source":

Julie Kelly has the DETAILS HERE.\n\nI am not surprised in the least. Remember, the objective of the FBI raid was to resecure the physical evidence that President Trump had showing how the DOJ and FBI action in 2016 was targeting him using the power of their law enforcement and intelligence agencies. The origination of all the DOJ/FBI/IC issues goes back to the '15/'16 FBI exploitation of the NSA database; this is not a contested discussion issue - it's just continually forgotten.\n\nThe FBI was using their access to the NSA metadata of all Americans, to conduct surveillance on political candidates that might be a threat to the power structures that exploited the secrets within the electronic records of all Americans. The FBI was/is conducting domestic surveillance and tracking just like the German Stasi or Soviet KGB. It's still happening, but we are not supposed to remember or something.\n\nThe raid on Mar-a-Lago, just like the Robert Mueller investigation, was part of the long standing coverup operation. The FBI was looking for what Trump took with him as evidence of the weaponized system that targeted him. The FBI wanted that back. The FBI was willing to use deadly force to get it back if that's what it took.\n\nThe raid involved 25 Miami FBI agents, four Washington FBI agents, one unidentified individual from FBI Headquarters, one DOJ attorney, and the assistant U.S. Attorney from the Southern District of Florida. (MORE)\n\nYes, apparently the FBI was prepared to engage in a gun battle or kill people in Mar-a-Lago in order to retake the evidence against them. I know it sounds scarey, but that's the reality of our modern FBI. These are not good people. Remember also that AG Merrick Garland said he authorized every facet of the raid.\n\nI keep trying to drive the point home, these are not good people.... yet, many refuse to accept, pretend it just can't be that bad, or keep forgetting the real examples that prove how bad the FBI is.\n\nThe modern FBI is the police agency of a weaponized U.S government, with a direct and purposeful mandate to keep the American people under control through strict surveillance and a violent police state.\n\nUnderstand and accept this with great seriousness, there are no honorable \"rank and file\" inside this organization.\n\nEvery member of the FBI is a participant in the weaponization of power and government. The members are jackboots recruited from ideological college campuses for exactly the purpose of supporting a Stasi-like police state.\n\nThrough the past several years, we have discovered how the FBI worked inside Twitter, Facebook and social media to control information, remove content and manipulate opinion on behalf of the U.S. government - all activity political.\n\nWe have also learned the FBI took active measures to suppress information about the Hunter Biden laptop and control any negative consequences for the Biden regime - again, political. These are not disputed realities.\n\nThe U.S. Dept of Justice and FBI are now political institutions that have abandoned their originating mission in order to become the domestic equivalent of the Soviet-era FSB. Their joint targeting mechanisms have been redesigned to support the interests of corrupt DC politicians, specifically the interests of democrats.\n\nIt was in June 2022, when Senator Chuck Grassley sent a letter [pdf HERE] to Attorney General Merrick Garland and FBI Director Chris Wray, notifying them of whistleblower allegations from within the FBI that senior leadership in both Main Justice and FBI are involved in a coordinated effort to cover up criminal activity related to Hunter Biden.\n\nThe whistleblower allegations, in combination with the documented history of DOJ and FBI misconduct, culminate in Senator Grassley stating:\n\n\"If these allegations are true and accurate, the Justice Department and FBI are - and have been - institutionally corrupted to their very core to the point in which the United States Congress and the American people will have no confidence in the equal application of the law. Attorney General Garland and Director Wray, simply put, based on the allegations that I've received from numerous whistleblowers, you have systemic and existential problems within your agencies.\" (LINK)\n\nGrassley was admitting what has been visible for years.\n\nSenator Grassley is telling the corrupt DOJ-FBI leadership that people in the organizations are outlining the detailed behavior of their corrupt leadership. However, with zero oversight involved, and with Democrats in charge of all committees that would be responsible for such oversight, and with institutional media in alignment and agreement with the corrupt institutional intents of the DOJ/FBI, the frustrating question becomes, \"and\"?\n\nI mean, who are we kidding?... If Republicans were in charge of the Senate Judiciary, Reform/Oversight, or Intelligence committees, do we really believe that anything would be different? Before responding to that cynicism remind yourself, they were for four years, January 2015 through January 2019, Republicans were in charge of oversight.\n\nIt was exactly when Republicans were in charge of Main Justice and FBI oversight that Main Justice and FBI were targeting political candidate Donald Trump.\n\nIn July 2021, the DOJ OIG produced an absolutely damning Inspector General investigation of FBI conduct in the rape and sexual assault of U.S. Gymnasts, revealing how FBI agents facilitated Nassar's sex crimes by taking no action despite numerous witness statements to them.\n\nWorse yet, the FBI never reported the sexual assaults to local law enforcement... and to top it off, the rank and vile FBI agents lied during the investigation of their conduct, and the DOJ under AG Bill Barr, and now under AG Merrick Garland, refused to prosecute the FBI liars.\n\nThe entire IG report [Must Read pdf Here] reveals layer-upon-layer of FBI wrongdoing, misconduct and false statements in an effort to cover up their activity when the internal investigation of their conduct began. This report is a total condemnation of the FBI rank and file. It really is quite stunning.", "source": {"uri": "theconservativetreehouse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Last Refuge"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Here are some of the things. This is TPM's Morning Memo. Sign up for the email version.\n\nU.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon has screwed up the Mar-a-Lago case in so many ways it defies easy categorization. Her slow rolling of the trial is obviously her single gravest sin. But there's another layer of malfeasance going on here that came more clearly into view yesterday.\n\nOver the objection of Special Counsel Jack Smith, Cannon ordered the unsealing of previous filings in the case. In some of those filings, it's becoming apparent, Trump has tucked in information about the case that he wants to seed in the public imagination and use as fodder for his presidential campaign and for fighting the criminal charges outside of court.\n\nCannon has given him a green light to do so, and the results became apparent yesterday.\n\nIn one of the filings, Trump drew attention to the FBI's deadly force policy, which was in effect during the search of Mar-a-Lago, as it is in every FBI field operation. As soon as the filing was unsealed, right-wing news outlets seized on it and accused Biden of being responsible for gunning for Trump.\n\nOf course none of this is true. The same deadly force policy that is in effect for every FBI operation was in effect for the Mar-a-Lago search. The FBI doesn't need special authority to use deadly force; it has standing authority to use deadly force when circumstances warrant it. This is a standard operating policy, and Biden had nothing to do with its promulgation in general or its application in the Mar-a-Lago search in particular.\n\nBut you can see the dynamic plainly from what I just had to do to explain this to you: Trump wants to use the criminal justice process to generate more disinformation, Cannon facilitates him doing so with her rulings, right-wing media go apeshit, Trump gooses the reaction some more, and then a day later I come along and try to unpack it all for you, including the underlying falsity, with a put-the-toothpaste-back-in-the-tube futility. The FBI issued an unusual statement in similarly futile fashion.\n\nThis is all bad enough, but there's another even darker layer here: It feeds the right-wing animosity toward federal law enforcement that has already led to two attacks on FBI field offices in the past two years. As former FBI agent Asha Rangappa points out:\n\nCannon's unsealing of court filings in the Mar-a-Lago case is a blunt instrument, and that means it's doesn't yield only good things for Trump.\n\nAmong the new revelations yesterday was a dramatic March 17, 2023 decision from U.S. District Judge Beryl Howell that came during the investigative phase of the Mar-a-Lago case. The 87-page decision, attached as an exhibit to one of Trump's motions, offered new evidence of Trump's obstruction of the effort to retrieve the classified documents that he unlawfully withheld and stowed at Mar-a-Lago.\n\nSo along with the bogus FBI deadly force headlines, Trump got these headlines, too:\n\nThe jury is not supposed to draw any inference from the defendant not testifying in their own defense, but that doesn't mean we can't - especially when the defendant is running for president.\n\nFrom a legal strategy point of view, testifying would have been a disaster. But from a political point of view, not testifying should by all rights be its own disaster.\n\nTrump bragged that he would testify, but we knew he wouldn't and he didn't and now the question is whether he will be held to account for it.\n\nI hate the framing of \"imagine what the reaction would be if [insert name of prior, usually Democratic, president] did this thing Trump did.\" But his failure to testify is exactly the kind of thing that would rightly be hung around the neck of any other presidential candidate from now until Election Day.\n\nIn the meantime, closing arguments are scheduled for Tuesday.\n\nAn unrepresented Rudy Giuliani appeared via video at his arraignment in the Arizona fake electors scheme and pleaded not guilty. Because he had dodged service of the indictment for weeks, Giuliani was required to post a cash bond of $10,000, the only defendant in the case forced to do so.\n\nIn a new filing in Rudy Giuliani's bankruptcy case, he has reached an agreement with Georgia election workers Ruby Freeman and Shaye Moss to cease serially defaming them even after they won a $148 million defamation judgment against him, forcing him into the bankruptcy.\n\nBloomberg's Josh Green:\n\nLaw Dork Chris Geidner found an interesting detail in Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito's Federal Judicial Financial Disclosure report: Last August, at the peak of the Bud Light faux controversy ginned up by the right wing over a trans influencer touting the watery beer, Alito sold some of his Anheuser-Busch stock and on the same day bought Molson Coors stock:\n\nWas that Alito's personal participation in the Bud Light boycott? It's not clear, but it is curious.\n\nAmong the best, most-detailed videos of a tornado ever captured. This was yesterday afternoon in Iowa via a drone.

Who or what is Cyberspace Command?\n\nAnd it's not even a grammatically correct statement.\n\nSo I was extremely skeptical already.\n\nThen I asked Grok, who confirmed my suspicions were correct -- there is no credible evidence of this happening:\n\nLet's be very clear on one thing, this doesn't mean it did NOT happen, it just means this is not credible evidence that it did happen.\n\nI'm not a huge Ron DeSantis fan, but we don't fabricate stories around here -- we report fairly and honestly.\n\nIn a related story, I reported earlier today that we DID learn this today:\n\nWe just learned more information about the FBI's raid on Mar-a-Lago, and it's not good.\n\nThanks to U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon unsealing many documents in the case, we just learned that the FBI authorized the use of Deadly Force during the raid on Mar-a-Lago.\n\nThe documents related to the Mar-a-Lago raid in August 2022 were ordered to be unsealed by U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon. Judge Cannon has been presiding over the case involving former President Donald Trump's handling of classified documents and the FBI's search of his Mar-a-Lago estate. The decision to unseal these documents is part of the legal proceedings and the public's interest in the case, balancing the need for transparency with the need to protect ongoing investigations and national security interests.\n\nBut that wasn't all we learned...\n\nJulie Kelly has been doing some excellent reporting on this and here is a summary of the high points of the newest revelations:\n\nCall me crazy, but if I didn't know any better I would almost think they were HOPING for a confrontation. Looking for one.\n\nOf course, President Trump and his staff was far too wise and far too calm and collected to give that to them.\n\nMAGA is the side of peace!\n\nIf you'd like to see more of the unsealed documents, here is a good link: https://www.lawfaremedia.org/current-projects/the-trump-trials/trump-prosecuted-in-the-southern-district-of-florida/docket-watch-trump-prosecuted-in-the-southern-district-of-florida\n\nWe'll continue to monitor the story and bring you updates.", "source": {"uri": "100percentfedup.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "100 Percent Fed Up"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mar-a-Lago", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mar-a-Lago"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_New_York", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Governor of New York"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_DeSantis", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ron DeSantis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laura_Loomer", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Laura Loomer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_states_and_blue_states", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Red states and blue states"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aileen_Cannon", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aileen Cannon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_district_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States district court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_America_Great_Again", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Make America Great Again"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://100percentfedup.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/ron-desantis-trump-1200x630-1-1600x900.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9587575", "eventUri": "eng-9587575", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 137, "relevance": 1}

Pick just about any try-hard MAGA loser you can think of and what are they doing? Either farting on their fingers and smelling them, spreading this lie, or (likely) both.\n\nAs is so often the case, this lie came directly from the criminal's babbling gullet. Trump upchucked onto his failing Truth Social site yesterday:\n\nYou can tell Trump wrote that one himself because he's bitching like the feeble old man he is about the temperature in the courtroom, and also the functionally illiterate use of capital letters. The \"reports\" he was referring to are newly unsealed documents that show that -- surprise! -- Trump's lawyers found more stolen classified documents AFTER the Mar-a-Lago search, IN HIS BEDROOM. (We'll have more on that!)\n\nEverybody, let's scream about Biden ordering Trump assassinated instead!\n\nAs Heather Cox Richardson explains, Trump's campaign followed up with an email with the subject line \"They were authorized to shoot me -- I nearly escaped death.\" The body read: \"Joe Biden was locked & loaded ready to take me out & put my family in danger.... But here's the one thing they don't know: WE WILL NEVER SURRENDER!\" (Astute commenter notes that \"nearly escaped death\" would mean he was killed. So that's hilarious.)\n\nSo that's where that started. (Actually it appears to have REALLY started with a bugfuck conspiracy theorist named Julie Kelly, whereupon it made its way up Trump's and the RNC's assholes in record time.)\n\nIs there even a shred of truth in it? Nah.\n\nAs ABC News reporter Katherine Faulders explains, the documents Trump is referring to say nothing more than that the FBI followed its own standard policies when it conducted the Mar-a-Lago search. Former FBI assistant director Frank Figliuzzi tweeted, \"Yep, every FBI operations order contains a reminder of FBI deadly force policy. Even for a search warrant. Deadly force is always authorized if the required threat presents itself.\"\n\nNBC News adds quotes from some complete wingnuts who happen to know better on this subject:\n\nEven right-wing former FBI agents who regularly criticize the bureau pushed back on the focus on the FBI protocols, calling the documents \"boilerplate,\" \"nothing out of the ordinary,\" and \"a giant nothing\" burger (using a hamburger emoji), in posts on X. \"The hyperbole and emotion over this is ridiculous, especially considering legitimate reasons to question the MAL raid,\" wrote Garret O'Boyle, who previously testified before a House subcommittee led by top Trump ally, Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio.\n\nHere's a real kicker for you: Trump wasn't even at Mar-a-Lago the day it was raided, and the FBI knew that. (Now go back and read that Trump campaign email about I NEARLY ESCAPED DEATH! and just marvel.)\n\nBut this new lie is so insidious that the FBI itself felt the need to release a statement of clarification, a sort of Dear Pigfucks letter to the mouthbreathers:\n\nAnd surprise, the MAGA liars are now lying about the FBI's clarification, saying it makes it even worse, and that people saying otherwise are gaslighting you:\n\nIt's everywhere. Chirping anger muppet Maria Bartiromo is chirping angrily about it on Fox Business. Judge Jeanine \"Boxwine\" Pirro is sloshing it around in her glass. The entire MAGA-sphere.\n\nThis sort of lying works because the people stupid enough to respect people like Mike Davis, Jack Posobiec, Marjorie Taylor Greene, and Paul Gosar are also too monumentally stupid to figure out the truth on their own. If they tried to Do Their Own Research they'd just end up on some other MAGA incel's YouTube listening to them agree with these others that yes, Joe Biden personally ordered Donald Trump assassinated. (And of course, this is all built on the MAGA brainworm delusion that Joe Biden is in the Oval Office personally directing witch hunts against Trump.)\n\nPeople like Davis, Posobiec, Pirro, Bartiromo, Gosar, the congresswoman with the six B's know they don't have even one follower smart enough to check their work. And that's extremely charitably assuming that those people are smart enough to know what lies they're spreading. They may not be, especially in the case of Greene and Gosar, who often play the role of both propagandist and the mark. (Pirro should know better. Baritiromo, eh probably not, she's a fucking moron.)\n\nThe point is that the contempt MAGA has for its own voters is, as ever, breathtaking.\n\nOne more thing: Remember that with Trump and with MAGA, every accusation is a confession. Remember that Trump absolutely wants to use a second presidential term to go after his enemies, and that his lawyers are at the Supreme Court asking them to establish that he has the right to have his rivals assassinated.\n\nTrump literally wanted to execute the person who leaked that he was a big fucking chickenshit baby who hides in the White House bunker when there are protesters outside. He literally wants to execute people who embarrass him, who laugh at him, who expose him for the weakass loser he is.\n\nRemember that. That's who he is, and that's who his squealing impotent pig followers are. It's all projection.\n\nI have profiles those other places but I think I forgot how to log on.", "source": {"uri": "wonkette.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Wonkette"}, "authors": [{"uri":

The report added that the agents at the scene were instructed to wear unmarked polo or collared shirts and bring standard-issue weapons, ammunition, handcuffs and bolt cutters. Trump faces a total of 91 charges in four criminal cases in what he has characterized as an attempt by Democrats and the establishment in the United States to prevent him from being reelected.", "source": {"uri": "sputnikglobe.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sputnik International"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mar-a-Lago", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mar-a-Lago"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutionality", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Constitutionality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Witch-hunt", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Witch-hunt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coming_out", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coming out"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_impeachment_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal impeachment in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth_Social", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Truth Social"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marjorie_Taylor_Greene", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marjorie Taylor Greene"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merrick_Garland", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Merrick Garland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty-fifth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Director_of_the_Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Attorney_General", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Attorney General"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newsweek", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Newsweek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/images/sharing/article/eng/1118572943.jpg?11170466441716334114", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9587575", "eventUri": "eng-9587575", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 130, "relevance": 1}

Marjorie Taylor Greene went absolutely bonkers with a theory-asserted like everything else MTG theorizes as stone-cold fact-that the Biden administration was not only \"planning to assassinate [ex-President Donald] Trump,\" but actually \"gave the green light\" for doing so when Trump's Mar-a-Lago compound was raided in the 2022 search for classified documents Trump absconded with leading to criminal charges:\n\nBut if any of these members of Congress had taken a moment to contact either the Department of Justice or anyone with a federal law enforcement background, they could have had their concerns allayed in about two sentences. As reported by the Phil Anschutz-owned Washington Examiner:\n\nOn Tuesday, the FBI released a statement saying its language authorizing deadly force was standard protocol.\n\n\"The FBI followed standard protocol in this search as we do for all search warrants, which includes a standard policy statement limiting the use of deadly force,\" the agency said. \"No one ordered additional steps to be taken and there was no departure from the norm in this matter.\"\n\nAs it turns out, the language in the search warrant of Mar-a-Lago supposedly authorizing \"deadly force\" was entirely boilerplate and would apply in any felony federal warrant. There's absolutely nothing in this routine language in a search warrant executed by sworn federal law enforcement to suggest a plot to assassinate Donald Trump.\n\nEspecially since, as MTG, Boebert, and Gosar forgot to mention:\n\nThe operations order further shows how agents were well aware Trump would not be present at the property during the search, as it was carried out during Mar-a-Lago's off-season when Trump normally resides at his property in Bedminster, New Jersey.\n\nTrump was a thousand miles away. The warrant was executed when authorities knew Trump would not be on the premises.\n\nThe real problem here, of course, is that Trump is very unhappy to be on the wrong side of the criminal justice system. Rep. Boebert, herself no stranger to the criminal justice system, should at least be able to understand that felony search warrants are by definition backed up with the threat of force.\n\nThere was a time when even the fringes of the debate were more careful.

But Joe Biden had classified documents from his days as senator and vice president, and there was no raid. And Mike Pence had documents from his vice presidency and there was no raid.\n\nPerhaps the target was a binder including documents from the government's Crossfire Hurricane investigation, that fabricated claim that the Trump campaign in 2016 was colluding with Russians, a claim that was sponsored by Democrats involved in failed presidential bid by Hillary Clinton, claims that were later debunked by special counsel Robert Mueller.\n\nGet the hottest, most important news stories on the Internet - delivered FREE to your inbox as soon as they break! Take just 30 seconds and sign up for WND's Email News Alerts!\n\nA report at the Gateway Pundit pointed out sources, months ago, charged that that \"missing top-secret binder\" that could link Barack Obama directly to the conspiracy against Trump, was being sought.\n\n\"This document is rumored to contain damning evidence of former President Barack Obama's CIA's involvement in initiating the Russia collusion narrative against President Trump. Fox News host Jesse Watters discussed these details on his show, citing reporting by investigative journalists Michael Schellenberger and Matt Taibbi,\" the report said.\n\nThe Pundit report noted Trump had declassified a binder in 2021 that \"contains hundreds of pages about the Crossfire Hurricane scandal. It contains damaging information about the corrupt actors involved with our government. Two different DOJ attorney generals have defied President Trump's direct lawful order to publish the binder in the Federal Register.\"\n\nThe report said the DOJ made redactions, then sent the binder to the White House, but then insisted on more redactions.\n\n\"Hours before Trump left office on January 20th, Chief of Staff Mark Meadows gave the binder back to the DOJ, along with this memo. He asked the DOJ to make any Privacy Act redactions 'out of an abundance of caution.' In the memo, he asks them to expeditiously release the binder when finished. Meadows foolishly expected this would take 3-4 days. It's over three years now and it's still not released. Just the News recently obtained the Meadows memo from the National Archives, who also denied having a copy of the declassified binder,\" the report said.\n\nThe Pundit said, \"Meadows admitted in interviews that various agencies often stalled or defied Trump's orders. Meadows knew better than to rely on the DOJ to release this damaging binder after they left the White House. He should have released the binder to the public himself. But in doing so, there was a chance he would become a target of the DOJ and FBI.\"\n\nPreviously investigative reporter Paul Sperry documented how the federal bureaucracy was meeting with Trump's staff about documents and things seemed \"copasetic.\" But then something changed, as if the FBI \"had PERSONAL stake\" in search.\n\nThe report noted the \"Biden regime\" took photos of binders in Melania Trump's room.\n\nJulie Kelly reported, \"There are dozens of photos taken out of Melania's Room, and several taken out of Barron's Room. I don't know exactly what they were. It just refers to the location. But what? And there's actually, and I'm going to be posting this in Mike Davis, your ears are going to be burning as soon as I say this, there are probably 15 citations of pictures of binders in Melania Trump's suite. 'Binder,' that's the word that they use. Now, I know what Mike Davis is going to say, which is what he's been saying from the beginning, that this whole thing was based on trying to retrieve Trump's copy of the Crossfire Hurricane's document. So what were they doing in Melania's suite? And why were they taking pictures of binders that she had in her bedroom? So that again.\"\n\nThe FBI has claimed its \"deadly force\" authorization was a standard form included in all of its raids.\n\nTrump's response was blunt: \"Wow! I just came out of the Biden Witch Hunt Trial in Manhattan, the \"Icebox,\" and was shown Reports that Crooked Joe Biden's DOJ, in their Illegal and Unconstitutional Raid of Mar-a-Lago, AUTHORIZED THE FBI TO USE DEADLY (LETHAL) FORCE. NOW WE KNOW, FOR SURE, THAT JOE BIDEN IS A SERIOUS THREAT TO DEMOCRACY. HE IS MENTALLY UNFIT TO HOLD OFFICE - 25th AMENDMENT!\"\n\nThe FBI's shocking raid on Trump's home remains one of the stunners of the Joe Biden era in that agency.\n\nOfficers marched onto the property, demanded compliance with their orders for privacy and a video security system, scattered government documents on the floor and photographed them, and then took boxes and boxes - apparently snatching some of Trump's private belongings.\n\nThis all happened because the leftists at the National Archives apparently colluded with the Biden White House to assemble a criminal case against Trump - at a time when his representatives apparently were trying to work out all of the disputes that were involved in ownership of documents from his presidency.\n\nInvestigative journalist Julie Kelly, who has pursued the misbehaviors of the Biden administration diligently, revealed the FBI agenda and authorization to use \"deadly force when necessary.\"\n\nTwitchy explained, \"It sounds like the FBI and other government officials went into Mar-a-Lago like they were going on the Bin Laden raid. But wait, it gets even worse.\"\n\n'Don't buy the B.S.': FBI has absurd excuse for Mar-a-Lago 'lethal force'\n\nFor 25 years, WND has boldly brought you the news that really matters.

After court adjourned for the day, the ex-president spoke to reporters and again slammed the case against him. He continued his tirade on Truth Social, where he baselessly claimed that the Department of Justice \"AUTHORIZED THE FBI TO USE DEADLY (LETHAL) FORCE\" during the FBI's execution of a search warrant at the property in August 2022. The search turned up boxes of government documents Trump took with him upon leaving office. He has been charged with willfully retaining classified documents and has pleaded not guilty.\n\nThe former president was not at Mar-a-Lago when the search warrant was served.\n\nGreene seized on Trump's wild accusation and asserted that the Biden administration tried to kill the former president. She even took credit for Trump's claim by suggesting she told him about the alleged plot.\n\n\"I made sure that he knew,\" she wrote on social media. \"The Biden DOJ and FBI were planning to assassinate Pres Trump and gave the green light.

Meanwhile, Trump's MAGA media supporters ginned up a counternarrative based on a credulous reading of a deceptive argument from Trump's lawyers that was included in the unsealed documents.\n\nThe story that emerged from the right-wing media echo chamber posits that pro forma language provided to FBI agents before the 2022 search which stated that \"law enforcement officers of the Department of Justice may use deadly force when necessary\" was actually part of a Biden scheme to assassinate Trump. This is both a horrific accusation to make without evidence and facially absurd for any number of reasons. (Why would the Biden administration issue assassination orders in writing and then conduct the Mar-a-Lago search on a date specifically selected because Trump would be in New York instead?) But it spread quickly from its initiation by a key figure in the right's January 6 disinformation community, through the ranks of MAGA influencers, to Trump himself, and then to the Fox News airwaves.\n\n*snip*", "source": {"uri": "democraticunderground.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Democratic Underground"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspiracy_theory", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Conspiracy theory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mar-a-Lago", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mar-a-Lago"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classified_information", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Classified information"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fox News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_America_Great_Again", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Make America Great Again"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echo_chamber_(media)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Echo chamber (media)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_celebrity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Internet celebrity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disinformation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Disinformation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right-wing_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Right-wing politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assassination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual_Property", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual Property", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Unsolved", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Unsolved", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 81}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9587575", "eventUri": "eng-9587575", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-01-06", "textStart": 1861, "textEnd": 1870}], "sentiment": -0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 125, "relevance": 1}

At this point, the joke of a Georgian congresswoman isn't so much commenting on current affairs as writing a high fantasy novel one tweet at a time.\n\nThe latest mind-boggling band wagon she's hopped on to, taking her on a non-stop trip to Crazytown? That President Biden and the FBI were trying to assassinate Donald Trump when the federal authorities searched Mar-a-Lago for classified documents in August 2022. Blame Trump himself for spreading this ridiculous claim around first, although Marj was all to happy to squawk about it herself, like a politically inept parrot.\n\nFor context, unsealed court filings have revealed official documentation from the search, with one passage reading \"Law enforcement officers for the Department of Justice may use deadly force when necessary.\" This caused Trump himself to blow up (well, not literally -- if only) on Truth Social, claiming that Biden had authorized the FBI to use \"DEADLY (LETHAL) FORCE\" on him during the \"UnConstitutional Raid\" on Mar-a-Lago.\n\nClearly a man with such a strong grasp of the English language and punctuation cannot be mistaken, so MTG dutifully started tweeting about it too, going so far as to claim that \"The Biden DOJ and FBI were planning to assassinate Pres Trump and gave the green light.\"\n\nHere's the thing, though: the \"deadly force\" line is standard FBI procedure, used on documentation relating to all incidents like this and was not some special, underhanded request from Biden. In fact, it's employed in a a bid to limit fatalities, not ensure them.\n\nIronically, Taylor Greene's own flagrant falsehoods were assassinated themselves, all thanks to X's Community Notes feature. The fact-checking service slapped Greene's tweet with an addendum reading, \"This is false. Neither the DOJ nor the FBI were planning to assassinate Mr. Trump. That language in question is standard procedure.\"\n\nIn other words, \"Please pay no attention to the screeching doomsayer with the bleach blonde bad built butch body.\"\n\nMTG is probably feeling pretty betrayed now, given that Community Notes is a favorite feature of her old pal, Elon Musk, who she's previously allied with on the app for various offensive endeavors. There's not a lot we can be thankful for about what Musk has done to Twitter, but at least the rise of fact-checking on the site has been a useful addition, and now it's led to this deliciously embarrassing moment for Marjorie.\n\nUnfortunately, we know all too well by now that the MAGA minions don't exactly back down in the face of iron-clad facts, so we might continue to hear more about these nonsensical claims from Trump and co. in the future. One commenter to Greene's tweet put it best, though, when reasoning how we know the FBI never tried to assassinate him: \"He's not dead.

The exact nature of these documents has not been disclosed, but they are believed to contain highly classified information critical to national security.\n\nAccording to multiple sources within the Biden administration, the decision to authorize the use of deadly force was made as a precautionary measure to ensure the safety of the FBI agents involved in the operation. This authorization was not taken lightly and was deemed necessary due to the potential risks associated with retrieving such sensitive information.\n\nA senior administration official explained, \"The safety of our law enforcement officers is paramount. Given the nature of the materials in question, the authorization was a necessary and prudent measure.\" The official emphasized that the decision was based on standard protocols for handling high-risk operations involving classified materials.\n\nPolitical reactions\n\nFormer President Trump has been vocal in his criticism of the Biden administration's decision, calling it \"an unprecedented and unwarranted escalation.\" Trump argued that the authorization of deadly force was excessive and politically motivated. He stated, \"This is a clear example of the lengths to which the Biden administration will go to target their political opponents.\"\n\nSupporters of Trump have echoed his sentiments, calling for greater accountability and transparency regarding the decision-making process. They argue that the use of deadly force in such a situation sets a dangerous precedent and could be seen as a politically motivated attack on a former president.\n\nOn the other hand, officials from the Biden administration have defended the decision, arguing that it was necessary to protect the agents involved in the operation. They have pointed out that the retrieval of highly classified materials poses significant risks, and the authorization of deadly force was a precautionary measure to mitigate those risks.\n\nA senior administration official stated, \"The decision was made with the utmost consideration for the safety of our agents. In situations involving highly classified information, we must be prepared for any eventuality.\"\n\nLegal and political implications\n\nThe raid on Mar-a-Lago and the authorization of deadly force have significant legal and political implications. The investigation into Trump's handling of classified documents is ongoing, and both sides are preparing for potential legal battles. The decision to authorize deadly force adds another layer of complexity to the already contentious relationship between the Biden administration and Trump.\n\nLegal experts are divided on the implications of this authorization.

And I genuinely hope he does that.\"\n\nThe comments in her first public speech since leaving the race are another signal of the GOP's virtually complete consolidation of support behind Trump, even from those who have labeled him a threat in the past.\n\nHaley shut down her own bid for the GOP nomination two months ago but did not immediately endorse Trump, having accused him of causing chaos and disregarding the importance of US alliances abroad as well as questioning whether Trump, 77, was too old to be president again.\n\nTrump, in turn, repeatedly mocked her with the nickname \"Birdbrain,\" though he curtailed those attacks after securing enough delegates in March to become the presumptive Republican nominee.\n\nTrump's campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Haley's announcement.\n\nPresident Biden's campaign, meanwhile, has been working to win over her supporters, whom they view as true swing voters. Biden's team is quietly organizing a Republicans for Biden group, which will eventually include dedicated staff and focus on the hundreds of thousands of Haley voters in each battleground state, according to people familiar with the plans but not authorized to discuss them publicly.\n\nAssociated Press\n\nThe Senate confirmed President Biden's 200th judicial nominee Wednesday, a significant milestone for Democratic and White House efforts to remake a federal court system that grew increasingly conservative under President Donald Trump.\n\nMagistrate Judge Angela Martinez, who previously served as an assistant US attorney, was approved to become a federal judge in the District of Arizona in a 66-28 vote, with 45 Democrats, three independents, and 18 Republicans voting in favor. She brings additional ethnic and gender diversity to a cohort of judges nominated by Biden that includes more women, people of color, and LGBTQ individuals than those nominated by any other president in US history.\n\n\"Judges matter. These men and women have the power to uphold basic rights or to roll them back,\" Biden said in a statement following the vote. \"They hear cases that decide whether women have the freedom to make their own reproductive health care decisions; whether Americans have the freedom to cast their ballots; whether workers have the freedom to unionize and make a living wage for their families; and whether children have the freedom to breathe clean air and drink clean water.\"\n\nMore than four years have passed since Biden promised to appoint judges who reflect the diversity of the United States as part of his presidential campaign's pitch to Black voters. Since then, the Senate has confirmed 200 of his judicial nominees.\n\nThey include Judges Zahid N. Quraishi, the first Muslim to sit on a federal district bench; Nusrat Choudhury, the first Muslim woman to serve as federal judge; Nancy Abudu, the first Black woman to serve on the US Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit; Sara Hill, a member of Cherokee Nation and Oklahoma's first Native American federal judge; Irma Carrillo Ramirez, the daughter of Mexican immigrants and the first Latina judge on the US Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit; Jerry Edwards, first Black federal judge in the Western District of Louisiana; and Amanda Brailsford, the first woman to serve as district court judge in Idaho.\n\nBiden's barrier-breaking nominees also include Supreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, the first Black woman to sit on the nation's highest court.\n\nWashington Post\n\nDonald Trump on Tuesday falsely claimed in a campaign fund-raising email that President Biden was \"locked & loaded ready to take me out\" during a 2022 search of his Mar-a-Lago estate for classified documents, an extraordinary distortion of a standard FBI policy on the use of deadly force during such operations.\n\nTrump appeared to be referring to a law enforcement document, released Tuesday in court filings in the classified documents case, that describes the FBI's plans for a court-authorized search on Aug. 8, 2022, at Mar-a-Lago, his Florida residence and private club.\n\nFBI agents recovered classified material from Trump's time in the White House -- which the former president is now charged with illegally retaining. One page in the document includes a \"policy statement\" on the use of deadly force, which says officers may resort to lethal force only when the subject of such force poses an \"imminent danger of death or serious physical injury\" to an officer or another person.\n\nTrump, the presumptive GOP nominee for president, and some of his allies suggested Tuesday that this was evidence that Biden's Justice Department was prepared to fatally shoot him. In fact, Trump was not at his Florida property the day of the search. FBI agents specifically sought to avoid a confrontation with Trump, choosing a day when Trump would not be at the property and giving the Secret Service a heads-up, The Washington Post previously reported.\n\nA former president falsely accusing his successor and rival of posing a threat to his life is without precedent in modern US history. The comments marked a sharp escalation of Trump's baseless attacks on Biden, as the former president faces 88 criminal charges across four indictments in federal and state courts. Trump has frequently accused Biden of weaponizing the legal system against him in coordination with the Justice Department and local prosecutors. There is no evidence of such coordination.\n\nWashington Post\n\nLOS ANGELES -- Hunter Biden is scheduled to stand trial on federal tax charges in September after a judge on Wednesday granted his request to delay the California trial that had been approaching next month.\n\nUS District Judge Mark C. Scarsi agreed to delay the trial until Sept. 5, citing the \"needs of the defendant\" to prepare for the trial. President Biden's son is still scheduled to stand trial beginning June 3 on federal gun charges in a separate case in Delaware.\n\nHe has pleaded not guilty to both indictments, which his lawyers have claimed are politically motivated. Both cases are being overseen by judges who were nominated to the bench by then-President Donald Trump, a Republican who is running to unseat the Democratic president in November.\n\nThe trials will add to an already acrimonious presidential election as Trump's allies again seize on embarrassing details from the younger Biden's troubled life to attack his father, even as Trump faces his own legal problems. Trump is charged in four criminal cases, including a hush money trial underway in New York.\n\nHunter Biden's lawyers told the judge they cannot adequately prepare for both trials at the same time, and they noted the \"uniquely challenging and high-profile nature\" of the prosecution.", "source": {"uri": "bostonglobe.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Boston Globe"}, "authors": [],

Hazardous-materials teams from the U.S. Capitol Police were called in to address the situation.\n\nThe police cleared the suspicious package, which included two vials of blood and leaking ice packs, before 10 a.m. EDT, Politico reported. The vials were sealed. It was unclear whether any additional message accompanied the vials, other than Trump's name.\n\nTrump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, is expected to accept the party's nomination at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee in July. Trump all but secured the nomination in March, completing a sweep of early-voting states' GOP primaries, and winning all but one of the Super Tuesday primaries.\n\nIn the subsequent months, Trump and his campaign have worked to align his campaign with the RNC.

I have seen justice and injustice in China, Russia, Ukraine, England, France, Italy, Israel, as well as in nearly 40 of our 50 states\" he said in a Tuesday New York Post column.\n\n\"But in my 60 years as a lawyer and law professor, I have never seen a spectacle such as the one I observed sitting in the front row of the courthouse yesterday.\"\n\nDershowitz reported that Merchan routinely excluded obviously relevant evidence offered by the defense, while permitting the inclusion of irrelevant but salacious evidence for the prosecution.\n\nBut perhaps the most outrageous incident was when Merchan completely lost his composure and cleared the courtroom because a defense witness, attorney Robert Costello, raised his eyebrows in reaction to one of the judge's insane rulings.\n\n\"The judge actually threatened to strike all of Costello's testimony if he raised his eyebrows again,\" Dershowitz said.\n\nHe concluded that \"The judge's threat was absolutely outrageous, unethical, unlawful and petty,\" adding, that he \"revealed his utter contempt for the defense and anyone who testified for the defendant.\"\n\nMercian later refused to permit the testimony of a federal election official, who would have testified that the alleged \"hush money\" scheme did not amount to a violation of federal election law, contrary to the prosecution's theory.\n\nBut what may have been worse was revealed yesterday, when previously-sealed files related to the Mar-a-Lago raid were unsealed and released in Trump's \"classified documents\" case.\n\nMar-a-Lago is the permanent Florida residence of the former president and his family, as well as a private club and resort.\n\nInvestigative reporter Julie Kelly called the new documents \"mind-blowing\" -- and that may've been an understatement.\n\n\"FBI authorized the use of deadly force at Mar-a-Lago,\" she said.\n\n\"Oh my God,\" Kelly continued. \"Armed FBI agents were preparing to confront Trump and even engage Secret Service if necessary.\"\n\nThe FBI was also authorized to search the rooms of the resort's guests.\n\n\"They were going to go door to door to terrorize MAL guests and even pick the locks,\" she reported. \"Gestapo.\"\n\nUnder the heading \"Contingencies\" the filings said that \"Should [former President of the United States] arrive at [Mar-a-Lago], FBI MM EM and OSCs will be prepared to engage with [former President of the United States] and [U.S. Secret Service] Security Team.\"\n\nSurmised Brianna Lyman, reporting for The Federalist, \"MM may be a reference to the Miami FBI office, and OSC appears to refer to the office of Special Counsel Jack Smith,\" who filed the criminal \"classified documents\" case against Trump.\n\nUnder the heading \"Policy Statement,\" the filing said, \"Law enforcement officers of the Department of Justice may use deadly force when necessary.\"\n\nSo who would approve the use of deadly force against a former president and his Secret Service detail?\n\nKelly jogged our memories on that one.\n\n\"Recall who authorized the raid,\" Kelly said: \"Merrick Garland\" -- the attorney general of the United States, who very nearly became a U.S. Supreme Court justice, if former President Barack Obama had had his way.\n\nAll this to win an election?\n\nMaybe instead, Democrats should consider nominating qualified candidates instead of dimwits, halfwits, and nitwits.\n\nSo how did we get from Ronald Reagan's description of America as a \"shining city on a hill\" to a banana republic that uses Gestapo tactics against our political enemies?\n\nWhat sort of person would allow this to happen?\n\nThat would be the sort of person who would keep his biggest political rival tied up in court, offer condolences to Iran for the death of \"the Butcher of Tehran,\" and tell a young, eager, graduating class of African Americans that America hates them, that's who.\n\nAnd if we don't return to that \"shining city on a hill\" after the next election, we'll soon be reminiscing about those bygone days when people were free and government feared the people.\n\nMichael Dorstewitz is a retired lawyer and has been a frequent contributor to Newsmax.

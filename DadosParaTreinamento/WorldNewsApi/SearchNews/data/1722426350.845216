Brandsegg-Nyg\u00e5rd is the first Norwegian selected in the first round of the NHL draft. The native of Oslo has been playing in Sweden's second league and is earmarked to spend the 2024-25 season with Skelleftea\u030a in the top-rated Swedish Hockey League. There, he'll be teammates with fellow Red Wings prospect Axel Sandin Pellikka. Brandsegg-Nyg\u00e5rd, 18, is already 6 feet 1 and 207 pounds. He shoots right, which is always in demand. He's known for being a hard worker, and regularly strives to be a difference-maker. Brandsegg-Nyga\u030ard registered eight goals and 10 assists for Mora in HockeyAllsvensken in 2023-24. He has a better scoring touch than his stats suggest, though and he's the type of player whose efforts may not necessarily show up on a scoring sheet, in the way he works down low and has a hand in creating offensive opportunities. REACTION: Red Wings draft pick of Michael Brandsegg-Nyg\u00e5rd ripped by ESPN host John Buccigross The event was held at Sphere, the 18,600-seat auditorium marketed for its immersive video and audio capabilities. It's the last time teams will all be under the same roof for a draft, as next year the NHL will move to a decentralized model to allow for remote participation. It\u2019s also the third straight draft in which general manager Steve Yzerman has selected a forward in the first round, following the picks of Marco Kasper at No. 8 in 2022 and Nate Danielson at No. 9 in 2023. Kasper made his NHL debut with a lone game in the 2022-23 season. Kasper spent last season with the Grand Rapids Griffins of the AHL, posting 14 goals and 21 assists in 71 games, while Danielson spent his age-19 season in juniors, scoring 12 goals and adding 19 assists in 28 games with the Portland Winterhawks of the WHL. THE BIG PICTURE: 2024 NHL draft presents chance for Red Wings to improve team now and in future Boston University\u2019s Macklin Celebrini was the No. 1 overall pick Friday night in Las Vegas, selected by the San Jose Sharks earlier Friday night. Celebrini was followed by Michigan State defenseman Artyom Levshunov at No. 2 to the Chicago Blackhawks. The state of Michigan placed another player in the top 10 when Saginaw Spirit defenseman Zayne Parekh was selected by the Calgary Flames with the No. 9 overall pick. The NHL draft continues at 11:30 a.m. Saturday, with the Red Wings possessing seven additional draft picks: Nos. 47, 80, 126, 144, 176, 203 and 208.

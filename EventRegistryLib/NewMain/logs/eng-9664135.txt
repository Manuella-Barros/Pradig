Wednesday's opponents got off to a much better start in Group A, beating Hungary 3-1 in Cologne.\n\nThat's where Scotland's game will be played after Germany take on Hungary earlier in the day. That follows a crucial game in Group B, as Croatia look to recover from their bruising 3-0 loss to Spain on Saturday when they play underdogs Albania.\n\nLuka Modric and co find will view the game as a must-win, especially being in the group of death. A high-scoring victory against Albania would put them in the mix to qualify as at least one of the four best third-placed teams, but that's just what Albania will be hoping for after their narrow 2-1 defeat to Italy.\n\nMost of the UK's eyes will, of course, be on how Scotland fare, as boss Steve Clarke is demanding a reaction to their Deutschland demolition. \"I think if we show we are a good team and play as we can play we can get a result in the Swiss game that takes us to the last game. That's what we have to do,\" Clarke said.\n\n\"Of course we are disappointed. Of course we want to put it right. But we have a strong dressing room, big personalities. We have to show those big personalities on Wednesday night.\"\n\nHere's how to watch Wednesday's three matches in the UK.\n\nWednesday's Euro 2024 fixtures Croatia vs Albania - 2pm, Hamburg Germany vs Hungary - 5pm, Stuttgart Scotland vs Swtizerland - 8pm, Cologne\n\nYour turn! Will Scotland respond with a win over Switzerland? Let us know your score prediction in the comments section\n\nWhich TV channels are the fixtures on?\n\nITV will broadcast the first game on Wednesday: Croatia's clash with Albania. Each team lost their opener in Group B, so there's pressure to pick up a point or three in Hamburg. Fans can watch on ITV1 and via ITVX.\n\nThe BBC then take control of broadcasting. Both Germany against Hungary and Scotland versus Switzerland will be shown live on BBC One and iPlayer.\n\nOdds for Wednesday's Euro 2024 fixtures\n\nCroatia vs Albania\n\nCroatia 4/9 Draw 31/10 Albania 6/1\n\nGermany vs Hungary\n\nGermany 2/9 Draw 19/4 Hungary 21/2\n\nScotland vs Switzerland\n\nScotland 16/5 Draw 12/5 Switzerland 5/6\n\n*Odds provided by BetVictor may change, 18+\n\nJoin our new WhatsApp community and receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

You could see the euphoria in the stadium.\"\n\nHungary's hopes of progressing now hang by a thread, while group rivals Switzerland and Scotland played out a 1-1 stalemate in Wednesday's late match in Cologne.\n\n- 'Good reaction' -\n\nScotland, backed by a large and noisy support, went ahead early on when Callum McGregor cut the ball back for Scott McTominay to score with a shot that went in via a big touch off Fabian Schaer.\n\nHowever, Switzerland equalised when Xherdan Shaqiri pounced on a stray pass by Anthony Ralston to smash a superb first-time strike high into the net.\n\nThe Swiss saw Dan Ndoye miss a glorious second-half opportunity and Breel Embolo have a goal disallowed for offside, but Scotland deserved the draw which keeps their hopes alive.\n\nThey might even have won the game, with Grant Hanley hitting the post from a late header.\n\n\"The players knew what they needed to do. I thought it was a good team performance against a good opponent,\" said Scotland boss Steve Clarke.\n\n\"It was a good reaction to a disappointing night and we are still alive in the tournament.\"\n\nMore from this section Central China farmers face crop failures in 'withering' drought New mystery monolith appears in Nevada desert Two brand-new pools unveiled at Harry S. Truman High School\n\nSwitzerland, quarter-finalists at Euro 2020, may already have enough points to progress but a draw against Germany on Sunday will make sure of second place.\n\nScotland, who have not won a match at a major tournament since beating the Swiss 1-0 at Euro 96, can still qualify with a win over Hungary in Stuttgart.\n\n- Gjasula saves Albania -\n\nElsewhere, Albania's Klaus Gjasula scored at both ends, including a dramatic injury-time equaliser as his side drew 2-2 with Croatia in Hamburg.\n\nAfter a disappointing 3-0 loss to Spain in their opening game in Group B, Croatia were behind again when Qazim Laci gave Albania an early lead.\n\nBut Croatia improved after the break and Andrej Kramaric levelled with 16 minutes remaining, before Gjasula put through his own net.\n\nThe Albania midfielder became the last-gasp saviour, though, slotting into the bottom corner in the fifth minute of injury time to snatch his team a point.\n\nCroatia, World Cup semi-finalists in 2022, will now likely need to win their final Group B match against holders Italy on June 24 to reach the knockout phase for a fifth straight major tournament.\n\n\"We will believe until the very end, to give our best as we did in this match,\" said forward Kramaric.\n\n\"Unfortunately we didn't win but we hope to be a bit luckier against Italy.\"\n\nAlbania have won plenty of plaudits with their performances against both Italy, in a 2-1 defeat, and Croatia, but could not hold a lead in either game and will probably have to beat Spain to keep their last-16 hopes alive.\n\n\"We have to go forward but we have to fight for every single point,\" said Albania's Brazilian coach, Sylvinho.\n\n\"It's important for our lives, the life of the country, the federation. I'm proud of the players so we have to enjoy the moment.\"\n\nGroup rivals Spain and Italy meet in Gelsenkirchen in the standout tie on Thursday, while England face Denmark and Slovenia take on Serbia

afternoon.\n\nHaving been beaten in their Euro 2024 openers last weekend, the two teams will aim to stay in contention for a place in the tournament's knockout phase.\n\nWe say: Croatia 2-1 Albania\n\nThe stakes are already high in these nations' second Group B contest, as defeat would almost certainly mean elimination from Euro 2024.\n\nWhile they did not impress in their opener, Croatia's vast experience should see them past a committed Albania side that may well be bound for the exit.\n\n> Click here to read our full preview for this match\n\n> How Albania could line up

hosts Germany square off with Hungary in Wednesday's Group A battle at the MHPArena in Stuttgart.\n\nJulian Nagelsmann's men became record-breakers in a 5-1 thrashing of Scotland on the opening day, while their Hungarian foes were put to the sword 3-1 by Switzerland.\n\nWe say: Germany 3-0 Hungary\n\nAs Hungary's game with Switzerland wore on, Rossi's men belatedly sprung into life - although the damage had already been done - and were a dangerous proposition from crosses, which is where Scotland nabbed their consolation from on Friday.\n\nHowever, the prolific German attacking forces should be expected to overwhelm the Magyars, even if recent results in this head-to-head have not gone the hosts' way, and Nagelsmann's side should ease to the victory that will punch their ticket to the knockouts.\n\n> Click here to read our full preview for this match\n\n> How Hungary could line up against Germany\n\n> How Germany could line up against Hungary\n\nScotland vs. Switzerland (Wednesday, 8.00pm)\n\nHaving suffered the heaviest-ever opening defeat at the men's European Championships, Scotland seek to restore a sense of pride on Wednesday, when they resume Euro 2024 Group A against Switzerland in Cologne.\n\nAfter Steve Clarke's men were embarrassed 5-1 by tournament hosts Germany, their Rossocrociati counterparts managed to avoid the same fate by defeating Hungary 3-1.\n\nWe say: Scotland 0-2 Switzerland\n\nScotland's attackers barely saw the ball against Germany, partly thanks to Die Mannschaft's brilliant display and partly due to their perpetually sloppy passing, and a sturdy Swiss side will not give too much away either.\n\nWhile Yakin's men did go to sleep briefly against Hungary, their three points were merited, and we can only envisage Switzerland sealing their top-two placement while inflicting familiar Euros misery on the Scots.\n\n> Click here to read our full preview for this match\n\n> How Switzerland could line up against Scotland\n\n> How Scotland

Their 3-1 loss at Euro 2024 was a thrilling watch from start to finish, with the result failing to dampen the spirits of a national team and its boisterous fans who had been waiting for this day for more than 30 years.\n\nMeanwhile, fan zones in Cologne were closed on Tuesday ahead of Scotland's match with Switzerland following a severe weather warning. Read the full story here.\n\nToday's matchesCroatia vs Albania (Group B, Volksparkstadion) 2pm, ITVGermany vs Hungary (Group A, MHPArena) 5pm, BBC OneScotland vs Switzerland (Group A, Cologne Stadium) 8pm, BBC OnePredictions\n\nCroatia vs Albania\n\nBoth sides head into their second group game having suffered defeats against Spain and Italy respectively on Saturday. Croatia's vast experience should be enough to see them past Albania in what is likely to be a tight and cagey affair.\n\nVerdict: 2-1\n\nGermany vs Hungary\n\nGermany will be full of confidence after their victory over Scotland and they can make it two wins from two. The hosts looked fluid and free-scoring in their first major tournament game under Julian Nagelsmann and are expected to continue that form against Hungary. They are expected to secure their place in the knockout stages with a comfortable victory in Stuttgart.\n\nVerdict: 3-0\n\nScotland vs Switzerland\n\nScotland are in search of their first points at Euro 2024 but will need to improve on Friday's performance against Germany to stand a chance. Defeat for Steve Clarke's side is unthinkable but Switzerland are a good side - they showed their class against Hungary and have a good track record at tournaments. Murat Yakin's side will be keen to kick on and look solid odds on-favourites to stay on the winning trail at Euro 2024.\n\nVerdict: 0-2\n\nWhat are they saying (Croatia)\n\nCroatia head coach Zlatko Dalic has vowed to take nothing for granted as his side bid to belatedly kick-start their Euro campaign against Albania in Hamburg.\n\nAn opening 3-0 defeat to Spain in Group B has raised the stakes for Dalic's men with a final group game against favourites Italy still to come.\n\nBut Albania's gutsy display against the Italians - in which they scored after just 23 seconds before falling to gutsy 2-1 defeat - has made it clear to Dalic that his side face another difficult test.\n\nDalic told a press conference: \"Albania may not be of the same quality as Spain but they deserve a lot of respect.\n\n\"They are motivated and organised, so we need to be patient and cautious. We know our goal is to win and we will be more offensive. We want to improve. Even against Spain, we had possession and created more chances, but now we need to be even better.\"\n\nWhat are they saying (Germany)\n\nGermany might have the youngest coach of the European Championship, but it also has the oldest squad.\n\nMuch has been made of Julian Nagelsmann ushering in a new generation of exciting talent and the likes of Florian Wirtz (21), Jamal Musiala (21) and Kai Havertz (25) picked Scotland apart in Germany's 5-1 opening win at Euro 2024.\n\nBut - based on the average age of the squads - Germany has the oldest group at the tournament, with 10 of the 26 members aged 30 or older.\n\n\"It's always good to have a good mix in your team between experienced players and young, talented players,\" Nagelsmann said on the eve of his team's second match of Euro 2024, against Hungary. \"I think it's important that the young players are open minded, listen to the older players with experience, to improve.\n\n\"We have some experienced players in the squad. They have all experienced different situations, have solutions for different situations, especially when you talk about pressure, when you talk about situations to deal with on the pitch and off the pitch.\"\n\nLatest newsFan zones closed by heavy storms ahead of Tartan Army invasion\n\nScotland face Switzerland in Cologne on Wednesday where tens of thousands of supporters are expected.\n\nBut their experience threatens to be a washout after the weather warnings prompted officials to close the fan zones where matches were due to be shown on the big screens on Tuesday.\n\nThere are also closures of fan zones and viewing areas in Dortmund, where Turkey are playing against Georgia on Tuesday. Tens of thousands of Turkish supporters are believed to have made their way to Dortmund over recent days.\n\nDortmund's city website has called on supporters to stay at home if they do not have tickets for the match, which kicks off at 6pm local time.\n\nLocal reports have suggested there is even a possibility of isolated tornadoes striking the area, with large hailstones expected to rain down.\n\nThe German weather service has warned that as much as 35 litres of rainfall per square metre could fall within a few hours.\n\nCologne's official social media account issued a warning of its own on Tuesday morning, saying: \"Cologne, it's going to be uncomfortable. The German Weather Service (DWD) has predicted severe weather, heavy thunderstorms and storms for today.\n\n\"Therefore, we have to cancel all events for today! We hope that we can celebrate together again tomorrow, Wednesday! Take care of yourselves!\"\n\nA Rhine ferry service has also been suspended as a result of the weather warnings.\n\nThe expectation is that, while rain could hit Cologne again on Wednesday, the conditions will not be as severe as on Tuesday. It is therefore hoped that the weather will have no impact on Scotland's match against Switzerland.\n\nKey tournament dates\n\nThe group stage runs until June 26, with the knockouts starting three days later on June 29.\n\nRound of 16: June 29-July 2\n\nQuarter-finals: July 5-6\n\nSemi-finals: July 9-10\n\nFinal: July 14\n\nWhere is it?\n\nThe tournament is being held in Germany, with 10 host cities: Dortmund, Hamburg, Berlin, Leipzig, Munich, Stuttgart, Frankfurt, Cologne, D\u00fcsseldorf and Gelsenkirchen.\n\nEuro 2024 teams\n\nA total of 24 teams are competing at the tournament. Poland, Ukraine and Georgia were the last to confirm their places, via the play-offs.\n\nHow to watch Euro 2024 on TV\n\nThe BBC and ITV/STV are sharing broadcast rights for the European Championship in the United Kingdom.\n\nThe BBC showed England's opening win against Serbia and will broadcast their clash with Denmark after ITV banked on Gareth Southgate's men reaching at least the semi-finals.\n\nITV picked England's potentially-decisive final Group C game against Slovenia, plus any last-16 fixture involving the Three Lions and any semi-final.\n\nThe BBC will show any England quarter-final, with both channels - as always - sharing the final.\n\nThe opening match of the tournament between Scotland and hosts Germany was on ITV, with the BBC picking the Scots' other Group A games, against Switzerland and Hungary.\n\nWhere to watch Euro 2024: TV channel and streaming schedule for every matchBBC vs ITV at Euro 2024: Battle of the broadcasters - our verdictFixtures, results, groups and brackets\n\nEuro 2024 fixtures and results can be found via our Euro 2024 hub.\n\nHow many subs are allowed at Euro 2024?\n\nAs was the case for Euro 2020, each side can make five substitutes per match, with each team allowed a maximum of three stoppages to make their changes during the game (excluding half-time and other match delays).\n\nAn update on the last tournament is the fact managers can make a sixth change if a knockout match goes to extra-time.\n\nEuro 2024 tickets\n\nFans can apply for tickets for any team via the Uefa Euro 2024 ticket portal.\n\nWho are the favourites to win Euro 2024?France: 4/1England: 7/2Germany: 9/2Portugal: 6/1Spain: 15/2Italy: 16/1Netherlands: 16/1Belgium: 25/1Croatia: 40/1Switzerland 50/1Scotland: 200/1\n\nBetting on Euro 2024?

Their 3-1 loss at Euro 2024 was a thrilling watch from start to finish, with the result failing to dampen the spirits of a national team and its boisterous fans who had been waiting for this day for more than 30 years.\n\nMeanwhile, fan zones in Cologne were closed on Tuesday ahead of Scotland's match with Switzerland following a severe weather warning. Read the full story here.\n\nCroatia vs Albania\n\nBoth sides head into their second group game having suffered defeats against Spain and Italy respectively on Saturday. Croatia's vast experience should be enough to see them past Albania in what is likely to be a tight and cagey affair.\n\nVerdict: 2-1\n\nGermany vs Hungary\n\nGermany will be full of confidence after their victory over Scotland and they can make it two wins from two. The hosts looked fluid and free-scoring in their first major tournament game under Julian Nagelsmann and are expected to continue that form against Hungary. They are expected to secure their place in the knockout stages with a comfortable victory in Stuttgart.\n\nVerdict: 3-0\n\nScotland vs Switzerland\n\nScotland are in search of their first points at Euro 2024 but will need to improve on Friday's performance against Germany to stand a chance. Defeat for Steve Clarke's side is unthinkable but Switzerland are a good side - they showed their class against Hungary and have a good track record at tournaments. Murat Yakin's side will be keen to kick on and look solid odds on-favourites to stay on the winning trail at Euro 2024.\n\nVerdict: 0-2\n\nCroatia head coach Zlatko Dalic has vowed to take nothing for granted as his side bid to belatedly kick-start their Euro campaign against Albania in Hamburg.\n\nAn opening 3-0 defeat to Spain in Group B has raised the stakes for Dalic's men with a final group game against favourites Italy still to come.\n\nBut Albania's gutsy display against the Italians - in which they scored after just 23 seconds before falling to gutsy 2-1 defeat - has made it clear to Dalic that his side face another difficult test.\n\nDalic told a press conference: \"Albania may not be of the same quality as Spain but they deserve a lot of respect.\n\n\"They are motivated and organised, so we need to be patient and cautious. We know our goal is to win and we will be more offensive. We want to improve. Even against Spain, we had possession and created more chances, but now we need to be even better.\"\n\nGermany might have the youngest coach of the European Championship, but it also has the oldest squad.\n\nMuch has been made of Julian Nagelsmann ushering in a new generation of exciting talent and the likes of Florian Wirtz (21), Jamal Musiala (21) and Kai Havertz (25) picked Scotland apart in Germany's 5-1 opening win at Euro 2024.\n\nBut - based on the average age of the squads - Germany has the oldest group at the tournament, with 10 of the 26 members aged 30 or older.\n\n\"It's always good to have a good mix in your team between experienced players and young, talented players,\" Nagelsmann said on the eve of his team's second match of Euro 2024, against Hungary. \"I think it's important that the young players are open minded, listen to the older players with experience, to improve.\n\n\"We have some experienced players in the squad. They have all experienced different situations, have solutions for different situations, especially when you talk about pressure, when you talk about situations to deal with on the pitch and off the pitch.\"\n\nScotland face Switzerland in Cologne on Wednesday where tens of thousands of supporters are expected.\n\nBut their experience threatens to be a washout after the weather warnings prompted officials to close the fan zones where matches were due to be shown on the big screens on Tuesday.\n\nThere are also closures of fan zones and viewing areas in Dortmund, where Turkey are playing against Georgia on Tuesday. Tens of thousands of Turkish supporters are believed to have made their way to Dortmund over recent days.\n\nDortmund's city website has called on supporters to stay at home if they do not have tickets for the match, which kicks off at 6pm local time.\n\nLocal reports have suggested there is even a possibility of isolated tornadoes striking the area, with large hailstones expected to rain down.\n\nThe German weather service has warned that as much as 35 litres of rainfall per square metre could fall within a few hours.\n\nCologne's official social media account issued a warning of its own on Tuesday morning, saying: \"Cologne, it's going to be uncomfortable. The German Weather Service (DWD) has predicted severe weather, heavy thunderstorms and storms for today.\n\n\"Therefore, we have to cancel all events for today! We hope that we can celebrate together again tomorrow, Wednesday! Take care of yourselves!\"\n\nA Rhine ferry service has also been suspended as a result of the weather warnings.\n\nThe expectation is that, while rain could hit Cologne again on Wednesday, the conditions will not be as severe as on Tuesday. It is therefore hoped that the weather will have no impact on Scotland's match against Switzerland.\n\nThe group stage runs until June 26, with the knockouts starting three days later on June 29.\n\nRound of 16: June 29-July 2\n\nQuarter-finals: July 5-6\n\nSemi-finals: July 9-10\n\nFinal: July 14\n\nThe tournament is being held in Germany, with 10 host cities: Dortmund, Hamburg, Berlin, Leipzig, Munich, Stuttgart, Frankfurt, Cologne, D\u00fcsseldorf and Gelsenkirchen.\n\nA total of 24 teams are competing at the tournament. Poland, Ukraine and Georgia were the last to confirm their places, via the play-offs.\n\nThe BBC and ITV/STV are sharing broadcast rights for the European Championship in the United Kingdom.\n\nThe BBC showed England's opening win against Serbia and will broadcast their clash with Denmark after ITV banked on Gareth Southgate's men reaching at least the semi-finals.\n\nITV picked England's potentially-decisive final Group C game against Slovenia, plus any last-16 fixture involving the Three Lions and any semi-final.\n\nThe BBC will show any England quarter-final, with both channels - as always - sharing the final.\n\nThe opening match of the tournament between Scotland and hosts Germany was on ITV, with the BBC picking the Scots' other Group A games, against Switzerland and Hungary.\n\nEuro 2024 fixtures and results can be found via our Euro 2024 hub.\n\nAs was the case for Euro 2020, each side can make five substitutes per match, with each team allowed a maximum of three stoppages to make their changes during the game (excluding half-time and other match delays).\n\nAn update on the last tournament is the fact managers can make a sixth change if a knockout match goes to extra-time.", "source": {"uri": "ca.sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports Canada"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type":

How to watch? What to look out for?", "body": "Sports Mole rounds up everything you need to know about today's Euro 2024 action, including fixtures, predicted lineups, how to watch and the best storylines.\n\nyou have updates\n\nMere weeks after a gruelling domestic season concluded for the continent's most celebrated talents, 24 teams and over 600 players are now going again with Euro 2024 supremacy at stake.\n\nOnly three years have passed since Italy's exhilarating run to glory at the delayed Euro 2020 tournament, culminating in their penalty-shootout success over England at Wembley in the final, and the Azzurri are present in Germany to defend their crown after their World Cup 2022 failure.\n\nHowever, the likes of England, France, Spain, Portugal, the Netherlands and hosts Germany will be among the leading contenders to dethrone Italy as kings of Europe, where the new continental champions will be crowned in Berlin on July 14.\n\nHere, Sports Mole rounds up everything you need to know about today's Euro 2024 action, including which teams are in action, how to watch and what to keep a particular eye out for.\n\nTODAY'S EURO 2024 FIXTURES\n\nCroatia vs. Albania (2pm | Volksparkstadion)\n\nGermany vs. Hungary (5pm | MHPArena)\n\nScotland vs. Switzerland (8pm | RheinEnergieStadion)\n\nWith all nations at Euro 2024 having now completed their opening fixtures, round two commences on Wednesday, where Group B rivals Croatia and Albania both endeavour to bounce back from their dampening defeats in the afternoon kickoff.\n\nA Group A double-header then takes precedence, where hosts Germany welcome Hungary to the MHPArena in Stuttgart, before Scotland and Switzerland close out the day's action in Cologne.\n\nTODAY'S PREDICTED LINEUPS AT EURO 2024\n\nCroatia: Livakovic; Stanisic, Sutalo, Gvardiol, Sosa; Modric, Sucic, Kovacic; Majer, Budimir, Kramaric\n\nAlbania: Strakosha; Hysaj, Ajeti, Djimsiti, Mitaj; Asllani, Ramadani; Laci, Bajrami, Hoxha; Broja\n\nGermany: Neuer; Kimmich, Tah, Rudiger, Mittelstadt; Andrich, Kroos; Musiala, Gundogan, Wirtz; Havertz\n\nHungary: Gulacsi; Orban, Lang, Szalai; Bolla, Nagy, Schafer, Kerkez; Sallai, Szoboszlai; Varga\n\nScotland: Gunn; Hendry, Hanley, Tierney; Ralston, Gilmour, McTominay, Robertson; McGinn, Christie; Shankland\n\nSwitzerland: Sommer; Schar, Akanji, Rodriguez; Widmer, Xhaka, Freuler, Aebischer; Vargas, Ndoye; Duah\n\nHOW TO WATCH TODAY'S EURO 2024 ACTION\n\nITV1 and ITVX - in addition to STV and the STV Player - is the place to be for Croatia's clash with Albania, for which coverage begins at 1pm and ends at 4.15pm.\n\nBoth Group A contests will subsequently be shown on BBC 1, BBC iPlayer and the BBC Sport Website, which hosts Germany vs. Hungary from 4.30pm to 7pm, before Scotland's battle with Swizterland between 7.30pm and 10.30pm\n\nWHAT TO LOOK OUT FOR IN TODAY'S EURO 2024 MATCHES\n\nCroatia vs. Albania\n\nBoth victims of agonising opening defeats, Croatia were humbled in a 3-0 loss to Spain and arguably need to put things right more than Albania, whose 2-1 loss to Italy was not so disastrous by their standards.\n\nMidfielder Nedim Bajrami even managed to score the quickest men's goal that the Euros has ever seen - timed at 23 seconds - before the reigning champions fought back, and their superior goal difference to Croatia means that they currently hold third place in the rankings.\n\nHowever, with both sides on zero points, defeat for either could spell the end of their Euros journey prematurely, and Wednesday's battle will also see the two nations clash for the very first time in the men's game.\n\nExpect to see Luka Modric man the Chequered Ones' midfield once more, while Josko Gvardiol might earn a recall to the XI too, but there are rumours that fulcrum Marcelo Brozovic could be demoted to the bench.\n\nGermany vs. Hungary\n\nRecords tumbled at the feet of Germany's young guns and old guard during their 5-1 dismantling of Scotland in the inaugural fixture of the tournament, which represented the biggest-ever opening win that the men's tournament has ever seen.\n\nAs well as scoring the first goal of the tournament, Florian Wirtz's effort saw him become the youngest German man to strike at the European Championships, while Ilkay Gundogan managed to escape a nasty injury after a red-card worthy tackle from Ryan Porteous.\n\nThe Barcelona lynchpin is expected to form part of an unchanged lineup for the tournament hosts, who will be guaranteed a top-two finish should they prevail in Stuttgart, whereas Hungary have some more work to do.\n\nThe Magyars briefly showed some bite in their battle with Switzerland but ultimately lost 3-1 to sit third in the section, meaning that defeat could spell the end of their chances of last-16 qualification via a top-two finish.\n\nHowever, Marco Rossi's men took four points off Germany in the last Nations League cycle and also held Die Mannschaft to a draw in Euro 2020, so the tie is certainly not a foregone conclusion from the first whistle.\n\nScotland vs. Switzerland\n\nSubjected to an Allianz Arena annihilation last week, Scotland's shoddy display halted the party of the Tartan Army, who may be catching an early flight home if their side fail to drastically change their fortunes in Cologne.\n\nNow on a run of just one win from their last 10 games, Steve Clarke's men must find a way to cope with Porteous's suspension - the Watford man has been banned for two games and will miss the rest of the group stage - and a couple of changes further forward may be in order too.\n\nIn contrast, Switzerland are just one win away from confirming their last-16 place thanks to their beating of Hungary, where Breel Embolo - who made just five appearances for Monaco last season due to an ACL injury - popped up with an injury-time lob.\n\nWhether the 27-year-old's contribution justifies risking him from the first whistle is up to Murat Yakin's discretion, but even though Switzerland bested Scotland in a 2006 friendly, the Rossocrociati lost 1-0 to their opponents at Euro 96, which just so happens to be Scotland's most recent win at the Championships.\n\nWHAT HAPPENED YESTERDAY AT EURO 2024?\n\nOnly two contests took place on Tuesday, where the first round of fixtures concluded with Turkey's battle with Georgia and Portugal's showdown with the Czech Republic in Group F.\n\nThe former contest was certainly a worthwhile watch, as Turkey triumphed 3-1 - thanks in no small part to a wonder strike from Real Madrid star Arda Guler - while Georgia spurned some glorious chances to claw their way back into the tie before Kerem Akturkoglu rolled the insurance goal into an empty net.\n\nA couple of hours later, the Czech Republic dug incredibly deep defensively to keep Portugal at arm's length and looked set to pull off the latest Euro 2024 shock when Lukas Provod smashed in a stunning opener just past the hour mark.\n\nHowever, Portugal were only behind for all of seven minutes - the Selecao's pressure eventually led to Robin Hranac turning the ball into his own net - and not long after a Diogo Jota winner was disallowed, Porto's Sergio Conceicao completed a wonderful comeback in the second minute of injury time.\n\nWhile Cristiano Ronaldo did not get onto the scoresheet, the 39-year-old still added yet another record to his ever-growing list, becoming the first man to appear at six separate European Championships.\n\nbody check tags ::", "source": {"uri": "amp.sportsmole.co.uk", "dataType": "news",

They'll be aware that they are potentially still able to qualify in third but a surprise win against Germany would set them up nicely for a vital final group match against Scotland.\n\nFollow all the latest news and match action in our live blog below, after coverage of Croatia v Albania:\n\nIf the start to 2006 was a famous \"summer fairytale\" for Germany, this could be the beginning of an even better story. It doesn't want for youthful joy, either, as witnessed by the standing ovation for Jamal Musiala. For Scotland, there was only grim reality. There were some familiarities to that, too.\n\nThey at least had something like a belated shot, and a goal, to at least make this 5-1. It could really have been so much worse. It couldn't have gone much better for Germany. This opening game of Euro 2024 had the feel of a properly big event beforehand, as illustrated by Sir Alex Ferguson's message before a raucous Flower of Scotland, but he had to witness an occasion that solely became about how big the defeat would be. Scotland were fortunate to escape with a mere four-goal loss. Everyone else was fortunate to witness Musiala.\n\nThere was a real symbolism to how he and the effervescent Florian Wirtz both scored to win the game in the opening 20 minutes, particularly with the sheer abandon of Musiala's strike. The 21-year-old - to use head coach Julian Nagelsmann's line before the game - certainly rocked. This was the impetuous arrival of a brilliant new German generation, but they were already away before the opposition even had time to think. That might be a common feeling by the end of this tournament, as Nagelsmann's thrillingly synchronised team announced themselves as proper contenders.\n\nJamal Musiala signals the arrival of new Germany with thrashing of Scotland\n\nJamal Musiala and Florian Wirtz starred as Germany made the perfect start to their Euro 2024 campaign, thrashing sorry Scotland 5-1 in Munich\n\nJulian Nagelsmann's side now head to Dortmund to take on Hungary, who beat Germany away from home in the Nations League two years ago.\n\nBut Hungary have ground to make up if they are to reach the knockout stages, and were beaten 3-1 by Switzerland in their opening fixture.\n\nHere's everything you need to know ahead of the Group A match.\n\nIs Germany vs Hungary on TV? Channel, time and how to watch tonight\n\n11:11 , Jack Rathborn\n\nIt only took Luka Modric 18 years. In 2006, the summer before Lamine Yamal was born, he was an unused substitute against Brazil at Berlin's Olympiastadion. He didn't quite get on the pitch then - blame manager Zlatko Kranjcar for that one - but a remarkable longevity took him back to Berlin, into historic company. For the Croatia captain, playing in a ninth major tournament meant he joined only Cristiano Ronaldo and Lothar Matthaus among Europeans. A few months before his 39th birthday, he became the oldest ever player at European Championships; though perhaps only for a few days, until Ronaldo and Pepe go past him.\n\nA day of record-breakers, however, became an advertisement for youth, rather than experience. Lamine Yamal, the youngest footballer ever at this level, some 22 years Modric's junior, delivered a star turn. Croatia lost 3-0 to Spain. It wasn't quite as dramatic a case of a glorious career ending at the Olympiastadion as Zinedine Zidane's, later in the 2006 World Cup, but it was a day to prompt questions. Are Croatia, finally, too old? Will time eventually catch up with the timeless Modric, boyish as his physique remains, baggy as the shorts are?\n\nA central-midfield trio with a combined 375 caps can still pass, but perhaps they can't press. As Spain had less of the ball than in the past, Croatia did not get close enough to them. \"We weren't aggressive enough,\" said manager Zlatko Dalic. \"We were too slow and too far from the players.\" He felt the problem was most apparent on the flanks, not his veteran midfield, but a product of ageing can be a reluctance to get closer to younger, faster players. A problem of ageing is that every defeat gets attributed to the possibility of decline. This might simply be \"a bad day\", as Dalic said. Or it could prove something symbolic, the end of an era.\n\nLuka Modric's side slumped to a disappointing 3-0 defeat at the hands of Spain in their Group B opener, and though qualification hopes are very much still alive, it was an alarming performance from the World Cup semi-finalists.\n\nAlbania's tournament couldn't have started more positively, with Nedim Bajrami scoring the quickest goal in tournament history after just 23 seconds. Nevertheless, they went on to lose 2-1 to holders Italy, despite putting in a spirited performance.\n\nThey will know that, despite having arguably the toughest group in the tournament, they have a great chance of making the next round if they can sneak a win against their Balkan neighbours.", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [],

You could see the euphoria in the stadium.\"\n\nHungary's hopes of progressing now hang by a thread, while group rivals Switzerland and Scotland played out a 1-1 stalemate in Wednesday's late match in Cologne.\n\n'Good reaction'\n\nScotland, backed by a large and noisy support, went ahead early on when Callum McGregor cut the ball back for Scott McTominay to score with a shot that went in via a big touch off Fabian Schaer.\n\nHowever, Switzerland equalised when Xherdan Shaqiri pounced on a stray pass by Anthony Ralston to smash a superb first-time strike high into the net.\n\nThe Swiss saw Dan Ndoye miss a glorious second-half opportunity and Breel Embolo have a goal disallowed for offside, but Scotland deserved the draw which keeps their hopes alive.\n\nThey might even have won the game, with Grant Hanley hitting the post from a late header.\n\n\"The players knew what they needed to do. I thought it was a good team performance against a good opponent,\" said Scotland boss Steve Clarke.\n\n\"It was a good reaction to a disappointing night and we are still alive in the tournament.\"\n\nSwitzerland, quarter-finalists at Euro 2020, may already have enough points to progress but a draw against Germany on Sunday will make sure of second place.\n\nScotland, who have not won a match at a major tournament since beating the Swiss 1-0 at Euro 96, can still qualify with a win over Hungary in Stuttgart.\n\nGjasula saves Albania\n\nElsewhere, Albania's Klaus Gjasula scored at both ends, including a dramatic injury-time equaliser as his side drew 2-2 with Croatia in Hamburg.\n\nAfter a disappointing 3-0 loss to Spain in their opening game in Group B, Croatia were behind again when Qazim Laci gave Albania an early lead.\n\nBut Croatia improved after the break and Andrej Kramaric levelled with 16 minutes remaining, before Gjasula put through his own net.\n\nThe Albania midfielder became the last-gasp saviour, though, slotting into the bottom corner in the fifth minute of injury time to snatch his team a point.\n\nCroatia, World Cup semi-finalists in 2022, will now likely need to win their final Group B match against holders Italy on June 24 to reach the knockout phase for a fifth straight major tournament.\n\n\"We will believe until the very end, to give our best as we did in this match,\" said forward Kramaric.\n\n\"Unfortunately we didn't win but we hope to be a bit luckier against Italy.\"\n\nAlbania have won plenty of plaudits with their performances against both Italy, in a 2-1 defeat, and Croatia, but could not hold a lead in either game and will probably have to beat Spain to keep their last-16 hopes alive.\n\n\"We have to go forward but we have to fight for every single point,\" said Albania's Brazilian coach, Sylvinho.\n\n\"It's important for our lives, the life of the country, the federation.

Jamal just stood out, his goalscoring was phenomenal,\" Andrew Martin, Whitgift's director of soccer, said.\n\nMusiala then moved back to Germany in 2019, signing for Bayern Munich.\n\nAt just 17, he became the club's youngest ever Champions League goalscorer and went on to cement his place in Germany's national team, despite previously playing for England's youth teams.\n\nNow considered one of the most exciting attacking midfielders in the world, Musiala has been a stand out performer at Euro 2024, a tournament in which Germany is starting to look very threatening.\n\n\"He's going to lead Germany to glory one day,\" Darmstadt coach Torsten Lieberknecht said earlier this season, after Musiala dismantled his side in a 5-2 loss to Bayern Munich.\n\nGermany will hope to continue its unbeaten run when it faces Switzerland in its final Group A game on Sunday, but one eye will now be on the round of 16.\n\nGroup A: Scotland and Switzerland draw\n\nBoth teams had chances to win the Group A match on Wednesday.\n\nAlexander Scheuber/UEFA/Getty Images\n\nElsewhere in Group A, Scotland and Switzerland battled to a hard-fought 1-1 draw later on Wednesday.\n\nManchester United midfielder Scott McTominay scored the opening goal for Scotland in the 13th minute, his shot taking a huge deflection off Fabian Schar on its way to the goal.\n\nSwitzerland found the equalzier 13 minutes later as Xherdan Shaqiri punished Scotland for some sloppy passing, curing a long-range effort into the top corner after picking up on a loose ball.\n\nBoth teams can still qualify for the knockout stages. Scotland will face Hungary and Switzerland plays Germany on Sunday.\n\nGroup B: Albania rescues dramatic draw\n\nAlbania players celebrate scoring the first goal of the game.\n\nDan Mullan/Getty Images\n\nAlbania scored a stoppage-time equalizer to rescue a 2-2 draw against Croatia on Wednesday, a result which keeps its Euro 2024 campaign alive.\n\nKlaus Gjasula's 95th-minute strike capped off a thrilling encounter inside Hamburg's Volksparkstadion stadium, as this year's European Championships continues to deliver dramatic action and plot twists.\n\nThe No. 66 in FIFA's world rankings, Albania had taken a surprise lead in the first half through Qazim Laci, but Croatia equalized in the 74th minute thanks to Andrej Kramari\u0107's composed finish.\n\nJust two minutes later and Croatia took the lead with the most fortunate of goals. Albania's defenders did well to block a shot but the ball ricocheted off Klaus Gjasula who inadvertently scored the cruellest of own goals.\n\nHaving lost its opening game against Italy, the defeat would have left Albania on the brink of elimination from the tournament, but there was one more twist to come.\n\nWith the clock ticking down, Gjasula redeemed himself in the final moments, leveling the score with a calm finish which sparked jubilant scenes from Albania's traveling fans.\n\nCroatia, ranked 56 places higher than Albania, looked disappointed by the result at full-time but a draw was probably a fair result.\n\nAlbania now sits third in Group B with one point, ahead of Croatia only on goal difference. Italy and Spain are set to play each other in the other group match on Thursday.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional information.", "source": {"uri": "cnn.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Andrej Kramaric equalised with a shot just inside the post.\n\nJust two minutes later Klaus Gjasula was unlucky when Albania tried to clear the ball from the penalty area but it bounced off him and into the net.\n\nThis was the fourth own goal of the tournament.\n\nAt that point, Croatia looked in control but a late surge by Albania changed everything once again as Gjasula redeemed himself by scoring with a low shot in the 95th minute.\n\nCroatia, World Cup semi-finalists in 2022, will now likely need to win their final Group B match against holders Italy on June 24 to reach the knockout phase.\n\nGermany - Hungary: Die Mannschaft reach last 16\n\nWith goals from Jamal Musiala and Ilkay Gundogan, the hosts Germany became the first team to qualify for the last 16 of Euro 2024 after beating Hungary 2-0 in Stuttgart.\n\nGermany unsurprisingly stuck with the same line-up that battered Scotland 5-1 in the first game of the tournament, ending a run of three major finals in which they had lost their opening match.\n\nMeanwhile, Marco Rossi made two changes following Hungary's disappointing 3-1 loss to Switzerland, bringing Marton Dardai into his three-man defence and starting Bendeguz Bolla at right wing-back.\n\nAfter the whistle, Hungary had the first chance of the match when Roland Sallai nipped in behind Joshua Kimmich and could have nabbed a very early goal if Manuel Neuer hadn't rushed out to take the ball off his toe at the edge of the six-yard box.\n\nKai Havertz outmuscled Willi Orban to get to a ball into the Hungary box, only to have his effort saved at point-blank range by Peter Gulasci, who put it out for a corner.\n\nMusiala struck for the second game running midway through the first half. The 21-year-old is now officially the top scorer at the tournament.\n\nGundogan grabbed his side's second on 67 minutes as Germany eased to a second successive win in Group A, making sure they will progress to the knockout phase at least as one of the best third-placed sides.\n\nHungary still have a chance to qualify to the round of 16, granted they earn a win against Scotland in the final group stage game on Sunday.\n\nScotland - Switzerland: Scotland's Euro 2024 hopes still alive\n\nScotland went ahead early on when Manchester United's Scott McTominay -- their top scorer in qualifying -- swept home Callum McGregor's cutback on a counter-attack.\n\nThey were pegged back before half-time when Xherdan Shaqiri received the pass by Anthony Ralston to score with an inswinging curler that planted into the top-left corner, giving Angus Gunn no chance\n\nThe Swiss should have taken the lead just before the hour mark when Dan Ndoye turned Kieran Tierney on the edge of the box. With just the goalkeeper to beat, Ndoye fired wide of goal.\n\nGrant Hanley then headed against the post from a Scotland free kick and Switzerland's Zeki Amdouni headed wide at the far post late on.\n\nThe Scots will go into their final Group A match against Hungary in Stuttgart on Sunday, and a win in their last match of group stage may be just enough to take them to the knockout phase of a major tournament for the first time.

He can do the unexpected in every single situation,\" Germany captain \u0130lkay G\u00fcndo\u011fan said.\n\n\"Maybe he's the most important one at the moment for us and at such a young age as well.\n\n\"And, I love him. He's such a complete player and such a nice guy as well. Very humble. And if he keeps doing his thing, the way he's doing right now, he can be one of the best.\"\n\nMusiala opened the scoring in the 22nd minute with a goal that was furiously protested by Hungary. G\u00fcndo\u011fan had set that up and got on the scoresheet himself in the second half.\n\nMusiala had netted Germany's second goal in the 5-1 opening victory over Scotland on Friday to kick off Euro 2024. Hungary lost 3-1 to Switzerland on Saturday and now face an uphill challenge to advance.\n\n\"He did brilliant in both games,\" Germany coach Julian Nagelsmann said. \"Not only the two goals, I think every situation or offensive proposition is pretty tough for the opponent to defend.\n\n\"I think it's important for him not to deal with the pressure, just to deal with his capability to solve any offensive one-on-one situations ... He should not think about the pressure because he's brilliant in just playing soccer.\"\n\nHungary plays Scotland in the final Group A match on Sunday when Nagelsmann's team takes on Switzerland.\n\nLater, Germany became the first nation to advance to the round of 16 after Scotland and Switzerland played to a 1-1 draw, with Xherdan Shaqiri slamming in a stunning 26th-minute equaliser.\n\n\"He proved tonight that he lives and breathes for moments like these,\" Switzerland coach Murat Yakin said.\n\nScotland had led from the 13th minute when Scott McTominay's shot took a wicked deflection off Fabian Schar to beat Switzerland goalkeeper Yann Sommer.\n\nThe draw leaves Switzerland on four points, second in Group A behind Germany and likely to advance to the round of 16.\n\nIn Group B, Albania substitute Klaus Gjasula scored in the fifth minute of stoppage time to hold World Cup semi-finalists Croatia to a 2-2 draw. Gjasula's own goal, just four minutes after entering the game in the second half, had looked like handing Croatia the win until his late strike.", "source": {"uri": "jamaica-gleaner.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Jamaica Gleaner"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@jamaica-gleaner.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": true}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamal_Musiala", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jamal Musiala"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungary", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hungary"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Hungary"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/\u0130lkay_G\u00fcndo\u011fan", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "\u0130lkay G\u00fcndo\u011fan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_European_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UEFA European Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-elimination_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Single-elimination tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuttgart", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stuttgart"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Stuttgart"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klaus_Gjasula", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Klaus Gjasula"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murat_Yakin", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Murat Yakin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yann_Sommer", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Yann Sommer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xherdan_Shaqiri", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Xherdan Shaqiri"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Own_goal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Own goal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goalkeeper_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Goalkeeper (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_McTominay", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scott McTominay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croatia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Croatia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Croatia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albania", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Albania"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Albania"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Clans_and_Guilds", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Clans and Guilds", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Working_Abroad", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Working Abroad", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Fill_or_Bust", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Fill or Bust", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://jamaica-gleaner.com/sites/default/files/styles/250px/public/media/article_images/2024/06/20/2841129/7992543.jpg?itok=SaybiZnQ", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9664135", "eventUri": "eng-9664135", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4431372549019608, "wgt": 157, "relevance": 1}

The same applies to Hungary who would finish third with victory over the Scots, but can no longer end in second place.\n\nIn Group B, Croatia, World Cup big guns in recent years, continue their struggles at the Euros as they fell to a 2-2 draw against Albania, leaving their qualification hopes hanging by a thread.\n\nFor the second match running, Albania took an early lead, though on this occasion they had to wait until the 11th minute for Qazim Laci\u2019s opener as he headed home Kristjan Asllani\u2019s wonderful ball into the box.\n\nTheir lead lasted until the 74th minute when Andrej Kramaric finished coolly after good work from Ante Budimir \u2013 and the Croatians were ahead two minutes later as Luka Sucic\u2019s shot was deflected off two defenders and then into his own net by Albania\u2019s Klaus Gjasula.\n\nBut it was Gjasula who had the last say with a dramatic equaliser in the fifth minute of stoppage time as he fired into the net from inside the box.\n\nBoth sides will be watching Spain\u2019s clash with Italy closely. Anything other than a draw means all four sides can qualify with a victory in their final match.\n\nThey face Italy in their final match, while Albania go up against Spain.", "source": {"uri": "scmp.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "South China Morning Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungary", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hungary"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Hungary"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/\u0130lkay_G\u00fcndo\u011fan", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "\u0130lkay G\u00fcndo\u011fan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamal_Musiala", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jamal Musiala"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Nations_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Nations League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Bayern_Munich", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FC Bayern Munich"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albania", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Albania"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Albania"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Ralston", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Ralston"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xherdan_Shaqiri", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Xherdan Shaqiri"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angus_Gunn", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Angus Gunn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_McTominay", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scott McTominay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manchester"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manchester"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ante_Budimir", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ante Budimir"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klaus_Gjasula", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Klaus Gjasula"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Own_goal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Own goal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croatia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Croatia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Croatia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Visual_Arts/Drawing", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Visual Arts/Drawing", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Fan Pages", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Gyms", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Gyms", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 63}], "image": "https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/d8/images/canvas/2024/06/20/7b3a371c-a233-4a2a-bc1b-c23c7c7bd167_d1b6e069.jpg?itok=Be2KDc_C", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9664135", "eventUri": "eng-9664135", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 157, "relevance": 1}

Following Friday night's 5-1 defeat to Germany, they have two games left to avoid making it four straight group-stage exits in the competition.\n\nSteve Clarke's men turned plenty of heads in Qualifying Group A, losing just one of eight matches to finish second, six points ahead of Erling Haaland and Martin Odegaard's Norway and four points behind Spain, who they beat 2-0 at Hampden early in the campaign.\n\nScotland have been drawn into Group A at this summer's tournament and next face Switzerland before finishing their group campaign against Hungary.\n\n1-5 Germany (14 June, 8pm BST) - Scotland were two goals down before losing Ryan Porteous to a red card. Kai Havertz scored the resulting penalty before substitutes Niclas Fullkrug and Emre Can added two more. Centre-back Porteous will miss the match against Switzerland and, if the red card is upgraded to a two-match suspension, potentially the final group game against Hungary, which may well be a battle for third.\n\n1-1 Switzerland (19 June, 8pm BST) - The Tartan Army recovered well in their second game and earned a hard-fought point against Switzerland. Scott McTominay's deflected effort put them ahead in Cologne, only for a wonderful strike from Xherdan Shaqiri to cancel that out before half-time.\n\nvs Hungary (23 June, 8pm BST) - Hungary had been in far better form than Switzerland over the past couple of years. Prior to a pre-Euros friendly defeat vs Republic of Ireland, they were unbeaten in their last 14 matches, dating back to September 2022. Then they conceded three goals for the first time in three years. If Germany vs Hungary follows the odds, Scotland may see this match as their best chance to seal third place and a potential route to the knockout stage.\n\nLast 16: If Scotland somehow win Group A, they will face the runner-up of Group C in the round of 16. Most likely this will be Denmark or Serbia (or perhaps Slovenia).\n\nQuarter-finals: They would next meet the winner of the match between the winner of Group B or one of the third-placed finishers. The likelihood is stacked in the favour of the Group B winners, who could be Spain. Italy or Croatia are alternative candidates.\n\nLast 16: They would meet the Group B runner-up in the last 16. That, of course, is the group of death, meaning it could be any one of Spain, Italy or Croatia, or the far less likely prospect of Albania.\n\nAfter losing the first this is perhaps Scotland's most likely route to the knockouts. They would need to be one of the four best third-place teams.\n\nToo much is up in the air to map out a route. The only guarantee here is that the Tartan Army would then meet a group winner in the round of 16. Their most likely opponents would either be the Group B (Spain, Italy, Croatia, Albania) winner, the Group F winner (probably Portugal), or the Group E winner (likely Belgium).\n\nScotland have only ever won two of their nine matches at the European Champions, but at the 2020 edition, they showed they can at least frustrate elite opposition when they drew 0-0 with eventual runners-up England. What's more, their qualifying win against Spain and the campaign to get here overall showed signs of genuine attacking menace, coupled with an ability to close out games when required.\n\nArguably the most obvious roadblock for Scotland is if Scott McTominay doesn't bring his scoring boots. The Manchester United midfielder has been in strong goalscoring form at club level this season, with 12 goals in all competitions, including seven very important strikes in the Premier League.\n\nMcTominay carried that over into qualifying with a very impressive seven goals. Only Harry Kane (8), Kylian Mbappe (9), Cristiano Ronaldo (10) and Romelu Lukaku (14) scored more. Very fine company indeed.\n\nBut what if McTominay can't replicate those sorts of numbers in Germany this summer? John McGinn, another midfielder, was the only other Scottish player to score more than once with three. Among the forwards called up to the most recent national team camp, QPR's Lyndon Dykes was the highest scorer with just nine goals in 36 caps. Then he got injured in training and had to be replaced.\n\nScotland have shown they can make games tight and find defining moments when they need them. But if things go against them early, as with Germany, their ability to pull a result back may be found wanting.\n\nClarke has experimented with a few formations, but 3-4-2-1 seems to be his preferred set-up. Scotland are blessed with some rare depth in the midfield and full-back areas, so this is a system that maximises the quality there, but also allows them to morph into a 5-4-1 when coming under pressure against higher-quality opposition.\n\nExpect to see much of Scotland's play coming down the left, with Kieran Tierney overlapping Andy Robertson, while McGinn and McTominay will share the responsibility of making late runs into the box. Bologna midfielder Lewis Ferguson will be a massive miss in midfield, so the task of keeping the back door shut and trying to add a little composure in possession will likely fall to Brighton's Billy Gilmour.\n\nScotland's qualifying campaign was right up there among their best in decades and that early win over Spain has fans dreaming of what damage they could do in Germany this summer. Even a 4-0 friendly defeat to the Netherlands hasn't dampened their spirits too much, with Scotland matching their illustrious opponents for about 70 minutes before being harshly punished for some missed chances.\n\nThe Scottish media won't pile anywhere near as much pressure on their players as those south of the border, but another group stage exit is likely to, at the very least, cause some reflection and exasperation.", "source": {"uri": "ca.sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports Canada"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Germany ran riot in a 5-1 win over 10-man Scotland in the tournament's first match while Hungary slipped to a 3-1 defeat against Switzerland.\n\nYoung forwards Jamal Musiala and Florian Wirtz gave Germany fans hope that a new era beckons for the national team but they will carry the memory of Hungary winning 1-0 in Leipzig in the Nations League in September 2022.\n\nGermany is winless in its last three meetings against a Hungary side led by young captain Dominik Szoboszlai who was visibly frustrated in its opening defeat in Cologne as the tournament's dark horse failed to get up to speed.\n\nThe 23-year-old did set up a goal for team mate Barnabas Varga and the duo will be key to their team's chances of getting their first points on the board having both grabbed four goals in Hungary's excellent qualifying campaign.\n\nHowever, coach Marco Rossi knows that any of the same sloppiness that was on display from his side against the Swiss will be ruthlessly exploited by the Germans who play with a fluid intensity under manager Julian Nagelsmann.\n\nThe German coach employed Kai Havertz as a front man to draw space for Wirtz and Musiala to drive at defenders either side, a system likely to be used again as the team seek to wrap up a spot in the knockout stage.\n\nHowever, Nagelsmann is wary of Hungary's relationist system - where players are free to dictate the play between each other using their individual talents, rather than sticking to a positional doctrine and rigid formation.\n\nThe Tartan Army's party was the talk of the town before Scotland had the honour of kicking off the first match of this year's European Championships, but the celebrations of their ardent supporters were quickly curtailed as a glorious German outfit ripped Clarke's meek men to shreds in Munich.\n\nAlready rooted to fourth place in the Group A standings after Friday's chastening experience, Scotland will be out of top-two contention with a defeat - no matter the scoreline in Germany and Hungary's battle - and will be more or less consigned to the same fate with a draw, but Clarke's men still have 180 minutes to save their Euros bacon.\n\nWhile Scotland were left to dissect a lacklustre showing at the Allianz Arena, Switzerland deservedly went into the break two goals to the good against Hungary.\n\nScotland's attackers barely saw the ball against Germany, partly thanks to Die Mannschaft's brilliant display and partly due to their perpetually sloppy passing, and a sturdy Swiss side will not give too much away either.\n\nWhile Yakin's men did go to sleep briefly against Hungary, their three points were merited, and we can only envisage Switzerland sealing their top-two placement while inflicting familiar Euros misery on the Scots.\n\nHaving been beaten in their Euro 2024 openers last weekend, the two teams will aim to stay in contention for a place in the tournament's knockout phase.\n\nTipped by some pundits to finally bring home some silverware this summer, Croatia started their seventh European Championship appearance - and sixth in succession - with a humbling 3-0 defeat to Spain in Berlin.\n\nInstead, Croatia must try to arrest a decline featuring three defeats from their last five competitive matches, having also been beaten by Turkey and Wales in qualifying - that is as many losses as throughout the previous 29.\n\nWhile Croatia are seasoned campaigners at the Euros, this summer marks only Albania's second appearance since gaining independence - both coming in the last three editions.\n\nWhile the Croatian camp has yet to report any fresh injuries, Albania forward Jasir Asani is a major doubt due to an ankle problem. Therefore, Germany-born Arber Hoxha - who plays his club football for Dinamo Zagreb - may be promoted from the bench.\n\nEither Rey Manaj or Chelsea's Armando Broja should spearhead the Albanian attack, as Sokol Cikalleshi - a regular fixture during qualifying - was omitted from Sylvinho's squad and subsequently announced his international retirement.\n\nOnce again, the central striker's support comes from Sassuolo schemer Nedim Bajrami, who has recorded at least one goal involvement in each of his last three national team appearances - two goals and two assists.\n\nThe stakes are already high in these nations' second Group B contest, as defeat would almost certainly mean elimination from Euro 2024.\n\nWhile they did not impress in their opener, Croatia's vast experience should see them past a committed Albania side that may well be bound for the exit.", "source": {"uri": "thechronicle.com.gh", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Chronicle Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

It doesn't want for youthful joy, either, as witnessed by the standing ovation for Jamal Musiala. For Scotland, there was only grim reality. There were some familiarities to that, too.\n\nThey at least had something like a belated shot, and a goal, to at least make this 5-1. It could really have been so much worse. It couldn't have gone much better for Germany. This opening game of Euro 2024 had the feel of a properly big event beforehand, as illustrated by Sir Alex Ferguson's message before a raucous Flower of Scotland, but he had to witness an occasion that solely became about how big the defeat would be. Scotland were fortunate to escape with a mere four-goal loss. Everyone else was fortunate to witness Musiala.\n\nThere was a real symbolism to how he and the effervescent Florian Wirtz both scored to win the game in the opening 20 minutes, particularly with the sheer abandon of Musiala's strike. The 21-year-old - to use head coach Julian Nagelsmann's line before the game - certainly rocked. This was the impetuous arrival of a brilliant new German generation, but they were already away before the opposition even had time to think. That might be a common feeling by the end of this tournament, as Nagelsmann's thrillingly synchronised team announced themselves as proper contenders.\n\nJamal Musiala signals the arrival of new Germany with thrashing of Scotland\n\nJamal Musiala and Florian Wirtz starred as Germany made the perfect start to their Euro 2024 campaign, thrashing sorry Scotland 5-1 in Munich\n\nJulian Nagelsmann's side now head to Dortmund to take on Hungary, who beat Germany away from home in the Nations League two years ago.\n\nBut Hungary have ground to make up if they are to reach the knockout stages, and were beaten 3-1 by Switzerland in their opening fixture.\n\nHere's everything you need to know ahead of the Group A match.\n\nIs Germany vs Hungary on TV? Channel, time and how to watch tonight\n\n11:11 , Jack Rathborn\n\nIt only took Luka Modric 18 years. In 2006, the summer before Lamine Yamal was born, he was an unused substitute against Brazil at Berlin's Olympiastadion. He didn't quite get on the pitch then - blame manager Zlatko Kranjcar for that one - but a remarkable longevity took him back to Berlin, into historic company. For the Croatia captain, playing in a ninth major tournament meant he joined only Cristiano Ronaldo and Lothar Matthaus among Europeans. A few months before his 39th birthday, he became the oldest ever player at European Championships; though perhaps only for a few days, until Ronaldo and Pepe go past him.\n\nA day of record-breakers, however, became an advertisement for youth, rather than experience. Lamine Yamal, the youngest footballer ever at this level, some 22 years Modric's junior, delivered a star turn. Croatia lost 3-0 to Spain. It wasn't quite as dramatic a case of a glorious career ending at the Olympiastadion as Zinedine Zidane's, later in the 2006 World Cup, but it was a day to prompt questions. Are Croatia, finally, too old? Will time eventually catch up with the timeless Modric, boyish as his physique remains, baggy as the shorts are?\n\nA central-midfield trio with a combined 375 caps can still pass, but perhaps they can't press. As Spain had less of the ball than in the past, Croatia did not get close enough to them. \"We weren't aggressive enough,\" said manager Zlatko Dalic. \"We were too slow and too far from the players.\" He felt the problem was most apparent on the flanks, not his veteran midfield, but a product of ageing can be a reluctance to get closer to younger, faster players. A problem of ageing is that every defeat gets attributed to the possibility of decline. This might simply be \"a bad day\", as Dalic said. Or it could prove something symbolic, the end of an era.\n\nLuka Modric's side slumped to a disappointing 3-0 defeat at the hands of Spain in their Group B opener, and though qualification hopes are very much still alive, it was an alarming performance from the World Cup semi-finalists.\n\nAlbania's tournament couldn't have started more positively, with Nedim Bajrami scoring the quickest goal in tournament history after just 23 seconds. Nevertheless, they went on to lose 2-1 to holders Italy, despite putting in a spirited performance.\n\nThey will know that, despite having arguably the toughest group in the tournament, they have a great chance of making the next round if they can sneak a win against their Balkan neighbours.", "source": {"uri": "ca.sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports Canada"},

After Albania's early goal on Saturday, Italy dominated that match, controlling nearly 70% of possession while allowing Albania only seven more shot attempts -- none on goal -- after the Albanians' early strike.\n\nThe Germans are heavily favored (-370 at DK) to win Group A following an impressive 5-1 romp over Scotland to get Euro 2024 underway last Friday.\n\nUnder Julian Nagelsmann, one of the biggest questions entering Euro 2024 was who the 36-year-old would start at striker, but that was hardly a pressing concern against Scotland.\n\nKai Havertz, who started the match up top, made it 3-0 before halftime by converting a penalty kick. Later, Niclas Fullkrug came on for Havertz in the 63rd and buried a goal five minutes later.\n\nGermany's toughest challenger in Group A appears to be Switzerland, so don't be surprised to see another comfortably win by Germany on Wednesday, as Hungary lost its Euro opener 3-1 to the Swiss.\n\nBest bets: Half Time/Full Time -- Germany/Germany (-130) at DraftKings; Parlay: Germany Win, Over 3.5 (+130) at DraftKings\n\nScotland vs. Switzerland Betting Analysis\n\nSwitzerland should be a tough team to score on, and that was the case on Saturday, as the Swiss beat Hungary 3-1 while allowing just two shots on target. This team is led by a stout back line featuring Man City center back Manuel Akanji. At keeper, Borussia Dortmund's Gregor Kobel just helped lead his team to a surprise appearance in the 2024 Champions League final.\n\nScotland is looking to rebound from a brutal Euro 2024 opener against Germany. They not only lost that match 5-1, but failed to generate a single shot on goal, and ended up with an unheard of 0.0 expected goals (xG) for the match. The Scots only got on the scoreboard in the 87th minute via an own-goal by German center back Antonio Rudiger.\n\nManager Steve Clarke's team boasts several Premier Leaguers, including Liverpool star Andrew Robertson, Manchester United's Scott McTominay and Aston Villa's John McGinn, but the way this squad performed against Germany does not inspire much confidence.\n\nSwitzerland look tempting at plus-money on the halftime/full-time market.\n\nBest bet: Half Time/Full Time -- Switzerland/Switzerland (+185)", "source": {"uri": "newsweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsweek"}, "authors":

Sent on with 18 minutes to play, he saw his side fall from 1-0 up to 2-1, with Croatia's second going in off him.\n\nBut, in the 95th minute, he turned his fortune around by ghosting into the box and grabbing a deserved equaliser.\n\nIt's not one that Scotland fans will want to see again, with seemingly forever-injured defender Kieran Tierney picking up another injury against Switzerland, which could see him miss the remainder of the tournament after Steve Clarke confirmed he would miss at least the final group game.\n\nScott McTominay scored Scotland's second goal of EURO 2024, and the first effort by a Scottish player.\n\nIn doing so, he continued an astonishing record. Of the six goals that his nation have scored across their five European Championship appearances, all of them have been scored by someone with a surname beginning with Mc.\n\nMcStay, McClair, McAllister, McCoist, McGregor and now McTominay have all found the back of the net, though we don't think that Antonio Rudiger will be changing his name anytime soon to join the party.\n\nNevertheless, it seems clear that if Scotland finally want to make it out of the group stages at a European Championship, they just need to pick a squad entirely of Mc's.\n\nWith six points on the board, Germany are through and will play the second placed side from group C, which includes England and Denmark.\n\nBehind them, Switzerland will go through if they beat the Germans on matchday 3, or if Scotland don't win. If they lose and Scotland win, it will come down to goal difference.\n\nFor Scotland and Hungary, they both need to win to stand any chance of a spot in the last 16.\n\nJulian Nagelsmann singled out Jamal Musiala for praise after he scored his second in two games.\n\n\"He was brilliant in both games I think, not only the two goals, but I think his offensive positions and ball control is pretty tough for the opponent to defend,\" said Nagelsmann.\n\n\"I think it's important for him not to deal with the pressure and just deal with this capability to solve any offensive complications.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Scotland captain Andy Robertson was far happier with his side's performance this time out.\n\n\"It was much more like us. We got off to a great start and then we made a mistake.\"\n\n\"We left everything out here. We can take a lot of positives but we can improve even more and hopefully you see that on Sunday.\"\n\nAnd Croatia veteran Andrej Kramari\u0107 admitted he had been hoping for a better birthday, despite scoring.\n\n\"I didn't imagine we would be celebrating my birthday in such a disappointing way. It would have been much nicer if we had taken all three points and it was like that until the last seconds. That's football. Sometimes you score in the last second, sometimes you concede.\"\n\nSerbia and Slovenia kick off the action on Thursday as they both look for their first win of the tournament.\n\nThen, England are back in action as they take on Denmark, knowing that a win sees them into the knockout rounds.\n\nSpain or Italy can follow suit as the pair lock horns in the late kick off, in what promises to be another fascinating day of EURO 2024 action.", "source": {"uri": "ca.sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports Canada"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

They are ranked #16 in the FIFA men's rankings, their lowest ranking since 2004. That year they went out at the group stages in Portugal. It would be something of a national crisis if this were repeated on home soil.\n\nAs hosts, Germany didn't have to qualify for the tournament, so their build-up has been a series of friendlies. The most recent friendly results are listed below:\n\nGermany had also previously lost three friendlies in a row to Poland, Colombia, and Japan, which prompted the removal of Hansi Flick, and, after Julian Nagelsmann was dispensed with by Bayern Munich, he was approached to take the job until the European Championships.\n\n5-1 vs Scotland (14 June, 8pm BST) - Germany kicked off the tournament against Scotland on the opening night of Euro 2024 and it couldn't have gone much better. They won 5-1 with five different scorers. Florian Wirtz, 21 years and 41 days old, became the nation's youngest-ever goalscorer at the Euros. Then Jamal Musiala became their second-youngest goalscorer at the Euros. Kai Havertz added a third from the penalty spot and subsitutes Niclas Fullkrug and Emre Can completed the rout. Germany's odds on winning the competition subsequently shortened.\n\n2-0 vs Hungary (19 June, 5pm BST) - Germany were able to secure their passage to the knockout stages with a game to spare, following a 2-0 victory over Hungary. The German side had to hold on to their lead at points, with their opponents missing a couple of big chances in the second half but goals from Jamal Musiala and Ilkay Gundogan were enough to see Julian Nagelsmann and his side through to the round of 16.\n\nvs Switzerland (23 June, 8pm BST) - This is a really tough end to the group stage and as a result Germany will be hoping to come into this match already qualified, and, even better, already confirmed as group winners, as the route does make a difference to the chances of tournament victory from Group A. Another tie that has presented Germany with a problem over recent years. Switzerland have now gone three games unbeaten against Germany, including an incredible 5-3 victory in 2012. Indeed, this game seems to bring the goals, with 26 goals across their last six encounters.\n\nLast 16: If Germany win Group A, which they are favourites to do, then they play in the opening night of round of 16 fixtures against the runners-up of Group C. This group consists of England, Denmark, Serbia, and Slovenia. Markets suggest that Denmark are the most likely nation to play in this scenario, but there is also the chance of England finishing as runners up and meeting Germany in this round. Either Denmark or England would be a tricky test at this stage, but Denmark would be preferred by the Germans, which would be a local derby.\n\nQuarter-finals: They would next meet the winner of the match between the winner of Group B or one of the third-placed finishers. The likelihood then is stacked in the favour of the Group B winners, who could be Spain. Italy or Croatia are alternative candidates.\n\nSemi-finals: A semi-final, in terms of seeding and betting, would then most likely see Germany play Portugal, if the Iberians won their Group F, and then defeated a third placed team and a runner-up to get to the semi-finals.\n\nFinal: France or England, if either nation won their group and then saw off the remaining opposition.\n\nLast 16: Despite the bright start, the Germans have yet to play the two tougher opponents in Group A. Runners-up is still an possibility. This would result in a round of 16 match against the runners-up in Group B. A trickier tie than it sounds because Group B contains Spain, Italy, and Croatia.\n\nFinal: In this route, they would most likely face Portugal or the winners of Group B, Spain, Italy or Croatia. There is also the opportunity of a rematch of whoever finished above Germany in Group A.\n\nSo a runners-up route for Germany could be Spain, England, France, and Portugal. A tough ask.\n\nWith the narrowing down of 24 nations into 16 for the knockout rounds means that the four best third-placed teams will still progress.\n\nIf that was Germany's fate then the third-placed team from Group A could be drawn against the winner of Group B (odds suggest Spain), Group F (Portugal), or Group E (France).\n\nThere are then a multitude of possibilities from this point onwards, depending on which round of 16 match Germany won to progress to the quarter-finals.\n\nIt is definitely a route best avoided, as the certainty of playing a group winner, even if it isn't the favourite to do so, would mean that Germany would have to play an in-form nation in the last 16. Now that Germany have three points on the board, however, it would likely require them to lose the remaining two fixtures.\n\nApart from winning their first game and scoring five goals? Well, there is a lot more optimism around German football now than there was in the autumn. At that stage Germany looked lost for ideas and for a nation of their history to have to appoint a temporary manager, even one of the quality of Nagelsmann, is obviously not an ideal solution. Also, Bayern Munich were struggling domestically -- partly down to Nagelsmann of course -- and with a lot of German national team players traditionally coming out of Bayern, it was seen as a representation of the apparent decline in German quality in football.\n\nHowever, the last few weeks and months have provided a real spring in the step of German football observers. The nation had two Champions League semi-finalists, and were mere minutes away from providing both finalists for the first time since 2012.\n\nThe fact that Dortmund, fifth place in the Bundesliga, have reached the Champions League final, could say much about the current quality of the league. Bayer Leverkusen's success, their first ever Bundesliga crown, the reaching of the DFB-Pokal final and the Europa League final, in a currently unbeaten season, is undoubtedly the achievement of the season in all of European football. This combined effort from the German clubs in UEFA competition has meant that they will be granted an extra Champions League spot for next season as well.\n\nThe approach of Nagelsmann to use younger, in-form players, regardless of club has meant that there is a bit more freshness to the squad as well. Florian Wirtz will be full of confidence as well, and Kai Havertz's renaissance as a forward in Arsenal's Premier League title challenge will have pleased Nagelsmann no end.\n\nThe group looks winnable from a German perspective. Much should hinge on the Switzerland match, but as that is the final group game, a lot will have changed in the planning of the tournament, and some things will have become clearer for all parties.\n\nThe disappointing season that Bayern have had could affect the confidence of players such as Leroy Sane, Jamal Musiala, and Joshua Kimmich. However, it could also provide some motivation to turn their poor club season into an excellent international campaign.\n\nIf Germany don't win the group then the routes look perilous. A second- or third-place finish will likely see Germany face-off against other European heavyweights from the very start of the knockout phase. It is a route better avoided by topping the group if possible.\n\nWith Germany not having had a qualification campaign to judge them on, it felt fairly difficult to get a handle on exactly how the team would look in the tournament itself. However, over the last few fixtures Julian Nagelsmann seems to have landed on a settled XI:\n\nAs a coach, Nagelsmann has elements of Red Bull DNA, despite learning his trade as a coach at Hoffenheim, but there will have to be an element of adapting his philosophies to the players available to him.\n\nNagelsmann has always employed a very attacking, vertical style. He likes to play quickly forwards, often by-passing midfield, and taking as few touches as possible to progress play into the opposition's defensive area. This is not long-ball football as we may have seen in the past, but rather quick, intelligent passing and pace in transition. This often comes with a high defensive line and a willingness to press the opposition to win the ball back high up the pitch.\n\nFor this system to work well the team will need speed and technical ability. It is, therefore, key to have the right athletes in the right positions. The growing influence of Bayer Leverkusen's young star Florian Wirtz could be coming at a key time for Nagelsmann and Germany as he has the ability to play the way that the coach wants, and that helps to knit the forward line together. Jamal Musiala will also have a key role to play, and Nagelsmann will know him well from their time at Bayern together.\n\nThe basic formation is a 4-2-3-1, but in build-up this can adapt to a 3-2-5, or 3-1-6 or 2-3-5, depending on how Nagelsmann assesses the strengths or weaknesses of the opposition. Germany will not have a problem in being a bit more patient and keeping the ball, the question will then become, do they have the quality to defeat a low-block defence? Scotland will test this in the opening match.\n\nThere is an acceptance in Germany that this is not their vintage crop of players. But there is also genuine excitement in the country around a number of young talents that are emerging in attack (Wirtz, Musiala and Havertz). The result is a quiet confidence that the improved displays in the last international break mean that Nagelsmann has been able to match a style of play to the players that he has available to him.\n\nWith this being a home tournament, it is obviously important for Germany to get a good start. This will allow the momentum to build and the country to be sold on the success of the national team. Joshua Kimmich recognises the need for the team to provide the inspiration for the nation, \"I believe the people are ready for it. But we as a team must take the first step and be successful, then we can win the people over and emotionalise them.\"", "source": {"uri": "ca.sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo

You can make your own predictions for the second set of group games below, including Scotland versus Switzerland and England against Denmark.\n\nSutton is also picking the order he thinks each of the six groups will finish in.\n\nHe is backing France to win the European Championship, believes England will lose to them in the semi-finals, and thinks Scotland will not get out of their group.\n\nSutton's pre-tournament picks: Germany (winners) and Hungary (runners-up). Switzerland to finish third, and Scotland fourth.\n\nMatch report\n\nWhat a start from Germany, but it is still amazing how the mood of their fans has changed so quickly.\n\nThere was so much negativity about their prospects going into this tournament then suddenly one good win over Scotland, and they are going to win in it.\n\nAs impressive as they were, I don't see it being as simple as that, although of course it should give them confidence and get the nation believing a little bit more.\n\nIn contrast, Hungary made a disappointing start in their defeat by Switzerland. They are under pressure because they really need something from this game but I can only see another convincing Germany victory.\n\nBefore the Germany game, the Scotland fans made it one of the best pre-match atmospheres I have ever witnessed.\n\nAnd then the game kicked off and it was such a sorry performance. Scotland were smothered completely, and were not allowed to play.\n\nThey have to do much better against Switzerland, and it will be interesting to see whether Steve Clarke puts Billy Gilmour into midfield this time. I am not sure Gilmour would have made much difference against Germany but I can understand why there are calls for him to be picked this time.\n\nClarke has a decision to make at the back too, with Ryan Porteous suspended. I think he's got to bring Scott McKenna in at centre-half, but he will probably go with Grant Hanley. I am not sure about Hanley, with his lack of game-time for Norwich last season, and that might be a risk too far.\n\nI would be thinking about bringing James Forrest in, possibly at right wing-back. People might scoff at that, but he has played there before and is versatile.\n\nScotland's first aim has got to be to get up the pitch, something they failed to do against Germany, but it won't be easy. The Swiss have started really well and Granit Xhaka was influential for them against Hungary.\n\nI said before the tournament that I thought Scotland have a Championship backline, and I am worried about that again here.\n\nBoth of these teams lost their openers so this has become a big game for them.\n\nAlbania scored so early against Italy and then seemed to think 'what do we do next?'.\n\nThey did have a chance late on, but Italy should have been out of sight by then.\n\nCroatia, meanwhile, were flat as a pancake against Spain. Their fans were brilliant, but their team were beaten by half-time and you could tell they started thinking about this game because Luka Modric and Mateo Kovacic both came off midway through the second half.\n\nI don't think Croatia will find things easy here either, though. They will have plenty of possession, but they need to do something with it, and Albania will always be dangerous on the counter-attack.\n\nCroatia have some quality players who can affect games but they are an aging team and they are my choice as flops for this tournament - I have picked them to finish fourth in Group B - so let's go for Albania to get something here.\n\nThis is the game of the tournament so far. I am at this one for Radio 5 Live and I am really looking forward to it.\n\nI keep hearing loads of negativity about Spain, before and after their win over Croatia, and I don't understand why.\n\nThe game was the first in 136 competitive matches where they had less possession than their opponents, but they were extremely efficient at everything they did defensively, and carried a threat too.\n\nYou could argue the way they played is similar to what we have seen from Italy in the past, in terms of absorbing pressure and counter-attacking with devastating effect.\n\nAs for Italy, they responded really well after going behind against Albania and for all the criticism they have had, they got ahead and missed some big chances to win the game more comfortably.\n\nBecause of that it became a bit difficult and nervy for them but they held on to win - and it was only the second time they have come from a goal down to beat anyone at the Euros, since they overcame Bulgaria at Euro 2004.\n\nSo, I feel like both teams are in a pretty good place but that does not help me make a prediction, because how on earth do you call this?\n\nI want to pick a winner... so I am going for Spain. If Italy boss Luciano Spalletti has a worry, it is about his backline... and Spain will be able to get at them.\n\nSlovenia had chances against Denmark even before they scored but, because they have a point on the board already, I have a feeling they will sit back more here.\n\nSerbia worried England in the second half, but without having anything too clear cut, and I don't see them as being particularly dangerous going forward.\n\nI have a feeling this will end up being quite a cagey draw, which would leave both teams with everything to play for in their final games.\n\nI don't agree with all the criticism I have heard following England's opening win over Serbia, and I can see this being pretty comfortable for Gareth Southgate's side.\n\nTo be honest, I am sick and tired of people whinging about what England have done so far. I am often accused of being negative, but England have started a tournament with a win and it is still supposedly not good enough.\n\nOne of the debates has been whether Southgate should stick with Trent Alexander-Arnold in midfield, and I am massively on the fence there.\n\nYou look at what his strengths are and he is a wonderful passer of a football, but then he does have deficiencies in that position, and it is down to Southgate to decide whether he is worth the risk.\n\nIf England go further into this tournament then maybe Southgate will go for a bit more stability in there, but I don't see this as the time to worry about that. This is not the Danish team of tournaments past and I don't think they will cause too many problems.\n\nI am going for another England win, and another clean sheet - and I want to give a quick mention to Marc Guehi.\n\nI am not saying I had doubts about him before the Serbia game because he has had a good season, but he still had to step up to play in his first game at a major tournament - and he was absolutely colossal.\n\nBoth these teams lost their opening games by a single goal. The Netherlands could have won more comfortably but Poland carried more of a threat on the counter-attack than I anticipated.\n\nRobert Lewandowski should be fit to play, so they should be even more dangerous.\n\nI did not get a proper look at how Austria did against France because I had been working at the Belgium versus Slovakia game on the same evening but, from what I've seen, they did OK.\n\nThey carried a threat and although Kylian Mbappe missed a golden chance, they were still in the game at the end. This is going to be close too, but this time they might be the team who nicks the win.\n\nWe are waiting to see if Kylian Mbappe plays with his broken nose. I am no medical expert - I can't be an expert at everything - but my diagnosis is that it probably comes down to how sore it is.\n\nPatrick Vieira broke my nose once - he elbowed me off the ball at a corner when I was playing for Blackburn in 1998. I went down and when I looked up he was laughing at me while my eyes were pouring with water.\n\nThen I tried to take retribution by going in two-footed on him, missed... and got a straight red card. As I got up, I saw the ref waving the red card at me and Emmanuel Petit pushed me over and I landed on my nose again. It was a terrible few minutes for me.\n\nI reckon I would have been able to play with my broken nose, but not that particular day because I was sent off.\n\nAs for the game? I just cannot see past France, really.\n\nI quite liked the way the Netherlands played against Poland, but France will still probably edge past them. It is what they do.\n\nSutton's prediction: 1-2\n\nSutton's pre-tournament picks: Belgium (winners) and Slovakia (runners-up). Ukraine to finish third, and Romania fourth.\n\nDusseldorf / 21 June / 14:00 BST\n\nI loved being in Cologne for Slovakia's victory over Belgium, to see the fans inside the stadium during the game and the celebrations afterwards.\n\nI am a big fan of Stanislav Lobotka, the little enforcer in the middle of the park. Apart from him they are a team of giants but what really stands out is how well organised they are.\n\nAccording to the world rankings it was the biggest shock in Euros history, but Belgium should not be at number three on that showing. They need to have a good look at themselves.\n\nI wondered if Slovakia could maintain their focus for 90 minutes but, in fairness, they did.\n\nThis is a different kind of test for them, because Ukraine need something after being well beaten in what I thought would be a tight affair against Romania. They really need to win this, but I don't see that happening.\n\nThis group has been blown wide open. I think everyone thought Belgium would be the team that finished top, but they are under pressure.\n\nThey had a couple of goals disallowed against Slovakia, and the handball was harsh, but they also wasted a load of chances. Romelu Lukaku looked like he was playing with his boots on the wrong feet.\n\nRomania are a bit like Slovakia in that it's joyous to see a team who surprise everyone like they have. I can't say I know everything about Romanian football, but the quality of their goals and the way they played, means they will fancy their chances.\n\nThe Belgium backline is still vulnerable, but they have to win this game, and I think they will.\n\nSutton's prediction: 2-1\n\nSutton's pre-tournament picks: Portugal (winners) and Czech Republic (runners-up). Turkey to finish third, and Georgia fourth.\n\nHamburg / 22 June / 14:00 BST\n\nGeorgia gave it a good go against Turkey but they lost.\n\nTheir aim would be to get to their final game and have something to play for, but to do that they really need something here to stay in the tournament.\n\nThe Czech Republic put everything into nicking a result against Portugal but they must surely look at this game to kickstart their campaign.\n\nBy beating Georgia in their first game, Turkey have already done better than they did at the last Euros.\n\nWith Portugal, when you look at players they've got, you can see they have the quality needed to go and win this tournament, or it wouldn't be impossible anyway.\n\nThey are a bit like Belgium in that they were pretty flawless in qualifying, and have got some talented players, but they could not get things right after that.", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

They played out an enjoyable 2-2 draw, with Klaus Gjasula netting a last gasp equaliser for Sylvinho's side. Defeat for either side would have made an early exit very likely - the point keeps both of them alive for now.\n\nThis was followed by a meeting between Germany and Hungary. The latter made things difficult for the hosts, but Die Mannschaft emerged victorious thanks to finishes by Jamal Musiala and Ilkay Gundogan.\n\nWednesday's games were rounded off by another entertaining match between Scotland and Switzerland, ending in a 1-1 draw. Steve Clarke's men will be thankful for the point, knowing that a defeat would almost certainly have seen them eliminated.\n\nStandout Performer - Ilkay Gundogan\n\nFollowing Friday's 5-1 mauling of Scotland, many fancied Germany for another comfortable afternoon when they faced Hungary. However, the Magyars put up an admirable fight, coming close on several occasions.\n\nUltimately, Germany's quality prevailed, as they came away 2-0 winners. That quality was evident in their second goal, when a beautiful passing move resulted in Ilkay Gundogan sweeping into the far corner from Maximilian Mittelstadt's cutback.\n\nJulian Nagelsmann's side became the first team to secure their place in the round of 16. They go into their third group game with Switzerland, knowing that a draw will be enough to guarantee top spot.\n\nPoorest Player - Anthony Ralston\n\nScotland put in a dire display in their opener against a far superior Germany side. Yesterday, they bounced back admirably, securing a 1-1 draw against Switzerland. The result leaves their destiny in their hands, as a win over Hungary on Sunday will almost certainly be enough to see them through.\n\nBut the situation could have been so much brighter had Anthony Ralston not made a dreadful error in the first half. With the Tartan Army 1-0 up, the defender played a loose pass straight to the left foot of Xherdan Shaqiri. The former Liverpool man proceeded to hit a beautiful first-time effort into the top corner to level the scores.\n\nTo his credit, Ralston recovered well enough from the mistake to put in a solid performance. But unfortunately it could be a blunder that he comes to regret later on.\n\nTalking Point - Is Croatia's 'golden generation' over?\n\nIn recent years, Croatia have enjoyed the most fruitful era in their history. They made the World Cup final in 2018, reached the semi-finals in 2022, and lost last summer's Nations League final on penalties.\n\nThis year, however, they have looked miles off their best. A heavy defeat at the hands of Spain was followed by a draw against Albania, and they now head into their final group game against Italy needing a win to stand a realistic chance of progressing.\n\nLuka Modric is 38 now. Ivan Perisic is 35. Ivan Rakitic and Dejan Lovren have retired from international duty. Mario Mandzukic has retired from football entirely. And, aside from Josko Gvardiol, there doesn't seem to be a great wealth of young talent coming through.\n\nFor a nation of under 4 million people, earning three medals is brilliant, and manager Zlatko Dalic deserves huge credit. Unfortunately, it seems as if Croatia's best days are now behind them - it will hurt that they couldn't quite get over the line.\n\nThe other two sides in Group C get underway afterwards, as Denmark face England. A win for the Three Lions books their place in the round of 16, and they could nail down top spot if results go their way.\n\nAnd then the day finishes with a huge clash between Spain and Italy, who both currently sit on three points. Both nations have the chance to guarantee first place in the group with a win.", "source": {"uri": "ca.sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports Canada"}, "authors": [],

Musiala, a 21-year-old attacking midfielder, scored his second goal of the tournament, while G\u00fcndo\u011fan was named the Most Valuable Player at MHPArena.\n\nHungary, on the other hand, suffered another defeat following their opening loss to Switzerland (1-3), putting them on the brink of elimination. The Swiss were unable to secure their spot in the next round after a 1-1 draw against Scotland in a match that could have gone either way at the RheinEnergieStadion in Cologne.\n\nMeanwhile, Croatia, runners-up in the 2018 World Cup and semifinalists in Qatar 2022, missed the chance to surpass Albania on the second matchday of Group B, making their progression to the knockout stages more challenging. The Croatians were leading until the 95th minute when Klaus Gjasula equalized (2-2) at the majestic Volksparkstadion in Hamburg.\n\nGjasula went from zero to hero, having earlier scored an own goal in the 76th minute that gave the Balkans the lead.

The game is played at MHPArena in Stuttgart on Sunday, June 23\n\nThe Tartan Army stands a good chance of advancing to the knockout phase of a major tournament for the first time ever. They're third in group A with one point, which is still more than Hungary. In fact, if they beat the Magyars, we might see them get to the 2 place.\n\nBut even if they finish 3, they still have a chance to advance to the next stage as four of the best-ranked third-placed teams will get a spot in the knockouts. The bad news for Scotland is that their goal difference is bad, so they do need to go for a win against Hungary. More bad news is that basically the same applies to the Magyars, who have no other options but to go for a victory on June 23.\n\nScotland is on the verge of achieving historical success. The Tartan Army stands a chance to advance to the knockout phase of the Euro 2024, for which they need a good result in the June 23 game.\n\nIf they beat Hungary, it's almost certain that they will advance to the next phase of the tournament. Whether they'll get there from the second or third place in Group A is something that depends on Switzerland's performance against Germany.\n\nIf the Swiss get hammered by the tournament hosts and Scotland get a big win against Hungary, the Tartan Army will finish second. Even if they finish third, they will probably advance further, assuming that they have collected 4 points in the group phase.\n\nThey already have one point, which they earned against Switzerland. It was one of Scotland's best outings in recent years, especially given that they played against a team that's very hard to score against. But Scot McTominay managed to find the net, giving everyone in Scotland a massive confidence boost.\n\nHungary is on zero points after two rounds of the Euro 2024. In the first round, the Hungarians lost to Switzerland 3:1, but it wasn't an embarrassing defeat. In fact, for the most part of the second half, they were the dominating side.\n\nThen, in the second round, they lost 2:0 to Germany. Once again, the Hungarians did not embarrass themselves. It's just that Germany was much better.\n\nThanks to the new format of the Euros, the Magyars still stand a chance to advance to the next phase of the tournament. However, for that to happen, they have no other option but to beat Scotland on June 23.\n\nWhat's interesting is that simply winning the game might not be enough. Given that their score difference right now is 1:5, these guys need a big win on Sunday.\n\nThis is the key game of the 2024 Euro for both teams, which is why you can be certain their players will go all-in on Sunday. Hungary is desperate for a win, which is why we expect to see these guys attack from the very start, which should leave room for Scotland's counterattacks. As a result, we could see plenty of goals in this game.\n\nBut who will win, if any? We think it's going to be Hungary only for the fact that this team's Euro 2024 roster looks significantly stronger than Scotland's.", "source": {"uri": "gamblingnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GamblingNews"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mike_johnson@gamblingnews.com", "name": "Mike Johnson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarians", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hungarians"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tartan_Army", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tartan Army"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-elimination_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Single-elimination tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungary", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hungary"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Hungary"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goal_difference", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Goal difference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuttgart", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stuttgart"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Stuttgart"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_McTominay", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scott McTominay"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Multiplayer", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Multiplayer", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Hand-Eye_Coordination", "label": "dmoz/Games/Hand-Eye Coordination", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 76}], "image": "https://www.gamblingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/scotland-hungary.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9664135", "eventUri": "eng-9664135", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Hungary"}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-23", "textStart": 221, "textEnd": 228, "freq": 4}], "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 127, "relevance": 1}

A source close to the France captain confirmed to AFP shortly after the game that his nose was broken.\n\nThe French team will hope that does not prevent him from playing in Friday's second group match in Leipzig against the Netherlands.\n\nIn Monday's other fixture, Belgium started their Euro 2024 campaign with a defeat against Slovakia in Frankfurt, where Ivan Schranz of Slavia Prague scored the only goal.\n\nSchranz struck in the seventh minute, firing home the rebound after Belgian goalkeeper Koen Casteels had saved from Juraj Kucka.\n\nIt was an especially frustrating day for Belgium striker Romelu Lukaku, who missed a host of chances and had a late equaliser controversially disallowed by VAR.\n\nBelgium's first defeat since the 2022 World Cup puts Domenico Tedesco's team under pressure going into their second Group 'E' match against Romania on Saturday.\n\nElsewhere, Romania won at a major international tournament for the first time in 24 years as they beat Ukraine 3-0 with the help of two errors from goalkeeper Andriy Lunin.\n\nIn Sunday's Group 'C' matches, Bellingham header helped England edge Serbia 1-0 while Denmark were held 1-1 by Slovenia.", "source": {"uri":

However, Germany still hasn't secured the No. 1 spot, which the Mannschaft will do if they don't lose to the Swiss on June 23.\n\nThe Swiss have every right to hope to get to the knockout phase of the Euro 2024. If they win on June 23, they will definitely get there as they'll finish at the top of Group A. However, judging by the Switzerland vs. Germany odds, such a scenario isn't very likely to happen.\n\nA more plausible scenario is that the Swiss will hold the Germans to a tie. In that case, Switzerland would finish second. Even a loss on Sunday could see them stay in the second position - if Scotland doesn't get a big win over Hungary.\n\nAnd even if the Tartan Army leapfrogged them due to a better score difference, the Swiss would still stand a chance of qualifying for the knockouts as one of the four best third-placed teams.\n\nGermany wants to win Group A, and it's not just because of prestige. They want to do it so that they would have an easier schedule in the knockouts. The thing is that the winner of Group A gets to play against the runner-up from Group C.\n\nHow things currently stand, Denmark is likely to finish in that place. Although the Danas are good, they're not as dangerous as Italy/Spain/Croatia, one of which will take on the second-placed team in Group A.\n\nKnowing that the Mannschaft has the motivation to win on June 23, it's likely that we'll witness another masterclass by Jamal Musiala, Florian Wirtz, and the rest.\n\nGermany needs to win this game and we're almost 100% certain they will do it. Not only are they motivated to beat the Swiss but given that the tournament is played on their turf, they'll have their fans to give them support from the stands.\n\nAnd even if all that wasn't the case, we'd still favor them for the simple fact that their roster is much better than the one of Switzerland.", "source": {"uri": "gamblingnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GamblingNews"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jessie_carter@gamblingnews.com", "name": "Jessie Carter", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-elimination_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Single-elimination tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tartan_Army", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tartan Army"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungary", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hungary"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Hungary"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamal_Musiala", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jamal Musiala"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florian_Wirtz", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Florian Wirtz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croatia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Croatia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Croatia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Lotteries", "label": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Lotteries", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Educational", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Educational", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Working_Abroad", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Working Abroad", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Chemistry/Research_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Science/Chemistry/Research Groups", "wgt": 10}], "image": "https://www.gamblingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/switzerland-vs-germany-euro-2024.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9664135", "eventUri": "eng-9664135", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-23", "textStart": 240, "textEnd": 247, "freq": 3}], "sentiment": 0.2156862745098038, "wgt": 111, "relevance": 1}

The unrest, which has led to significant disruptions, could affect bilateral trade dynamics in the near future. The current situation in Bangladesh has been exacerbated by a severe shortage of foreign exchange, impacting the smooth flow of exports from India. Perishable goods, in particular, are facing logistical challenges at the border, further complicating trade operations.\n\nThe crisis escalated on Monday following the resignation of Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and her departure from violence-hit Dhaka. An interim government has been established as the country grapples with widespread protests. The demonstrations are fueled by discontent over a controversial quota system that allocates 30 percent of jobs to the families of veterans from the 1971 liberation war.\n\nThe violent protests have claimed over 100 lives in the past two days, adding to the instability and raising alarms about the future of trade relations. Despite the ongoing turmoil, exporters remain hopeful that the situation will stabilize soon, allowing trade between India and Bangladesh to return to normalcy.\n\nAlso read: Bangladesh unrest: Violent protesters occupy Parliament, smoke inside after Sheikh Hasina flees Dhaka (WATCH)\n\nTrade disruptions and Forex shortage\n\nThe Federation of Indian Export Organisations (FIEO) has reported that Indian exporters are already experiencing disruptions in their trade with Bangladesh, primarily due to a shortage of foreign exchange in the latter country. This shortage has particularly impacted exports of perishable goods at the border.\n\nAjay Sahai, Director General of FIEO, was quoted as saying in a PTI report, \"We were facing some disruptions due to the issues in Bangladesh, but we are expecting that the situation will be restored soon and trade will not face any challenge.\"\n\nSanjay Budhia, Managing Director of PATTON and an exporter based in West Bengal, noted the potential for significant repercussions given the close economic and geographic ties between India and Bangladesh.\n\n\"While the crisis in Bangladesh poses several risks to India's trade, proactive measures and regional cooperation can help mitigate these impacts and ensure continued economic stability and growth. The need of the hour is to have a balanced approach, keeping the geopolitical and economic considerations in mind,\" he told PTI.\n\nBudhia further noted that while the current situation is challenging for Indian exporters, \"we must continue to focus on our own competitiveness development to achieve the target of USD 1 trillion merchandise exports by 2030\".\n\nImplications for Export and Import Sectors\n\nIndia's trade with Bangladesh encompasses a broad range of goods. India exports cotton, machinery, food products, and other items while importing jute and fish from Bangladesh. The current crisis has the potential to affect these sectors, particularly if it leads to prolonged disruptions or border security issues.\n\nPravin Saraf, owner of PSY Ltd, expressed concerns about long-term implications. \"We were already facing payment delay issues in that country because of forex shortage there, and now this development would further hurt the bilateral trade. We do not know when the situation will be normalised,\" Saraf was quoted as saying in a PTI report. His company exports spices, food grains, and chemicals to Bangladesh.\n\nEconomic and Trade Impact\n\nThe Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI) has highlighted that Bangladesh's severe dollar shortage has limited its ability to import goods, including those from India. Rising inflation in Bangladesh has further reduced domestic demand, affecting both local and imported products.\n\nAjay Srivastava, founder of GTRI, stressed the importance of maintaining open supply lines despite the political turmoil. \"As Bangladesh experiences political turmoil, it is essential for all political factions to protect garment and other factories and keep supply lines open across the border to sustain trade and economic activity,\" he told the news agency.\n\nBangladesh, which is India's largest trade partner in South Asia, has seen a decline in bilateral trade over recent years. In the fiscal year 2023-24, India's exports to Bangladesh dropped to USD 11 billion from USD 12.21 billion in 2022-23. Imports also fell to USD 1.84 billion from USD 2 billion during the same period.\n\nAlso read: Bangladesh unrest: Rioters destroy, loot Sheikh Hasina's residence; vandalize Mujibur Rehman's statue (WATCH)\n\nDiverse Trade Sectors and Tariff Implications\n\nIndia's exports to Bangladesh cover a wide range of sectors, including agriculture, textiles, machinery, electronics, and more. Notably, many of these exports are subject to full tariffs and do not benefit from the South Asian Free Trade Area (SAFTA) agreement. In contrast, Bangladesh's exports to India are concentrated in textiles, garments, and made-ups, which benefit from zero tariffs under SAFTA.\n\nDespite the challenges posed by the current crisis, experts believe that proactive measures and regional cooperation could help mitigate the impacts and maintain economic stability. The focus remains on enhancing competitiveness and fostering trade resilience to achieve long-term economic goals, such as India's target of USD 1 trillion in merchandise exports by 2030.\n\nAs the situation in Bangladesh evolves, both Indian and Bangladeshi stakeholders will need to navigate the complexities of this crisis while striving to sustain and strengthen their bilateral trade relationship.", "source": {"uri": "newsable.asianetnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Asianet News Network Pvt Ltd"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federation_of_Indian_Export_Organisations", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federation of Indian Export Organisations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_exchange_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Foreign exchange market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheikh_Hasina", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sheikh Hasina"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhaka", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dhaka"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dhaka"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Floyd_protests", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "George Floyd protests"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilateral_trade", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bilateral trade"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provisional_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Provisional government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh_Liberation_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh Liberation War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Parliament of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States dollar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jute", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geopolitics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Geopolitics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cotton", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cotton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Bengal", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "West Bengal"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "West Bengal"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grain", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Grain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Asian_Free_Trade_Area", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "South Asian Free Trade Area"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Press_Trust_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Press Trust of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chemical industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Asia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "South Asia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tariff", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tariff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Textile", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Textile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Electronics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spice", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spice"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day_Trading", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day Trading", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Commodities_and_Futures", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Commodities and Futures", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Consumer_Goods_and_Services/Marketplaces", "label": "dmoz/Business/Consumer Goods and Services/Marketplaces", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://static-ai.asianetnews.com/images/01j4hedcg1v0vt2ajqmxv0gwzs/whatsapp-image-2024-08-05-at-19-46-08.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792287", "eventUri": "eng-9792287", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3960784313725491, "wgt": 227, "relevance": 1}

High inflation has eroded Dhaka's US dollar reserves, limiting the country's ability to import critical goods such as agricultural items, iron and steel, electricity, and plastics from India.\n\nWhile New Delhi's imports from Dhaka were stable over the past two years, Dhaka's imports tumbled by 31.5 per cent to $11.1 billion during 2023-24 (FY24), commerce and industry ministry data showed. In contrast, India's imports from Bangladesh slipped by just 5.3 per cent to $1.8 billion in FY24 compared to FY22.\n\nEven during the current financial year, economic activity has been slowing in Bangladesh as its imports of petroleum products from India slipped 8 per cent in June compared to May. Similarly, imports of spices fell 42 per cent, rice by 54 per cent, man-made yarn by 38 per cent, and coal and mineral imports by 13 per cent.\n\nThink tank Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI) said that as Bangladesh experiences political turmoil, it is essential for all political factions to protect garment and other factories and keep supply lines open across the border to sustain trade and economic activity.

India has been a keen partner in Bangladesh's development journey, which has also provided opportunities for companies back home.\n\n\"As Bangladesh experiences political turmoil, it is essential for all political factions to protect garment and other factories and keep supply lines open across the border to sustain trade and economic activity,\" said Ajay Srivastava, founder of economic think tank Global Trade Research Initiative.\n\nA senior government official told Mint the political crisis in Bangladesh could hinder India's plans to boost exports to the neighbouring country.\n\n\"If the situation worsens, which is highly possible, Bangladesh may stop importing Indian goods and seek other countries to meet their domestic needs,\" the official said, declining to be identified.\n\nOther experts said India faces losses in multiple trade segments due to the Bangladesh crisis, which could turn into opportunities for competitors like Vietnam and China.\n\n\"India will need to create strategies to compete with these countries and seize any potential market share,\" said Biswajit Dhar, economist and a retired professor at the Centre for Economic Studies and Planning at Delhi's Jawaharlal Nehru University.\n\n\"Bangladesh is one of the major destinations for Indian goods. After covid-19, Bangladesh was among the top five export destinations. However, trade has declined slightly after the export ban on rice and wheat. Despite this, it remains one of India's best trade partners,\" Dhar said.\n\nIn recent years, Bangladesh's economic challenges have hurt bilateral trade with India.\n\nIndia's exports to Bangladesh, which amounted to $16.2 billion in 2021-22, fell to $11.1 billion in 2023-24, declining by about 31.5%. Imports from Bangladesh have been relatively stable, increasing from $1.9 billion in FY22 to $2 billion the following year, before sliding back to $1.8 billion in FY24.\n\n\"Bangladesh has been facing a severe dollar shortage, which has limited its ability to import goods, including from India. The rising inflation in the country has also reduced domestic demand, leading to lower consumption of both local and imported products,\" Srivastava said.\n\nHe, however, added that India's exports of electricity, onions, and other agricultural products may not be significantly affected.\n\n\"India's exports to Bangladesh are highly diversified, covering agriculture, textiles, machinery, electronics, auto parts, iron and steel, electricity and plastics. Notably, most of these exports to Bangladesh are subject to full tariffs and are outside the South Asian Free Trade Area (SAFTA) agreement,\" Srivastava said.\n\nAlso read | Mint Explainer: Why India needs to have a wary eye on the Bangladesh coup\n\nIn contrast, Bangladesh's exports to India are concentrated in a few categories such as textiles and garments. These items benefit from zero tariffs under the SAFTA agreement extended by India.\n\nThe unrest in Bangladesh could also exacerbate already weakening demand for India's engineering exports. The total value of such exports from India to Bangladesh in the June quarter fell 8.2% from a year ago to $542.1 million.\n\n\"Recently, Bangladesh has seen a significant reduction in imports of industrial raw materials and capital machinery. The weak demand for consumer goods has affected factory production levels and worsened supply chain disruptions, complicating the economic landscape,\" said Arun Kumar Garodia, chairman of the Engineering Export Promotion Council of India.\n\n\"The ongoing political uncertainty may further worsen the situation and impact engineering exports.\"\n\nAlso at stake are connectivity projects between the two countries.\n\nTrain services connecting India and Bangladesh, including freight, have been suspended, resulting in a complete stop of movement of people and goods between the two countries.\n\nIndian Railways is connected to the Bangladesh railway network through five interchange points, which have been impacted by the turmoil in the neighbouring country. The fate of another rail connection between Agartala and Bangladesh also hangs in the balance.\n\nPlans to develop rail and road interconnection points connecting Nepal, India and Bangladesh and Bhutan-India, with linkage projects going all the way up to Bangladesh's Chittogram port, now stare at an uncertain future.\n\nAlso read | India plans linkage to Bangladesh's Matarbari port in regional connectivity push\n\nAlso facing uncertainty is a \u20b9950 crore contract won by Indian Railways' exports arm, RITES Ltd, in May to supply 200 broad gauge passenger carriages to Bangladesh Railway.\n\nMeanwhile, the world's longest ferry service connecting Varanasi with Dibrugarh in Assam via Bangladesh remains suspended.\n\nAn official with India's ministry of ports, shipping and waterways said the situation is being evaluated.\n\nLast year, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Hasina jointly inaugurated the India-Bangladesh Friendship Pipeline, a cross-border energy pipeline with a capacity to transport 1 million tonnes per annum of high-speed diesel.\n\nWhile Assam-based Numaligarh Refinery Ltd has been supplying petroleum products to Bangladesh since 2015,Adani Power Ltd supplies 1,496 MW of power from its plant in Godda, Jharkhand to the northern neighbour.\n\n\"Adani Power has a (power purchase agreement) with Bangladesh power distribution utility, Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB), to meet their power requirement,\" a spokesperson for Adani Power said in a statement.\n\n\"In its normal course of business, BPDB is scheduling the power supply to meet their demand and as per that schedule, Adani Power continues to supply power to the Bangladesh power utility without any disruption.\"\n\nAn official with another power generating company, speaking on condition of anonymity, said power supplies from India to Bangladesh are unlikely to be affected given the demand in the neighbouring country.\n\nBangladesh is a major textile hub catering to an international clientelle, benefiting in recent years also from a global policy to not rely purely on China for manufacturing. Several experts believe that the current turmoil in Bangladesh could present an opportunity for India's textile and apparel segment.\n\n\"The manufacturing of garments in Bangladesh may face a significant hit as factories are being set on fire, given that most textile units are owned by traders associated with (Sheikh Hasina's) Awami League Party,\" the government official quoted above said.\n\n\"In this scenario, India might fill the gap and become a supplier of garments to developed economies, although this would come at a cost,\" he added. \"Bangladesh, being on the list of Least Developed Countries, enjoys zero duty benefits, while Indian goods face tariff barriers.\"\n\nAlso read | Now Bangladesh shows the risk posed by unresolved job crises\n\nAlso, India may be compelled to maintain cordial relations with Dhaka and refrain from imposing duties on garment imports, which are currently duty-free.\n\n\"It's very early to speculate, but if borders remain closed and duty-free export-import activities are halted, it could significantly increase demand. This might benefit the Indian garment industry,\" said Anil Buchasia, executive member-eastern region, Apparel Export Promotion Council.\n\n\"About 85% of Bangladesh's foreign exchange comes from the garment industry. Given the significant political involvement in this sector, it's likely that the political class in Bangladesh will take swift control of this segment,\" Buchasia added.\n\nIndian companies with operations in Bangladesh are already feeling the heat.\n\nGurugram-based clothing manufacturer Pearl Global Industries Ltd said its Bangladesh facilities were temporarily non-operational due to the curfew imposed in the country. Its shares fell by more than 3% to \u20b9906 apiece on NSE on Tuesday.\n\nA spokesperson of the Union ministry of commerce and industries didn't respond to emailed queries.\n\nOn Tuesday, following attacks on minorities in Bangladesh, India's external affairs minister S. Jaishankar said India remained concerned about the status of minorities in the neighbouring country until law and order is restored.\n\n\"We are in close and continuous touch with the Indian community in Bangladesh through our diplomatic missions. There are an estimated 19,000 Indian nationals there, of which about 9,000 are students. The bulk of the students have already returned to India in the month of July on the advice of the High Commission,\" Jaishankar said in the Rajya Sabha.\n\nDhar, the economist quoted earlier, flagged another major concern.\n\n\"If the political crisis escalates and starts affecting the economy, and there is instability as it looks like law and order have broken down completely, it is a worrying sign,\" Dhar said.\n\n\"I am also worried that as economic uncertainty deepens and people start losing their jobs, there are chances of illegal migration.\"", "source": {"uri": "livemint.com",

Her leadership has significantly improved trade and economic relations between the two countries.\n\nHowever, the ongoing crisis in Bangladesh raises concerns about the future of this partnership and its potential impact on India.\n\nThe Indian finance ministry is closely watching the situation in Bangladesh. Sheikh Hasina's tenure has seen a rise in trade between the two nations, with India enjoying a trade surplus. Her departure could disrupt these gains, affecting the flow of goods and people and possibly halting a potential free trade agreement (FTA) between India and Bangladesh.\n\nUnder Hasina, Bangladesh has played a crucial role in combating anti-India terrorist groups and has fostered strong economic and cultural ties with India. In the financial year 2023-24, trade between the two countries reached $13 billion.\n\nBangladesh is a major market for India's cotton exports and imports significant amounts of petroleum products and cereals from India. On the other hand, India imports ready-made garments from Bangladesh, contributing $391 million to their trade.\n\nDiscussions about a free trade agreement began in October 2023, with the aim of reducing or eliminating customs duties on goods traded between the two nations. This agreement could have boosted Bangladesh's exports to India by up to 297% and India's exports by 172%, according to a World Bank paper. However, the future of these discussions is uncertain with the current political instability in Bangladesh.\n\nMohit Singla, chairman of the Trade Promotion Council of India, told the Economic Times, \"With the kharif harvest very near, the agri export basket of over $1.8 billion could be impacted, with soybean, soya bean meal, animal feed such as wheat residues, onion, and rapeseed being the worst hit.\"\n\nAjay Sahai, director general of the Federation of Indian Export Organisations, said, \"Internet disruptions have hurt banking transactions, and commodity exporters are worried about exports to Bangladesh through the land border. The next 7-10 days will be crucial.\"\n\nInfrastructure and connectivity projects have been central to strengthening Indo-Bangladesh relations. Since 2016, India has extended $8 billion in credit for the development of road, rail, shipping, and port infrastructure in Bangladesh.\n\nThe Akhaura-Agartala cross-border rail link and the Khulna-Mongla Port rail line, inaugurated in November 2023, are expected to improve trade and people-to-people exchanges.\n\nAny disruption in these connections could limit India's access to its Northeast region, which is connected through narrow land corridors. Existing bus routes and agreements for using Chittagong and Mongla ports also face potential risks.\n\nIn the financial year 2024, India had a trade surplus of $9.2 billion with Bangladesh. Major exports include cotton, coffee, tea, vegetables, vehicles, and electrical machinery.\n\nThe current unrest has already caused problems such as internet disruptions affecting banking transactions and difficulties in issuing letters of credit, causing concern among exporters, especially in Kolkata.\n\nGiven that a significant portion of exports to Bangladesh falls outside the South Asian Free Trade Area (SAFTA) agreement, and most imports from Bangladesh benefit from zero tariffs, the ongoing unrest poses a serious risk to trade dynamics between the two countries.

PTI\n\nMany people worried that the ouster of Sheikh Hasina in Bangladesh would hurt India.\n\nNow, it seems that the exit of Hasina, a close ally, is already having an impact on India.\n\nTrade between the two nations, which have generally been on an upswing since Hasina took power in 2008, is being affected.\n\nBut what is happening? How is her ouster hurting trade between New Delhi and Dhaka?\n\nFirst, let's take a closer look at trade relations between the two nations.\n\nBangladesh is India's largest trading partner in Asia and its 25th largest overall.\n\nMeanwhile, India is Bangladesh's second-largest trading partner - after China.\n\nAccording to Business Standard, bilateral trade between the two nations stands at $12.9 billion.\n\nNew Delhi currently has a trade surplus of $9.2 billion with Dhaka, as per India Today.\n\nAccording to GTRI, India's exports to Bangladesh are highly diversified, covering sectors like agriculture, textiles, machinery, electronics, auto parts, iron and steel, electricity and plastics.\n\nNotably, most of these exports to Bangladesh are subject to full tariffs and fall outside the South Asian Free Trade Area (SAFTA) agreement.\n\nAs per Indian Express, New Delhi sends around 34.9 per cent of its cotton exports - worth around 2.4 billion this financial year) to Dhaka.\n\nIndia's top import from Bangladesh are readymade garments, amounting to $391 million in FY24.\n\nIn contrast, Bangladesh's exports to India are concentrated in a few categories, with textiles, garments, and made-ups making up 56 per cent of their exports.\n\nThese items benefit from zero tariffs under the SAFTA agreement, extended by India.\n\nIndia's exports to Bangladesh fell to $11 billion in 2023-24 from $12.21 billion in 2022-23, while imports decreased to $1.84 billion from $2 billion in the same period.\n\nThis, experts say, is mainly down to economic issues in Bangladesh.\n\nThink tank Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI) said Bangladesh has been facing a severe dollar shortage, which has limited its ability to import goods, including those from India.\n\nRising inflation in the country has also reduced domestic demand, leading to lower consumption of local and imported products.\n\n\"Bangladesh has been facing a severe dollar shortage, which has limited its ability to import goods, including those from India. The rising inflation in the country has also reduced domestic demand, leading to lower consumption of both local and imported products,\" GTRI said as per Business Standard.\n\nAccording to India Today, Hasina leaving could even halt a potential Free Trade Agreement (FTA) between the two nations.\n\nThe two nations began negotiating an FTA in October 2023.\n\nThe idea was to do away with customs duties on goods\n\nThe outlet quoted a World Bank paper as saying such an agreement could have increased Bangladesh's exports to India by up nearly 300 per cent.\n\nIndia's exports to Bangladesh, meanwhile, could have shot up as much as 172 per cent.\n\nWhat is happening?\n\nNDTV reported that goods trucks have halted at the Changrabandha in West Bengal's Cooch Behar.\n\n\"We estimate that about $300 million worth of export trade has been affected due to the political crisis in Bangladesh. We export about $30 million to Bangladesh every day,\" Ajay Sahai, the Director-General of the Federation of Indian Export Organizations (FIEO) told the outlet.\n\n\"Export has come to a standstill. Many trucks are stuck and even the movement of people with visas has minimised now,\" exporter Dhiraj Guha said.\n\n\"Indian import is happening but export is completely stalled and many of our trucks are stuck,\" another businessman added.\n\nIndia's exports of perishable goods are facing major challenges at the border.\n\nThe Akhurah-Agartala border check post in Tripura is also shut, as per NDTV.\n\n\"Earlier, we used to receive 15 trucks of fish imports daily. Other items would range from about 35 trucks. But today, only one truck of fish and two trucks of other items have entered. There is almost no trade happening and it is hurting us financially,\" goods handler Titan Das told the outlet.\n\nWest Bengal Exporters Coordination Committee secretary Ujjal Saha said trade through land ports in the state has been halted due to \"non-clearance of goods by Bangladesh customs, resulting in hundreds of trucks being lined up in parking lots\".\n\nTrade between the two countries through land ports at Petrapole, Gojadanga, Mahadipur, and Fulbari in West Bengal has been affected, while some passenger movement has been reported but turnout remains low, sources said.\n\nSaha noted that a Bangladesh government notification issued on Sunday declared a three-day holiday till Wednesday, except for essential services.\n\nTrade through Petrapole in North 24 Parganas district, the largest land port, remains halted as the Benapole customs in Bangladesh remained non-functional.\n\nSecurity at the land ports has been increased in response to the situation, he added.\n\nExporters say they are facing disruptions in exports to Bangladesh due to a shortage of foreign exchange in that country.\n\nAjay Srivastava, founder of the Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI), emphasised the need to protect factories in Bangladesh and maintain supply lines to sustain trade and economic activities.\n\n\"As Bangladesh is experiencing political turmoil, it is essential for all political factions to protect garment and other factories and keep supply lines open across the border,\" he said.\n\nEngineering Export Promotion Council chairman Arun Kumar Garodia expressed concern over the political developments in Bangladesh, noting the significant impact on Indian exporters.\n\nMohit Singla, chairman of the Trade Promotion Council of India, told the Economic Times, \"With the kharif harvest very near, the agri export basket of over $1.8 billion could be impacted, with soybean, soya bean meal, animal feed such as wheat residues, onion, and rapeseed being the worst hit.\"\n\nSahai, director general of the Federation of Indian Export Organisations, added, \"Internet disruptions have hurt banking transactions, and commodity exporters are worried about exports to Bangladesh through the land border. The next 7-10 days will be crucial.\"\n\nArpita Mukherjee, professor, Indian Council for Research on International Economic Relations (ICRIER) told Business Standard the scenario is creating uncertainty for exporters.\n\n\"In fact, there will be greater risk for investors,\" said Mukherjee.\n\n\"As Bangladesh experiences political turmoil, it is essential for all political factions to protect garment and other factories and keep supply lines open across the border to sustain trade and economic activity,\" Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI) founder Ajay Srivastava said.\n\nWest Bengal-based exporter and Managing Director of PATTON Sanjay Budhia said that as the two countries have close economic and geographic ties, the crisis can have a significant impact on India's trade.\n\nBudhia said that supply disruptions can affect these sectors, and any crisis leading to border closures or increased security can disrupt the flow of goods, affecting the bilateral trade.\n\n\"While the crisis in Bangladesh poses several risks to India's trade, proactive measures and regional cooperation can help mitigate these impacts and ensure continued economic stability and growth. The need of the hour is to have a balanced approach, keeping the geopolitical and economic considerations in mind,\" he noted.\n\n'Well-diversified'\n\nBut S&P Global Ratings on Tuesday said that India is a well-diversified exporter and a blip in its exports to Bangladesh is unlikely to have any meaningful impact on India's overall trade position for the full year.\n\nS&P Global Ratings, Director, Sovereign and International Public Finance Ratings (Asia-Pacific), Andrew Wood said that S&P expects domestic demand conditions in Bangladesh in this period of time to be weak and probably going to entail less support for exports from other countries, including India, into Bangladesh.\n\n\"India is a well-diversified exporter to the entire world and its trade profile is significantly larger than bilateral trade relationships with economies like Bangladesh.\"\n\n\"Whatever the impact is going to be on directly is really quite unlikely to have a meaningful impact on its overall

This has caused a halt in the clearance of goods at land ports, affecting exporters and leading to a drop in bilateral trade figures. Increased security measures are in place.\n\nIndia-Bangladesh trade, which was disrupted in the wake of the unrest in the neighbouring country and the resignation of embattled prime minister Sheikh Hasina, remained stalled on Tuesday, traders said.\n\nWest Bengal Exporters Coordination Committee secretary Ujjal Saha said trade through land ports in the state has been halted due to ''non-clearance of goods by Bangladesh customs, resulting in hundreds of trucks being lined up in parking lots''.\n\nTrade between the two countries through land ports at Petrapole, Gojadanga, Mahadipur, and Fulbari in West Bengal has been affected, while some passenger movement has been reported but turnout remains low, sources said.\n\nSaha noted that a Bangladesh government notification issued on Sunday declared a three-day holiday till Wednesday, except for essential services.\n\nTrade through Petrapole in North 24 Parganas district, the largest land port, remains halted as the Benapole customs in Bangladesh remained non-functional. Security at the land ports has been increased in response to the situation, he added.\n\nAjay Srivastava, founder of the Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI), emphasised the need to protect factories in Bangladesh and maintain supply lines to sustain trade and economic activities.\n\n''As Bangladesh is experiencing political turmoil, it is essential for all political factions to protect garment and other factories and keep supply lines open across the border,'' he said.\n\nEngineering Export Promotion Council chairman Arun Kumar Garodia expressed concern over the political developments in Bangladesh, noting the significant impact on Indian exporters.\n\nBangladesh, a key destination for Indian engineering products, saw a drop in exports to USD 542.1 million during the April-June period of the 2024-25 fiscal, a decrease of 8.2 per cent from the previous year.\n\nBangladesh is India's largest trade partner in South Asia, and India is the second-largest trade partner for Bangladesh in Asia. India's exports to Bangladesh fell to USD 11 billion in 2023-24 from USD 12.21 billion in 2022-23, while imports decreased to USD 1.84 billion from USD 2 billion in the same period. India's main exports to Bangladesh include vegetables, coffee, tea, spices, sugar, confectionery, refined petroleum oil, chemicals, cotton, iron and steel, and vehicles, while major imports are fish, plastic, leather, and apparel. Bangladesh's exports to India are heavily concentrated in textiles and garments, which constitute 56 per cent of their exports.\n\nHasina landed at the Hindon airbase on the outskirts of Delhi on

Her exit could disrupt these gains, affecting the movement of goods and people and stalling a potential free trade agreement (FTA) between the two nations.\n\nBangladesh has been a crucial ally to India since Hasina came to power in 2009, helping to eliminate anti-India terrorist groups and fostering strong economic, social, and cultural ties. Their bilateral trade reached $13 billion in the financial year 2023-24, with Bangladesh being the top destination for India's cotton exports and a significant importer of petroleum products and cereals. Conversely, India imports ready-made garments from Bangladesh, contributing $391 million to their trade.\n\nThe FTA discussions initiated in October 2023 aimed to reduce or eliminate customs duties on goods traded between the two countries, potentially boosting Bangladesh's exports to India by up to 297% and India's exports by 172%, as estimated by a World Bank working paper. However, the future of these discussions remains uncertain with the interim Bangladeshi government.\n\nMohit Singla, chairman of the Trade Promotion Council of India told the Economic Times: With the kharif harvest very near, agri export basket of over $1.8 billion could be impacted with soybean, soya bean meal, animal feed such as wheat residues, onion and rapeseed, being the worst hit.\"\n\nAjay Sahai, director general of the Federation of Indian Export Organisations, added, \"Internet disruptions have hurt banking transactions and commodity exporters are worried about exports to Bangladesh through the land border. The next 7-10 days will be crucial.\"\n\nInfrastructure and connectivity projects have been pivotal in strengthening Indo-Bangladesh ties. India has extended $8 billion in credit since 2016 for the development of road, rail, shipping, and port infrastructure in Bangladesh. The Akhaura-Agartala cross-border rail link and the Khulna-Mongla Port rail line, inaugurated in November 2023, are expected to enhance trade and people-to-people exchanges.\n\nA disruption in these ties could restrict India's access to the Northeast, currently connected through narrow land corridors. The existing bus routes and agreements for using Chittagong and Mongla ports also face potential risks.\n\nIndia had a $9.2 billion trade surplus with Bangladesh in FY24, with top exports including cotton, coffee, tea, vegetables, vehicles, and electrical machinery. The ongoing unrest has already caused issues such as internet disruptions affecting banking transactions and difficulties in issuing letters of credit, causing concern among exporters, particularly those in Kolkata.\n\nWith a significant portion of exports to Bangladesh falling outside the South Asian Free Trade Area (SAFTA) agreement and most imports from Bangladesh benefiting from zero tariffs, the current unrest poses a substantial risk to the trade dynamics between the two countries. The next few days will be critical in determining the extent of the impact on trade and economic stability in the region.\n\nExperts term situation \"very volatile\"\n\nAs the situation in Bangladesh worsened following Hasina's resignation amid heavy protests, several former diplomats and experts have raised concerns about the scenario and asked the Indian government to remain vigilant.\n\nSeveral experts have cautioned about a huge influx of migrants from Bangladesh and have also raised suspicion of the involvement of a foreign hand behind the unrest in Bangladesh.\n\nFormer Indian High Commissioner to Bangladesh, Veena Sikri has termed the current situation in Bangladesh as \"very volatile\" adding that India is carefully watching the scenario as it wants a stable neighbourhood.\n\nSikri said, \"The situation in Bangladesh is very volatile today. PM Sheikh Hasina gave her resignation yesterday and she has left the country. She is currently in India and the situation is evolving. We have to watch carefully what is happening in Bangladesh. We in India, are watching it very carefully because we want a stable neighborhood. We want there to be stability, economic development, economic interaction with Bangladesh.\"\n\nShe emphasized that although everyone thinks that the crisis unfolded due to the quota protests, but the fact is both Hasina and the students were on the same page on the issue.\n\n\"The world thinks that it was a quota reform movement, a student's movement but the students and PM Hasina have for the longest time been on the same wavelength. It is PM Hasina who abolished the quota in 2018. This year, in the month of June, when the High Court restored the quota, she went to the Supreme Court, again in favour of the students and student groups even joined the government of Bangladesh in going to the Supreme Court,\" Sikri said.\n\nThe former Indian envoy further elaborated how the student protests, turned into clashes between the student wings of Awami League and other opposition political parties, leading to complete \"mayhem.\"", "source": {"uri": "asianlite.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Local News for British Asian and Indian Community in London"}, "authors": [],

As Bangladesh experiences political turmoil, it is essential for all its political factions to protect garment and other factories and keep supply lines open across the border to sustain trade and economic activity,\" said Ajay Srivastava, founder of the Global Trade Research Initiative.\n\nAccording to the Ministry of Commerce, India exported goods worth Rs 91,614 crore to Bangladesh during this period, while it imported goods worth Rs 15,268 crore from Bangladesh. This resulted in a trade surplus in favor of India of Rs 76,346 crore. The data highlights Bangladesh's role as a crucial trading partner for India, and any disruptions will impact the economies of both countries.\n\nIndia's exports to Bangladesh include a diverse range of products, such as cotton yarn, petroleum products, oil meals, spices, and auto components. The current political unrest in Bangladesh threatens these exports, particularly impacting the cotton yarn sector. Indian cotton farmers could be affected if trade disruptions occur. If exports decrease, it could lead to an oversupply of cotton in India, which may lower prices and hurt farmers' incomes.\n\nOn the other hand, India imports several essential commodities from Bangladesh, including ready-made garments (RMG) made of cotton, aircraft and spacecraft parts, jute, leather footwear, and marine products. The RMG sector is especially important, as Bangladesh is a major global exporter of these garments.\n\nAny interruption in the supply of these goods could affect India's textile and garment industries, which depend on these imports for production. Moreover, the Indian aerospace sector, which imports specialized parts from Bangladesh, could also face supply chain issues.\n\n\"India's exports, such as wheat, rice, lentils, onions, spices, sugar, oil cake, and electricity, are crucial for the people. Any disruption in supplies will lead to a massive price rise in Bangladesh and inconvenience to people,\" added Srivastava.\n\nThe ongoing political turmoil in Bangladesh not only disrupts current trade activities but also creates uncertainty about future economic cooperation between the two countries.

Both countries have been a ddddddddddddddddmajor trading partners, engaging in a wide exchange of goods and services.\n\nIn FY 2023-24, the total trade between India and Bangladesh was Rs 1,35,285 crore, with India holding a significant trade surplus.\n\nAlso Read | Nvidia Scraping YouTube and Netflix Videos To Train AI Models: Report.\n\n\"India has a strategic interest in a stable and strong Bangladesh, supporting its economic stability and hoping for peace in the region. As Bangladesh experiences political turmoil, it is essential for all its political factions to protect garment and other factories and keep supply lines open across the border to sustain trade and economic activity,\" said Ajay Srivastava, founder of the Global Trade Research Initiative.\n\nAccording to the Ministry of Commerce, India exported goods worth Rs 91,614 crore to Bangladesh during this period, while it imported goods worth Rs 15,268 crore from Bangladesh. This resulted in a trade surplus in favor of India of Rs 76,346 crore. The data highlights Bangladesh's role as a crucial trading partner for India, and any disruptions will impact the economies of both countries.\n\nAlso Read | Bajaj Chetak 3201 Special Edition Electric Scooter Launched in India, Available Only on Amazon; Check Specifications, Features and Price.\n\nIndia's exports to Bangladesh include a diverse range of products, such as cotton yarn, petroleum products, oil meals, spices, and auto components. The current political unrest in Bangladesh threatens these exports, particularly impacting the cotton yarn sector. Indian cotton farmers could be affected if trade disruptions occur. If exports decrease, it could lead to an oversupply of cotton in India, which may lower prices and hurt farmers' incomes.\n\nOn the other hand, India imports several essential commodities from Bangladesh, including ready-made garments (RMG) made of cotton, aircraft and spacecraft parts, jute, leather footwear, and marine products. The RMG sector is especially important, as Bangladesh is a major global exporter of these garments.\n\nAny interruption in the supply of these goods could affect India's textile and garment industries, which depend on these imports for production. Moreover, the Indian aerospace sector, which imports specialized parts from Bangladesh, could also face supply chain issues.\n\n\"India's exports, such as wheat, rice, lentils, onions, spices, sugar, oil cake, and electricity, are crucial for the people. Any disruption in supplies will lead to a massive price rise in Bangladesh and inconvenience to people,\" added Srivastava.\n\nThe ongoing political turmoil in Bangladesh not only disrupts current trade activities but also creates uncertainty about future economic cooperation between the two countries. Given Bangladesh's importance as a trading partner, continued instability could lead to a prolonged reduction in trade volumes.\n\nIf the situation persists in the long run, it might force Indian businesses to seek alternative markets or suppliers, which could be challenging.

The exports to Bangladesh were already facing issues due to the shortage of foreign exchange in the protest-hit country, but with the current developments, the businesses may face more disruptions.\n\nBangladesh is India's biggest trading partner in the subcontinent and India is its second biggest export partner. As per the Ministry of Commerce, Bangladesh saw a trade deficit of $9.2 billion with India in the financial year ending FY24, down from $10.1 billion in FY23, while in four months of FY24, the deficit stood at $2.3 billion.\n\nIndia's overall exports to the neighbouring country stood at $11 billion in the fiscal year ending March 2024, a 9.45% drop from $12.21 billion in the previous year. Imports, on the other hand, dipped to $1.84 billion, an 8.7% drop from $2 billion a year ago, the ministry data shows.\n\nThe exports had touched its highest value at $16.1 billion in FY22, up from $9.6 billion in FY21. Imports from Bangladesh remain almost flat in the past few years, with the value hitting its peak at $2 bn in FY23.\n\nGlobally, Bangladesh remains the 4th top export destination for India, with vegetables, coffee, tea, cotton yarn, petroleum products, other cereals, chemicals, iron, steel, and vehicles accounting for the most. India's imports from Bangladesh include fish, leather, apparel, plastic and others.\n\nLast year, Bangladesh became the 19th nation that signed for bilateral trade settlements in the Indian rupee. To stem dollar outflow, policymakers in India's neighbourhood signed rupee trade settlement deals, providing a boon for nations like Bangladesh that run trade deficits with India. To settle cross-border trade with India, Bangladesh authorised its two banks Sonali Bank and Eastern Bank Limited to open Rupee Vostro accounts with India's ICICI bank and State Bank of India.\n\nOverall, in fiscal year 2024, India experienced a drop in trade, with exports falling by 3.1% and imports by 5.7% from the previous year. According to the GTRI data, from FY 2019 to FY 2024, India's total merchandise exports increased 32.41%, from $330.08 billion to $437.07 billion, and imports rose by 31.39%, from $514.08 billion to $675.44 billion.\n\nThe death toll in Bangladesh, meanwhile, has risen to 300, with curfew and internet blackouts imposed in several areas seeing the anti-government protests. Former prime minister Sheikh Hasina, who resigned on Monday as protests went out of control, fled the country with her sister Rehana to land in India. Her abrupt departure even prompted protesters to storm her official residence. Bangladesh Army Chief General Waqar-uz-Zaman, who has taken charge of the interim government, urged citizens to cease violence and promised a probe into the recent killings. The unrest began with student protests over quotas in July, resulting in over 300 deaths. Violence escalated on July 16 after clashes between protesters, security officials, and pro-government activists.", "source": {"uri": "fortuneindia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "FortuneIndia"},

Both countries have been a ddddddddddddddddmajor trading partners, engaging in a wide exchange of goods and services.\n\nIn FY 2023-24, the total trade between India and Bangladesh was Rs 1,35,285 crore, with India holding a significant trade surplus.\n\n\"India has a strategic interest in a stable and strong Bangladesh, supporting its economic stability and hoping for peace in the region. As Bangladesh experiences political turmoil, it is essential for all its political factions to protect garment and other factories and keep supply lines open across the border to sustain trade and economic activity,\" said Ajay Srivastava, founder of the Global Trade Research Initiative.\n\nAccording to the Ministry of Commerce, India exported goods worth Rs 91,614 crore to Bangladesh during this period, while it imported goods worth Rs 15,268 crore from Bangladesh. This resulted in a trade surplus in favor of India of Rs 76,346 crore. The data highlights Bangladesh's role as a crucial trading partner for India, and any disruptions will impact the economies of both countries.\n\nIndia's exports to Bangladesh include a diverse range of products, such as cotton yarn, petroleum products, oil meals, spices, and auto components. The current political unrest in Bangladesh threatens these exports, particularly impacting the cotton yarn sector. Indian cotton farmers could be affected if trade disruptions occur. If exports decrease, it could lead to an oversupply of cotton in India, which may lower prices and hurt farmers' incomes.\n\nOn the other hand, India imports several essential commodities from Bangladesh, including ready-made garments (RMG) made of cotton, aircraft and spacecraft parts, jute, leather footwear, and marine products. The RMG sector is especially important, as Bangladesh is a major global exporter of these garments.\n\nAny interruption in the supply of these goods could affect India's textile and garment industries, which depend on these imports for production. Moreover, the Indian aerospace sector, which imports specialized parts from Bangladesh, could also face supply chain issues.\n\n\"India's exports, such as wheat, rice, lentils, onions, spices, sugar, oil cake, and electricity, are crucial for the people. Any disruption in supplies will lead to a massive price rise in Bangladesh and inconvenience to people,\" added Srivastava.\n\nThe ongoing political turmoil in Bangladesh not only disrupts current trade activities but also creates uncertainty about future economic cooperation between the two countries. Given Bangladesh's importance as a trading partner, continued instability could lead to a prolonged reduction in trade volumes.\n\nIf the situation persists in the long run, it might force Indian businesses to seek alternative markets or suppliers, which could be challenging. The current scenario highlights the importance of political stability for maintaining strong economic ties and the potential consequences when such stability is lacking.

Economic Impact on India Amid Political Turmoil in Neighbourhood", "body": "How Bangladesh's Political Unrest Could Impact India's Economy and Trade Relations\n\nBangladesh Unrest: Ever since Sheikh Hasina became prime minister in 2009, Bangladesh has been an indispensable ally of India, greatly improving commercial and economic ties between the two countries. Nonetheless, questions over this partnership's survival and its possible effects on India are raised by the continuing turmoil in Bangladesh.\n\nStrong Trade Relations Under Hasina's Leadership\n\nTrade between India and Bangladesh has increased significantly under Sheikh Hasina's leadership, with India continuing to maintain a trade surplus. Trade reached $13 billion between the two nations in the fiscal year 2023-2024. India now exports a significant amount of cotton to Bangladesh, which also buys a sizable amount of cereals and petroleum goods. On the other hand, India buys $391 million worth of ready-made clothing from Bangladesh, offsetting their trade deficit.\n\nPotential Disruption of Free Trade Agreement Talks\n\nTalks over a possible free trade agreement (FTA) to lower or do away with customs taxes on products transported between Bangladesh and India started in October 2023. A World Bank report estimates that this deal might increase India's exports by 172% and Bangladesh's exports to India by up to 297%. But the future of these conversations is dubious given Bangladesh's present political unrest.\n\nConcerns from Indian Exporters\n\nIndian exporters are growing more concerned about possible disruptions resulting from the upheaval in Bangladesh. Concerns about the effects on the agri-export basket, which is valued at over $1.8 billion and consists of goods including soybean, soya bean meal, animal feed, wheat residues, onions, and rapeseed,.\n\nInfrastructure and Connectivity Projects at Risk\n\nTo improve bilateral ties, India has made large investments in connectivity and infrastructure projects in Bangladesh. India has provided $8 billion in financing since 2016 for the construction of port, rail, road, and maritime infrastructure. The November 2023 opening of the Khulna-Mongla Port rail line and the Akhaura-Agartala cross-border rail link are two notable projects.\n\nThe Northeast region of India is connected by a network of small land corridors, therefore any disruption in these linkages could restrict India's access to that area. There could be dangers associated with agreements to use the ports in Mongla and Chittagong as well as existing bus routes.\n\nEconomic Implications of the Unrest\n\nIndia and Bangladesh had a $9.2 billion trade surplus in the 2024 fiscal year. Cotton, coffee, tea, vegetables, automobiles, and electrical machinery were among the top exports. The ongoing upheaval has already resulted in issues that have alarmed exporters, especially in Kolkata: internet outages that impact banking operations and challenges obtaining letters of credit.\n\nGiven that a significant portion of exports to Bangladesh falls outside the South Asian Free Trade Area (SAFTA) agreement and most imports from Bangladesh benefit from zero tariffs, the ongoing unrest poses a serious risk to trade dynamics between the two countries. The coming days will be critical in assessing the impact on trade and economic stability in the region.", "source": {"uri": "dnpindia.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "DNP INDIA"}, "authors": [{"uri": "harsh_tyagi@dnpindia.in", "name": "Harsh Tyagi", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheikh_Hasina", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sheikh Hasina"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_trade_agreement", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Free trade agreement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balance_of_trade", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Balance of trade"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prime minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapeseed", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rapeseed"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onion", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Onion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soybean", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Soybean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Petroleum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Customs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cotton", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cotton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheat", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wheat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cereal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cereal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiscal_year", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fiscal year"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Car"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Asian_Free_Trade_Area", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "South Asian Free Trade Area"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northeast_Region,_Brazil", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Northeast Region, Brazil"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tea", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tariff", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tariff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Port"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coffee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vegetable", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vegetable"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolkata", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kolkata"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kolkata"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chittagong", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chittagong"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chittagong"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/International_Business_and_Trade", "label": "dmoz/Business/International Business and Trade", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day_Trading", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day Trading", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Trading", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Trading", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/International_Business_and_Trade/Import_and_Export", "label": "dmoz/Business/International Business and Trade/Import and Export", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Consumer_Goods_and_Services/Marketplaces", "label": "dmoz/Business/Consumer Goods and Services/Marketplaces", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://www.dnpindia.in/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Bangladesh-Unrest-2.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792287", "eventUri": "eng-9792287", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 171, "relevance": 1}

Photograph: Mohammad Ponir Hossain/Reuters\n\nWith the crisis in Bangladesh intensifying, the textile sector, which contributes a lion's share of its exports, is likely to be a victim of the turmoil, with international buyers shifting their focus to alternative markets like India.\n\nIndia's gain will be an additional business of $300 million to $400 million per month if 10-11 per cent of the neighbouring country's export is diverted to Indian hubs like Tiruppur, say industry experts.\n\n\"We expect orders may start coming to Tiruppur, and this financial year, they are expected to be at least 10 per cent more than last year's,\" said K M Subramanian, president of the Tiruppur Exporters' Association.\n\nBangladesh's monthly apparel export is $3.5 billion to $3.8 billion and has a high double-digit share in the European Union and the United Kingdom and a 10 per cent market share in the United States.\n\nIndia is exporting in the range $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion per month.\n\n\"This is unfortunate and if the current disruption lasts long, it will affect buyer sentiment. Initially, buyers will likely shift some orders to India and other countries. We have the capacity to handle an additional $300 million to $400 million in orders immediately,\" said Prabhu Damodaran, secretary to the Indian Texpreneurs Federation, an industry body.\n\nThe crisis has come at a time when Bangladesh was expected to cross $50 billion in annual exports in 2024, compared to around $47 billion in 2023.\n\nIn addition to this, manufacturing units owned by Indians in Bangladesh are also likely to shift their base to India.\n\nAccording to trade-policy analyst S Chandrasekaran, around 25 per cent of the units in Bangladesh are owned by Indians.\n\nThey include companies like Shahi Exports, House of Pearl Fashions, Jay Jay Mills, TCNS, Gokaldas Images, and Ambattur Clothing.\n\n\"The movement of consignments is stuck, and there is a breakdown in the supply chain for the upcoming Christmas season. India has an advantage here because orders will be diverted,\" Chandrasekaran added. \"The sudden drop in global volumes may be compensated by a rise in Indian exports.\"\n\nIndia-Bangladesh trade headed for uncertainty:\n\nShreya Nandi\n\nNew Delhi's trade and investment relationship with Dhaka may have entered a phase of uncertainty after Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina resigned following weeks of violent demonstrations and their army chief declared that an interim government will now run the country.\n\nBangladesh is India's 25th largest trading partner, with the size of the bilateral trade at $12.9 billion.\n\nThe trade is dominated by exports, with Bangladesh being India's eighth largest export partner. In FY24, India's exports to Bangladesh contracted 9.5 per cent to $11 billion.\n\nOver the last two years, outbound shipments to Dhaka have been declining.\n\nFor instance, during FY22, Bangladesh was India's fourth largest export market.\n\nHowever, outbound shipments were affected by factors such as dollar shortage, high inflation and other factors like India's export restrictions on essential items such as wheat and some categories of rice.\n\nBangladesh is also a key destination for Indian auto exports, alongside African and Latin American countries.\n\nThe political unrest in the neighbouring country could also pose risk for investors for their existing projects and may lead to an influx of illegal migrants into India.\n\n\"The political unrest in Bangladesh will create uncertainty for exporters. In fact, there will be greater risk for investors,\" said Arpita Mukherjee, professor, Indian Council for Research on International Economic Relations.\n\nAccording to Delhi-based think tank Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI), India's exports, such as onions, other agricultural products, and electricity, are crucial for the people and economy of Bangladesh and may not be significantly affected by the unrest.\n\n'However, Bangladesh's economic challenges have negatively impacted bilateral trade in recent years... Bangladesh has been facing a severe dollar shortage, which has limited its ability to import goods, including those from India. The rising inflation in the country has also reduced domestic demand, leading to lower consumption of both local and imported products,' GTRI said.\n\nIndia's imports from Bangladesh contracted 8.7 per cent to $1.8 billion in 2023-24. Top inbound shipments include iron and steel products, textiles and leather goods, among others.\n\nBiswajit Dhar, distinguished professor at the Council for Social Development, said that Bangladesh is very important and a large market for India.\n\n\"Political uncertainty in Bangladesh will certainly hit us on the trade front. If the political uncertainty spills over to economic uncertainty,\" Dhar added, \"then Bangladesh's economy will get affected. That may result in illegal migration into India.\"\n\nFeature Presentation: Aslam Hunani/Rediff.com", "source": {"uri": "rediff.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Rediff.com India Ltd."}, "authors":

Imports too declined to USD 1.84 billion in the last fiscal, from USD 2 billion in 2022-23.\n\nIndia's main exports include vegetables, coffee, tea, spices, sugar, confectionery, refined petroleum oil, chemicals, cotton, iron and steel, and vehicles. The main import items are fish, plastic, leather, and apparel, among others.

However, the impact will likely be for the short-term, while the textile and jute sectors may gain in the long term as buyers abroad look for a safe destination for timely delivery.\n\nWeeks of violent protests in Dhaka led to Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina Wajed resigning on Monday and leaving for India for a \"very short stay\".\n\nTop export market\n\nData gathered by businessline show that Bangladesh is a top-10 export market for India, with exports totalling $11 billion in 2023-24. It is a top-5 destination with which it has a trade balance of $9.2 billion. The export basket is well diversified from perishables, cotton, iron and steel, automobiles and components, to spices, India export a diverse set of goods to the neighbouring country.\n\nFIEO Director-General and CEO Ajay Sahai said the disruption in trade is a cause of concern, particularly perishables.\n\n\"Bangladesh is a very important export market for us. Trade has been impacted over the last fortnight. There were issues with clearances and logistics. We are concerned with the export of perishables. We hope things will get better because they also require perishables,\" he said.\n\n\"Cotton exports to Bangladesh have come to a complete halt. Since last month there has been no export of cotton and yarn to Bangladesh,\" said Ramanuj Das Boob, a sourcing agent for multinationals and domestic firms from Karnataka's Raichur.\n\n\"Some quantity meant for Bangladesh is stocked here and at Bangladesh bordering cities like Bangaon. We don't know when it will open up,\" Das Boob said.\n\nBangladesh is the main destination for Indian cotton exports. India's raw cotton exports to Bangladesh, including waste, stood at $633 million during 2023-24. Bangladesh accounted for over half of India's raw cotton exports, including waste valued at $1.12 billion during 2023-24.\n\nHowever, Atul Ganatra, President, the Cotton Association of India, said the ongoing crisis will not impact exports. \"This is a slack season. So hardly any effects,\" Ganatra said.\n\nAnand Popat, a Rajkot-based trader in cotton, yarn, and cotton waste, said in the short term India could suffer a reverse in cotton exports.\n\n\"There will be little impact on cotton yarn, though trade in cotton and yarn has been halted. But in the long-term, India could stand to gain as buyers abroad could turn to India for garments,\" he said.\n\nTerming as unfortunate the turbulence in Bangladesh, Prabhu Dhamodharan, Convenor of the Indian Texpreneurs' Federation, said Bangladesh's monthly apparel exports are $3.5-3.8 billion, and this current unrest will create fear among international buyers, particularly concerning delivery times.\n\n\"As a de-risking strategy, buyers may divert some orders to other countries, including India. With our monthly run rate of $1.3-1.5 billion in apparel exports, we can handle an additional $300-400 million in monthly volumes,\" he said.\n\nA healthy Bangladeshi apparel sector is crucial for the Indian spinning and fabric sectors. Due to their lack of capacity in spinning and fabrics, their dependency on India is high. \"We expect normalcy in at least a week in terms of trade. In such a case, there will be strong momentum for yarn exports to fill the gap created by their local production issues,\" he said.\n\nOilmeal exports\n\nTerming Bangladesh as a major trade partner, BV Mehta, Executive Director of the Solvent Extractors' Association of India (SEA), said India exported about 9 lakh tonnes (lt) of oilmeals - 4.3 lt each of soyabean meal and rapeseed meal, and 30,000 tonnes of rice bran extractions - in 2023-24, accounting for 18 per cent of total oilmeals exports.\n\nMost of these are exported by train and road. Stating that unrest in Bangladesh will impact India unless it is stopped, he said: \"We have to stop our exports for the time being. Let us wait and watch when the normalcy returns.\"\n\nA prominent onion trader said over the past three days, no onion trucks has crossed the border into Bangladesh, the primary export destination this year.\n\n\"Some onions were previously being exported to Bangladesh on a Letter of Credit (LC) basis, but the situation has changed dramatically,\" said the trader.\n\n\"Currently, no truck is crossing the border, and vegetables are not being exported. Traders in Bangladesh indicate that it will take a few days for the situation to normalize. The main issue is the lack of available banking channels, making business transactions impossible,\" he said.\n\nHe said 2024 has been the worst year for onion exports, with Bangladesh being the only significant outlet, which is now also closed.\n\nSeafood exports\n\nSeafood exports to Dhaka are at stake, though the quantity is \"negligible\", official sources said. India exported 58,701 tonnes of seafood worth \u20b9318 crore to Bangladesh in 2023-24, which mainly consists of dry fish and a limited quantity cuttle fish Rohu from Andhra Pradesh. Dry fish from Gujarat and Chennai also find their way into in Bangladesh. These low value fish are mainly exported by road through the border check posts in trucks, official sources said.\n\nA jute industry insider said imports of high-quality jute from the neighbouring country are at stake. The jute imported from Bangladesh are re-exported as value-added products to the US, Europe and Africa nations. \"Right now, there is no problem as the industry had stocked up in advance and may not need the material for another 3 months,\" the insider said.\n\nAn industry source said the country may gain from exports of jute products too as Bangladesh's situation could force buyers to turn to India.\n\nManufacturing sector\n\nThe political turmoil in Bangladesh has impacted some Indian businesses who set up manufacturing bases there. M Rafeeque Ahmed, Chairman of Farida Group, said his shoe manufacturing facility there was hit by the shutdown. \"We are to meet European delivery orders. We hope normalcy is restored,\" he said.\n\n(With inputs from Sindhu Hariharan in Chennai, Vishwanath Kulkarni in Bengaluru, Radheshyam Jadhav in Pune, Vinayak AJ in Mangaluru, Mithun Das Gupta in

While perishable exports were continuing as usual, they too have been affected since yesterday.\n\nErratic internet has posed challenges in the banking sector, further impacting exports. However, feedback from Indian exporters in contact with their Bangladeshi counterparts suggests that the problem may be short-lived, and normalcy could be restored soon, allowing business to resume as usual.\n\nFIEO is in close touch with exporters who have businesses in Bangladesh. Sahai said that those who have invested in Bangladesh are concerned at this point, and some with urgent orders are looking to execute those supplies from India to meet customer requirements. Currently, they are not making definitive decisions on how to handle the situation.\n\nIn the last financial year, bilateral trade between India and Bangladesh was around USD 12.8 billion, with India having a trade surplus.\n\nIndia's exports to Bangladesh were approximately USD 11 billion, including commodities such as cotton, petroleum products, automobiles and auto components, machinery, articles of iron and steel, fruits and vegetables, tea, coffee, spices, and animal feed.\n\nImports from Bangladesh amounted to USD 1.8 billion, primarily comprising textile products such as apparel, made-ups, yarn, and fabric, as well as leather goods, fruits, fish, and animal feed.", "source": {"uri": "greaterkashmir.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Greater Kashmir"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federation_of_Indian_Export_Organisations", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federation of Indian Export Organisations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Car"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_feed", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Animal feed"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yarn", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Yarn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balance_of_trade", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Balance of trade"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tea", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fruit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fruit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leather", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Leather"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Textile", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Textile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Petroleum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cotton", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cotton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coffee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vegetable", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vegetable"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spice", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clothing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Clothing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiscal_year", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fiscal year"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Commodity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States dollar"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Consumer_Goods_and_Services/Marketplaces", "label": "dmoz/Business/Consumer Goods and Services/Marketplaces", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://www-greaterkashmir-com.imagibyte.sortdcdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Bangladesh-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792287", "eventUri": "eng-9792287", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-06", "textStart": 11, "textEnd": 17}], "sentiment": 0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 160, "relevance": 1}

The political turbulence in the country may not only put a strain on diplomacy but also hit trade prospects, lend uncertainty to on-going projects and increase influx of immigrants.\n\nStrategically, the situation is challenging for New Delhi as Hasina was seen as a \"close friend of India\" and ties between the two nations had strengthened during her regime. With her ouster, some other nations competing with India for influence in the region, for instance China, may try to take advantage, some analysts say. It would also be a diplomatic problem to handle the increased number of illegal immigrants from the country who may want refuge in India.\n\nEconomic uncertainties\n\n\"Bangladesh is our close and strategic partner. Hence, instability in the neighbourhood has obvious diaspora and security imperatives which might already be felt. Influx of refugees escaping violence can become a problem. External powers, inimical to India's interests may gain ground, which will have to be factored in,\" Ambassador Anil Trigunayat told businessline.\n\nPeople from the British Bangladeshi community step on an image of Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina on a banner following her resignation, in a park in East London, Britain | Photo Credit: TOBY MELVILLE\n\nThe political crisis will surely spill over into the economic sphere, said Biswajit Dhar, Distinguished Professor, Council for Social Development. \"Bangladesh has emerged as a major export destination for India. Before India's rice export ban, the country was among the top five export destinations. Its economy has been growing at a decent rate. But the political crisis has brought in a whole lot of economic uncertainties,\" Dhar said. When an economy gets on a downhill, prospects of a growing market goes out of the window, he added.\n\nHasina had received a lot of flak from the Opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) for \"going out of the way\" to strike deals with India for various infrastructure projects, Dhar pointed out. Now that she has been ousted, one needed to watch out for what lay ahead.\n\nTrade prospects\n\nThe first items to get affected because of the turmoil are perishables. \"Temporarily trade has taken a hit. There are more worries on the commodities front. India exports perishables such as onions and other vegetables to Bangladesh. If clearance is delayed and logistics poses a challenge, the consignments would be at risk,\" pointed out Ajay Sahai from exporters body FIEO.\n\nIf the internet outage in Bangladesh continues, banks will have an issue functioning as they work on internet, which will create further delays, Sahai said.\n\nPolitical ramifications\n\n\"As Bangladesh experiences political turmoil, it is essential for all political factions to protect garment and other factories and keep supply lines open across the border to sustain trade and economic activity,\" pointed out Ajay Srivastava from Global Trade and Research Initiative.\n\nIndia's exports to Bangladesh in 2023-24 were valued at $11.1 billion, down from $12.2 billion in 2022-23 and $16.2 billion in 2021-22, because of multiple factors such as India's ban on rice exports and a severe dollar shortage in the neighbouring country. India's imports from Bangladesh were at $1.8 billion in 2023-24.\n\nSHARE Copy linkEmailFacebookTwitterTelegramLinkedInWhatsAppRedditPublished on August 5, 2024", "source": {"uri": "thehindubusinessline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "@businessline"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Bangladesh", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of Bangladesh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheikh_Hasina", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sheikh Hasina"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diplomacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Diplomacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illegal_immigration", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Illegal immigration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Immigration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Bangladeshis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "British Bangladeshis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_London", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "East London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "East London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diaspora", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Diaspora"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rice", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refugee", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Refugee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bandar_Seri_Begawan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bandar Seri Begawan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bandar Seri Begawan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brunei"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh_Nationalist_Party", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh Nationalist Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onion", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Onion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Logistics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-aircraft_warfare", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anti-aircraft warfare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Commodity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Sikhism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Sikhism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Consumer_Goods_and_Services/Marketplaces", "label": "dmoz/Business/Consumer Goods and Services/Marketplaces", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://bl-i.thgim.com/public/incoming/wt5gp6/article68489535.ece/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1200/2024-08-05T141355Z_244726063_RC2N99A0H4Q7_RTRMADP_3_BANGLADESH-PROTESTS.JPG", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792287", "eventUri": "eng-9792287", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 152, "relevance": 1}

What's worked for the nation is access to cheap Chinese fabric, leaner labour laws and mammoth factories.\n\nNow, with the crisis in Bangladesh intensifying, expectations have emerged that Indian textiles could become the next best choice for European, British, and American markets, providing a much-needed boost for a sector that has seen a slowdown in outbound shipments.\n\nCan India benefit?\n\nAccording to some experts, temporary setbacks in any country may not have an immediate impact on the long-term trading relationship between a buyer and a seller.\n\nIndia Ratings' chief economist Devendra Pant said that if the unrest in Bangladesh continues, it may offer an opportunity for India's textiles sector, but if it is resolved sooner than later, it is unlikely that buyers will shift base.\n\nThe question around the opportunity a crisis in Bangladesh offers India's textile sector is crucial given that the former has been a mainstay for key international buyers when it comes to ready-made garments.\n\nAt nearly $47 billion, ready-made garments constituted 84.6 percent of Bangladesh's total exports in 2022-23.\n\nAs per Rahul Mehta, chief mentor, Clothing Manufacturers Association of India (CMAI), if the country is set to face economic or political instability for a prolonged period, buyers may want another option and India may possibly be the next best choice.\n\nHowever, Mehta added that given that India and Bangladesh's fortes in this sector lie in different metrics, it may not be that India is a shoo-in as the preferred destination for buyers.\n\n\"India and Bangladesh's strengths in the sector are very different. Bangladesh has large factories with sometimes as much as 20,000 workers capable of taking bulk production. India's strength is more in smaller-quantity orders, in flexible and value-added requirements. It is not going to be cakewalk for Indian exporters to get into this space,\" Mehta said.\n\nVishal S. Budhia, secretary for the South Gujarat Textile Processors Welfare Association, said the impact could be a mixed bag for the Indian textile sector. While garment-manufacturing states and districts like Coimbatore, Tirupur and Delhi may benefit, Surat would lose more than gain.\n\n\"Surat is not a garment exporter and is primarily a net exporter directly or indirectly to Bangladesh for products such as sarees as well as for fabrics used in garment manufacturing. Therefore, Surat will be more hurt than benefited,\" Budhia said.\n\nBudhia estimates a loss of around Rs 9-10 crore per day in exports to Bangladesh during the upcoming festive season that lasts around 120 days.\n\n\"Especially ahead of Durga Puja, we see good demand from eastern India and Bangladesh because new designs are sent from Surat. We had prepared for sales which may get impacted. We export around 3-5 lakh sarees per day to Bangladesh, so a fair amount of that could be impacted as many of it could get stuck at the borders,\" he added.\n\nWhile the ready-made garments sector is the single biggest export earner for Bangladesh, it was only 3.35 percent of India's total outbound shipments in FY24. In fact, New Delhi is looking to extend its production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme to this category of textiles in a bid to boost trade.\n\nThe Budget allocation for the PLI scheme for textiles has also been increased to Rs 45 crore for the ongoing fiscal year from a mere Rs 5 crore in 2023-24\n\nIndian exports of all categories of textiles dropped 3.23 percent on-year to $34.40 billion in FY24, as per commerce ministry data.\n\nThe China angle\n\nThe ongoing turmoil in Bangladesh could further strengthen the western world's China plus one policy wherein buyers may now look to diversify supply chains beyond Bangladesh.\n\n\"In the long run, Indian exporters can have an edge. The western world was already looking at a China plus one strategy and that place was largely occupied by Bangladesh. This kind of upheaval will only strengthen the buyer's resolve to diversify supply chains and that is where India may benefit,\" Mehta said.\n\nBudhia concurred that since Bangladesh plays a pivotal role in the western world's China plus one strategy, Indian garment makers could get an immediate benefit from the turmoil in Dhaka.\n\nBut yet another China angle could make it harder for India to take advantage of the crisis in its neighbourhood. Bangladesh's pricing edge in textiles is a result of the nation's cheaper Chinese fabric\n\n\"Bangladesh primarily uses Chinese fabrics via imports from China. That is not encouraged in India. The question is whether those kinds of fabrics are available in India, whether we can import them to the same extent, whether Indian fabric can compete in international markets when pricing is concerned. All these are questions that needs to be answered before we can start saying by how India will gain from the crisis,\" CMAI's Mehta said.\n\nHe added that India needs to focus on increasing domestic capacity, enhance its skilled workforce and offer a greater range of products to effectively become a preferred source for the world's textile needs.\n\n\"India is focusing on a product category that is of smaller importance in world trade. In apparels, we are focused on low- to mid-priced casual wear, which is 80 percent of our exports, whereas man-made fibre and speciality garments are products that occupy 65 percent of world trade, where we are totally absent,\" Mehta pointed out.\n\nSmall wins?\n\nGiven the fluidity of the situation, the impact on trade is a tough question at this point. But recent developments point to difficult times for Bangladesh's garment factories.\n\nA day after Sheikh Hasina stepped down as prime minister and fled Bangladesh, the country's main garments manufacturers' body called for a total shutdown of all facilities, a BBC report said on Tuesday. This is seen as a major disruption to key industries.\n\nThe complete shutdown of all garment factories across Bangladesh will hit apparel giants such as H&M and Zara.\n\nMehta said, \"Whether the buyers are based out of UK, France, Germany or India, they will watch the situation carefully. If a riot-like situation continues for three months or more, the well-being of factories in Bangladesh may be impacted. But if the military is able to improve the law and order situation and life returns to normalcy soon, then I don't see an immediate shifting of orders.\"\n\nBut what could be of significance, according to Mehta, is that buyers like Reliance and Arvind, stationed in India and importing from Bangladesh for duty exemptions, may reduce their share of such inbound shipments from the neighbouring nation and instead look at Vietnam, Myanmar or indeed reconsider China, or even ask some of the local manufacturers to up their capacity.\n\nMeanwhile, Budhia expects a more immediate advantage for Indian garments manufacturers due to the tensions in Dhaka. \"Key western markets such as the US and UK would start ordering materials for Christmastime around now. So I am sure buyers may have immediately shifted inquiries from last week given the situation in Bangladesh,\" Budhia said.\n\nWhether India ultimately gains from the meltdown in its neighbouring state may depend on how long the crisis lasts.\n\nAs India Ratings' Pant said, \"If the situation turns out to be more fluid than what it is right now, if it impacts the supply chain, and manufacturing and production lines in Bangladesh, we may see a shift in buyers. But, whatever its impact, it will be felt after a lag, it won't be immediate.\"", "source": {"uri": "moneycontrol.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MoneyControl"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

Indian exports of two-wheelers, trucks, and buses to Bangladesh are likely to be severely hit this month with the South Asian nation grappling with a deadly civil unrest.\n\nBajaj Auto, India's largest exporter of two- and three-wheelers, ships around 3.6% of its monthly exports to Bangladesh. At Hero MotoCorp, Bangladesh contributes 20-30% of its sales outside India.\n\nTwo-wheeler makers from India also have manufacturing facilities in Bangladesh to meet local regulations and save on high customs duties.

Hero MotoCorp, with a 15-16% market share and an annual volume of 60,000 units, is the second largest by volume.

Since then, it hasn't recovered.

Companies like Vardhman Textiles, KPR Mills, GHCL Textiles and Sportking experienced substantial gains during the day.\n\nV Nagappan, a stock analyst, commenting on the increase in stock prices of various textile and spinning companies says, \"Many of them have begun performing well with new and dynamic management unlike in the past where the owners were like Zamindars and their lieutenants running the show. NexGen is doing better. Bangladesh uncertainty adds to FDA issues.\"\n\nThe increase in stock price was anticipated due to the expectation that many foreign buyers would now be looking at India as a China Plus policy, said a source. Bangladesh has built a strong garment industry over the past decade. It holds an edge over India in the global readymade garments market, which was valued at around $1,110 billion in 2023.\n\nTrade impact\n\nIndia's exports of readymade garments (RMG), including cotton accessories, stood at $16 billion in FY23. In comparison, Bangladesh's RMG exports topped $47 billion, according to data on the web.\n\nIt is unfortunate to note the internal turbulence in Bangladesh. As a dominant player in apparel exports, the concern over timely delivery from Bangladesh may lead to order diversion to countries like India particularly for cotton apparel. \"We have some spare capacity available in India to handle an additional 20 per cent of orders immediately,\" said Prabhu Dhamodharan, Convenor, Indian Texpreneurs Federation, Coimbatore.\n\nSector impact\n\nIn yarn and fabric exports, with Bangladesh being a major buyer of Indian cotton yarn and fabrics, the spinning sector may face short-term issues. A swift recovery in Bangladesh is crucial for these two sectors. Once the businesses resume production, which can happen in a week, demand for yarn and fabric may rebound strongly to manage the Shortages created by the disruption in their spinning sector.\n\nApparel imports from Bangladesh have already been declining over the past few months, and a further drastic reduction in imports is expected. Consequently, goods may not arrive in time for India's upcoming festival season. This will help Indian manufacturers to get more orders from domestic retailers, he said.\n\nK Venkatachalam, Chief Advisor of the Tamil Nadu Spinning Mills Association, said that If garment orders diverted to India, the country has sufficient infrastructure to cater for any requirements. This opportunity needs to be capitalised suitably.\n\nA temporary slowdown in yarn sales is anticipated, but it should stabilise in a month or so, said SK Sundararaman, Chairman, The Southern India Mills' Association (SIMA).\n\n\"Bangladesh is the biggest customer for yarn exports as of now. with around 25 per cent to 30 per cent of exports goes to Bangladesh. Any disruption over there will create issues here as well. However, this situation is relatively minor and has not yet impacted demand. But unless it is resolved or it continues for a long period, then there could be a concern.

Their total bilateral trade amounted to $13 billion in the financial year 2023-24, according to the Union Ministry of Commerce.\n\nBangladesh is the biggest export destination for India's cotton, accounting for 34.9% of India's total cotton exports (some $2.4 billion in FY24). Other major Indian exports to Bangladesh are petroleum products and cereals. India's top import from Bangladesh are readymade garments, amounting to $391 million in FY24. In recent years, Bangladesh has emerged as a major global hub for textiles.\n\nIn October 2023, India and Bangladesh began discussions on an FTA during a meeting of the Joint Working Group on Trade in Dhaka. An FTA would reduce or eliminate customs duties on goods traded between India and Bangladesh, and ease norms to help promote further trade and investments.\n\nA 2012 working paper published by the World Bank estimated that a full FTA for goods would increase Bangladesh's exports to India by 182%, whereas a partial FTA could lead to a 134% increase. However, an FTA accompanied with improved transport infrastructure and better connectivity could see Bangladesh's exports rise to 297%. India, too, would see an increase to its exports by as much as 172% in this scenario. A successful FTA would substantially expand Bangladesh's market reach and give Indians access to more manufactured goods.\n\nIt is unclear if and how an FTA plan would proceed under the interim Bangladeshi government, or the dispensation to follow.\n\nInfra & connectivity\n\nInfrastructure and connectivity has been a growing part of India-Bangladesh ties, according to the Minister of External Affairs. India has extended three lines of credit to Bangladesh since 2016 amounting to $8 billion for the development of road, rail, shipping and port infrastructure. In November 2023, two joint projects - the Akhaura-Agartala cross-border rail link and Khulna-Mongla Port rail line - were inaugurated.\n\nThe latest Akhaura-Agartala link, which provided an alternate route from mainland India to the Northeast, was the sixth cross-border rail line between the countries. This has cut down the travel time (by train) between Agartala and Kolkata from 31 hours to 10 hours and was expected to boost tourism, trade, and people-to-people exchanges between the two countries.\n\nA disruption in Indo-Bangladesh ties could thus restrict India's access to the Northeast, which will be connected to mainland India only through the narrow \"Chicken's Neck\" -- only 22 km at its narrowest -- between West Bengal and Assam.\n\nBesides rail, there are currently five operational bus routes between India and Bangladesh, including connections from Kolkata, Agartala and Guwahati to Dhaka. In 2023, the countries had agreed to operationalise the agreement for the usage of the Chittagong and Mongla ports to ease the movement of cargo between mainland India and the Northeast.", "source":

According to an official from Tripura's Industry and Commerce Department, commerce between Tripura and Bangladesh has significantly increased from Rs 230.24 crore in 2013-14 to Rs 715.98 crore in 2023-24.\n\nIn the financial year 2023-24, exports from Tripura to Bangladesh were valued at Rs 12.31 crore, while imports stood at Rs 703.67 crore. Bangladesh exports various commodities to Tripura and other northeastern states, including fish, cement, food items, steel sheets, PVC pipes, soft drinks, and cotton waste. On the other hand, it imports broken stone, maize, agarbatti, fresh ginger, dry chillies, vegetable seeds, and wood apple from the region.\n\nDue to the volatile situation and incidents of violence in Bangladesh, a high alert has been issued in areas bordering the neighboring country.\n\nOfficials are closely monitoring the situation and expect normalcy in trade activities shortly.", "source": {"uri": "economictimes.indiatimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Economic Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northeast_India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Northeast India"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tripura", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tripura"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tripura"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheikh_Hasina", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sheikh Hasina"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_rupee", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indian rupee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assam", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Assam"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Assam"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meghalaya", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Meghalaya"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Meghalaya"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dawki", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dawki"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dawki"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akhaura_Upazila", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Akhaura Upazila"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Akhaura Upazila"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crore", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Crore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agartala", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Agartala"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Agartala"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mizoram", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mizoram"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mizoram"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chili_pepper", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chili pepper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cement", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ginger", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ginger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Apple"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_drink", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Soft drink"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cotton", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cotton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vegetable", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vegetable"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maize", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Maize"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiscal_year", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fiscal year"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steel", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Steel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fish"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day_Trading", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day Trading", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Sikhism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Sikhism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Consumer_Goods_and_Services/Marketplaces", "label": "dmoz/Business/Consumer Goods and Services/Marketplaces", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 64}], "image": "https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-112325520,width-1200,height-630,imgsize-425514,overlay-economictimes/photo.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792287", "eventUri": "eng-9792287", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 132, "relevance": 1}

Source: FILE/REUTERS.\n\nBangladesh, which has been witnessing a political crisis, is known for its textile sector. The country earns a large share of its income from exports of clothes and the ongoing unrest is expected to hit them hard.\n\nWith the world keeping a close eye on rapid developments in Bangladesh, international buyers, especially textile importers, are shifting their focus to alternative markets including India.\n\nBangladesh is a key market for Indian textiles and serves both as a manufacturing hub and a significant export destination.\n\nThe monthly apparel export of Bangladesh is $3.5-3.8 billion and has a high double-digit share in the European Union and the United Kingdom and a 10 per cent market share in the United States.\n\nIndia, meanwhile, is exporting in the range of $1.3-1.5 billion per month.\n\nA report by Business Standard quoted industry experts as saying that if 10 to 11 per cent of Bangladesh's export is diverted to Indian hubs like Triuppur, India's gain will be an additional business of $300-400 million per month.\n\n\"We expect orders may start coming to Tiruppur, and this financial year, they are expected to be at least 10 per cent more than last year's,\" the report quoted KM Subramanian, president of the Tiruppur Exporters' Association, as saying.\n\n\"This is unfortunate and if the current disruption lasts long, it will affect buyer sentiment. Initially, buyers will likely shift some orders to India and other countries. We have the capacity to handle an additional $300-400 million in orders immediately,\" Prabhu Damodaran, secretary to the Indian Texpreneurs Federation, an industry body, was quoted as saying by Business Standard.\n\nThe protests and upheaval in Bangladesh have come at a time when the country was expected to surpass $50 billion in annual exports in 2024, compared to around $47 billion in 2023.\n\nTextile manufacturing units shifting base to India\n\nThe report further said that manufacturing units owned by Indians in Bangladesh are also likely to shift their base to India.\n\nThere are nearly 25 per cent of the units in Bangladesh that are owned by India. These include companies like Shahi Exports, House of Pearl Fashions, Jay Jay Mills, TCNS, Gokaldas Images, and Ambattur Clothing, trade-policy analyst S Chandrasekaran said.\n\n\"The movement of consignments is stuck, and there is a breakdown in the supply chain for the upcoming Christmas season. India has an advantage here because orders will be diverted,\" Chandrasekaran said.\n\n\"The sudden drop in global volumes may be compensated by a rise in Indian exports,\" he further said.\n\nBangladesh has been witnessing its worst political crisis since independence in 1971, with Sheikh Hasina resigning from the post of Prime Minister amid massive anti-government protests.\n\nBangladesh Army Chief General Waqar-uz-Zaman, on August 5, announced that an interim government would be taking over the responsibilities.", "source": {"uri": "firstpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Firstpost"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Textile", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Textile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiruppur", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tiruppur"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tiruppur"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Standard", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Business Standard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Textile_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Textile industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Textile_manufacturing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Textile manufacturing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhaka", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dhaka"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dhaka"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019\u20132020_Hong_Kong_protests", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2019\u20132020 Hong Kong protests"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh_Army", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh Army"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provisional_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Provisional government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partition_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Partition of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheikh_Hasina", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sheikh Hasina"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Christmas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambattur", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ambattur"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ambattur"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Sikhism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Sikhism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Consumer_Goods_and_Services/Marketplaces", "label": "dmoz/Business/Consumer Goods and Services/Marketplaces", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 82}], "image": "https://images.firstpost.com/uploads/2024/08/Bangladesh-garment-factory-2024-08-81ee910d82c1ad904d62c0cbd78a1c66-1200x675.jpg?im=FitAndFill=(1200,675)", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792287", "eventUri": "eng-9792287", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-05", "textStart": 2894, "textEnd": 2902}], "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 131, "relevance": 1}

At Hero MotoCorp, Bangladesh contributes 20-30% of its sales outside India.\n\nTwo-wheeler makers from India also have manufacturing facilities in Bangladesh to meet local regulations and save on high customs duties.

This analysis examines the various ways in which the political upheaval in Bangladesh is affecting India's economy, using recent facts, figures, and data.\n\nOverview of the Coup and Immediate Reactions\n\nIn early August 2024, a military coup in Bangladesh led to the ousting of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina. The coup, executed by a faction within the Bangladesh Army, has led to significant instability in the country, including curfews, a disrupted administration, and a volatile economic environment.\n\nImpact on Trade and Investment Trade Relations Bilateral Trade Disruptions: Bangladesh and India share a robust trade relationship. In FY 2023, India exported goods worth approximately $11 billion to Bangladesh, making it one of India's largest trading partners in South Asia. The coup has led to border closures and disruptions in supply chains, impacting the flow of goods. For instance, major exports like textiles and pharmaceuticals, which account for a significant portion of trade, are experiencing delays. Economic Slowdown: The disruption in trade has already begun to affect the Indian economy. According to the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, trade with Bangladesh has decreased by 15% in the past month. The slowdown is expected to lead to a negative impact on the Indian manufacturing sector, especially textiles and pharmaceuticals. Investment Impact Foreign Direct Investment (FDI): Bangladesh has been a growing destination for Indian FDI, with investments amounting to around $2.5 billion in 2023. The political instability has led to a halt in new investments and uncertainty regarding existing ones. Indian companies, including those in the power and infrastructure sectors, are facing delays and increased risks. Companies such as Tata Power and Larsen & Toubro have reported operational disruptions and potential losses. Stock Market Volatility: The Indian stock market has experienced volatility due to regional instability. For example, the Sensex and Nifty indices dropped by 2.3% in the weeks following the coup, influenced partly by investor concerns over regional stability and its impact on trade. Economic Implications on Regional Supply Chains Disruptions in Supply Chains: India and Bangladesh have intertwined supply chains, especially in sectors like textiles, where raw materials are sourced across borders. The coup has caused interruptions in these supply chains, leading to increased costs and delays for Indian manufacturers. Inflationary Pressures: The disruptions are contributing to higher inflation in India. Prices of raw materials and finished goods have increased due to supply chain issues, contributing to the inflationary pressures already facing the Indian economy. Humanitarian and Refugee Implications Potential Refugee Crisis: The coup may lead to a refugee crisis, with potential influxes of Bangladeshi refugees into India. This situation could strain resources and increase humanitarian costs in border areas, particularly in West Bengal and Assam. Regional Stability Concerns: Increased instability in Bangladesh may also impact India's security and border management costs, requiring additional resources for border security and emergency response. Long-Term Economic Forecast Economic Growth Projections: The IMF has revised its projections for Indian economic growth in light of the regional instability. The Indian economy, which was projected to grow at 6.5% in 2024, may see a downward adjustment due to the ongoing disruptions. Strategic Adjustments: India may need to adjust its economic strategies, including diversifying its trade and investment portfolio, and seeking new markets to mitigate the effects of the instability in Bangladesh. Conclusion\n\nThe recent coup in Bangladesh has introduced considerable uncertainty into the economic relations between India and its neighbor. The immediate impacts include disruptions in trade, a slowdown in investment, and increased economic volatility. As the situation evolves, India may face both short-term challenges and long-term adjustments in its economic strategies. The full extent of the economic impact will depend on the stability of the political situation in Bangladesh and India's ability to adapt to the changing regional dynamics.", "source": {"uri": "forevernews.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "Forever NEWS"}, "authors": [{"uri": "fn_exclusives@forevernews.in", "name": "Fn Exclusives", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Economy of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Asia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "South Asia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coup_d'\u00e9tat", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Coup d'\u00e9tat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_chain", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Supply chain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Textile", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Textile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh_Army", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh Army"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheikh_Hasina", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sheikh Hasina"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curfew", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Curfew"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiscal_year", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fiscal year"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_direct_investment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Foreign direct investment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Commerce_and_Industry_(India)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Commerce and Industry (India)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larsen_&_Toubro", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Larsen & Toubro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tata_Power", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tata Power"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raw_material", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Raw material"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stock market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refugee", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Refugee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Monetary_Fund", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International Monetary Fund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_growth", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economic growth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assam", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assam"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Assam"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Bengal", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "West Bengal"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "West Bengal"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day_Trading", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day Trading", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Commodities_and_Futures", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Commodities and Futures", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Consumer_Goods_and_Services/Marketplaces", "label": "dmoz/Business/Consumer Goods and Services/Marketplaces", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://www.forevernews.in/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/swarajya_2021-10_d4b12613-91bb-45df-ae3f-a5a504038924_Bangladesh_Temple_Image__1_.avif", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792287", "eventUri": "eng-9792287", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "wgt": 125, "relevance": 1}

As the situation unfolds, these sectors are closely monitoring the developments and bracing for potential disruptions. Initial estimates indicate that Gujarat's textile industry has seen at least Rs 1,000 crore in transactions affected.Both industries are in a revival phase, and the Bangladesh crisis could severely impact them.\n\nThe textile industry, heavily reliant on exports to Bangladesh, has already taken a hit. Around 60% of Gujarat's cotton yarn exports go to Bangladesh, and new shipments have been halted as a precaution. About 100 containers, each weighing 20 tonnes, are stranded at Gujarat's ports, awaiting clarity on when exports can resume.\n\n\"Bangladesh is the biggest export market for Gujarat-based spinning industry with around 60% share. There will be a significant impact on the industry. Currently, export is halted. We are closely observing the situation,\" said Rahul Shah, co-chairman of the GCCI Textile Taskforce.\n\nYarn prices declined by Rs 8 per kg in the past week, settling at Rs 242 per kg, reflecting the uncertainty surrounding the industry's ability to maintain its export momentum to Bangladesh. Some believe that prolonged uncertainty in Bangladesh could boost garment manufacturing in India, but industry leaders caution that the immediate impact on yarn exports is severe.\n\nThe chemical industry is also facing challenges. \"Gujarat's dyestuff manufacturers supply around 3,500 to 4,000 tonnes of dyes, mainly reactive dyes, to Bangladesh every month, accounting for approximately 15% of the state's dye exports. We are going to hold an urgent meeting of exporters to assess the situation and devise strategies to mitigate potential losses,\" said Nilesh Damani, vice-president of the Gujarat Dyestuffs Manufacturers' Association (GDMA). Around 150 companies have significant exports of reactive dyes to Bangladesh from Ahmedabad.\n\nBoth industries are hoping for a swift resolution to the crisis and a return to normal trade relations. Industry leaders are expected to explore contingency plans to minimize the impact on their businesses, including diversifying export markets and alternative supply chains.", "source": {"uri": "timesofindia.indiatimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Times of India"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gujarat", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gujarat"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gujarat"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yarn", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Yarn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Textile_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Textile industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Textile", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Textile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_rupee", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Indian rupee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chemical industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Asia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "South Asia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crore", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Crore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahmedabad", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ahmedabad"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ahmedabad"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dye", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dye"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinning_(textiles)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spinning (textiles)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactive_dye", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reactive dye"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/International_Business_and_Trade/Import_and_Export", "label": "dmoz/Business/International Business and Trade/Import and Export", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Textiles_and_Nonwovens", "label": "dmoz/Business/Textiles and Nonwovens", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Chemicals/Cleaning_Agents_and_Toiletries", "label": "dmoz/Business/Chemicals/Cleaning Agents and Toiletries", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Chemicals/Agrochemicals", "label": "dmoz/Business/Chemicals/Agrochemicals", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Chemicals/Import_and_Export", "label": "dmoz/Business/Chemicals/Import and Export", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 60}], "image": "https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112331538,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-78094,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792287", "eventUri": "eng-9792287", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ahmedabad"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 115, "relevance": 1}

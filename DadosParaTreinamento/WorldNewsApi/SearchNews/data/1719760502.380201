{"id": 224999512, "title": "Delinquent: For Anita, peace won\u2019t come until teen accused of killing her son is found", "text": "CLEVELAND, Ohio \u2013 The first time Anita Deal mourned a son\u2019s death was in 2017. Her 18-year-old was shot in a car. The second time she mourned a son\u2019s death was in 2020. Her 26-year-old was found in a field with gunshot wounds. The third time she mourned a son\u2019s death was in 2021. Her 13-year-old was killed in a drive-by shooting, a case of mistaken identity. During a final breath, he cried, \u201cWhere\u2019s my mommy?\u201d she recounts. Prosecutors charged two teens with that murder. They received life sentences, but another juvenile suspect remains at large. Anita, of Euclid, has one son left. He\u2019s in prison for a crime spree at 17, involving armed robberies of two Cleveland delivery drivers and two Lakewood carjackings. Anita stands at a cruel crossroads: One son was killed by a juvenile who was punished with adult prison. Another son is serving time in adult prison for crimes he committed in his youth. In the first case, she believes adult prison is justified \u2013 \u201cthey shot a child,\u201d she says resolutely. But her son didn\u2019t kill anyone, she says, calling his incarceration unfair. Throughout this special series \u2013 Delinquent: Our system, our kids \u2013 The Plain Dealer/cleveland.com has been exploring the complexities of the juvenile justice system through the eyes of the young people caught within it. Their stories, told over six weeks, illustrate influences that led juveniles to crime, escalations from petty misdemeanors to violent acts, and barriers that delayed or blocked their way out, sometimes despite interventions. But all crimes have victims, and the court is supposed to consider the harm they\u2019ve suffered, too. We spoke to the victims of several youth offenders about their views on the juvenile system and what it means to get justice. Losing a brother Seven years ago, Anita\u2019s house buzzed with testosterone-infused energy. There was Mark, the oldest, who loved videogames and science projects. Then Martell, the family prankster and avid basketball hooper. Next, Doug, a fine student, close to Martell. Last, Maurco, a budding musician who helped neighbors with odd jobs. Anita worked as a grocery store chef. In 2017, Martell, 18, was driving through Cleveland\u2019s East Side with 15-year-old Doug in the backseat. Martell got into a confrontation with a group outside, and someone shot him in the head. As emergency technicians rendered assistance, Doug held his brother in his arms, not realizing he\u2019d already perished, Anita says. Doug tried to cope but struggled. He quit playing basketball \u2013 it reminded him of Martell \u2013 and began hanging out with rough kids. One day, Doug, then 16, ran away. Two weeks later, police caught him and another youth with a stolen car. Doug said his friend picked him up, but he wasn\u2019t surprised the vehicle\u202fwas stolen. He was charged with receiving stolen property, spent time in jail and went home. He expressed remorse and empathy to a probation officer. He called Anita his biggest support. (While we have not named most juveniles and family members in our series to protect them from harm, Anita asked that her name, and the names of her deceased sons, be used, as she continues to seek justice. Doug, however, is a pseudonym.) But Doug seemed fascinated by gang life. Though he denied membership, his comments worried the officer, who hinted at a root cause: Doug \u201cis taking the death of his brother particularly hard,\u201d she reported. A judge found Doug delinquent and put him on probation. But in the five months since charges were brought, the court did little to help, Anita says now. She pushed for Doug\u2019s enrollment in a behavioral program, she recalls, but that didn\u2019t happen till he was officially adjudicated. At that point, Doug, 17, ran away again. Anita saw social media photos of her son carrying a gun and large amounts of cash. She feared for his life. \u201cShe wanted him locked up in jail before she \u2018lost another child,\u2019\u201d Doug\u2019s probation officer reported. \u201cShe does demonstrate a great deal of concern and love.\u201d Eventually, Anita\u2019s wish came true. Doug was caught and arrested. Charged with four armed robberies in a two-week span, he was later transferred to adult court, where he pleaded guilty to the robberies, plus criminal gang activity. He was sentenced to nine years in prison. Doug declined to participate in interviews. But his tailspin isn\u2019t hard to understand, Anita says. After witnessing Martell\u2019s killing, \u201cHe was traumatized,\u201d she explains. \u201cStill is.\u201d Sleepless nights Martell\u2019s murder was never solved. In addition to Doug, it shook Mark and Maurco. Mark, then 23, had been a person of faith, but after the killing, he abandoned it. He told Anita that if he were to die, he didn\u2019t want a religious eulogy. Maurco, 9, told his mom that if he were killed, he wanted to be cremated, to be close to her forever. Maurco\u2019s sense of foreboding resurfaced three years later, following Mark\u2019s murder. That case was solved; the killer received a 17-year sentence. In late 2021, Anita got a call from Maurco\u2019s counselor. The news was bad.\u202fShe sped to the crime scene. When she saw the police tape, she collapsed to the ground. Maurco had been visiting with a friend when someone fired seven shots from an SUV, mistaking her youngest son for someone else, investigators said. An hour later, three suspects, ages 18, 17 and 16, posed for photos in front of the SUV with a gun. Authorities located the 18- and 17-year-old, who were standout high school football players with no criminal record. (The 17-year-old declined to comment for this story.)\u202fLast November, following a trial, a jury found them guilty. Weeks later, Anita\u2019s family packed one side of a courtroom for the sentencing, clad in white sweatshirts honoring Maurco. Many carried cremation lockets, containing a bit of Maurco\u2019s ashes. When the judge asked if family members wanted to speak, they described Maurco as an upbeat entrepreneur who delighted neighbors by shoveling snow, raking leaves, stuffing tamales and assisting with a lemonade stand. When it was Anita\u2019s turn, tears flowed, as her voice quivered. \u201cI have not slept a night peacefully because my son\u2019s not running through my house.\u201d The judge gave each defendant a life sentence with the chance for parole after 32 years. Earlier that day, a reporter asked Anita if this would be her last time in a courtroom. She shook her head no: The 16-year-old suspect in Maurco\u2019s killing was still at large. Months later, she continues calling the U.S. Marshals Service for updates. She\u2019s losing hope. In April, inside her living room, Anita tried making sense of her life. Memories of her boys filled the space: tapestries showing Martell in a bowtie and Mark in a comically ugly sweater; a balloon from Maurco\u2019s last birthday. \u201cLet Go and Let God,\u201d declared a wall mounting. Flowers crowded a table, many dead, remnants of old sympathy gifts. \u201cA lot of people ask me, \u2018How do I still have them up?\u2019\u201d Anita says of the memorials. \u201cThey\u2019re my children,\u201d she asserts, \u201cI\u2019m not supposed to put them in a box.\u201d As for Doug, Anita believes God saved him when he was arrested. She hopes he will find purpose upon his release. Considering his traumas, however, she\u2019s unsure. Maurco\u2019s killing haunts Doug the most, she says. \u201cHe feels he failed him.\u201d Anita is 45. She hasn\u2019t punched a timeclock since Maurco\u2019s death two-and-a-half years ago. Every day is a struggle. She says she sometimes has \u201cevil thoughts\u201d about what she would do if she found the third suspect before authorities did. She doesn\u2019t think she\u2019ll ever feel normal again. But his arrest, she says, would bring her some peace. (Coming tomorrow: Within the world of criminal justice, there is sometimes overlap among victims and offenders who find themselves at both ends of the spectrum at different points in life. But rarely is someone a victim and offender in the same case. That\u2019s what happened to Sandy, after she caught a group of youths trying to steal her car.)

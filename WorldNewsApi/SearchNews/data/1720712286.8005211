If you want to bring the music with you camping or beachside, you need a robust speaker matched with robust sound. The Sony XE300 is a sturdy speaker with a rugged build and crystal-clear sound quality. This portable speaker has a lengthy battery life, wide compatibility, and comes in like-new condition.

This one is about the size of a travel mug, measuring a little over eight inches long. Portability is just the start of this Sony speaker, though. This tough speaker is IP67-rated. That means it's waterproof (perfect for summer afternoons by the pool or beach) and dustproof, and it can also take some serious punches if it's bouncing around in your beach tote or duffel bag during travel. When it's time to make camp, your speaker doesn't have to be the center of attention (even if it naturally is). The XE300 is compatible with the Party Connect app, so you can pair it up with up to 100 other compatible speakers for portable surround sound. Grab the Sony XE300 now to amplify your summer tunes wherever you go. https://www.youtube.com/embed/xEEHcyP4bS0 If the party stops when the music ends, bring a pillow.

What does Open Box Return mean? When you see the Open Box label on this speaker, all that means is it might have been handled and repackaged. So, it might not be in the original box, but it also doesn't have the original price. Even though this speaker is in like-new condition, it's still over half off.

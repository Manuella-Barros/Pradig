Bonsall died on Tuesday, July 9, 2024, from complications of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis in Hendersonville, Tenn. He was 76.\n\nJoe Bonsall, Grammy award winner and celebrated tenor of the country and gospel group the Oak Ridge Boys, died Tuesday. He was 76.\n\nBonsall died from complications of the neuromuscular disorder Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, according to a statement from representatives of his family.\n\n\"Joe loved to sing. He loved to read. He loved to write,\" the statement read. \"He loved to play banjo. He loved working on the farm. And he loved the Philadelphia Phillies. But Jesus and his family always came first -- and we will see him again on the Promised Day.\"\n\nA Philadelphia native and resident of Hendersonville, Tennessee, Bonsall left his gospel group the Keystones in 1973 to join the Oak Ridge Boys, which originally formed in the 1940s. He saw the band through its golden period in the '80s and beyond, which included its signature 1981 song, \"Elvira,\" its 1982 hit \"Bobbie Sue\" and 1983's \"American Made.\" \"Elvira\" marked a massive crossover moment for the group, reaching No. 1 on the country chart and No. 5 on Billboard's all-genre Hot 100.\n\nAmyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or ALS, is a disease that damages nerve cells and connections that are necessary to control muscles for movements such as walking, talking and breathing. Most patients die within three to five years of a diagnosis. The illness became known as Lou Gehrig's disease after the star baseball player was diagnosed in 1939.\n\nIn September 2023, the Oak Ridge Boys embarked on a farewell tour that was scheduled to last into 2024. But in January, Bonsall announced his retirement from touring, saying it was too difficult for him physically after a four-year battle with ALS. Ben James, who has performed with Doyle Lawson and Dailey & Vincent, was announced as his replacement.\n\n\"I am now at a point where walking is impossible, so I have basically retired from the road. It has just gotten too difficult,\" Bonsall said at the time of his retirement. \"It has been a great 50 years, and I am thankful to all the Oak Ridge Boys, band, crew, and staff for the constant love and support shown to me through it all. I will never forget, and for those of you who have been constantly holding me up in prayer, I thank you and ask for you to keep on praying.\"\n\nIn June 2022, Bonsall shared on X, formerly Twitter, that he \"could have easily died\" after suffering pulmonary embolisms.\n\nHis memoir, \"I See Myself,\" will be released posthumously in November. It is his 11th book, a collection which includes the four-part children's series, \"The Molly Books.\"\n\nDuring his five decades with the Oak Ridge Boys, Bonsall was a member of the Grand Ole Opry. He was inducted into the Philadelphia Music Hall of Fame, the Gospel Music Hall of Fame, the Vocal Group Hall of Fame and the Country Music Hall of Fame.\n\n\"For 50 years, Joe Bonsall was the Oak Ridge Boys' sparkplug. He was as exciting a performer as any who ever hit a gospel or country stage,\" Kyle Young, CEO of the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum, said in a written statement. \"His tenor voice was high and clear, and his jovial spirit always provided a jolt of energy, immediately rousing audiences to come on in and take a load off. He certainly lightened our cares every time he sang.\"\n\nJohn Rich of country music duo Big & Rich shared a remembrance on X. Country music is crying today,\" he wrote. \"Joe was a real friend, and someone I looked up to not only as an artist, but as a man. He's left a legacy of incredible music, and endless accounts of his kind heartedness.\"\n\nCountry musician Travis Tritt also posted a tribute to Bonsall on X, writing, \"Joe had amazing talent and a wonderful personality and he will be missed terribly by everyone who knew him.\"\n\nBonsall is survived by his wife, Mary Ann; daughters Jennifer and Sabrina; sister Nancy; granddaughter Breanne; grandson Luke; and great grandsons, Chance and Grey.", "source": {"uri": "idahostatejournal.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Idaho State Journal"}, "authors": [{"uri":

I am now to a point that walking is impossible so I have basically retired from the road.

He and his country singing partners William Lee Golden, Duane Allen and Richard Sterban sold more than 41 million albums.\n\nThe Oak Ridge Boys won five Grammy Awards and produced more than 30 top-five country hits, including \"Bobbie Sue,\" \"American Made,\" \"Leaving Louisiana in the Broad Daylight,\" and \"Elvira.\"\n\nBonsall was also the author of 11 books, including On the Road with The Oak Ridge Boys and his memoir I See Myself, which is scheduled for release in November.\n\n\"Joe loved to sing. He loved to read. He loved to write. He loved to play banjo. He loved working on the farm. And he loved the Philadelphia Phillies,\" his family said Tuesday. \"But Jesus and his family always came first -- and we will see him again on the Promised Day.\"\n\nIn 2018, Bonsall and The Oak Ridge Boys sang \"Amazing Grace\" at the funeral for President George H.W. Bush, after making a promise to the former president three decades earlier.\n\n\"The vice president comes tearing across the White House lawn,\" Bonsall told CNN as he recounted the 1983 encounter.\n\n\"Here comes George Bush running towards us, saying, 'I can't make it tonight, but I'm a huge country fan, I'm a big Oak fan. Will you sing some of your songs?'\" Bonsall recounted.\n\n\"He started listing album cuts, so he wasn't kidding,\" Bonsall said. \"We were just blown away that the vice president knew our music.\"\n\nWhile on tour in 2018, the group made a quick detour to play one last time for the former president at his funeral.\n\n\"We've been carrying a suit on our tour bus for a couple of months and wondering,\" Bonsall said. \"By hook or by crook, we were going to be there for him.\"\n\nWhile no funeral is planned for Bonsall, his family has requested donations be made to The ALS Association and the Vanderbilt Medical Center ALS and Neuroscience Research Center.\n\nOn Tuesday, reaction to Bonsall's death began pouring in from country singers including Blake Shelton, who said \"We all lost a special person today,\" and Lee Greenwood, who called Bonsall \"the high voice with The Oak Ridge Boys who I toured with almost every year of my career.\"\n\n\"My family sends prayers to the Bonsall Family and The Oak Ridge Boys,\" Greenwood added. \"We will miss you, Joe!", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Bonsall", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Bonsall"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Oak_Ridge_Boys", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Oak Ridge Boys"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tenor", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tenor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vocal_Group_Hall_of_Fame", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vocal Group Hall of Fame"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gospel_Music_Hall_of_Fame", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gospel Music Hall of Fame"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country_Music_Hall_of_Fame_and_Museum", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Ole_Opry", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Grand Ole Opry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_Football_Hall_of_Fame", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pro Football Hall of Fame"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennessee", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tennessee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tennessee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hendersonville,_Tennessee", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hendersonville, Tennessee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hendersonville, Tennessee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Grammy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Made_(song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "American Made (song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bobbie_Sue_(song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bobbie Sue (song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elvira_(song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Elvira (song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Lee_Golden", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "William Lee Golden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duane_Allen", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Duane Allen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Sterban", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Richard Sterban"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_H._W._Bush", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "George H.

He loved to read. He loved to write,\" the statement read. \"He loved to play banjo. He loved working on the farm. And he loved the Philadelphia Phillies. But Jesus and his family always came first -- and we will see him again on the Promised Day.\"\n\nA Philadelphia native and resident of Hendersonville, Tennessee, Bonsall left his gospel group the Keystones in 1973 to join the Oak Ridge Boys, which originally formed in the 1940s. He saw the band through its golden period in the '80s and beyond, which included its signature 1981 song, \"Elvira,\" its 1982 hit \"Bobbie Sue\" and 1983's \"American Made.\" \"Elvira\" marked a massive crossover moment for the group, reaching No. 1 on the country chart and No. 5 on Billboard's all-genre Hot 100.\n\nAmyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or ALS, is a disease that damages nerve cells and connections that are necessary to control muscles for movements such as walking, talking and breathing. Most patients die within three to five years of a diagnosis. The illness became known as Lou Gehrig's disease after the star baseball player was diagnosed in 1939.\n\nIn September 2023, the Oak Ridge Boys embarked on a farewell tour that was scheduled to last into 2024. But in January, Bonsall announced his retirement from touring, saying it was too difficult for him physically after a four-year battle with ALS. Ben James, who has performed with Doyle Lawson and Dailey & Vincent, was announced as his replacement.\n\n\"I am now at a point where walking is impossible, so I have basically retired from the road. It has just gotten too difficult,\" Bonsall said at the time of his retirement. \"It has been a great 50 years, and I am thankful to all the Oak Ridge Boys, band, crew, and staff for the constant love and support shown to me through it all. I will never forget, and for those of you who have been constantly holding me up in prayer, I thank you and ask for you to keep on praying.\"\n\nIn June 2022, Bonsall shared on X, formerly Twitter, that he \"could have easily died\" after suffering pulmonary embolisms.\n\nHis memoir, \"I See Myself,\" will be released posthumously in November. It is his 11th book, a collection which includes the four-part children's series, \"The Molly Books.\"\n\nDuring his five decades with the Oak Ridge Boys, Bonsall was a member of the Grand Ole Opry. He was inducted into the Philadelphia Music Hall of Fame, the Gospel Music Hall of Fame, the Vocal Group Hall of Fame and the Country Music Hall of Fame.\n\n\"For 50 years, Joe Bonsall was the Oak Ridge Boys' sparkplug. He was as exciting a performer as any who ever hit a gospel or country stage,\" Kyle Young, CEO of the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum, said in a written statement. \"His tenor voice was high and clear, and his jovial spirit always provided a jolt of energy, immediately rousing audiences to come on in and take a load off. He certainly lightened our cares every time he sang.\"\n\nJohn Rich of country music duo Big & Rich shared a remembrance on X. Country music is crying today,\" he wrote. \"Joe was a real friend, and someone I looked up to not only as an artist, but as a man. He's left a legacy of incredible music, and endless accounts of his kind heartedness.\"\n\nCountry musician Travis Tritt also posted a tribute to Bonsall on X, writing, \"Joe had amazing talent and a wonderful personality and he will be missed terribly by everyone who knew him.\"\n\nBonsall is survived by his wife, Mary Ann; daughters Jennifer and Sabrina; sister Nancy; granddaughter Breanne;

He became a member after a gig with the Keystones and was a mainstay as the group achieved mainstream success throughout the '70s and '80s.

In response to the decision, Bonsall declared, \"It's a sad day for those that care about spirituality and principles based on the Bible,\" and swiftly faced backlash.\n\nIn the years before his death, Bonsall toured seemingly nonstop with the Oak Ridge Boys, save for their hiatus amid the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020.\n\nBefore announcing his retirement this year, Bonsall had revealed in 2022 that he had battled pulmonary embolisms, telling fans at the time, \"I could've easily died last weekend.\"\n\nThe Oak Ridge Boys launched their American Made Farewell Tour in September 2023, and singer-songwriter Ben James took over for Bonsall amid his retirement.\n\nBefore his death, Bonsall authored 11 books, including his upcoming memoir \"I See Myself,\" which is set to publish in November. Music, family and faith were central to Bonsall, his website said.\n\n\"Joe loved to sing. He loved to read. He loved to write. He loved to play banjo,\" the statement added. \"He loved working on the farm. And he loved the Philadelphia Phillies.

He was 76.\n\nBonsall died from complications of the neuromuscular disorder Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, according to a statement from representatives of his family.\n\n\"Joe loved to sing. He loved to read. He loved to write,\" the statement read. \"He loved to play banjo. He loved working on the farm. And he loved the Philadelphia Phillies. But Jesus and his family always came first -- and we will see him again on the Promised Day.\"\n\nA Philadelphia native and resident of Hendersonville, Tennessee, Bonsall left his gospel group the Keystones in 1973 to join the Oak Ridge Boys, which originally formed in the 1940s. He saw the band through its golden period in the '80s and beyond, which included its signature 1981 song, \"Elvira,\" its 1982 hit \"Bobbie Sue\" and 1983's \"American Made.\" \"Elvira\" marked a massive crossover moment for the group, reaching No. 1 on the country chart and No. 5 on Billboard's all-genre Hot 100.\n\nAmyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or ALS, is a disease that damages nerve cells and connections that are necessary to control muscles for movements such as walking, talking and breathing. Most patients die within three to five years of a diagnosis. The illness became known as Lou Gehrig's disease after the star baseball player was diagnosed in 1939.\n\nIn September 2023, the Oak Ridge Boys embarked on a farewell tour that was scheduled to last into 2024. But in January, Bonsall announced his retirement from touring, saying it was too difficult for him physically after a four-year battle with ALS. Ben James, who has performed with Doyle Lawson and Dailey & Vincent, was announced as his replacement.\n\n\"I am now at a point where walking is impossible, so I have basically retired from the road. It has just gotten too difficult,\" Bonsall said at the time of his retirement. \"It has been a great 50 years, and I am thankful to all the Oak Ridge Boys, band, crew, and staff for the constant love and support shown to me through it all. I will never forget, and for those of you who have been constantly holding me up in prayer, I thank you and ask for you to keep on praying.\"\n\nIn June 2022, Bonsall shared on X, formerly Twitter, that he \"could have easily died\" after suffering pulmonary embolisms.\n\nHis memoir, \"I See Myself,\" will be released posthumously in November. It is his 11th book, a collection which includes the four-part children's series, \"The Molly Books.\"\n\nDuring his five decades with the Oak Ridge Boys, Bonsall was a member of the Grand Ole Opry. He was inducted into the Philadelphia Music Hall of Fame, the Gospel Music Hall of Fame, the Vocal Group Hall of Fame and the Country Music Hall of Fame.\n\n\"For 50 years, Joe Bonsall was the Oak Ridge Boys' sparkplug. He was as exciting a performer as any who ever hit a gospel or country stage,\" Kyle Young, CEO of the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum, said in a written statement. \"His tenor voice was high and clear, and his jovial spirit always provided a jolt of energy, immediately rousing audiences to come on in and take a load off. He certainly lightened our cares every time he sang.\"\n\nJohn Rich of country music duo Big & Rich shared a remembrance on X. Country music is crying today,\" he wrote. \"Joe was a real friend, and someone I looked up to not only as an artist, but as a man. He's left a legacy of incredible music, and endless accounts of his kind heartedness.\"\n\nCountry musician Travis Tritt also posted a tribute to Bonsall on X, writing, \"Joe had amazing talent and a wonderful personality and he will be missed terribly by everyone who knew him.\"\n\nBonsall is survived by his wife, Mary Ann; daughters Jennifer and Sabrina; sister Nancy; granddaughter Breanne; grandson Luke; and great grandsons, Chance and Grey.", "source": {"uri": "mercurynews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "San Jose Mercury News"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Here's a look at the stars we've lost so far in 2024, through May.\n\nJoe Bonsall, a 50-year member of the Country Music Hall of Fame group the Oak Ridge Boys, died Tuesday from complications of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis. He was 76.\n\nAmong fellow music artists weighing in Bonsall's death was Blake Shelton, who posted this on social media: \"I'm heartbroken to hear of my friend Joe Bonsall's passing. I've never seen Joe when he wasn't smiling and completely full of life. He absolutely loved singing like no one I ever met. My thoughts and prayers are with his family and the Oak Ridge Boys brothers. We all lost a special person today.\"\n\nA tenor singer with the Oak Ridge Boys, Bonsall announced in January that he was retiring from touring due to health issues. Ben James, formerly with Dailey & Vincent, replaced Bonsall in the touring lineup.\n\n\"Many of you know I have been battling a slow onset (over four years now) of a neuromuscular disorder,\" Bonsall said in his retirement statement.\n\n\"I am now at a point where walking is impossible, so I have basically retired from the road. It has just gotten too difficult. It has been a great 50 years, and I am thankful to all the Oak Ridge Boys, band, crew and staff for the constant love and support shown to me through it all. I will never forget, and for those of you who have been constantly holding me up in prayer, I thank you and ask for you to keep on praying.\"\n\nIn the same statement, Bonsall urged people to support his replacement (Ben James) in the Oak Ridge Boys, who have been managed for decades by Tulsa-based impresario Jim Halsey.\n\n\"God love you, Joe Bonsall,\" Halsey said. \"You have been an inspiration to fans, friends and family -- especially to me -- for 52 years. This is a very rough day.\"\n\nBonsall was a member of the Grand Ole Opry and, in addition to the Country Music Hall of Fame, is in the Philadelphia Music Hall of Fame, the Gospel Music Hall of Fame and the Vocal Group Hall of Fame.\n\nHe saw the band through its golden period in the '80s and beyond, which included its signature 1981 song, \"Elvira,\" its 1982 hit \"Bobbie Sue\" and 1983's \"American Made.\" \"Elvira\" marked a massive crossover moment for the group, reaching No. 1 on the country chart and No. 5 on Billboard's all-genre Hot 100.\n\n\"For 50 years, Joe Bonsall was the Oak Ridge Boys' sparkplug. He was as exciting a performer as any who ever hit a gospel or country stage,\" Kyle Young, CEO of the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum, said in a written statement. \"His tenor voice was high and clear, and his jovial spirit always provided a jolt of energy, immediately rousing audiences to come on in and take a load off.

Country music is crying today,\" he wrote. \"Joe was a real friend, and someone I looked up to not only as an artist, but as a man. He's left a legacy of incredible music, and endless accounts of his kind heartedness.\"\n\nCountry musician Travis Tritt also posted a tribute to Bonsall on X, writing, \"Joe had amazing talent and a wonderful personality and he will be missed terribly by everyone who knew him.\"\n\nBonsall wrote 11 books. His memoir, \"I See Myself,\" will be released posthumously in November.\n\nSaid a news release from an Oak Ridge Boys publicist: \"Joe loved to sing. He loved to read. He loved to write. He loved to play banjo. He loved working on the farm. And he loved the Philadelphia Phillies. But Jesus and his family always came first -- and we will see him again on the promised day.\"\n\nSurvivors include his wife, Mary Ann, daughters Jennifer and Sabrina, granddaughter Breanne, grandson Luke, two great grandsons, Chance and Grey, and a sister, Nancy. He was preceded in death by his parents Joseph S. Bonsall Sr. and Lillie Bonsall.\n\nAt the request of Bonsall, there will be no funeral. In lieu of flowers, donations may be made to The ALS Association or to the Vanderbilt Medical Center ALS and Neuroscience Research Center.\n\nWhat other members of the Oak Ridge Boys said:\n\nDuane Allen: \"When I look at Joe Bonsall's life, I see a life fulfilled. The son of two military veterans, he was raised to become street-smart in the hood-influenced neighborhood of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. His parents taught him that he could be anything he wished to be if he worked hard, told the truth and trusted in God. Joe could do anything he set his mind to do, but what impressed me the most was the energy, love and compassion he put into everything he did and his unique gift to communicate those emotions and feelings into every performance, song and book. Joe was 'that' best friend that every person hopes to have in his life.\"\n\nWilliam Lee Golden: \"This has been a week of sadness with the loss of my son, Rusty Golden, and now the loss of our brother and our partner of over 50 years, Joe Bonsall. Thankfully we have the memories made and the songs that we've sang together to get us through. It gives me comfort to know that Joe and Rusty are together again. Our prayers are with his family.\"\n\nRichard Sterban: \"For many years, Joe was my best friend. We knew each other long before we both became members of The Oak Ridge Boys. He was a special person who was loved by everyone and was a true inspiration to us all. He was also the best singing partner a person could have. For several years he bravely fought a terrible disease and was a trooper right up until the very end. There is no doubt that today he is in a much better place -- at home with Jesus. I will see you soon my dear friend.\"\n\nBen James: \"Joe was a true hero to me. His singing is something that I have admired since I was a kid. Nobody could do it like Joe could do it. He was such an encouragement to me. I feel honored that he chose me to sing the tenor line when he decided to come off the road. I try my best for Joe and the Boys every night but only Joe can fill that spot. The legacy he leaves with us is something that is irreplaceable. I am forever thankful I got to know and love one of my all-time heroes that was nothing but good to me. I will miss Joe Bonsall.

Here's a look at the stars we've lost so far in 2024, through May.\n\nJoe Bonsall, a 50-year member of the Country Music Hall of Fame group the Oak Ridge Boys, died Tuesday from complications of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis. He was 76.\n\nAmong fellow music artists weighing in Bonsall's death was Blake Shelton, who posted this on social media: \"I'm heartbroken to hear of my friend Joe Bonsall's passing. I've never seen Joe when he wasn't smiling and completely full of life. He absolutely loved singing like no one I ever met. My thoughts and prayers are with his family and the Oak Ridge Boys brothers. We all lost a special person today.\"\n\nA tenor singer with the Oak Ridge Boys, Bonsall announced in January that he was retiring from touring due to health issues. Ben James, formerly with Dailey & Vincent, replaced Bonsall in the touring lineup.\n\n\"Many of you know I have been battling a slow onset (over four years now) of a neuromuscular disorder,\" Bonsall said in his retirement statement.\n\nPeople are also reading...\n\n\"I am now at a point where walking is impossible, so I have basically retired from the road. It has just gotten too difficult. It has been a great 50 years, and I am thankful to all the Oak Ridge Boys, band, crew and staff for the constant love and support shown to me through it all. I will never forget, and for those of you who have been constantly holding me up in prayer, I thank you and ask for you to keep on praying.\"\n\nIn the same statement, Bonsall urged people to support his replacement (Ben James) in the Oak Ridge Boys, who have been managed for decades by Tulsa-based impresario Jim Halsey.\n\n\"God love you, Joe Bonsall,\" Halsey said. \"You have been an inspiration to fans, friends and family -- especially to me -- for 52 years. This is a very rough day.\"\n\nBonsall was a member of the Grand Ole Opry and, in addition to the Country Music Hall of Fame, is in the Philadelphia Music Hall of Fame, the Gospel Music Hall of Fame and the Vocal Group Hall of Fame.\n\nHe saw the band through its golden period in the '80s and beyond, which included its signature 1981 song, \"Elvira,\" its 1982 hit \"Bobbie Sue\" and 1983's \"American Made.\" \"Elvira\" marked a massive crossover moment for the group, reaching No. 1 on the country chart and No. 5 on Billboard's all-genre Hot 100.\n\nOak Ridge Boys' Joe Bonsall retires from touring Jimmie Tramel Tulsa World Oak Ridge Boys celebrating farewell tour, 51-year relationship with Jim Halsey Jimmie Tramel Tulsa World\n\n\"For 50 years, Joe Bonsall was the Oak Ridge Boys' sparkplug. He was as exciting a performer as any who ever hit a gospel or country stage,\" Kyle Young, CEO of the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum, said in a written statement. \"His tenor voice was high and clear, and his jovial spirit always provided a jolt of energy, immediately rousing audiences to come on in and take a load off. He certainly lightened our cares every time he sang.\"\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack\n\nJohn Rich of country music duo Big & Rich shared a remembrance on X. Country music is crying today,\" he wrote. \"Joe was a real friend, and someone I looked up to not only as an artist, but as a man. He's left a legacy of incredible music, and endless accounts of his kind heartedness.\"\n\nCountry musician Travis Tritt also posted a tribute to Bonsall on X, writing, \"Joe had amazing talent and a wonderful personality and he will be missed terribly by everyone who knew him.\"\n\nBonsall wrote 11 books. His memoir, \"I See Myself,\" will be released posthumously in November.\n\nSaid a news release from an Oak Ridge Boys publicist: \"Joe loved to sing. He loved to read. He loved to write. He loved to play banjo. He loved working on the farm. And he loved the Philadelphia Phillies. But Jesus and his family always came first -- and we will see him again on the promised day.\"\n\nSurvivors include his wife, Mary Ann, daughters Jennifer and Sabrina, granddaughter Breanne, grandson Luke, two great grandsons, Chance and Grey, and a sister, Nancy. He was preceded in death by his parents Joseph S. Bonsall Sr. and Lillie Bonsall.\n\nAt the request of Bonsall, there will be no funeral. In lieu of flowers, donations may be made to The ALS Association or to the Vanderbilt Medical Center ALS and Neuroscience Research Center.\n\nWhat other members of the Oak Ridge Boys said:\n\nDuane Allen: \"When I look at Joe Bonsall's life, I see a life fulfilled. The son of two military veterans, he was raised to become street-smart in the hood-influenced neighborhood of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. His parents taught him that he could be anything he wished to be if he worked hard, told the truth and trusted in God. Joe could do anything he set his mind to do, but what impressed me the most was the energy, love and compassion he put into everything he did and his unique gift to communicate those emotions and feelings into every performance, song and book. Joe was 'that' best friend that every person hopes to have in his life.\"\n\nWilliam Lee Golden: \"This has been a week of sadness with the loss of my son, Rusty Golden, and now the loss of our brother and our partner of over 50 years, Joe Bonsall. Thankfully we have the memories made and the songs that we've sang together to get us through. It gives me comfort to know that Joe and Rusty are together again. Our prayers are with his family.\"\n\nRichard Sterban: \"For many years, Joe was my best friend. We knew each other long before we both became members of The Oak Ridge Boys. He was a special person who was loved by everyone and was a true inspiration to us all. He was also the best singing partner a person could have. For several years he bravely fought a terrible disease and was a trooper right up until the very end. There is no doubt that today he is in a much better place -- at home with Jesus. I will see you soon my dear friend.\"\n\nBen James: \"Joe was a true hero to me. His singing is something that I have admired since I was a kid. Nobody could do it like Joe could do it. He was such an encouragement to me. I feel honored that he chose me to sing the tenor line when he decided to come off the road. I try my best for Joe and the Boys every night but only Joe can fill that spot. The legacy he leaves with us is something that is irreplaceable. I am forever thankful I got to know and love one of my all-time heroes that was nothing but good to me. I will miss Joe Bonsall. Thank you for loving everyone you met and making them feel like the most important person in your life when you spoke to them. A true gentleman.\"\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.\n\nLove 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0 * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to

Here's a look at the stars we've lost so far in 2024, through May.\n\nJoe Bonsall, a 50-year member of the Country Music Hall of Fame group the Oak Ridge Boys, died Tuesday from complications of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis. He was 76.\n\nAmong fellow music artists weighing in Bonsall's death was Blake Shelton, who posted this on social media: \"I'm heartbroken to hear of my friend Joe Bonsall's passing. I've never seen Joe when he wasn't smiling and completely full of life. He absolutely loved singing like no one I ever met. My thoughts and prayers are with his family and the Oak Ridge Boys brothers. We all lost a special person today.\"\n\nA tenor singer with the Oak Ridge Boys, Bonsall announced in January that he was retiring from touring due to health issues. Ben James, formerly with Dailey & Vincent, replaced Bonsall in the touring lineup.\n\n\"Many of you know I have been battling a slow onset (over four years now) of a neuromuscular disorder,\" Bonsall said in his retirement statement.\n\nPeople are also reading...

It has just gotten too difficult. It has been a great 50 years, and I am thankful to all the Oak Ridge Boys, band, crew and staff for the constant love and support shown to me through it all. I will never forget, and for those of you who have been constantly holding me up in prayer, I thank you and ask for you to keep on praying.\"\n\nIn the same statement, Bonsall urged people to support his replacement (Ben James) in the Oak Ridge Boys, who have been managed for decades by Tulsa-based impresario Jim Halsey.\n\n\"God love you, Joe Bonsall,\" Halsey said. \"You have been an inspiration to fans, friends and family -- especially to me -- for 52 years. This is a very rough day.\"\n\nBonsall was a member of the Grand Ole Opry and, in addition to the Country Music Hall of Fame, is in the Philadelphia Music Hall of Fame, the Gospel Music Hall of Fame and the Vocal Group Hall of Fame.\n\nHe saw the band through its golden period in the '80s and beyond, which included its signature 1981 song, \"Elvira,\" its 1982 hit \"Bobbie Sue\" and 1983's \"American Made.\" \"Elvira\" marked a massive crossover moment for the group, reaching No. 1 on the country chart and No. 5 on Billboard's all-genre Hot 100.\n\nOak Ridge Boys' Joe Bonsall retires from touring Jimmie Tramel Tulsa World Oak Ridge Boys celebrating farewell tour, 51-year relationship with Jim Halsey Jimmie Tramel Tulsa World\n\n\"For 50 years, Joe Bonsall was the Oak Ridge Boys' sparkplug. He was as exciting a performer as any who ever hit a gospel or country stage,\" Kyle Young, CEO of the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum, said in a written statement. \"His tenor voice was high and clear, and his jovial spirit always provided a jolt of energy, immediately rousing audiences to come on in and take a load off. He certainly lightened our cares every time he sang.\"\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack\n\nJohn Rich of country music duo Big & Rich shared a remembrance on X. Country music is crying today,\" he wrote. \"Joe was a real friend, and someone I looked up to not only as an artist, but as a man. He's left a legacy of incredible music, and endless accounts of his kind heartedness.\"\n\nCountry musician Travis Tritt also posted a tribute to Bonsall on X, writing, \"Joe had amazing talent and a wonderful personality and he will be missed terribly by everyone who knew him.\"\n\nBonsall wrote 11 books. His memoir, \"I See Myself,\" will be released posthumously in November.\n\nSaid a news release from an Oak Ridge Boys publicist: \"Joe loved to sing. He loved to read. He loved to write. He loved to play banjo. He loved working on the farm. And he loved the Philadelphia Phillies. But Jesus and his family always came first -- and we will see him again on the promised day.\"\n\nSurvivors include his wife, Mary Ann, daughters Jennifer and Sabrina, granddaughter Breanne, grandson Luke, two great grandsons, Chance and Grey, and a sister, Nancy. He was preceded in death by his parents Joseph S. Bonsall Sr. and Lillie Bonsall.\n\nAt the request of Bonsall, there will be no funeral. In lieu of flowers, donations may be made to The ALS Association or to the Vanderbilt Medical Center ALS and Neuroscience Research Center.\n\nWhat other members of the Oak Ridge Boys said:\n\nDuane Allen: \"When I look at Joe Bonsall's life, I see a life fulfilled. The son of two military veterans, he was raised to become street-smart in the hood-influenced neighborhood of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. His parents taught him that he could be anything he wished to be if he worked hard, told the truth and trusted in God. Joe could do anything he set his mind to do, but what impressed me the most was the energy, love and compassion he put into everything he did and his unique gift to communicate those emotions and feelings into every performance, song and book. Joe was 'that' best friend that every person hopes to have in his life.\"\n\nWilliam Lee Golden: \"This has been a week of sadness with the loss of my son, Rusty Golden, and now the loss of our brother and our partner of over 50 years, Joe Bonsall. Thankfully we have the memories made and the songs that we've sang together to get us through. It gives me comfort to know that Joe and Rusty are together again. Our prayers are with his family.\"\n\nRichard Sterban: \"For many years, Joe was my best friend. We knew each other long before we both became members of The Oak Ridge Boys. He was a special person who was loved by everyone and was a true inspiration to us all. He was also the best singing partner a person could have. For several years he bravely fought a terrible disease and was a trooper right up until the very end. There is no doubt that today he is in a much better place -- at home with Jesus. I will see you soon my dear friend.\"\n\nBen James: \"Joe was a true hero to me. His singing is something that I have admired since I was a kid. Nobody could do it like Joe could do it. He was such an encouragement to me. I feel honored that he chose me to sing the tenor line when he decided to come off the road. I try my best for Joe and the Boys every night but only Joe can fill that spot. The legacy he leaves with us is something that is irreplaceable. I am forever thankful I got to know and love one of my all-time heroes that was nothing but good to me. I will miss Joe Bonsall. Thank you for loving everyone you met and making them feel like the most important person in your life when you spoke to them. A true gentleman.\"\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or

Most patients die within three to five years of a diagnosis. The illness became known as Lou Gehrig's disease after the star baseball player was diagnosed in 1939.\n\nIn September 2023, the Oak Ridge Boys embarked on a farewell tour that was scheduled to last into 2024. But in January, Bonsall announced his retirement from touring, saying it was too difficult for him physically after a four-year battle with ALS. Ben James, who has performed with Doyle Lawson and Dailey & Vincent, was announced as his replacement.\n\n\"I am now at a point where walking is impossible, so I have basically retired from the road. It has just gotten too difficult,\" Bonsall said at the time of his retirement. \"It has been a great 50 years, and I am thankful to all the Oak Ridge Boys, band, crew, and staff for the constant love and support shown to me through it all. I will never forget, and for those of you who have been constantly holding me up in prayer, I thank you and ask for you to keep on praying.\"\n\nIn June 2022, Bonsall shared on X, formerly Twitter, that he \"could have easily died\" after suffering pulmonary embolisms.\n\nHis memoir, \"I See Myself,\" will be released posthumously in November. It is his 11th book, a collection which includes the four-part children's series, \"The Molly Books.\"\n\nDuring his five decades with the Oak Ridge Boys, Bonsall was a member of the Grand Ole Opry. He was inducted into the Philadelphia Music Hall of Fame, the Gospel Music Hall of Fame, the Vocal Group Hall of Fame and the Country Music Hall of Fame.\n\n\"For 50 years, Joe Bonsall was the Oak Ridge Boys' sparkplug. He was as exciting a performer as any who ever hit a gospel or country stage,\" Kyle Young, CEO of the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum, said in a written statement. \"His tenor voice was high and clear, and his jovial spirit always provided a jolt of energy, immediately rousing audiences to come on in and take a load off. He certainly lightened our cares every time he sang.\"\n\nJohn Rich of country music duo Big & Rich shared a remembrance on X. Country music is crying today,\" he wrote. \"Joe was a real friend, and someone I looked up to not only as an artist, but as a man. He's left a legacy of incredible music, and endless accounts of his kind heartedness.\"\n\nCountry musician Travis Tritt also posted a tribute to Bonsall on X, writing, \"Joe had amazing talent and a wonderful personality and he will be missed terribly by everyone who knew him.\"\n\nBonsall is survived by his wife, Mary Ann; daughters Jennifer and Sabrina; sister Nancy; granddaughter Breanne; grandson Luke; and great grandsons, Chance and Grey.\n\nMore from this section\n\nInformative Research Adds Brandon Hall as New EVP of Operations\n\nUnited Filmmakers Announces an Exciting Financing

This is a very rough day.\"\n\nBonsall was a member of the Grand Ole Opry and, in addition to the Country Music Hall of Fame, is in the Philadelphia Music Hall of Fame, the Gospel Music Hall of Fame and the Vocal Group Hall of Fame.\n\nHe saw the band through its golden period in the '80s and beyond, which included its signature 1981 song, \"Elvira,\" its 1982 hit \"Bobbie Sue\" and 1983's \"American Made.\" \"Elvira\" marked a massive crossover moment for the group, reaching No. 1 on the country chart and No. 5 on Billboard's all-genre Hot 100.\n\nOak Ridge Boys' Joe Bonsall retires from touring Jimmie Tramel Tulsa World Oak Ridge Boys celebrating farewell tour, 51-year relationship with Jim Halsey Jimmie Tramel Tulsa World\n\n\"For 50 years, Joe Bonsall was the Oak Ridge Boys' sparkplug.

But Jesus and his family always came first -- and we will see him again on the promised day.\"\n\nSurvivors include his wife, Mary Ann, daughters Jennifer and Sabrina, granddaughter Breanne, grandson Luke, two great grandsons, Chance and Grey, and a sister, Nancy. He was preceded in death by his parents Joseph S. Bonsall Sr. and Lillie Bonsall.\n\nAt the request of Bonsall, there will be no funeral. In lieu of flowers, donations may be made to The ALS Association or to the Vanderbilt Medical Center ALS and Neuroscience Research Center.\n\nWhat other members of the Oak Ridge Boys said:\n\nDuane Allen: \"When I look at Joe Bonsall's life, I see a life fulfilled. The son of two military veterans, he was raised to become street-smart in the hood-influenced neighborhood of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. His parents taught him that he could be anything he wished to be if he worked hard, told the truth and trusted in God. Joe could do anything he set his mind to do, but what impressed me the most was the energy, love and compassion he put into everything he did and his unique gift to communicate those emotions and feelings into every performance, song and book. Joe was 'that' best friend that every person hopes to have in his life.\"\n\nWilliam Lee Golden: \"This has been a week of sadness with the loss of my son, Rusty Golden, and now the loss of our brother and our partner of over 50 years, Joe Bonsall. Thankfully we have the memories made and the songs that we've sang together to get us through. It gives me comfort to know that Joe and Rusty are together again. Our prayers are with his family.\"\n\nRichard Sterban: \"For many years, Joe was my best friend. We knew each other long before we both became members of The Oak Ridge Boys. He was a special person who was loved by everyone and was a true inspiration to us all. He was also the best singing partner a person could have. For several years he bravely fought a terrible disease and was a trooper right up until the very end. There is no doubt that today he is in a much better place -- at home with Jesus. I will see you soon my dear friend.\"\n\nBen James: \"Joe was a true hero to me. His singing is something that I have admired since I was a kid. Nobody could do it like Joe could do it. He was such an encouragement to me. I feel honored that he chose me to sing the tenor line when he decided to come off the road. I try my best for Joe and the Boys every night but only Joe can fill that spot. The legacy he leaves with us is something that is irreplaceable. I am forever thankful I got to know and love one of my all-time heroes that was nothing but good to me. I will miss Joe Bonsall. Thank you for loving everyone you met and making them feel like the most important person in your life when you spoke to them. A true gentleman.\"\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.\n\n0 Comments Be the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that

In lieu of flowers, donations may be made to The ALS Association or to the Vanderbilt Medical Center ALS and Neuroscience Research Center.\n\nWhat other members of the Oak Ridge Boys said:\n\nDuane Allen: \"When I look at Joe Bonsall's life, I see a life fulfilled. The son of two military veterans, he was raised to become street-smart in the hood-influenced neighborhood of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. His parents taught him that he could be anything he wished to be if he worked hard, told the truth and trusted in God. Joe could do anything he set his mind to do, but what impressed me the most was the energy, love and compassion he put into everything he did and his unique gift to communicate those emotions and feelings into every performance, song and book. Joe was 'that' best friend that every person hopes to have in his life.\"\n\nWilliam Lee Golden: \"This has been a week of sadness with the loss of my son, Rusty Golden, and now the loss of our brother and our partner of over 50 years, Joe Bonsall. Thankfully we have the memories made and the songs that we've sang together to get us through. It gives me comfort to know that Joe and Rusty are together again. Our prayers are with his family.\"\n\nRichard Sterban: \"For many years, Joe was my best friend. We knew each other long before we both became members of The Oak Ridge Boys. He was a special person who was loved by everyone and was a true inspiration to us all. He was also the best singing partner a person could have. For several years he bravely fought a terrible disease and was a trooper right up until the very end. There is no doubt that today he is in a much better place -- at home with Jesus. I will see you soon my dear friend.\"\n\nBen James: \"Joe was a true hero to me. His singing is something that I have admired since I was a kid. Nobody could do it like Joe could do it. He was such an encouragement to me. I feel honored that he chose me to sing the tenor line when he decided to come off the road. I try my best for Joe and the Boys every night but only Joe can fill that spot. The legacy he leaves with us is something that is irreplaceable. I am forever thankful I got to know and love one of my all-time heroes that was nothing but good to me. I will miss Joe Bonsall. Thank you for loving everyone you met and making them feel like the most important person in your life when you spoke to them.

In lieu of flowers, donations may be made to The ALS Association or to the Vanderbilt Medical Center ALS and Neuroscience Research Center.\n\nWhat other members of the Oak Ridge Boys said:\n\nDuane Allen: \"When I look at Joe Bonsall's life, I see a life fulfilled. The son of two military veterans, he was raised to become street-smart in the hood-influenced neighborhood of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. His parents taught him that he could be anything he wished to be if he worked hard, told the truth and trusted in God. Joe could do anything he set his mind to do, but what impressed me the most was the energy, love and compassion he put into everything he did and his unique gift to communicate those emotions and feelings into every performance, song and book. Joe was 'that' best friend that every person hopes to have in his life.\"\n\nWilliam Lee Golden: \"This has been a week of sadness with the loss of my son, Rusty Golden, and now the loss of our brother and our partner of over 50 years, Joe Bonsall. Thankfully we have the memories made and the songs that we've sang together to get us through. It gives me comfort to know that Joe and Rusty are together again. Our prayers are with his family.\"\n\nRichard Sterban: \"For many years, Joe was my best friend. We knew each other long before we both became members of The Oak Ridge Boys. He was a special person who was loved by everyone and was a true inspiration to us all. He was also the best singing partner a person could have. For several years he bravely fought a terrible disease and was a trooper right up until the very end. There is no doubt that today he is in a much better place -- at home with Jesus. I will see you soon my dear friend.\"\n\nBen James: \"Joe was a true hero to me. His singing is something that I have admired since I was a kid. Nobody could do it like Joe could do it. He was such an encouragement to me. I feel honored that he chose me to sing the tenor line when he decided to come off the road. I try my best for Joe and the Boys every night but only Joe can fill that spot. The legacy he leaves with us is something that is irreplaceable. I am forever thankful I got to know and love one of my all-time heroes that was nothing but good to me. I will miss Joe Bonsall. Thank you for loving everyone you met and making them feel like the most important person in your life when you spoke to them. A true gentleman.\"\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.\n\nSubscribe to stay connected to Tucson.

He loved to read. He loved to write,\" the statement read. \"He loved to play banjo. He loved working on the farm. And he loved the Philadelphia Phillies. But Jesus and his family always came first -- and we will see him again on the Promised Day.\"\n\nA Philadelphia native and resident of Hendersonville, Tennessee, Bonsall left his gospel group the Keystones in 1973 to join the Oak Ridge Boys, which originally formed in the 1940s. He saw the band through its golden period in the '80s and beyond, which included its signature 1981 song, \"Elvira,\" its 1982 hit \"Bobbie Sue\" and 1983's \"American Made.\" \"Elvira\" marked a massive crossover moment for the group, reaching No. 1 on the country chart and No. 5 on Billboard's all-genre Hot 100.\n\nAmyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or ALS, is a disease that damages nerve cells and connections that are necessary to control muscles for movements such as walking, talking and breathing. Most patients die within three to five years of a diagnosis. The illness became known as Lou Gehrig's disease after the star baseball player was diagnosed in 1939.\n\nIn September 2023, the Oak Ridge Boys embarked on a farewell tour that was scheduled to last into 2024. But in January, Bonsall announced his retirement from touring, saying it was too difficult for him physically after a four-year battle with ALS. Ben James, who has performed with Doyle Lawson and Dailey & Vincent, was announced as his replacement.\n\n\"I am now at a point where walking is impossible, so I have basically retired from the road. It has just gotten too difficult,\" Bonsall said at the time of his retirement. \"It has been a great 50 years, and I am thankful to all the Oak Ridge Boys, band, crew, and staff for the constant love and support shown to me through it all. I will never forget, and for those of you who have been constantly holding me up in prayer, I thank you and ask for you to keep on praying.\"\n\nIn June 2022, Bonsall shared on X, formerly Twitter, that he \"could have easily died\" after suffering pulmonary embolisms.\n\nHis memoir, \"I See Myself,\" will be released posthumously in November. It is his 11th book, a collection which includes the four-part children's series, \"The Molly Books.\"\n\nDuring his five decades with the Oak Ridge Boys, Bonsall was a member of the Grand Ole Opry. He was inducted into the Philadelphia Music Hall of Fame, the Gospel Music Hall of Fame, the Vocal Group Hall of Fame and the Country Music Hall of Fame.\n\n\"For 50 years, Joe Bonsall was the Oak Ridge Boys' sparkplug. He was as exciting a performer as any who ever hit a gospel or country stage,\" Kyle Young, CEO of the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum, said in a written statement. \"His tenor voice was high and clear, and his jovial spirit always provided a jolt of energy, immediately rousing audiences to come on in and take a load off. He certainly lightened our cares every time he sang.\"\n\nJohn Rich of country music duo Big & Rich shared a remembrance on X. Country music is crying today,\" he wrote. \"Joe was a real friend, and someone I looked up to not only as an artist, but as a man. He's left a legacy of incredible music, and endless accounts of his kind heartedness.\"\n\nCountry musician Travis Tritt also posted a tribute to Bonsall on X, writing, \"Joe had amazing talent and a wonderful personality and he will be missed terribly by everyone who knew him.\"\n\nBonsall is survived by his wife, Mary Ann; daughters Jennifer and Sabrina; sister Nancy; granddaughter Breanne; grandson Luke; and great grandsons, Chance and Grey.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Here's a look at the stars we've lost so far in 2024, through May.\n\nJoe Bonsall, a 50-year member of the Country Music Hall of Fame group the Oak Ridge Boys, died Tuesday from complications of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis. He was 76.\n\nAmong fellow music artists weighing in Bonsall's death was Blake Shelton, who posted this on social media: \"I'm heartbroken to hear of my friend Joe Bonsall's passing. I've never seen Joe when he wasn't smiling and completely full of life. He absolutely loved singing like no one I ever met. My thoughts and prayers are with his family and the Oak Ridge Boys brothers. We all lost a special person today.\"\n\nA tenor singer with the Oak Ridge Boys, Bonsall announced in January that he was retiring from touring due to health issues. Ben James, formerly with Dailey & Vincent, replaced Bonsall in the touring lineup.\n\n\"Many of you know I have been battling a slow onset (over four years now) of a neuromuscular disorder,\" Bonsall said in his retirement statement.\n\nPeople are also reading...

It has just gotten too difficult. It has been a great 50 years, and I am thankful to all the Oak Ridge Boys, band, crew and staff for the constant love and support shown to me through it all. I will never forget, and for those of you who have been constantly holding me up in prayer, I thank you and ask for you to keep on praying.\"\n\nIn the same statement, Bonsall urged people to support his replacement (Ben James) in the Oak Ridge Boys, who have been managed for decades by Tulsa-based impresario Jim Halsey.\n\n\"God love you, Joe Bonsall,\" Halsey said. \"You have been an inspiration to fans, friends and family -- especially to me -- for 52 years. This is a very rough day.\"\n\nBonsall was a member of the Grand Ole Opry and, in addition to the Country Music Hall of Fame, is in the Philadelphia Music Hall of Fame, the Gospel Music Hall of Fame and the Vocal Group Hall of Fame.\n\nHe saw the band through its golden period in the '80s and beyond, which included its signature 1981 song, \"Elvira,\" its 1982 hit \"Bobbie Sue\" and 1983's \"American Made.\" \"Elvira\" marked a massive crossover moment for the group, reaching No. 1 on the country chart and No. 5 on Billboard's all-genre Hot 100.\n\nOak Ridge Boys' Joe Bonsall retires from touring Jimmie Tramel Tulsa World Oak Ridge Boys celebrating farewell tour, 51-year relationship with Jim Halsey Jimmie Tramel Tulsa World\n\n\"For 50 years, Joe Bonsall was the Oak Ridge Boys' sparkplug. He was as exciting a performer as any who ever hit a gospel or country stage,\" Kyle Young, CEO of the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum, said in a written statement. \"His tenor voice was high and clear, and his jovial spirit always provided a jolt of energy, immediately rousing audiences to come on in and take a load off. He certainly lightened our cares every time he sang.\"\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack\n\nJohn Rich of country music duo Big & Rich shared a remembrance on X. Country music is crying today,\" he wrote. \"Joe was a real friend, and someone I looked up to not only as an artist, but as a man. He's left a legacy of incredible music, and endless accounts of his kind heartedness.\"\n\nCountry musician Travis Tritt also posted a tribute to Bonsall on X, writing, \"Joe had amazing talent and a wonderful personality and he will be missed terribly by everyone who knew him.\"\n\nBonsall wrote 11 books. His memoir, \"I See Myself,\" will be released posthumously in November.\n\nSaid a news release from an Oak Ridge Boys publicist: \"Joe loved to sing. He loved to read. He loved to write. He loved to play banjo. He loved working on the farm. And he loved the Philadelphia Phillies. But Jesus and his family always came first -- and we will see him again on the promised day.\"\n\nSurvivors include his wife, Mary Ann, daughters Jennifer and Sabrina, granddaughter Breanne, grandson Luke, two great grandsons, Chance and Grey, and a sister, Nancy. He was preceded in death by his parents Joseph S. Bonsall Sr. and Lillie Bonsall.\n\nAt the request of Bonsall, there will be no funeral. In lieu of flowers, donations may be made to The ALS Association or to the Vanderbilt Medical Center ALS and Neuroscience Research Center.\n\nWhat other members of the Oak Ridge Boys said:\n\nDuane Allen: \"When I look at Joe Bonsall's life, I see a life fulfilled. The son of two military veterans, he was raised to become street-smart in the hood-influenced neighborhood of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. His parents taught him that he could be anything he wished to be if he worked hard, told the truth and trusted in God. Joe could do anything he set his mind to do, but what impressed me the most was the energy, love and compassion he put into everything he did and his unique gift to communicate those emotions and feelings into every performance, song and book. Joe was 'that' best friend that every person hopes to have in his life.\"\n\nWilliam Lee Golden: \"This has been a week of sadness with the loss of my son, Rusty Golden, and now the loss of our brother and our partner of over 50 years, Joe Bonsall. Thankfully we have the memories made and the songs that we've sang together to get us through. It gives me comfort to know that Joe and Rusty are together again. Our prayers are with his family.\"\n\nRichard Sterban: \"For many years, Joe was my best friend. We knew each other long before we both became members of The Oak Ridge Boys. He was a special person who was loved by everyone and was a true inspiration to us all. He was also the best singing partner a person could have. For several years he bravely fought a terrible disease and was a trooper right up until the very end. There is no doubt that today he is in a much better place -- at home with Jesus. I will see you soon my dear friend.\"\n\nBen James: \"Joe was a true hero to me. His singing is something that I have admired since I was a kid. Nobody could do it like Joe could do it. He was such an encouragement to me. I feel honored that he chose me to sing the tenor line when he decided to come off the road. I try my best for Joe and the Boys every night but only Joe can fill that spot. The legacy he leaves with us is something that is irreplaceable. I am forever thankful I got to know and love one of my all-time heroes that was nothing but good to me. I will miss Joe Bonsall. Thank you for loving everyone you met and making them feel like the most important person in your life when you spoke to them. A true gentleman.\"\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "source": {"uri": "richmond.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Richmond Times-Dispatch"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Here's a look at the stars we've lost so far in 2024, through May.\n\nJoe Bonsall, a 50-year member of the Country Music Hall of Fame group the Oak Ridge Boys, died Tuesday from complications of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis. He was 76.\n\nAmong fellow music artists weighing in Bonsall's death was Blake Shelton, who posted this on social media: \"I'm heartbroken to hear of my friend Joe Bonsall's passing. I've never seen Joe when he wasn't smiling and completely full of life. He absolutely loved singing like no one I ever met. My thoughts and prayers are with his family and the Oak Ridge Boys brothers. We all lost a special person today.\"\n\nA tenor singer with the Oak Ridge Boys, Bonsall announced in January that he was retiring from touring due to health issues. Ben James, formerly with Dailey & Vincent, replaced Bonsall in the touring lineup.\n\n\"Many of you know I have been battling a slow onset (over four years now) of a neuromuscular disorder,\" Bonsall said in his retirement statement.\n\nPeople are also reading...

It has just gotten too difficult. It has been a great 50 years, and I am thankful to all the Oak Ridge Boys, band, crew and staff for the constant love and support shown to me through it all. I will never forget, and for those of you who have been constantly holding me up in prayer, I thank you and ask for you to keep on praying.\"\n\nIn the same statement, Bonsall urged people to support his replacement (Ben James) in the Oak Ridge Boys, who have been managed for decades by Tulsa-based impresario Jim Halsey.\n\n\"God love you, Joe Bonsall,\" Halsey said. \"You have been an inspiration to fans, friends and family -- especially to me -- for 52 years. This is a very rough day.\"\n\nBonsall was a member of the Grand Ole Opry and, in addition to the Country Music Hall of Fame, is in the Philadelphia Music Hall of Fame, the Gospel Music Hall of Fame and the Vocal Group Hall of Fame.\n\nHe saw the band through its golden period in the '80s and beyond, which included its signature 1981 song, \"Elvira,\" its 1982 hit \"Bobbie Sue\" and 1983's \"American Made.\" \"Elvira\" marked a massive crossover moment for the group, reaching No. 1 on the country chart and No. 5 on Billboard's all-genre Hot 100.\n\nOak Ridge Boys' Joe Bonsall retires from touring Jimmie Tramel Tulsa World Oak Ridge Boys celebrating farewell tour, 51-year relationship with Jim Halsey Jimmie Tramel Tulsa World\n\n\"For 50 years, Joe Bonsall was the Oak Ridge Boys' sparkplug. He was as exciting a performer as any who ever hit a gospel or country stage,\" Kyle Young, CEO of the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum, said in a written statement. \"His tenor voice was high and clear, and his jovial spirit always provided a jolt of energy, immediately rousing audiences to come on in and take a load off. He certainly lightened our cares every time he sang.\"\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack\n\nJohn Rich of country music duo Big & Rich shared a remembrance on X. Country music is crying today,\" he wrote. \"Joe was a real friend, and someone I looked up to not only as an artist, but as a man. He's left a legacy of incredible music, and endless accounts of his kind heartedness.\"\n\nCountry musician Travis Tritt also posted a tribute to Bonsall on X, writing, \"Joe had amazing talent and a wonderful personality and he will be missed terribly by everyone who knew him.\"\n\nBonsall wrote 11 books. His memoir, \"I See Myself,\" will be released posthumously in November.\n\nSaid a news release from an Oak Ridge Boys publicist: \"Joe loved to sing. He loved to read. He loved to write. He loved to play banjo. He loved working on the farm. And he loved the Philadelphia Phillies. But Jesus and his family always came first -- and we will see him again on the promised day.\"\n\nSurvivors include his wife, Mary Ann, daughters Jennifer and Sabrina, granddaughter Breanne, grandson Luke, two great grandsons, Chance and Grey, and a sister, Nancy. He was preceded in death by his parents Joseph S. Bonsall Sr. and Lillie Bonsall.\n\nAt the request of Bonsall, there will be no funeral. In lieu of flowers, donations may be made to The ALS Association or to the Vanderbilt Medical Center ALS and Neuroscience Research Center.\n\nWhat other members of the Oak Ridge Boys said:\n\nDuane Allen: \"When I look at Joe Bonsall's life, I see a life fulfilled. The son of two military veterans, he was raised to become street-smart in the hood-influenced neighborhood of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. His parents taught him that he could be anything he wished to be if he worked hard, told the truth and trusted in God. Joe could do anything he set his mind to do, but what impressed me the most was the energy, love and compassion he put into everything he did and his unique gift to communicate those emotions and feelings into every performance, song and book. Joe was 'that' best friend that every person hopes to have in his life.\"\n\nWilliam Lee Golden: \"This has been a week of sadness with the loss of my son, Rusty Golden, and now the loss of our brother and our partner of over 50 years, Joe Bonsall. Thankfully we have the memories made and the songs that we've sang together to get us through. It gives me comfort to know that Joe and Rusty are together again. Our prayers are with his family.\"\n\nRichard Sterban: \"For many years, Joe was my best friend. We knew each other long before we both became members of The Oak Ridge Boys. He was a special person who was loved by everyone and was a true inspiration to us all. He was also the best singing partner a person could have. For several years he bravely fought a terrible disease and was a trooper right up until the very end. There is no doubt that today he is in a much better place -- at home with Jesus. I will see you soon my dear friend.\"\n\nBen James: \"Joe was a true hero to me. His singing is something that I have admired since I was a kid. Nobody could do it like Joe could do it. He was such an encouragement to me. I feel honored that he chose me to sing the tenor line when he decided to come off the road. I try my best for Joe and the Boys every night but only Joe can fill that spot. The legacy he leaves with us is something that is irreplaceable. I am forever thankful I got to know and love one of my all-time heroes that was nothing but good to me. I will miss Joe Bonsall. Thank you for loving everyone you met and making them feel like the most important person in your life when you spoke to them. A true gentleman.\"\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.\n\n0 Comments Love 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up!

Country music is crying today,\" he wrote. \"Joe was a real friend, and someone I looked up to not only as an artist, but as a man. He's left a legacy of incredible music, and endless accounts of his kind heartedness.\"\n\nCountry musician Travis Tritt also posted a tribute to Bonsall on X, writing, \"Joe had amazing talent and a wonderful personality and he will be missed terribly by everyone who knew him.\"\n\nBonsall wrote 11 books. His memoir, \"I See Myself,\" will be released posthumously in November.\n\nSaid a news release from an Oak Ridge Boys publicist: \"Joe loved to sing. He loved to read. He loved to write. He loved to play banjo. He loved working on the farm. And he loved the Philadelphia Phillies. But Jesus and his family always came first -- and we will see him again on the promised day.\"\n\nSurvivors include his wife, Mary Ann, daughters Jennifer and Sabrina, granddaughter Breanne, grandson Luke, two great grandsons, Chance and Grey, and a sister, Nancy. He was preceded in death by his parents Joseph S. Bonsall Sr. and Lillie Bonsall.\n\nAt the request of Bonsall, there will be no funeral. In lieu of flowers, donations may be made to The ALS Association or to the Vanderbilt Medical Center ALS and Neuroscience Research Center.\n\nWhat other members of the Oak Ridge Boys said:\n\nDuane Allen: \"When I look at Joe Bonsall's life, I see a life fulfilled. The son of two military veterans, he was raised to become street-smart in the hood-influenced neighborhood of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. His parents taught him that he could be anything he wished to be if he worked hard, told the truth and trusted in God. Joe could do anything he set his mind to do, but what impressed me the most was the energy, love and compassion he put into everything he did and his unique gift to communicate those emotions and feelings into every performance, song and book. Joe was 'that' best friend that every person hopes to have in his life.\"\n\nWilliam Lee Golden: \"This has been a week of sadness with the loss of my son, Rusty Golden, and now the loss of our brother and our partner of over 50 years, Joe Bonsall. Thankfully we have the memories made and the songs that we've sang together to get us through. It gives me comfort to know that Joe and Rusty are together again. Our prayers are with his family.\"\n\nRichard Sterban: \"For many years, Joe was my best friend. We knew each other long before we both became members of The Oak Ridge Boys. He was a special person who was loved by everyone and was a true inspiration to us all. He was also the best singing partner a person could have. For several years he bravely fought a terrible disease and was a trooper right up until the very end. There is no doubt that today he is in a much better place -- at home with Jesus. I will see you soon my dear friend.\"\n\nBen James: \"Joe was a true hero to me. His singing is something that I have admired since I was a kid. Nobody could do it like Joe could do it. He was such an encouragement to me. I feel honored that he chose me to sing the tenor line when he decided to come off the road. I try my best for Joe and the Boys every night but only Joe can fill that spot. The legacy he leaves with us is something that is irreplaceable. I am forever thankful I got to know and love one of my all-time heroes that was nothing but good to me. I will miss Joe Bonsall. Thank you for loving everyone you met and making them feel like the most important person in your life when you spoke to them. A true gentleman.\"\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or

What to know about the 50-year member of the long-running vocal group.", "body": "Celebrating the life and legacy of Joe Bonsall, the longtime tenor vocalist of the Oak Ridge Boys, who recently passed away at 76 due to ALS complications.\n\nOn Tuesday, Oak Ridge Boys member Joe Bonsall died from complications of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis at 76 years old. In the midst of the tenor vocalist's passing, his longtime band members mourned his loss.\n\nThe Oak Ridge Boy's posted on Instagram, notifying their fans of Bonsall's death.\n\nThe caption said, \"As a 50-year member of the American music group The Oak Ridge Boys, Joe was a member of the Grand Ole Opry and inducted into the Philadelphia Music Hall of Fame, the Gospel Music Hall of Fame, the Vocal Group Hall of Fame, and the prestigious Country Music Hall of Fame.\"\n\nThe post said that Joseph S. Bonsall leaves behind his wife, Mary Ann, daughters Jennifer and Sabrina, granddaughter Breanne, grandson Luke, two great grandsons, Chance and Grey, and sister, Nancy.\n\nAt this time, the family is requesting privacy.\n\n\"Joseph is also the author of 11 books including his latest, a memoir entitled I See Myself, which releases in November,\" the caption continued.\n\n\"Joe loved to sing. He loved to read. He loved to write. He loved to play banjo. He loved working on the farm. And he loved the Philadelphia Phillies. But Jesus and his family always came first -- and we will see him again on the Promised Day.\"\n\nThe band members said that at the request of Bonsall, there will be no funeral.\n\nInstead of flowers, they ask fans to donate to the ALS Association or Vanderbilt Medical Center ALS and Neuroscience Research Center.\n\nBonsall was a singer, author and father who lived in Hendersonville, TN.\n\nA Philadelphia native, Bonsall became the 30th of 35 total performers to join the Oak Ridge Boys. Bonsall joined the group in 1973 and was a 50-year member of the Oak Ridge Boys.\n\nJoe Bonsall announced his retirement from the group in December 2023.\n\nIn a press release, he said, \"Many of you know I have been battling a slow onset (over four years now) of a neuromuscular disorder. I am now at a point where walking is impossible, so I have basically retired from the road.\"\n\n\"It has just gotten too difficult. It has been a great 50 years, and I am thankful to all the Oak Ridge Boys, band, crew and staff for the constant love and support shown to me through it all,\" he continued.\n\n\"I will never forget, and for those of you who have been constantly holding me up in prayer, I thank you and ask for you to keep on praying. The Oak Ridge Boys will finish the Farewell Tour without me, but rest assured, I am good with all of it! God's Got It!!!\"\n\nHe was replaced by singer Ben James upon his retirement.\n\nThe Oak Ridge Boys formed in 1943 in Oak Ridge, Tennessee.\n\nThey grew to popularity in the '50s as Southern gospel music gained momentum. Later, they shifted to country music.\n\nOver the years, they've had approximately 35 members come and go, both as short-term fill-ins and long-term band members.\n\nThe current Oak Ridge Boys members are baritone William Lee Golden, lead vocalist Duane Allen, bass singer Richard Sterban, and Ben James, who replaced Joe Bonsall.\n\nGolden joined in 1965, Allen in 1966, Bonsall in 1973 and Sterban in 1972.\n\nWho were the past Oak Ridge Boys members?\n\nThe quartet has had many singers join them onstage in since '43, and the current three members are only a small fraction of the long list of Oak Ridge Boys.\n\nThe quartet formed in 1943 as a group called Wally Fowler and the Georgia Clodhoppers. They began recording music in 1947.\n\nThe original quartet was comprised of Wally Fowler, Lon \"Deacon\" Freeman, Curly Kinsey and Johnny New.\n\nThe quartet shifted to calling themselves the Oak Ridge Quartet and in '62, started calling themselves the Oak Ridge Boys.\n\n'Elvira' and the Oak Ridge Boys' biggest hits, accolades\n\nThe Oak Ridge Boys are known for songs \"Elvira,\" \"Bobbie Sue,\" \"American Made\" \"Y'all Come Back Saloon\" and \"Leaving Louisiana In The Broad Daylight.\"\n\nThe band was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame in 2015 and has won three Grammy

He was 76.\n\nAmong fellow music artists weighing in Bonsall's death was Blake Shelton, who posted this on social media: \"I'm heartbroken to hear of my friend Joe Bonsall's passing. I've never seen Joe when he wasn't smiling and completely full of life. He absolutely loved singing like no one I ever met. My thoughts and prayers are with his family and the Oak Ridge Boys brothers.

This is a very rough day.\"\n\nBonsall was a member of the Grand Ole Opry and, in addition to the Country Music Hall of Fame, is in the Philadelphia Music Hall of Fame, the Gospel Music Hall of Fame and the Vocal Group Hall of Fame.\n\nHe saw the band through its golden period in the '80s and beyond, which included its signature 1981 song, \"Elvira,\" its 1982 hit \"Bobbie Sue\" and 1983's \"American Made.\" \"Elvira\" marked a massive crossover moment for the group, reaching No. 1 on the country chart and No. 5 on Billboard's all-genre Hot 100.\n\nOak Ridge Boys' Joe Bonsall retires from touring Jimmie Tramel Tulsa World Oak Ridge Boys celebrating farewell tour, 51-year relationship with Jim Halsey Jimmie Tramel Tulsa World\n\n\"For 50 years, Joe Bonsall was the Oak Ridge Boys' sparkplug.

In lieu of flowers, donations may be made to The ALS Association or to the Vanderbilt Medical Center ALS and Neuroscience Research Center.\n\nWhat other members of the Oak Ridge Boys said:\n\nDuane Allen: \"When I look at Joe Bonsall's life, I see a life fulfilled. The son of two military veterans, he was raised to become street-smart in the hood-influenced neighborhood of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. His parents taught him that he could be anything he wished to be if he worked hard, told the truth and trusted in God. Joe could do anything he set his mind to do, but what impressed me the most was the energy, love and compassion he put into everything he did and his unique gift to communicate those emotions and feelings into every performance, song and book. Joe was 'that' best friend that every person hopes to have in his life.\"\n\nWilliam Lee Golden: \"This has been a week of sadness with the loss of my son, Rusty Golden, and now the loss of our brother and our partner of over 50 years, Joe Bonsall. Thankfully we have the memories made and the songs that we've sang together to get us through. It gives me comfort to know that Joe and Rusty are together again. Our prayers are with his family.\"\n\nRichard Sterban: \"For many years, Joe was my best friend. We knew each other long before we both became members of The Oak Ridge Boys. He was a special person who was loved by everyone and was a true inspiration to us all. He was also the best singing partner a person could have. For several years he bravely fought a terrible disease and was a trooper right up until the very end. There is no doubt that today he is in a much better place -- at home with Jesus. I will see you soon my dear friend.\"\n\nBen James: \"Joe was a true hero to me. His singing is something that I have admired since I was a kid. Nobody could do it like Joe could do it. He was such an encouragement to me. I feel honored that he chose me to sing the tenor line when he decided to come off the road. I try my best for Joe and the Boys every night but only Joe can fill that spot. The legacy he leaves with us is something that is irreplaceable. I am forever thankful I got to know and love one of my all-time heroes that was nothing but good to me. I will miss Joe Bonsall. Thank you for loving everyone you met and making them feel like the most important person in your life when you spoke to them.

He loved to read. He loved to write. He loved to play the banjo. He loved to work on the farm. And he loved the Philadelphia Phillies. But Jesus and his family always came first and we will see him again on the Promised Day.\n\nA Philadelphia native and Hendersonville, Tennessee resident, Bonsall left his gospel group, the Keystones, in 1973 to join the Oak Ridge Boys, originally formed in the 1940s. He saw the group through its golden era in the '80s and beyond, which included its 1981 hit \"Elvira,\" its 1982 hit \"Bobbie Sue\" and 1983's \"American Made.\" Elvira marked a massive crossover moment for the group, reaching No. 1 on the country chart and No. 5 on Billboard's all-genre Hot 100.\n\nAmyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or ALS, is a disease that damages nerve cells and connections needed to control muscles for movements such as walking, speaking, and breathing. Most patients die within three to five years of diagnosis. The disease is known as Lou Gehrig's disease after the star baseball player was diagnosed in 1939.\n\nIn September 2023, the Oak Ridge Boys embarked on a farewell tour that was scheduled to last through 2024. But in January, Bonsall announced his retirement from touring, saying it was too physically demanding for him after a four-year battle with ALS. Ben James, who played with Doyle Lawson and Dailey & Vincent was announced as his replacement.\n\n\"I am now at a point where walking is impossible, so I have retired from the road. It has become too difficult,\" Bonsall said at the time of his retirement. \"It has been a great 50 years and I am grateful to all the Oak Ridge Boys, the band, the team and the staff for the constant love and support they have shown me throughout this time. I will never forget, and for those of you who have constantly supported me in prayer, I thank you and ask that you continue to pray.\"\n\nIn June 2022, Bonsall shared on Xformerly Twitter, that he could have easily died after suffering a pulmonary embolism.\n\nHer memoir, I See Myself, will be published posthumously in November. It is her 11th book, a collection that includes the four-part children's series, The Molly Books.\n\nDuring his five decades with the Oak Ridge Boys, Bonsall was a member of The Grand Ole OpryHe has been inducted into the Philadelphia Music Hall of Fame, the Gospel Music Hall of Fame, the Vocal Group Hall of Fame and The Country Music Hall of Fame.\n\nFor 50 years, Joe Bonsall was the driving force behind the Oak Ridge Boys. He was as exciting an entertainer as any who ever graced the gospel or country stage,\" Kyle Young, CEO of the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum, said in a written statement. \"His tenor voice was high and clear, and his jovial spirit always provided a burst of energy, immediately inspiring audiences to come and relax. He certainly lightened our worries every time he sang.\"\n\nJohn Rich of country music duo Big & Rich sharing a memory on X\"Country music mourns today,\" he wrote. \"Joe was a true friend, someone I admired not only as an artist, but as a man. He left behind an incredible legacy of music and countless testaments to his kindness.\"\n\nCountry musician Travis Tritt Also posted a tribute to Bonsall on X, writing, Joe had an incredible talent and a wonderful personality and he will be terribly missed by all who knew him.\n\nBonsall is survived by his wife, Mary Ann;

In lieu of flowers, donations may be made to The ALS Association or to the Vanderbilt Medical Center ALS and Neuroscience Research Center.\n\nWhat other members of the Oak Ridge Boys said:\n\nDuane Allen: \"When I look at Joe Bonsall's life, I see a life fulfilled. The son of two military veterans, he was raised to become street-smart in the hood-influenced neighborhood of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. His parents taught him that he could be anything he wished to be if he worked hard, told the truth and trusted in God. Joe could do anything he set his mind to do, but what impressed me the most was the energy, love and compassion he put into everything he did and his unique gift to communicate those emotions and feelings into every performance, song and book. Joe was 'that' best friend that every person hopes to have in his life.\"\n\nWilliam Lee Golden: \"This has been a week of sadness with the loss of my son, Rusty Golden, and now the loss of our brother and our partner of over 50 years, Joe Bonsall. Thankfully we have the memories made and the songs that we've sang together to get us through. It gives me comfort to know that Joe and Rusty are together again. Our prayers are with his family.\"\n\nRichard Sterban: \"For many years, Joe was my best friend. We knew each other long before we both became members of The Oak Ridge Boys. He was a special person who was loved by everyone and was a true inspiration to us all. He was also the best singing partner a person could have. For several years he bravely fought a terrible disease and was a trooper right up until the very end. There is no doubt that today he is in a much better place -- at home with Jesus. I will see you soon my dear friend.\"\n\nBen James: \"Joe was a true hero to me. His singing is something that I have admired since I was a kid. Nobody could do it like Joe could do it. He was such an encouragement to me. I feel honored that he chose me to sing the tenor line when he decided to come off the road. I try my best for Joe and the Boys every night but only Joe can fill that spot. The legacy he leaves with us is something that is irreplaceable. I am forever thankful I got to know and love one of my all-time heroes that was nothing but good to me. I will miss Joe Bonsall. Thank you for loving everyone you met and making them feel like the most important person in your life when you spoke to them. A true gentleman.\"\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or

Bonsall Jr.) comes months after the musician announced his retirement from touring with The Oak Ridge Boys. The tenor singer told PEOPLE that he was stepping back to prioritize his health amid a years-long battle, though he kept his exact diagnosis private at the time.\n\n\"Many of you know I have been battling a slow onset (over four years now) of a neuromuscular disorder. I am now to a point that walking is impossible so I have basically retired from the road,\" he said in January. \"It has just gotten too difficult. It has been a great 50 years and I am thankful to all the Oak Ridge Boys band crew and staff for the constant love and support shown to me through it all.\"\n\nThe musician added, \"I will never forget and for those of you who have been constantly holding me up in prayer I thank you and ask for you to keep on praying.\"\n\nBonsall, born and raised in Philadelphia, had been a member of The Oak Ridge Boys for over 50 years before his death. According to the band's website, he began singing around age 4 and later \"fell in love with Southern Gospel music harmony\" in his mid-teens.\n\nHe joined the legendary group in 1973 before they emerged onto the country music scene, where they eventually spawned dozens of hits (including 1984's \"American Made\") and a host of accolades that landed them -- including Bonsall -- in the prestigious Grand Ole Opry, the Vocal Group Hall of Fame, the Gospel Music Hall of Fame and the Country Music Hall of Fame. Bonsall was also inducted into the Philadelphia Music Hall of Fame back in 1994.\n\nIn addition to being a mainstay in one of country music's leading bands, Bonsall also achieved feats outside of music, like writing 11 books, per the press release -- including an upcoming memoir titled I See Myself, which will be released in November.\n\nPrior to his retirement, the singer-songwriter's band announced a celebratory farewell tour to commemorate their 50th anniversary. \"We are doing a farewell tour because we owe it to our fans to say goodbye,\" William Lee Golden said in a press release. \"They have always been there for us through the good times and the bad. I will always be thankful to every person who came out to a show, bought a T-shirt, played our music, and overall, loved us enough to spend their hard-earned money whenever they could. This tour is for you!\"\n\nRelated: Rusty Golden, Son of the Oak Ridge Boys' William Lee Golden, Dies at 65: 'A Wonderful Son'\n\nIn his own statement, Bonsall told PEOPLE, \"You could have never convinced that 25-year-old Joe Bonsall in 1973 that in 50 years the four of us would still be singing together and still loving every second of it.\"\n\n\"Our mantra has always been LET'S SING... it still is!\" he concluded. \"We have had our share of challenges over all these decades, but we have always persevered as men who have each always cared about doing things right and God has blessed us for it.\"", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ALS", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "ALS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Oak_Ridge_Boys", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Oak Ridge Boys"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonsall,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bonsall, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bonsall, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Bonsall", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Joe Bonsall"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nancy_Reagan", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nancy Reagan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country_Music_Hall_of_Fame_and_Museum", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanderbilt_University_Medical_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vanderbilt University Medical Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroscience", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Neuroscience"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurology", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Neurology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_gospel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Southern gospel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tenor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tenor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmony", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Harmony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Country music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Made_(song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American Made (song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vocal_Group_Hall_of_Fame", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vocal Group Hall of Fame"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Lee_Golden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "William Lee Golden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gospel_Music_Hall_of_Fame", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gospel Music Hall of Fame"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Ole_Opry", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Grand Ole Opry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_Football_Hall_of_Fame", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pro Football Hall of Fame"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_chart", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Record chart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coming_out", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coming out"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "God"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Styles", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Styles", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Musical", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Musical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/7r3hQqG2dbVraxjakDuHxQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/people_218/1b9ed4b5c7f37d0decd8818fd3e5d6c2", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9718643", "eventUri": "eng-9718643", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-09", "textStart": 329, "textEnd": 335}], "sentiment": -0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 219, "relevance": 1}

In lieu of flowers, donations may be made to The ALS Association or to the Vanderbilt Medical Center ALS and Neuroscience Research Center.\n\nWhat other members of the Oak Ridge Boys said:\n\nDuane Allen: \"When I look at Joe Bonsall's life, I see a life fulfilled. The son of two military veterans, he was raised to become street-smart in the hood-influenced neighborhood of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. His parents taught him that he could be anything he wished to be if he worked hard, told the truth and trusted in God. Joe could do anything he set his mind to do, but what impressed me the most was the energy, love and compassion he put into everything he did and his unique gift to communicate those emotions and feelings into every performance, song and book. Joe was 'that' best friend that every person hopes to have in his life.\"\n\nWilliam Lee Golden: \"This has been a week of sadness with the loss of my son, Rusty Golden, and now the loss of our brother and our partner of over 50 years, Joe Bonsall. Thankfully we have the memories made and the songs that we've sang together to get us through. It gives me comfort to know that Joe and Rusty are together again. Our prayers are with his family.\"\n\nRichard Sterban: \"For many years, Joe was my best friend. We knew each other long before we both became members of The Oak Ridge Boys. He was a special person who was loved by everyone and was a true inspiration to us all. He was also the best singing partner a person could have. For several years he bravely fought a terrible disease and was a trooper right up until the very end. There is no doubt that today he is in a much better place -- at home with Jesus. I will see you soon my dear friend.\"\n\nBen James: \"Joe was a true hero to me. His singing is something that I have admired since I was a kid. Nobody could do it like Joe could do it. He was such an encouragement to me. I feel honored that he chose me to sing the tenor line when he decided to come off the road. I try my best for Joe and the Boys every night but only Joe can fill that spot. The legacy he leaves with us is something that is irreplaceable. I am forever thankful I got to know and love one of my all-time heroes that was nothing but good to me. I will miss Joe Bonsall. Thank you for loving everyone you met and making them feel like the most important person in your life when you spoke to them. A true gentleman.\"\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.\n\n0 Comments Be the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that

The degenerative nervous system disease can affect nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord.\n\nBonsall announced on social media about six months ago that he was leaving the group.\n\n\"Many of you know I have been battling a slow onset (over 4 years now) of a neuromuscular disorder,\" he wrote. \"I am now to a point that walking is impossible so I have basically retired from the road. It has just gotten too difficult.\"\n\nBonsall noted that \"it has been a great 50 years and I am thankful to all the Oak Ridge Boys band crew and staff for the constant love and support shown to me through it all.\"\n\n\"I will never forget and for those of you who have been constantly holding me up in prayer I thank you and ask for you to keep on praying,\" he added.\n\nBonsall explained at the time that Ben James is singing in the group in his stead, writing that \"his sound is different than mine but he brings a ton of talent to the table!\"\n\n\"The @oakridgeboys will finish the Farewell Tour without me but rest assured I am good with all of it!\" he concluded. \"God's Got It!!!\"\n\nThe country and gospel quartet, originally founded in 1943 out ot Tennessee, are known for songs including \"Elvira\" and \"American Made.\" Bonsall joined the group in 1973.\n\nDuring his long career, Bonsall became a member of the Grand Ole Opry and was inducted into the Philadelphia Music Hall of Fame, the Gospel Music Hall of Fame, the Vocal Group Hall of Fame, and the Country Music Hall of Fame.\n\nHe was also the author of 11 books, including a memoir titled, \"I See Myself: Musings and Memories of a Blessed Life,\" which is set to be published in November.\n\n\"Joe loved to sing.

The announcement was made on July 9 by representatives of the artist and the group.\n\nSix months ago, citing the half-decade onset of the previously-mentioned disorder, Bonsall retired from performing on the road with the group after 50 years.\n\nNotably, alongside his Country Music Hall of Fame and Grand Ole Opry membership, Bonsall was an inductee of the Philadelphia Music Hall of Fame and Gospel Music Hall of Fame.\n\n\"It has been a great 50 years and I am thankful to all the Oak Ridge Boys, band, crew and staff for the constant love and support shown to me through it all. I will never forget, and for those of you who have been constantly holding me up in prayer,\" stated Bonsall in January to The Tennessean.\n\nThe Philadelphia native had already been replaced on the road by bluegrass and gospel performer Ben James alongside Duane Allen, William Lee Golden and Richard Sterban. In November 2022, James appeared with the quartet who, while performing on the same billing as Dailey & Vincent, brought him onstage to perform their 40-year-old crossover smash \"Elvira.\"\n\n\"Joe handed me the mic and said, 'You've got the next verse. And I'm not sure I will ever get over that moment. 'Elvira' was always on repeat when I was growing up. It's still one of those timeless songs that never grow old,\" offered James in a press statement.\n\nHis Oak Ridge Boys legacy\n\nIn a Dec. 2023 feature, Bonsall described a career as an Oak Ridge Boy member that saw him play over 10,000 concerts in amphitheaters, arenas, stadiums and theaters worldwide as bearing witness to an \"amazing phenomenon\" that \"took on a life of its own\" and \"marks so many unique spaces, stories and times.\"\n\nHe added that the group \"represented the place to be for five decades. Four guys who looked like they shouldn't even know each other have blended harmonies and had a celebrated career.\"\n\nBonsall became an Oak Ridge Boy in Oct. 1973, the 30th of 35 total performers to perform in the group since its 1947 inception.\n\nFor 35 years, The Oak Ridge Boys achieved excellence as a Southern gospel quartet with soulful leanings. However, by the mid-1970s, the group evolved its image in a cosmopolitan direction. Clad in suits from Hollywood fashion designer Harvey Krantz, they began emphasizing \"entertainment\" over preaching to create a mainstream pop-ready, GQ-style country act.\n\nThat spurred a run of 14 Top 10 Billboard Country chart singles, began with 1977's \"Y'all Come Back Saloon\" and included songs like \"Elvira\" and \"American Made\" among many hits.\n\nThat success was marked by moments like 1978's NBC-broadcasted \"World's Largest Indoor Country Music Show,\" where the Oak Ridge Boys appeared at Detroit's Pontiac Silverdome alongside Kenny Rogers, Minnie Pearl, Dottie West and numerous others.\n\n\"We're out there in front of a national audience and 60,000 people running all over the stage singing country music and then we put that big gospel ending on it. It was a feeling like nothing else I'd felt to that point,\" Bonsall recalled to The Tennessean.\n\nBonsall's other notable career interests\n\nOver the past three decades, the vocalist was also the author of 11 books, including \"The Molly Books,\" a four-part children's book series, 2003's \"GI Joe and Lillie,\" about his parents' lives during and after World War II, plus his forthcoming memoir, \"I See Myself,\" which is still scheduled for a Nov. 13, 2024 release.\n\nAbout his memoir, a press statement notes the following:\n\n\"In 'I See Myself,' Joe Bonsall reflects on his life's contrasts and crossroads. From growing up in the inner city of Philadelphia to sitting on the front porch of his log home in rural Tennessee. From hanging with a street gang in his teens to surrendering to Christ at a youth camp. From working as a short order cook to headlining sold-out arenas. And now -- from running across the stage each night to being sidelined by a neuromuscular disorder that has stolen his mobility. However, despite the changing circumstances of Joe's life, two things have not changed. His unwavering faith in God. And his ability to inspire others.\"\n\nBonsall's memoir is currently available for pre-order via Amazon.\n\nAt Bonsall's request, there will be no funeral. Instead of flowers, donations may be made to The ALS Association or the Vanderbilt Medical Center ALS and Neuroscience Research Center.", "source": {"uri": "tennessean.com", "dataType": "news",

Here's a look at the stars we've lost so far in 2024, through May.\n\nJoe Bonsall, a 50-year member of the Country Music Hall of Fame group the Oak Ridge Boys, died Tuesday from complications of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis. He was 76.\n\nAmong fellow music artists weighing in Bonsall's death was Blake Shelton, who posted this on social media: \"I'm heartbroken to hear of my friend Joe Bonsall's passing. I've never seen Joe when he wasn't smiling and completely full of life. He absolutely loved singing like no one I ever met. My thoughts and prayers are with his family and the Oak Ridge Boys brothers. We all lost a special person today.\"\n\nA tenor singer with the Oak Ridge Boys, Bonsall announced in January that he was retiring from touring due to health issues. Ben James, formerly with Dailey & Vincent, replaced Bonsall in the touring lineup.\n\n\"Many of you know I have been battling a slow onset (over four years now) of a neuromuscular disorder,\" Bonsall said in his retirement statement.\n\nPeople are also reading...

I will never forget, and for those of you who have been constantly holding me up in prayer, I thank you and ask for you to keep on praying.\"\n\nIn the same statement, Bonsall urged people to support his replacement (Ben James) in the Oak Ridge Boys, who have been managed for decades by Tulsa-based impresario Jim Halsey.\n\n\"God love you, Joe Bonsall,\" Halsey said. \"You have been an inspiration to fans, friends and family -- especially to me -- for 52 years. This is a very rough day.\"\n\nBonsall was a member of the Grand Ole Opry and, in addition to the Country Music Hall of Fame, is in the Philadelphia Music Hall of Fame, the Gospel Music Hall of Fame and the Vocal Group Hall of Fame.\n\nHe saw the band through its golden period in the '80s and beyond, which included its signature 1981 song, \"Elvira,\" its 1982 hit \"Bobbie Sue\" and 1983's \"American Made.\" \"Elvira\" marked a massive crossover moment for the group, reaching No. 1 on the country chart and No. 5 on Billboard's all-genre Hot 100.\n\nOak Ridge Boys' Joe Bonsall retires from touring Jimmie Tramel Tulsa World Oak Ridge Boys celebrating farewell tour, 51-year relationship with Jim Halsey Jimmie Tramel Tulsa World\n\n\"For 50 years, Joe Bonsall was the Oak Ridge Boys' sparkplug. He was as exciting a performer as any who ever hit a gospel or country stage,\" Kyle Young, CEO of the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum, said in a written statement. \"His tenor voice was high and clear, and his jovial spirit always provided a jolt of energy, immediately rousing audiences to come on in and take a load off. He certainly lightened our cares every time he sang.\"\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack\n\nJohn Rich of country music duo Big & Rich shared a remembrance on X. Country music is crying today,\" he wrote. \"Joe was a real friend, and someone I looked up to not only as an artist, but as a man. He's left a legacy of incredible music, and endless accounts of his kind heartedness.\"\n\nCountry musician Travis Tritt also posted a tribute to Bonsall on X, writing, \"Joe had amazing talent and a wonderful personality and he will be missed terribly by everyone who knew him.\"\n\nBonsall wrote 11 books. His memoir, \"I See Myself,\" will be released posthumously in November.\n\nSaid a news release from an Oak Ridge Boys publicist: \"Joe loved to sing. He loved to read. He loved to write. He loved to play banjo. He loved working on the farm. And he loved the Philadelphia Phillies. But Jesus and his family always came first -- and we will see him again on the promised day.\"\n\nSurvivors include his wife, Mary Ann, daughters Jennifer and Sabrina, granddaughter Breanne, grandson Luke, two great grandsons, Chance and Grey, and a sister, Nancy. He was preceded in death by his parents Joseph S. Bonsall Sr. and Lillie Bonsall.\n\nAt the request of Bonsall, there will be no funeral. In lieu of flowers, donations may be made to The ALS Association or to the Vanderbilt Medical Center ALS and Neuroscience Research Center.\n\nWhat other members of the Oak Ridge Boys said:\n\nDuane Allen: \"When I look at Joe Bonsall's life, I see a life fulfilled. The son of two military veterans, he was raised to become street-smart in the hood-influenced neighborhood of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. His parents taught him that he could be anything he wished to be if he worked hard, told the truth and trusted in God. Joe could do anything he set his mind to do, but what impressed me the most was the energy, love and compassion he put into everything he did and his unique gift to communicate those emotions and feelings into every performance, song and book. Joe was 'that' best friend that every person hopes to have in his life.\"\n\nWilliam Lee Golden: \"This has been a week of sadness with the loss of my son, Rusty Golden, and now the loss of our brother and our partner of over 50 years, Joe Bonsall. Thankfully we have the memories made and the songs that we've sang together to get us through. It gives me comfort to know that Joe and Rusty are together again. Our prayers are with his family.\"\n\nRichard Sterban: \"For many years, Joe was my best friend. We knew each other long before we both became members of The Oak Ridge Boys. He was a special person who was loved by everyone and was a true inspiration to us all. He was also the best singing partner a person could have. For several years he bravely fought a terrible disease and was a trooper right up until the very end. There is no doubt that today he is in a much better place -- at home with Jesus. I will see you soon my dear friend.\"\n\nBen James: \"Joe was a true hero to me. His singing is something that I have admired since I was a kid. Nobody could do it like Joe could do it. He was such an encouragement to me. I feel honored that he chose me to sing the tenor line when he decided to come off the road. I try my best for Joe and the Boys every night but only Joe can fill that spot. The legacy he leaves with us is something that is irreplaceable. I am forever thankful I got to know and love one of my all-time heroes that was nothing but good to me. I will miss Joe Bonsall. Thank you for loving everyone you met and making them feel like the most important person in your life when you spoke to them. A true gentleman.\"\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or

He became a member after a gig with the Keystones and was a mainstay as the group achieved mainstream success throughout the '70s and '80s. The Tennessee group gained popularity in gospel circles and touted Johnny Cash, Ray Charles, Brenda Lee and Paul Simon among its collaborators.\n\nThe group earned its first Grammy Award in the gospel performance category in 1971. The Oak Ridge Boys would go on to win four additional Grammys, including one for \"Elvira\" in 1982. The group has a total of 23 Grammy nominations.\n\n\"We're the act that won't go away,\" Bonsall told The Times in 1996 after a performance in Glendale, California. \"We're not kids anymore, but we're out there rockin'.\"\n\nBonsall, a member of the Grand Ole Opry, was also inducted into the Philadelphia Music Hall of Fame, the Gospel Music Hall of Fame, the Vocal Group Hall of Fame and the Country Music Hall of Fame, according to his website.\n\nThe musician was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame in 2015, the same year the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that same-sex couples have a constitutional right to marry in the United States.

He's survived by his wife, Mary Ann, daughters Jennifer and Sabrina, granddaughter Breanne, grandson Luke, two great-grandsons, Chance and Grey and a sister, Nancy. The family requests privacy at this time.\n\nPer Bonsall's request, a funeral will not be held for him, but donations can be made to The ALS Association or to the Vanderbilt Medical Center ALS and Neuroscience Research Center.\n\nThe death of Bonsall (born Joseph S. Bonsall Jr.) comes months after the musician announced his retirement from touring with The Oak Ridge Boys. The tenor singer told PEOPLE that he was stepping back to prioritize his health amid a years-long battle, though he kept his exact diagnosis private at the time.\n\n\"Many of you know I have been battling a slow onset (over four years now) of a neuromuscular disorder. I am now to a point that walking is impossible so I have basically retired from the road,\" he said in January. \"It has just gotten too difficult. It has been a great 50 years and I am thankful to all the Oak Ridge Boys band crew and staff for the constant love and support shown to me through it all.\"\n\nThe musician added, \"I will never forget and for those of you who have been constantly holding me up in prayer I thank you and ask for you to keep on praying.\"\n\nBonsall, born and raised in Philadelphia, had been a member of The Oak Ridge Boys for over 50 years before his death. According to the band's website, he began singing around age 4 and later \"fell in love with Southern Gospel music harmony\" in his mid-teens.\n\nHe joined the legendary group in 1973 before they emerged onto the country music scene, where they eventually spawned dozens of hits (including 1984's \"American Made\") and a host of accolades that landed them -- including Bonsall -- in the prestigious Grand Ole Opry, the Vocal Group Hall of Fame, the Gospel Music Hall of Fame and the Country Music Hall of Fame. Bonsall was also inducted into the Philadelphia Music Hall of Fame back in 1994.\n\nIn addition to being a mainstay in one of country music's leading bands, Bonsall also achieved feats outside of music, like writing 11 books, per the press release -- including an upcoming memoir titled I See Myself, which will be released in November.\n\nPrior to his retirement, the singer-songwriter's band announced a celebratory farewell tour to commemorate their 50th anniversary. \"We are doing a farewell tour because we owe it to our fans to say goodbye,\" William Lee Golden said in a press release. \"They have always been there for us through the good times and the bad. I will always be thankful to every person who came out to a show, bought a T-shirt, played our music, and overall, loved us enough to spend their hard-earned money whenever they could. This tour is for you!\"\n\nIn his own statement, Bonsall told PEOPLE, \"You could have never convinced that 25-year-old Joe Bonsall in 1973 that in 50 years the four of us would still be singing together and still loving every second of it.\"\n\n\"Our mantra has always been LET'S SING... it still is!\" he concluded. \"We have had our share of challenges over all these decades, but we have always persevered as men who have each always cared about doing things right and God has blessed us for it.\"", "source": {"uri": "people.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "PEOPLE.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ALS", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "ALS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Oak_Ridge_Boys", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Oak Ridge Boys"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonsall,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bonsall, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bonsall, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country_Music_Hall_of_Fame_and_Museum", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Bonsall", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Bonsall"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nancy_Reagan", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nancy Reagan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanderbilt_University_Medical_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vanderbilt University Medical Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ALS_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ALS Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tenor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tenor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_gospel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Southern gospel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmony", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Harmony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_chart", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Record chart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Country music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Made_(song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American Made (song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vocal_Group_Hall_of_Fame", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vocal Group Hall of Fame"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Lee_Golden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "William Lee Golden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gospel_Music_Hall_of_Fame", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gospel Music Hall of Fame"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Ole_Opry", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Grand Ole Opry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_Football_Hall_of_Fame", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pro Football Hall of Fame"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coming_out", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coming out"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "God"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Styles", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Styles", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Musical", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Musical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://people.com/thmb/OdBmSpRM9HRZuiklCtQsl8NkKXs=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(745x207:747x209)/Joe-Bonsall-Oak-Ridge-Boys-070924-tout-1a044427ac074e6fa2be78c41468f211.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9718643", "eventUri": "eng-9718643", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-09", "textStart": 190, "textEnd": 196}], "sentiment": -0.192156862745098, "wgt": 213, "relevance": 1}

Here's a look at the stars we've lost so far in 2024, through May.\n\nJoe Bonsall, a 50-year member of the Country Music Hall of Fame group the Oak Ridge Boys, died Tuesday from complications of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis. He was 76.\n\nAmong fellow music artists weighing in Bonsall's death was Blake Shelton, who posted this on social media: \"I'm heartbroken to hear of my friend Joe Bonsall's passing. I've never seen Joe when he wasn't smiling and completely full of life. He absolutely loved singing like no one I ever met. My thoughts and prayers are with his family and the Oak Ridge Boys brothers. We all lost a special person today.\"\n\nA tenor singer with the Oak Ridge Boys, Bonsall announced in January that he was retiring from touring due to health issues. Ben James, formerly with Dailey & Vincent, replaced Bonsall in the touring lineup.\n\n\"Many of you know I have been battling a slow onset (over four years now) of a neuromuscular disorder,\" Bonsall said in his retirement statement.\n\nPeople are also reading...\n\nPi Pizzeria closing last remaining location, in St. Louis' Central West End McClellan: Downtown St. Louis is a casualty of the do-gooder war Tropical Storm Beryl could hit St. Louis area with 4 inches of rain or more Hulk Hogan starts selling his new Real American Beer in Missouri, competing with Bud Light BenFred: Why Jordan Walker's name will provide hot-stove fodder as Cardinals near trade deadline Wentzville schools investigated board members for alleged retaliation, ethics violations Parades, fireworks and parties: Your guide to July 4th in St. Louis Several St. Louis-area cities move fireworks shows to Friday.

I will never forget, and for those of you who have been constantly holding me up in prayer, I thank you and ask for you to keep on praying.\"\n\nIn the same statement, Bonsall urged people to support his replacement (Ben James) in the Oak Ridge Boys, who have been managed for decades by Tulsa-based impresario Jim Halsey.\n\n\"God love you, Joe Bonsall,\" Halsey said. \"You have been an inspiration to fans, friends and family -- especially to me -- for 52 years. This is a very rough day.\"\n\nBonsall was a member of the Grand Ole Opry and, in addition to the Country Music Hall of Fame, is in the Philadelphia Music Hall of Fame, the Gospel Music Hall of Fame and the Vocal Group Hall of Fame.\n\nHe saw the band through its golden period in the '80s and beyond, which included its signature 1981 song, \"Elvira,\" its 1982 hit \"Bobbie Sue\" and 1983's \"American Made.\" \"Elvira\" marked a massive crossover moment for the group, reaching No. 1 on the country chart and No. 5 on Billboard's all-genre Hot 100.\n\nOak Ridge Boys' Joe Bonsall retires from touring\n\nJimmie Tramel Tulsa World\n\nOak Ridge Boys celebrating farewell tour, 51-year relationship with Jim Halsey\n\nJimmie Tramel Tulsa World\n\n\"For 50 years, Joe Bonsall was the Oak Ridge Boys' sparkplug. He was as exciting a performer as any who ever hit a gospel or country stage,\" Kyle Young, CEO of the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum, said in a written statement. \"His tenor voice was high and clear, and his jovial spirit always provided a jolt of energy, immediately rousing audiences to come on in and take a load off. He certainly lightened our cares every time he sang.\"\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack\n\nJohn Rich of country music duo Big & Rich shared a remembrance on X. Country music is crying today,\" he wrote. \"Joe was a real friend, and someone I looked up to not only as an artist, but as a man. He's left a legacy of incredible music, and endless accounts of his kind heartedness.\"\n\nCountry musician Travis Tritt also posted a tribute to Bonsall on X, writing, \"Joe had amazing talent and a wonderful personality and he will be missed terribly by everyone who knew him.\"\n\nBonsall wrote 11 books. His memoir, \"I See Myself,\" will be released posthumously in November.\n\nSaid a news release from an Oak Ridge Boys publicist: \"Joe loved to sing. He loved to read. He loved to write. He loved to play banjo. He loved working on the farm. And he loved the Philadelphia Phillies. But Jesus and his family always came first -- and we will see him again on the promised day.\"\n\nSurvivors include his wife, Mary Ann, daughters Jennifer and Sabrina, granddaughter Breanne, grandson Luke, two great grandsons, Chance and Grey, and a sister, Nancy. He was preceded in death by his parents Joseph S. Bonsall Sr. and Lillie Bonsall.\n\nAt the request of Bonsall, there will be no funeral. In lieu of flowers, donations may be made to The ALS Association or to the Vanderbilt Medical Center ALS and Neuroscience Research Center.\n\nWhat other members of the Oak Ridge Boys said:\n\nDuane Allen: \"When I look at Joe Bonsall's life, I see a life fulfilled. The son of two military veterans, he was raised to become street-smart in the hood-influenced neighborhood of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. His parents taught him that he could be anything he wished to be if he worked hard, told the truth and trusted in God. Joe could do anything he set his mind to do, but what impressed me the most was the energy, love and compassion he put into everything he did and his unique gift to communicate those emotions and feelings into every performance, song and book. Joe was 'that' best friend that every person hopes to have in his life.\"\n\nWilliam Lee Golden: \"This has been a week of sadness with the loss of my son, Rusty Golden, and now the loss of our brother and our partner of over 50 years, Joe Bonsall. Thankfully we have the memories made and the songs that we've sang together to get us through. It gives me comfort to know that Joe and Rusty are together again. Our prayers are with his family.\"\n\nRichard Sterban: \"For many years, Joe was my best friend. We knew each other long before we both became members of The Oak Ridge Boys. He was a special person who was loved by everyone and was a true inspiration to us all. He was also the best singing partner a person could have. For several years he bravely fought a terrible disease and was a trooper right up until the very end. There is no doubt that today he is in a much better place -- at home with Jesus. I will see you soon my dear friend.\"\n\nBen James: \"Joe was a true hero to me. His singing is something that I have admired since I was a kid. Nobody could do it like Joe could do it. He was such an encouragement to me. I feel honored that he chose me to sing the tenor line when he decided to come off the road. I try my best for Joe and the Boys every night but only Joe can fill that spot. The legacy he leaves with us is something that is irreplaceable. I am forever thankful I got to know and love one of my all-time heroes that was nothing but good to me. I will miss Joe Bonsall. Thank you for loving everyone you met and making them feel like the most important person in your life when you spoke to them. A true gentleman.\"\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up!\n\n* I understand and agree that registration on

He loved to read. He loved to write,\" the statement read. \"He loved to play banjo. He loved working on the farm. And he loved the Philadelphia Phillies. But Jesus and his family always came first -- and we will see him again on the Promised Day.\"\n\nA Philadelphia native and resident of Hendersonville, Tennessee, Bonsall left his gospel group the Keystones in 1973 to join the Oak Ridge Boys, which originally formed in the 1940s.

Now what?\n\nAmyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or ALS, is a disease that damages nerve cells and connections that are necessary to control muscles for movements such as walking, talking and breathing. Most patients die within three to five years of a diagnosis. The illness became known as Lou Gehrig's disease after the star baseball player was diagnosed in 1939.\n\nIn September 2023, the Oak Ridge Boys embarked on a farewell tour that was scheduled to last into 2024. But in January, Bonsall announced his retirement from touring, saying it was too difficult for him physically after a four-year battle with ALS. Ben James, who has performed with Doyle Lawson and Dailey & Vincent, was announced as his replacement.\n\n\"I am now at a point where walking is impossible, so I have basically retired from the road. It has just gotten too difficult,\" Bonsall said at the time of his retirement. \"It has been a great 50 years, and I am thankful to all the Oak Ridge Boys, band, crew, and staff for the constant love and support shown to me through it all. I will never forget, and for those of you who have been constantly holding me up in prayer, I thank you and ask for you to keep on praying.\"\n\nIn June 2022, Bonsall shared on X, formerly Twitter, that he \"could have easily died\" after suffering pulmonary embolisms.\n\nHis memoir, \"I See Myself,\" will be released posthumously in November. It is his 11th book, a collection which includes the four-part children's series, \"The Molly Books.\"\n\nDuring his five decades with the Oak Ridge Boys, Bonsall was a member of the Grand Ole Opry. He was inducted into the Philadelphia Music Hall of Fame, the Gospel Music Hall of Fame, the Vocal Group Hall of Fame and the Country Music Hall of Fame.\n\n\"For 50 years, Joe Bonsall was the Oak Ridge Boys' sparkplug. He was as exciting a performer as any who ever hit a gospel or country stage,\" Kyle Young, CEO of the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum, said in a written statement. \"His tenor voice was high and clear, and his jovial spirit always provided a jolt of energy, immediately rousing audiences to come on in and take a load off. He certainly lightened our cares every time he sang.\"\n\nJohn Rich of country music duo Big & Rich shared a remembrance on X. Country music is crying today,\" he wrote. \"Joe was a real friend, and someone I looked up to not only as an artist, but as a man. He's left a legacy of incredible music, and endless accounts of his kind heartedness.\"\n\nCountry musician Travis Tritt also posted a tribute to Bonsall on X, writing, \"Joe had amazing talent and a wonderful personality and he will be missed terribly by everyone who knew him.\"\n\nBonsall is survived by his wife, Mary Ann; daughters Jennifer and Sabrina; sister Nancy; granddaughter Breanne; grandson Luke; and great grandsons, Chance and Grey.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Bonsall was on the road often during his five decades with the group, before stepping aside earlier this year as ALS impacted his life.\n\n\"I am now at a point where walking is impossible, so I have basically retired from the road. It has just gotten too difficult,\" he said in January. \"It has been a great 50 years, and I am thankful to all the Oak Ridge Boys, band, crew and staff for the constant love and support shown to me through it all.\"\n\nBorn May 18, 1948, in Philadelphia, Bonsall's music career took him to Harrisburg and Buffalo with different gospel groups before he moved to Hendersonville, Tenn., and joined the Oak Ridge Boys.\n\nThe group itself had been through turbulent times since it was founded in the 1940s, with multiple massive lineup changes and little commercial success to speak of. Even a cosign from Johnny Cash in 1973 and a record deal with Columbia couldn't propel them to success.\n\nBut in 1977, the Oak Ridge Boys released \"Y'all Come Back Saloon,\" and their run of country dominance began.\n\n\"In 1977 we knew we were on our way to making it when 'Y'all Come Back Saloon' was on every jukebox in the country,\" Bonsall told Ellicottville Now in 2023. \"You'd see four guys feeding the boxes quarters so they could play the song over and over again. It's a wonder we didn't get beat with a tire iron.\"\n\n\"Elvira,\" originally recorded in 1966 by Dallas Frazier, became the group's biggest hit in 1981, topping the country charts and reaching No. 5 on the Billboard Hot 100. The Oak Ridge Boys eventually racked up 17 No. 1 country hits through 1990.\n\nThey were inducted into the Gospel Music Hall of Fame in 2000, and the Country Music Hall of Fame in 2015.\n\nAlong with his work as a singer, Bonsall also penned 10 books, including a four-part children's series. His 11th book, a memoir called \"I See Myself,\" is scheduled for release in November.\n\n\"I'm heartbroken to hear of my friend Joe Bonsall's passing,\" country star Blake Shelton wrote Tuesday on social media. \"I've NEVER seen Joe when he wasn't smiling and completely full of life. He absolutely loved singing like no one I ever met. My thoughts and prayers are with his family and his Oak Ridge Boys brothers. We all lost a special person today.\"\n\nBonsall is survived by his wife, Mary Ann; daughters Jennifer and Sabrina; sister, Nancy, and two grandchildren.", "source": {"uri": "nydailynews.com",

He was 76 years old and passed away in Hendersonville, Tennessee. Earlier this year, Bonsall had announced his retirement from touring.\n\nThe Oak Ridge Boys, consisting of Bonsall along with Duane Allen, William Lee Golden, and Richard Sterban, initially gained fame as a gospel group. They transitioned to country music in 1977 with their hit \"Y'All Come Back Saloon,\" marking the beginning of a successful career that included 34 top 10 hits on Billboard's Top Country Songs chart.\n\nIn addition to Grammys, The Oak Ridge Boys received accolades from the Country Music Association (CMA) and the Academy of Country Music (ACM). They won CMA's Vocal Group of the Year in 1978 and Single of the Year in 1981 for \"Elvira,\" and secured four ACM Awards, including Top Vocal Group, Album of the Year for \"Ya'll Come Back Saloon\" in 1978, and Single Record of the Year for \"Elvira\" in 1981. Their enduring impact on music was further recognized with the Cliffie Stone Pioneer Award in 2007.\n\nThe Oak Ridge Boys achieved significant milestones in their career, including 17 chart-topping hits on Billboard's country chart, making them the third-highest among groups and duos, trailing only Alabama (33) and Brooks & Dunn (20). Their crossover success was notable with two songs, \"Elvira\" reaching No. 5 in 1981 and \"Bobbie Sue\" at No. 12 in 1982 on the Billboard Hot 100.\n\nREAD MORE: The Morning Show' Season 4: Jennifer Aniston Posts BTS Pic With Reese Witherspoon\n\nThey also secured three No. 1 albums on the Top Country Albums chart, with \"Fancy Free\" peaking at No. 14 in 1981 and \"Bobbie Sue\" at No. 20 in 1982 on the all-genre Billboard 200. Their musical prowess earned them five Grammy Awards, initially in gospel categories and later in country for \"Elvira,\" recognized as the best country performance by a duo or group.\n\nJoe Bonsall, a member of The Oak Ridge Boys for over 50 years, was honored with inductions into prestigious halls of fame, including the Grand Ole Opry, the Philadelphia Music Hall of Fame, the Gospel Music Hall of Fame, the Vocal Group Hall of Fame, and the Country Music Hall of Fame in 2015. His contributions to music, spanning across genres and decades, solidified The Oak Ridge Boys' place as icons in American music history.\n\n\"For 50 years, Joe Bonsall was the Oak Ridge Boys' sparkplug,\" Kyle Young, CEO of the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum, said in a statement. \"He was as exciting a performer as any who ever hit a gospel or country stage. His tenor voice was high and clear, and his jovial spirit always provided a jolt of energy, immediately rousing audiences to come on in and take a load off. He certainly lightened our cares every time he sang.\"\n\n\"When I think of the Oak Ridge Boys and their place in country music history, the image of Joe with his huge smile and boundless energy comes to mind so clearly,\" Sarah Trahern, Country Music Association CEO, said in a statement. \"His commitment to serving others while developing country music into a worldwide sensation will never be forgotten and our industry has been made better because of him. Today, we lost an incomparable energy and voice in music. He will be missed greatly by all who were fortunate to know him.\"\n\nJoe Bonsall, in addition to his musical achievements, authored 11 books, including his upcoming memoir titled \"I See Myself,\" scheduled for release in November. Per Bonsall's wishes, there will be no funeral arrangements. Instead of flowers, contributions can be made to The ALS Association or to the Vanderbilt Medical Center ALS and Neuroscience Research Center.\n\nSurvivors include his wife, Mary Ann; daughters Jennifer and Sabrina; granddaughter Breanne; grandson Luke; great-grandsons Chance and Grey; and his sister, Nancy. He is preceded in death by his parents, Joseph S. Bonsall Sr. and Lillie Bonsall. Bonsall's passing occurred just eight days following the death of William \"Rusty\" Golden, a musician, songwriter, and son of The Oak Ridge Boys' member William Lee Golden.

He was 76, and died in Hendersonville, Tenn. Bonsall had announced his retirement from touring at the beginning of the year.\n\nIn 1973, Bonsall left his position with gospel group The Keystones to join The Oak Ridge Boys. The Oaks, in which Bonsall teamed with Duane Allen, William Lee Golden and Richard Sterban, first found success as a gospel group. They segued into country music in 1977 with \"Y'All Come Back Saloon,\" their first of 34 top 10 hits on Billboard's Top Country Songs chart.\n\nThe Oaks landed 17 No. 1 hits on that chart, the third-highest total among duos and groups after Alabama (33) and Brooks & Dunn (20). Two of the Oaks' country chart-toppers became top 20 hits on the Billboard Hot 100 - \"Elvira\" (No. 5 in 1981) and \"Bobbie Sue\" (No. 12 in 1982).\n\nThe group landed three No. 1 albums on Billboard's Top Country Albums chart, two of which became top 20 albums on the all-genre Billboard 200 - Fancy Free (No. 14 in 1981) and Bobbie Sue (No. 20 in 1982).\n\nThe Oaks won five Grammys. The first four were in gospel categories; the fifth in country, for \"Elvira.\" That platinum-selling smash won best country performance by a duo or group with vocal.\n\nThe Oaks won two CMA awards - vocal group of the year in 1978 and single of the year in 1981 for \"Elvira.\"\n\nThey won four ACM Awards - top vocal group in 1978, album of the year that same year for Ya'll Come Back Saloon, single record of the year in 1981 for \"Elvira\" and the Cliffie Stone Pioneer Award in 2007.\n\nAs a 50-year member of the The Oak Ridge Boys, Bonsall was a member of the Grand Ole Opry and was inducted into the Philadelphia Music Hall of Fame, the Gospel Music Hall of Fame, the Vocal Group Hall of Fame, and the Country Music Hall of Fame, the latter in 2015.\n\n\"For 50 years, Joe Bonsall was the Oak Ridge Boys' sparkplug,\" Kyle Young, CEO of the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum, said in a statement. \"He was as exciting a performer as any who ever hit a gospel or country stage. His tenor voice was high and clear, and his jovial spirit always provided a jolt of energy, immediately rousing audiences to come on in and take a load off. He certainly lightened our cares every time he sang.\"\n\n\"When I think of the Oak Ridge Boys and their place in country music history, the image of Joe with his huge smile and boundless energy comes to mind so clearly,\" Sarah Trahern, Country Music Association CEO, said in a statement. \"His commitment to serving others while developing country music into a worldwide sensation will never be forgotten and our industry has been made better because of him. Today, we lost an incomparable energy and voice in music. He will be missed greatly by all who were fortunate to know him.\"\n\nBonsall was also the author of 11 books including his latest, a memoir entitled I See Myself, which is set for release in November.\n\nBonsall's final show with the Oaks was on Dec. 17, 2023. In January, he revealed that he had battled the slow onset of a neuromuscular disorder for more than four years. \"I am now at a point where walking is impossible, so I have basically retired from the road. It has just gotten too difficult,\" he said in a statement. \"It has been a great 50 years, and I am thankful to all the Oak Ridge Boys band crew and staff for the constant love and support shown to me through it all. I will never forget, and for those of you who have been constantly holding me up in prayer, I thank you and ask for you to keep on praying.\"\n\nAt Bonsall's request, there will be no funeral. In lieu of flowers, donations may be made to The ALS Association or to the Vanderbilt Medical Center ALS and Neuroscience Research Center.\n\nSurvivors include his wife, Mary Ann; daughters Jennifer and Sabrina; granddaughter Breanne; grandson Luke; two great grandsons, Chance and Grey; and a sister, Nancy. He is preceded in death by his parents, Joseph S. Bonsall Sr. and Lillie Bonsall.\n\nBonsall's death comes just eight days after the death of William \"Rusty\" Golden, a musician, songwriter and son of The Oak Ridge Boys member William Lee Golden. The younger Golden died on July 1 at his home in Hendersonville, Tenn. He was 65. William Lee Golden said in a statement at that time, \"This is the hardest thing ever for a father to have to face. I love family more than anything. Rusty was a great musician, a talented songwriter and a wonderful son. We appreciate your thoughts and prayers for the days ahead. I love you, son.\"", "source": {"uri": "billboard.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Billboard"}, "authors": [{"uri": "paul_grein@billboard.com", "name": "Paul Grein", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elvira_(song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Elvira (song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Bonsall", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Bonsall"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Oak_Ridge_Boys", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Oak Ridge Boys"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gospel_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gospel music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_chart", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Record chart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bobbie_Sue_(song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bobbie Sue (song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tenor", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tenor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billboard_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Billboard (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Country music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top_Country_Albums", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Top Country Albums"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BTS", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "BTS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duane_Allen", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Duane Allen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Sterban", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Richard Sterban"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammy_Museum_at_L.A._Live", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Grammy Museum at L.A.

(WSMV) - Born in Philadelphia in the late 1940s, Joe Bonsall always had a love for music.\n\nHis personal affection for gospel and his ability to sing garnered him a spot in his first group, the Keystones. In 1973, he'd leave the Philly-based Gospel group to join the Oak Ridge Boys.\n\n\"Right after he joined is when they really became nationally known and became country music stars,\" Michael McCall said.\n\nBonsall's unmistakable tenor voice joined a powerhouse musical group and remained there for the rest of his life.\n\nBonsall saw the group through its golden years, with chart-topping singles like 'Elvira' in 1981, 'Bobbie Sue' in 1982, and 'American Made' in 1983.\n\n\"It was a real presentation going on there with a lot of energy, and like I said, I think Joe was the most energetic,\" McCall said.\n\nDuring his five decades with the group, Bonsall was a well-known member of the Grand Ole Opry. The group was inducted into the Gospel Hall of Fame in 2000, and just 15 years later, etched their names in history at the Country Music Hall of Fame.\n\n\"It's an incredible thing for us,\" Bonsall said at the time. \"It represents a lot of songs and a lot of miles and a lot of stuff together, and to have this happen to us, man it's gigantic, it's huge.\"\n\nBonsall's health declined in the years to follow. His known battle with Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) started in 2020.\n\n\"He was a very active man, and he always said I'm going to stay active, I'm going to stay active,\" McCall said of Bonsall.\n\nThe longtime singer did just that for as long as he could, up until the group's Farewell Tour this past year.\n\nIn January, the singer shared he could no longer walk and was retiring from the tour.\n\nThe band shared the following obituary on their website on Tuesday:\n\n\"Joseph S. Bonsall (76) of Hendersonville, Tennessee passed on to Glory on July 9, 2024, from complications of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis. He leaves behind his precious wife, Mary Ann, daughters Jennifer and Sabrina, granddaughter Breanne, grandson Luke, two great-grandsons, Chance and Grey, and a sister, Nancy. He is preceded in death by his parents Joseph S. Bonsall Sr. and Lillie Bonsall.\n\nAs a 50-year member of the American music group The Oak Ridge Boys, Joe was a member of the Grand Ole Opry and inducted into the Philadelphia Music Hall of Fame, the Gospel Music Hall of Fame, the Vocal Group Hall of Fame, and the prestigious Country Music Hall of Fame.\n\nJoseph is also the author of 11 books including his latest, a memoir entitled I See Myself, which releases in November.

\"Elvira,\" \"Bobbie Sue,\" and \"American Made.\"\n\nThe lineup at the time also consisted of lead vocalist Duane Allen, baritone William Lee Golden and bass singer Richard Sterban.\n\nAfter making the jump from gospel music to country, The Oak Ridge Boys landed a hit in 1977 with \"Y'All Come Back Saloon,\" their first of 34 top 10 hits on Billboard's Top Country Songs chart.\n\nThe Oaks landed 17 No. 1 hits on that chart, the third-highest total among duos and groups after Alabama (33) and Brooks & Dunn (20), according to Billboard.\n\nThe group also landed three No. 1 albums on Billboard's Top Country Albums chart, two of which became top 20 albums on the all-genre Billboard 200 -- \"Fancy Free\" (No. 14 in 1981) and \"Bobbie Sue\" (No. 20 in 1982), the outlet reported.\n\nThe Oaks have

I will never forget, and for those of you who have been constantly holding me up in prayer,\" stated Bonsall in January to The Nashville Tennessean, part of the USA TODAY Network.\n\nThe Philadelphia native had already been replaced on the road by bluegrass and gospel performer Ben James alongside Duane Allen, William Lee Golden and Richard Sterban. In November 2022, James appeared with the quartet who, while performing on the same billing as Dailey & Vincent, brought him onstage to perform their 40-year-old crossover smash \"Elvira.\"\n\n\"Joe handed me the mic and said, 'You've got the next verse. And I'm not sure I will ever get over that moment. 'Elvira' was always on repeat when I was growing up. It's still one of those timeless songs that never grow old,\" offered James in a press statement.\n\nJoe Bonsall health issues with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis caused retirement\n\nBonsall retired from performing on the road with the group after 50 years six months ago, citing the half-decade onset of his ALS diagnosis.\n\nIn a December feature, Bonsall described a career as an Oak Ridge Boy member that saw him play over 10,000 concerts in amphitheaters, arenas, stadiums and theaters worldwide as bearing witness to an \"amazing phenomenon\" that \"took on a life of its own\" and \"marks so many unique spaces, stories and times.\"\n\nHe added that the group \"represented the place to be for five decades. Four guys who looked like they shouldn't even know each other have blended harmonies and had a celebrated career.\"\n\nHow Joe Bonsall embraced being one of The Oak Ridge Boys members\n\nBonsall became an Oak Ridge Boy in October 1973, the 30th of 35 total performers to perform in the group since its 1947 inception.\n\nFor 35 years, The Oak Ridge Boys achieved excellence as a Southern gospel quartet with soulful leanings. However, by the mid-1970s, the group evolved its image in a cosmopolitan direction. Clad in suits from Hollywood fashion designer Harvey Krantz, they began emphasizing \"entertainment\" over preaching to create a mainstream pop-ready, GQ-style country act.\n\nThat spurred a run of 14 Top 10 Billboard Country chart singles, began with 1977's \"Y'all Come Back Saloon\" and included songs like \"Elvira\" and \"American Made\" among many hits.\n\nThat success was marked by moments like 1978's NBC-broadcasted \"World's Largest Indoor Country Music Show,\" where the Oak Ridge Boys appeared at Detroit's Pontiac Silverdome alongside Kenny Rogers, Minnie Pearl, Dottie West and numerous others.\n\n\"We're out there in front of a national audience and 60,000 people running all over the stage singing country music and then we put that big gospel ending on it. It was a feeling like nothing else I'd felt to that point,\" Bonsall recalled to The Tennessean.\n\nJoe Bonsall's other notable career interests\n\nOver the past three decades, the vocalist was also the author of 11 books, including \"The Molly Books,\" a four-part children's book series, 2003's \"GI Joe and Lillie,\" about his parents' lives during and after World War II, plus his forthcoming memoir, \"I See Myself,\" which is still scheduled for a Nov. 13, 2024 release.\n\nAbout his memoir, a press statement notes the following:\n\n\"In 'I See Myself,' Joe Bonsall reflects on his life's contrasts and crossroads. From growing up in the inner city of Philadelphia to sitting on the front porch of his log home in rural Tennessee. From hanging with a street gang in his teens to surrendering to Christ at a youth camp. From working as a short order cook to headlining sold-out arenas. And now -- from running across the stage each night to being sidelined by a neuromuscular disorder that has stolen his mobility. However, despite the changing circumstances of Joe's life, two things have not changed. His unwavering faith in God. And his ability to inspire others.\"\n\nBonsall's memoir is currently available for pre-order via Amazon.\n\nAt Bonsall's request, there will be no funeral. Instead of flowers, donations may be made to The ALS Association or the Vanderbilt Medical Center ALS and Neuroscience Research Center.", "source": {"uri": "usatoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

He was 76 years old.\n\nHis death was announced in a statement from the band's publicity team. Bonsall announced his retirement from touring back in January due to the progression of his illness.\n\nBorn on May 18, 1948, in Philadelphia, Penn., Bonsall spent five decades as an Oak Ridge Boys member, singing on hits such as \"Elvira,\" \"Bobbie Sue\" and \"American Made.\" As part of his work with the group, he was a member of the Grand Ole Opry, the Philadelphia Music Hall of Fame, the Gospel Music Hall of Fame and the Vocal Group Hall of Fame. In 2015, he and his bandmates were inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame.\n\nIn addition to his work in music, Bonsall was the author of 11 books, including a memoir called I See Myself that is slated for release in November.\n\nBeginning last September, Bonsall toured with the Oaks for their American Made: Farewell Tour. However, in January, he announced his decision to retire, explaining that his neuromuscular disorder had made walking impossible. He was replaced by a 27-year-old singer named Ben James.\n\nBonsall was open about his health struggles in his latter years. He had a brush with death in 2022 after doctors found pulmonary embolisms, requiring a six-day hospital stay. \"I could have easily died last weekend but God is not through with me yet,\" he told fans in a tweet following that experience.\n\nRelated: Country Stars Living With Serious Health Conditions\n\nThe Oak Ridge Boys have been affected by multiple tragedies this year. Bonsall's death comes just one week after singer William Lee Golden announced the death of his son, William \"Rusty\" Golden, who died at age 65 at his Nashville-area home.\n\nBonsall is survived by his wife Mary Ann, daughters Jennifer and Sabrina and multiple grandchildren and great-grandchildren. His family is requesting privacy as they grieve his loss.\n\nAt the singer's request, there will be no funeral service. In lieu of flowers, fans wishing to express their sympathies can make donations to The ALS Association or to the Vanderbilt Medical Center ALS and Neuroscience Research Center.", "source": {"uri": "975kgkl.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KGKL 97.5 FM Country"}, "authors": [{"uri": "carena_liptak@975kgkl.com", "name": "Carena Liptak", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Oak_Ridge_Boys", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Oak Ridge Boys"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonsall,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bonsall, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bonsall, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ALS", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "ALS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Made_(song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American Made (song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bobbie_Sue_(song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bobbie Sue (song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elvira_(song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Elvira (song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Bonsall", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Bonsall"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tenor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tenor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_chart", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Record chart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vocal_Group_Hall_of_Fame", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vocal Group Hall of Fame"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Lee_Golden", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "William Lee Golden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gospel_Music_Hall_of_Fame", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gospel Music Hall of Fame"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country_Music_Hall_of_Fame_and_Museum", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Ole_Opry", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Grand Ole Opry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_Football_Hall_of_Fame", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pro Football Hall of Fame"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanderbilt_University_Medical_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vanderbilt University Medical Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ALS_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ALS Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_embolism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pulmonary embolism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "God"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Country music"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Mental_Health/Grief,_Loss_and_Bereavement", "label": "dmoz/Health/Mental Health/Grief, Loss and Bereavement", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://townsquare.media/site/204/files/2024/07/attachment-JoeBonsall2.jpg?w=1200&q=75&format=natural", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9718643", "eventUri": "eng-9718643", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-09", "textStart": 88, "textEnd": 94}, {"amb": false, "date": "2018-05-", "textStart": 358, "textEnd": 364}], "sentiment": -0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 201, "relevance": 1}

The announcement was made on July 9 by representatives of the artist and the group.\n\nSix months ago, citing the half-decade onset of the previously-mentioned disorder, Bonsall retired from performing on the road with the group after 50 years.\n\nNotably, alongside his Country Music Hall of Fame and Grand Ole Opry membership, Bonsall was an inductee of the Philadelphia Music Hall of Fame and Gospel Music Hall of Fame.\n\n\"It has been a great 50 years and I am thankful to all the Oak Ridge Boys, band, crew and staff for the constant love and support shown to me through it all. I will never forget, and for those of you who have been constantly holding me up in prayer,\" stated Bonsall in January to The Tennessean.\n\nThe Philadelphia native had already been replaced on the road by bluegrass and gospel performer Ben James alongside Duane Allen, William Lee Golden and Richard Sterban. In November 2022, James appeared with the quartet who, while performing on the same billing as Dailey & Vincent, brought him onstage to perform their 40-year-old crossover smash \"Elvira.\"\n\n\"Joe handed me the mic and said, 'You've got the next verse. And I'm not sure I will ever get over that moment. 'Elvira' was always on repeat when I was growing up. It's still one of those timeless songs that never grow old,\" offered James in a press statement.\n\nIn a Dec. 2023 feature, Bonsall described a career as an Oak Ridge Boy member that saw him play over 10,000 concerts in amphitheaters, arenas, stadiums and theaters worldwide as bearing witness to an \"amazing phenomenon\" that \"took on a life of its own\" and \"marks so many unique spaces, stories and times.\"\n\nHe added that the group \"represented the place to be for five decades. Four guys who looked like they shouldn't even know each other have blended harmonies and had a celebrated career.\"\n\nBonsall became an Oak Ridge Boy in Oct. 1973, the 30th of 35 total performers to perform in the group since its 1947 inception.\n\nFor 35 years, The Oak Ridge Boys achieved excellence as a Southern gospel quartet with soulful leanings. However, by the mid-1970s, the group evolved its image in a cosmopolitan direction. Clad in suits from Hollywood fashion designer Harvey Krantz, they began emphasizing \"entertainment\" over preaching to create a mainstream pop-ready, GQ-style country act.\n\nThat spurred a run of 14 Top 10 Billboard Country chart singles, began with 1977's \"Y'all Come Back Saloon\" and included songs like \"Elvira\" and \"American Made\" among many hits.\n\nThat success was marked by moments like 1978's NBC-broadcasted \"World's Largest Indoor Country Music Show,\" where the Oak Ridge Boys appeared at Detroit's Pontiac Silverdome alongside Kenny Rogers, Minnie Pearl, Dottie West and numerous others.\n\n\"We're out there in front of a national audience and 60,000 people running all over the stage singing country music and then we put that big gospel ending on it. It was a feeling like nothing else I'd felt to that point,\" Bonsall recalled to The Tennessean.\n\nOver the past three decades, the vocalist was also the author of 11 books, including \"The Molly Books,\" a four-part children's book series, 2003's \"GI Joe and Lillie,\" about his parents' lives during and after World War II, plus his forthcoming memoir, \"I See Myself,\" which is still scheduled for a Nov. 13, 2024 release.\n\nAbout his memoir, a press statement notes the following:\n\n\"In 'I See Myself,' Joe Bonsall reflects on his life's contrasts and crossroads. From growing up in the inner city of Philadelphia to sitting on the front porch of his log home in rural Tennessee. From hanging with a street gang in his teens to surrendering to Christ at a youth camp. From working as a short order cook to headlining sold-out arenas. And now -- from running across the stage each night to being sidelined by a neuromuscular disorder that has stolen his mobility. However, despite the changing circumstances of Joe's life, two things have not changed. His unwavering faith in God. And his ability to inspire others.\"\n\nBonsall's memoir is currently available for pre-order via Amazon.\n\nAt Bonsall's request, there will be no funeral. Instead of flowers, donations may be made to The ALS Association or the Vanderbilt Medical Center ALS and Neuroscience Research Center.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

But because they were often asked to sing for service members and their families at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory, the group changed their name to the Oak Ridge Quartet before becoming the Oak Ridge Boys in 1961.\n\nThe current lineup of the Oaks was completed in 1973, and for the last 50 years has featured lead singer Duane Allen, tenor Joe Bonsall, baritone William Lee Golden (and his iconic beard), and bass Richard Sterban.\n\nOver the past 50 years The Oak Ridge Boys have become icons of country music with hits like \"American Made,\" \"Bobbie Sue,\" \"Leaving Louisiana In The Broad Daylight,\" \"Fancy Free,\" and of course their biggest hit, \"Elvira.\" And they've also become well known for the mark they've left on the gospel world, having even performed \"Amazing Grace\" at the funeral of President George H.W. Bush back in 2018.\n\nBut Bonsall announced back in January that he would be stepping away from touring due to a neuromuscular disorder that has left him unable to walk.\n\nBonsall said at the time:\n\n\"Many of you know I have been battling a slow onset (over four years now) of a neuromuscular disorder. I am now at a point where walking is impossible, so I have basically retired from the road. It has just gotten too difficult.\n\nIt has been a great 50 years, and I am thankful to all the Oak Ridge Boys, band, crew, and staff for the constant love and support shown to me through it all. I will never forget, and for those of you who have been constantly holding me up in prayer, I thank you and ask for you to keep on praying.\n\nThere is a young man named Ben James singing for me out there, and he needs your love and encouragement ... his sound is different than mine, but he brings a ton of talent to the table!\n\nThe Oak Ridge Boys will finish the Farewell Tour without me, but rest assured, I am good with all of it! God's Got It!!!\"\n\nIn many ways the face of the group, Bonsall was well known for interacting with fans on Twitter and showing off his beloved cat, Barney. And one of the coolest moments of my career came last year when I had the opportunity to sit down and talk to the legendary Oak Ridge Boys, including Bonsall. It was like sitting down with royalty - and they were just as nice in person as you would expect them to be.\n\nBonsall is survived by his wife, Mary Ann, daughters Jennifer and Sabrina, granddaughter Breanne, grandson Luke, two great grandsons, Chance and Grey, and a sister, Nancy.

Both Golden and Bonsall were residents of Hendersonville, Tennessee.\n\nBonsall joined the popular country and gospel singing group the Oak Ridge Boys in 1973, and his tenor vocals and high harmonies quickly became an integral part of the group's sound on on such hits as \"Elvira\" and \"Bobbie Sue.\"\n\nThe Oak Ridge Boys, which has sold more than 41 million records, won five Grammys and was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame in 2015.

But Jesus and his family always came first -- and we will see him again on the Promised Day.\"\n\nBorn May 18, 1948, Bonsall said at the time of his retirement in January, \"Many of you know I have been battling a slow onset (over four years now) of a neuromuscular disorder.

I've NEVER seen Joe when he wasn't smiling and completely full of life,\" Shelton, 48, wrote alongside a photo performing with the band.\n\nHe continued, \"He absolutely loved singing like no one I ever met. My thoughts and prayers are with his family and his @theoakridgeboys brothers. We all lost a special person today.\"\n\nIn 2016, Shelton collaborated with the Southern gospel group on his song \"Doing It to Country Songs.\"\n\nBonsall died from complications of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), according to a press release shared with PEOPLE.\n\nPer his request, a funeral will not be held for him but he encouraged donations be made to The ALS Association or to the Vanderbilt Medical Center ALS and Neuroscience Research Center.\n\nThe tenor singer announced his retirement from touring in January. At the time, he told PEOPLE he was prioritizing his health -- though he kept his exact diagnosis private.\n\n\"Many of you know I have been battling a slow onset (over four years now) of a neuromuscular disorder. I am now to a point that walking is impossible so I have basically retired from the road,\" he said. \"It has just gotten too difficult. It has been a great 50 years and I am thankful to all the Oak Ridge Boys band crew and staff for the constant love and support shown to me through it all.\"\n\nThe musician added, \"I will never forget and for those of you who have been constantly holding me up in prayer I thank you and ask for you to keep on praying.\"\n\nBonsall -- who is survived by his wife, Mary Ann, daughters Jennifer and Sabrina, granddaughter Breanne, grandson Luke, two great-grandsons, Chance and Grey and a sister, Nancy -- was a member of the Oak Ridge Boys for over 50 years before his death.\n\nWith the group, which he joined in 1973, Bonsall landed in the prestigious Grand Ole Opry, the Vocal Group Hall of Fame, the Gospel Music Hall of Fame and the Country Music Hall of Fame. He was also inducted into the Philadelphia Music Hall of Fame back in 1994.\n\nIn addition to his music, Bonsall was a published author. He wrote 11 books, including a memoir titled I See Myself, which will be released in November.\n\nIn September the band announced a celebratory farewell tour to commemorate their 50th anniversary.\n\n\"We are doing a farewell tour because we owe it to our fans to say goodbye,\" William Lee Golden said in a press release. \"They have always been there for us through the good times and the bad. I will always be thankful to every person who came out to a show, bought a T-shirt, played our music, and overall, loved us enough to spend their hard-earned money whenever they could.

His arrival marked a pivotal moment in the band's trajectory, coinciding with their transition from gospel roots to mainstream success. As a key songwriter and arranger, Bonsall played a crucial role in shaping their signature hits, infusing their music with heartfelt emotion and infectious energy that resonated with audiences worldwide.\n\nEmerging in the early 1960s as a gospel quartet, the group underwent several transformations before solidifying their lineup in the 1970s with Bonsall, Duane Allen, William Lee Golden, and Richard Sterban. Their signature four-part harmonies became synonymous with hits like \"Elvira,\" which topped the charts and earned them crossover success.\n\nBeyond his musical achievements, Joseph was a prolific author, penning 11 books, including his upcoming memoir, \"I See Myself,\" set for release in November. His passions were as diverse as his talents: from banjo picking to farming, and his unwavering devotion to the Philadelphia Phillies.\n\nHe is survived by his beloved wife Mary Ann, daughters Jennifer and Sabrina, granddaughter Breanne, grandson Luke, two great grandsons, Chance and Grey, and sister Nancy.\n\nIn accordance with his wishes, there will be no funeral service.

Allen hugged him, but Bonsall seemed to freeze.\n\n\"I want to let something process for a moment,\" Bonsall said. \"He just said we are the newest members of the Grand Ole Opry. This is a brotherhood and a sisterhood that is unlike any other. We have been around a long time. We have been friends of the Grand Ole Opry for a long time. It's going to take a little while to process. We're about to single 'Elvira' here. So give us a moment. We've been a friend of the Opry for a long time. I've got to admit to you folks, with changing times and all the great young folks in this business who are holding country music high, we've not been singing to you for years.\n\nWe've been singing to you for decades. I kind of thought that Opry thing wasn't going to happen. Thank you.\"\n\nBecoming Members of the Country Music Hall of Fame\n\nIn 2015, Brenda Lee revealed The Oak Ridge Boys would be the next members of the Country Music Hall of Fame. The band's members - Bonsall, Duane Allen, William Lee Golden and Richard Sturban - lined up behind Brenda Lee as she hosted the press conference announcing them as inductees. When the event was over, Bonsall, always vibrant with an undeniable excitement and zest for life, bent his knees to accommodate Lee's 4'9'' height, opened his arms wide, and she rushed into his embrace for a congratulatory hug.\n\n\"Our children's children's children's children can see that,\" Bonsall said of the group's commemorative marker that hangs in the Country Music Hall of Fame. \"Even when we are gone, we'll still be here.\"\n\nThe night they were inducted into The Country Music Hall of Fame, Garth Brooks and Trisha Yearwood, Jeff Hanna, and Allen's daughter and her family band Rockland Road sang their hits back to them.\n\n\"This was high school for me,\" Brooks said of the Oak Ridge Boys' music. \"'Y'all Come Back Saloon,' that's that whole record that changed everything. They're also the group that did 'Callin' Baton Rouge' first. It all goes back.\n\n\"'I'll Be True to You' was not a duet,\" Yearwood added. \"But everything the Oak Ridge Boys did was four-part harmony, so it was easy to figure out and make it into a duet.\"\n\nCountry Music Hall of Famer Kenny Rogers inducted the band in the modern era artist category.\n\n\"In a lifetime and in a career of incredible things, this is the most incredible thing that's ever happened to the Oak Ridge Boys,\" Bonsall said. \"We run our group as a family, trying to be honest, like our parents taught us. Treat people right. I really think that's why we're here today.\"\n\nThe Oak Ridge Boys Team With Blake Shelton\n\nIn 2016, The Oak Ridge Boys teamed with Blake Shelton for his cut \"Doing It to Country Songs\" from his \"If I'm Honest\" album. At CMA Fest, Shelton took the Oaks everywhere, making sure to expose them to a new generation of country music fans. That week in June, The Oaks went with Shelton to his exhibit opening at The Country Music Hall of Fame and played with him stage with him at the CMT Awards.\n\n\"I tell you, it's going to be epic,\" Bonsall said at the time. \"It's going to be really cool. We're actually stripping,\" he joked.\n\nThen, the band surprised fans at Nissan Stadium when they joined him to sing \"Doing It to Country Songs.\"\n\n\"Only in Nashville, Tenn., do you get something like that, man,\" Shelton told fans. \"That cost me a lot of money. You're welcome. They're very expensive. I have to take a moment now and soak that in. That just happened. Moment of silence, everybody, please, for The Oak Ridge Boys.\"\n\nKept Promise To Sing at George H. W. Bush's Funeral\n\nBefore he died, George H. W. Bush wrote that he wanted the Oak Ridge Boys to sing \"Amazing Grace\" at his funeral. To ensure they could keep that promise, the Oaks spent months traveling with suits and ties so if they got the call that Bush had passed, they could hop on a plane and show up in time.\n\nIt turned out they needed them. Following a show in Spokane, Wash., in 2018, the men boarded an overnight flight with suits in hand to fly to Houston to perform at his funeral.\n\n\"Cheers To You\" Joe Bonsall and The Oak Ridge Boys\n\nIt was the end of June 2020 when up-and-coming country group Essex County was fighting against the pandemic to be seen and heard when, like the rest of the music industry, they'd lost the opportunity to play live. The men, a U.K. brother trio, and their manager devised a plan to release an EP, record videos for the songs and then release the videos on CMT. The project would make them the first act to release a video EP on the network, and the network agreed to play each video in rotation.\n\nThe concept for the trio's \"Cheers To You\" music video was that the group would ask other country music acts to make cameos in the clip or submit videos of themselves toasting with cocktails. The Oak Ridge Boys - already Grand Ole Opry members and Country Music Hall of Famers - agreed to appear in the music video.\n\nEssex County met The Oak Ridge Boys in Hendersonville, Tennessee, where they filmed a television appearance and spent an afternoon filming video footage together. Bonsall and the rest of the Oaks, learned lines to the song and played along with the afternoon of hijinx, even toasting with flower vases when they had nothing else to use.\n\n\"We were so privileged to have made a music video with American legends, The Oak Ridge Boys,\" singer Nate Bass said. \"They were amazing and so kind to us newbies. Joe told us to stay together and keep pushing, and something like the music industry was tough, and we had to be tougher. Thank you, Joe.\"\n\nThe Oak Ridge Boys Join Alabama To Play June Jam, the First Since 1997\n\nCountry Music Hall of Famers Alabama are still touring, and in recent years, they reached out to The Oak Ridge Boys to tour with them. That ask extended to June Jam in 2023, the first time Alabama had hosted its iconic festival since 1997. The Oak Ridge Boys wouldn't miss it.\n\nBonsall's health was failing. He had to be helped to the stage and played the show perched on a stool.\n\nDressed in a bright green button-up shirt, jeans, and sneakers, Bonsall anchored his side of the stage, tapping his foot, clapping his nads over his head, and leading the fans with every ounce of energy he gave when he was still able to play standing up.\n\nMore than 11,000 people danced and sang along to \"American Made,\" \"Elvira\" and more. Other than the fact he was seated, Bonsall looked healthy. No one knew it could be the last time they would see him on stage.\n\n(Photo by Jason Kempin/Getty Images)", "source": {"uri": "americansongwriter.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "American Songwriter"}, "authors": [{"uri": "cindy_watts@americansongwriter.com", "name": "Cindy Watts", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Bonsall", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Bonsall"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Jimmy_Dickens", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Little Jimmy Dickens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Oak_Ridge_Boys", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Oak Ridge Boys"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country_Music_Hall_of_Fame_and_Museum", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Ole_Opry", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Grand Ole Opry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blake_Shelton", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Blake Shelton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Country music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I'll_Be_True_to_You", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "I'll Be True to You"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elvira_(song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Elvira (song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Lee_Golden", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "William Lee Golden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duane_Allen", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Duane Allen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brenda_Lee", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Brenda Lee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_chart", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Record chart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thank_God_for_Kids", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Thank God for Kids"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bobbie_Sue_(song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bobbie Sue (song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garth_Brooks", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Garth Brooks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Songwriter", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American Songwriter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trisha_Yearwood", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Trisha Yearwood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duet", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Duet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tenor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tenor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Made_(song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "American Made (song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Callin'_Baton_Rouge", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Callin' Baton Rouge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenny_Rogers", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kenny Rogers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CMT_Music_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "CMT Music Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hot_Country_Songs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hot Country Songs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CMA_Music_Festival", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "CMA Music Festival"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_H._W._Bush", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "George H.

Bonsall retired from the Oak Ridge Boys as a touring member in January and was, in fact, replaced by a young singer named Ben James, who's been singing his old parts quite capably during the group's farewell tour.\n\nAny singer can be replaced, but what Joe Bonsall brought to the Oak Ridge Boys was so much more important than any singing part, song or onstage performance. The Country Music Hall of Fame -- which inducted Bonsall alongside the other Oaks in 2015 -- put it best, referring to Bonsall as the group's \"sparkplug\" in an online tribute.\n\nJoe Bonsall was the Oak Ridge Boys' biggest cheerleader, unabashed fan, PR guy and relentless promoter, all in one.\n\nI first interviewed Joe Bonsall in 2014 for ToC's partner site, The Boot, and the thing that struck me immediately was his obvious, unbridled and genuine passion and enthusiasm for the group he was in.\n\nRELATED: Country Stars Mourn the Loss of Oak Ridge Boys Singer Joe Bonsall\n\n\"Far from projecting the seen-it-all cynicism of many career musicians, Bonsall speaks as enthusiastically about the new project and his fellow band members as if this were his first album, and it's contagious,\" I wrote. \"It's not hard to imagine that if anyone ever tried to resist the Oak Ridge Boys in their career goals, the irrepressible singer would simply talk them into going along with whatever he wanted with his trademark mix of enthusiasm, charm and wit -- and they wouldn't even realize that it hadn't been their idea all along.\"\n\nIt was clear that Bonsall was not putting on a show when he talked about how the Oaks maintained their longevity:\n\nWell, we're all as different as night is from day. Each guy is an individual, each guy brings a different type of talent and energy to the table, I believe, and we all love each other and respect each other as friends. And as years have gone by, all of that's actually gotten easier. There's no weird egos here, no nothing. It's, 'Let's get on the bus and go sing.'\n\nSee, I've always believed -- and this could be a message to the kids singing today -- that the music business can be as easy or as hard as you wanna make it. I mean, how about this -- let's all get along, let's go get onstage, let's give it everything we've got, let's hug each other's necks and get back on the bus, get the check, shake hands and go to the next town. It can be that easy, you know.\n\nWhen I interviewed Bonsall again for a book project in 2015, he once again spoke of the band and his bandmates in the most glowing terms possible.\n\n\"I gotta tell you, I can't even remember a bad word amongst any of us for years,\" he said. \"And even if there is, it's the kind of thing where maybe you have a disagreement about something, and you get it right out there and you talk about it, talk it through and put it right out there on the table. You don't sit back and harbor anything. You always have to be open to the fact that your brother, your partner, may actually have a better idea than you.\"\n\nForty years into a career at that point, Bonsall turned humorous when asked if the group ever thought about how it would end.\n\n\"I think the end scares us a little bit. We never talk about it,\" he said. \"I think we've been able to plan every aspect of our career except how to end it, so I guess we'll just have to leave that with God.\n\n\"I think God will tell us when there's no more Oak Ridge Boys. It won't be us. We'll probably fall down out there singing somewhere, and then that'll be the end,\" he said with a laugh. \"It'll be settled for us, man. 'Where's Joe?' 'Uh . . . he ain't coming anymore,\" he added with another laugh. \"'God done said he's done.' So I guess that's pretty much how we look at it.\"\n\nTo the surprise of absolutely nobody, Bonsall did keep singing and performing until very nearly the end of his life, even performing seated at some shows in 2023 due to his advancing battle with ALS. And while the Oak Ridge Boys still have concerts on their calendar through December, those shows are bound to be bittersweet for a group that, according to Bonsall, never wanted to see it end.\n\n\"The great thing is that all four Oak Ridge Boys are forward-thinking guys. There's no slowing down in anybody,\" he told ToC. \"There's just no quit in these guys. It's always, 'What do we do next? How do we make things better tomorrow than they are today?' And that's the glory, because it only takes one guy ... I don't think anyone in this group wants to see this legacy end. All these decades, all these miles, all these songs, all this water under all these bridges -- who would want to be the guy to say, 'Let's end it'? Nobody. Not even close.\"", "source": {"uri": "tasteofcountry.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Taste of Country"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sterling_whitaker@tasteofcountry.com", "name": "Sterling Whitaker", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Bonsall", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Bonsall"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Oak_Ridge_Boys", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Oak Ridge Boys"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonsall,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bonsall, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bonsall, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Country music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country_Music_Hall_of_Fame_and_Museum", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Townsquare_Media", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Townsquare Media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheerleading", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cheerleading"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Promoter_(entertainment)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Promoter (entertainment)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_relations", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Public relations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trademark", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Trademark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "God"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 78}], "image": "https://townsquare.media/site/204/files/2024/07/attachment-joe-bonsall-oak-ridge-boys-legacy.jpg?w=1200&q=75&format=natural", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9718643", "eventUri": "eng-9718643", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-09", "textStart": 82, "textEnd": 88}], "sentiment": 0.2078431372549019, "wgt": 191, "relevance": 1}

He was a member of the Grand Ole Opry and inducted into the Philadelphia Music Hall of Fame, the Gospel Music Hall of Fame, the Vocal Group Hall of Fame, and the prestigious Country Music Hall of Fame.\n\n\"Many of you know I have been battling a slow onset (over 4 years now) of a neuromuscular disorder,\" the tenor wrote on X. \"I am now to a point that walking is impossible so I have basically retired from the road. It has just gotten too difficult.\"\n\n\"It has been a great 50 years and I am thankful to all the Oak Ridge Boys band crew and staff for the constant love and support shown to me through it all,\" he wrote. \"I will never forget and for those of you who have been constantly holding me up in prayer I thank you and ask for you to keep on praying,\" he added.\n\nThe band, originally founded in 1943 as The Oak Ridge Quartet, has had many members over the years. The foursome that saw the most success consisted of baritone William Lee Golden, tenor Bonsall, bass Richard Sterban and Duane Allen, the lead vocalist, during their heyday in the 70s and 80s.\n\nIn addition to music, Bonsall wrote 11 books, including his latest, a memoir titled, \"I See Myself\" set to be released in November.\n\nRELATED: FDA approves Eli Lilly's Alzheimer's drug that can modestly slow disease\n\nIn lieu of flowers, the band is asking for donations to be made to The ALS Association or to the Vanderbilt Medical Center ALS and Neuroscience Research Center.\n\nAccording to the Mayo Clinic, ALS or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is \"a nervous system disease that affects nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord.

It started when Joe Bonsall stepped down from the band due to health issues in January. After that, the floodgates of sorrow seemed to open on the band. Deaths of family members came in quick succession as the sun rose on spring. Most recently, Bonsall passed away earlier today (July 9).\n\nVideos by American Songwriter\n\nAfter announcing their farewell tour and receiving a Tennessee Music Pathways marker at the Grove Theater in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, the group ended 2023 on a high note. Unfortunately, that momentum didn't carry over into the new year. Below is a timeline of the hardships and tragedies the band has faced this year.\n\nJoe Bonsall Says Farewell to the Oak Ridge Boys\n\nJoy Bonsall joined the Oak Ridge Boys as a tenor singer in 1973. He was the face and public voice of the group for much of his five-decade tenure. Then, in January, he announced that his health forced him to walk away from the band.\n\n[RELATED: After 50 Years, Joe Bonsall Bids Farewell to The Oak Ridge Boys; Replacement Revealed]\n\nBonsall took to social media on January 3 to announce his departure from the group. \"Many of you know I have been battling the slow onset of a neuromuscular disorder,\" he wrote. \"I am now to a point where walking is impossible, so I have basically retired from the road. It has just gotten too difficult,\" he added. \"It has been a great 50 years and I am thankful to all the Oak Ridge Boys band, crew, and staff for the constant love and support shown to me through it all.\"\n\nAmyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis took Bonsall's ability to walk. The disorder would later take his life. However, it didn't take away his faith or his light. He thanked those who had held him up in prayer and asked that they continued to do so. Then, he named his replacement. \"There is a young man named Ben James singing for me out there and he needs your love and encouragement,\" he wrote in his statement. \"His sound is different than mine but he brings a ton of talent to the table,\" he added. He concluded the statement with \"God's Got It!\"\n\nDonnie Carr's Mother Passed in March\n\nBonsall's retirement was a hit to the band. However, it would pale in comparison to the next loss they took. In March, longtime guitarist Donnie Guitar Carr's mother, Phyllis Faye Carr, passed away at the age of 88. More than Carr's mother, she was a member of the group's extended family.\n\nThe Oak Ridge Boys took to social media to mark her passing on March 13. \"Our guitar player for a few decades Donnie Guitar Carr's mom has gone home to be with Jesus,\" they wrote. \"We all loved Mama Carr,\" they added.\n\nEaster Sunday Brings Two Deaths\n\nAs the sun rose on Easter Sunday (March 31), the Oak Ridge Boys lost two cherished members of their extended family. First, Norah Lee Allen, a member of the Grand Ole Opry and longtime wife of Duane Allen passed away after a long illness. The 76-year-old singer left this world at Vanderbilt Hospital surrounded by her family.\n\n[RELATED: Oak Ridge Boys Mourning Two Deaths in 24 Hours on Sad Easter Sunday]\n\nHours later, Richard Sterban's wife, Donna Sterban lost her father.\n\nFormer Oak Ridge Boy William Lee Golden Loses His Son\n\nOn July 2, former Oak Ridge Boys member William Lee Golden took to social media to announce the passing of his son, Rusty. At 65, the younger Golden had made a name for himself as a singer, songwriter, and musician. \"This is the hardest thing ever for a father to have to face. I love my family more than anything... We appreciate your thoughts and prayers for the days ahead. I love you, son,\" Golden shared in a statement.\n\nJoe Bonsall Passes Away\n\nJust days later, on July 9, longtime Oak Ridge Boys member, author, and philanthropist Joe Bonsall passed away. The disorder that led to him stepping away from the group in January continued to progress. He passed away surrounded by his loved ones at the age of 76.\n\nFeatured Image by Jason Kempin/Getty Images", "source": {"uri": "americansongwriter.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "American Songwriter"}, "authors": [{"uri": "clayton_edwards@americansongwriter.com", "name": "Clayton Edwards", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Bonsall", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Bonsall"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Oak_Ridge_Boys", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Oak Ridge Boys"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concert_tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Concert tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Songwriter", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American Songwriter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tenor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tenor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guitar", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Guitar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennessee", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tennessee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tennessee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oak_Ridge,_Tennessee", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oak Ridge, Tennessee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oak Ridge, Tennessee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Lee_Golden", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "William Lee Golden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easter", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Easter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Grand_Ole_Opry_members", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "List of Grand Ole Opry members"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duane_Allen", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Duane Allen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanderbilt_University_Medical_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vanderbilt University Medical Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Songwriter", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Songwriter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jesus"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Mental_Health/Grief,_Loss_and_Bereavement", "label": "dmoz/Health/Mental Health/Grief, Loss and Bereavement", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://americansongwriter.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/download-2024-07-09T134421.620.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9718643", "eventUri": "eng-9718643", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-09", "textStart": 345, "textEnd": 351, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "date": "-01-03", "textStart": 1115, "textEnd": 1124}, {"amb": false, "date": "-03-13", "textStart": 2496, "textEnd": 2504}, {"amb": false, "date": "-03-31", "textStart": 2719, "textEnd": 2727}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-02", "textStart": 3220, "textEnd": 3226}], "sentiment": -0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 189, "relevance": 1}

He was 76.\n\nBonsall was born in May 1948 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He died on Tuesday morning, per a statement shared on his website and by The Oak Ridge Boys. Bonsall is survived by his wife of more than four decades, Mary Ann, daughters Jennifer and Sabrina, granddaughter Breanne, grandson Luke, great grandsons Chance and Grey, and sister Nancy, the statement reads, adding that the family requests privacy at this time.\n\nSara Evans was one of many country artists and fans to pay tribute to Bonsall, writing on her Instagram story: \"So sad to hear of Joe Bonsall passing. My prayers today are for his family and loved ones. I love The Oak Ridge Boys music!\"\n\n\"I'm heartbroken to hear of my friend Joe Bonsalls passing,\" Blake Shelton wrote in a post on X, formerly Twitter. \"I've NEVER seen Joe when he wasn't smiling and completely full of life.

Rest in paradise, & tell a certain fiddle player we love and miss him.\"\n\n\"My heart is heavy this morning after hearing that my friend [Oak Ridge Boys] tenor [Joe Bonsall] has passed away at the age of 76,\" Travis Tritt wrote.

He saw the band through its golden period in the '80s and beyond, which included its signature 1981 song, \"Elvira,\" its 1982 hit \"Bobbie Sue\" and 1983's \"American Made.\" \"Elvira\" marked a massive crossover moment for the group, reaching No. 1 on the country chart and No. 5 on Billboard's all-genre Hot 100.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Most patients die within three to five years of a diagnosis. The illness became known as Lou Gehrig's disease after the star baseball player was diagnosed in 1939.\n\nIn September 2023, the Oak Ridge Boys embarked on a farewell tour that was scheduled to last into 2024. But in January, Bonsall announced his retirement from touring, saying it was too difficult for him physically after a four-year battle with ALS. Ben James, who has performed with Doyle Lawson and Dailey & Vincent, was announced as his replacement.\n\n\"I am now at a point where walking is impossible, so I have basically retired from the road. It has just gotten too difficult,\" Bonsall said at the time of his retirement. \"It has been a great 50 years, and I am thankful to all the Oak Ridge Boys, band, crew, and staff for the constant love and support shown to me through it all. I will never forget, and for those of you who have been constantly holding me up in prayer, I thank you and ask for you to keep on praying.\"\n\nIn June 2022, Bonsall shared on X, formerly Twitter, that he \"could have easily died\" after suffering pulmonary embolisms.\n\nHis memoir, \"I See Myself,\" will be released posthumously in November. It is his 11th book, a collection which includes the four-part children's series, \"The Molly Books.\"\n\nLove 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your

He sings it nightly performing with William Lee Golden, Duane Allen and Richard Sterban.\n\nBruce R. Miller Journal staff writer\n\nEditor's Note: In 2004, Joe Bonsall talked with The Journal about his book. A regular in Sioux City at the Municipal Auditorium, the Tyson Events Center and the Orpheum Theatre, the Oak Ridge Boys were favorites in Siouxland. Bonsall died July 9 from complications of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis. Here's the story:\n\nIt's amazing what writing one little book will do.\n\nFollowing the release of \"G.I. Joe and Lillie,\" the story of his parents, Oak Ridge Boy Joe Bonsall has gotten countless letters, e-mails and hugs from veterans thanking him for sharing.\n\nRoutinely, Bonsall says, he'll meet veterans backstage who'll say his book -- and companion song -- have touched them in profound ways. \"Last night in Southern California I had an old Marine who said to me, 'When you sing that song tonight, sing it for both our parents.' He was standing with tears in his eyes and his daughter said, 'There ain't much that gets to this old Marine.' \"\n\nPeople are also reading...

It's such an important part of Bonsall's life he could easily fill a second volume with letters from fans. More important? \"Young kids today are writing: 'My husband's in Iraq and I was so inspired by your mom I want to be the kind of wife she was.' It's incredible,\" Bonsall says. And it almost didn't happen.\n\nOnce Bonsall decided he would write about his parents, he didn't know where to start. Then he read through his mother's memoirs and \"that filled in a lot of gaps. They were like a guidepost to me. Overall, writing this book was a happy experience. I was a little boy doing what mommy wanted him to do.\"\n\nThe book came after both parents had died. It details their war and post-war years and emphasizes the love that endured through the worst of times.\n\nThe song, also called \"G.I. Joe and Lillie,\" emerged quickly. \"I wrote the song in its entirety on the back of the bus before our show in Lancaster, Pa.,\" honoring veterans. It got a tremendous reaction and launched the latest phase of Bonsall's life.\n\nNow, he says, there's talk of turning the book and song into a movie. \"If there are 20 steps to that process, there may be four taken,\" he says. \"It would be incredible if it did.\"\n\nBonsall says \"Seabiscuit's\" Chris Cooper could play his father in his later years, a newcomer would have to play him in his teens.\n\nLife as a movie producer, though, is hardly on the singer's radar. He's so thrilled to still be doing more than 170 shows a year he can't ask for anything more.\n\nEven the Grammy nomination the Oaks got this year (for best country group) seems like gravy. \"It meant a lot to us,\" he says. \"To be nominated with Diamond Rio and some of the other young groups was very, very big for us.\"\n\nBonsall figures members of the Grammy organization did it as a lifetime achievement tribute. \"They looked and saw that the Oaks were still pounding away and doing astounding things. They figured, let's honor them with a Grammy nomination. We've seen it with Hollywood...folks who've never won an Oscar get one.\"\n\nWhile the group didn't win the prize (Ricky Skaggs and Kentucky Thunder took it), the nomination did make a statement: The Oak Ridge Boys are alive and well and still \"singing our hearts out.\"\n\nWant to make them mad? Ask about retiring. \"When people come up and confuse us with the Statlers, you can really see us bristle,\" Bonsall says. \"This group doesn't know how to slow down and we don't want to. As long as the guys are blessed with health, our hands are in the cookie jar.\"\n\nWhile Bonsall is busy with his book project, William Lee Golden has found a niche as a painter, Duane Allen has increased his producing profile and Richard Sterban is making a name for himself as a fashion expert. Music is the group's calling card, not its only ability.\n\nCurrently, the four have finished half the tracks on a new album slated for release at the end of summer. It has a bluegrass/gospel/acoustic sound and it features another one of those \"written in a minute\" songs by Bonsall. Called \"The Journey,\" it talks about saying goodbye to friends. \"It's the journey we're all going to have to take\" and it emerged, oddly enough, from looking at a picture of Bonsall's parents.\n\nWhile messing around on a dulcimer-like instrument, Bonsall got a \"cool mountain sound\" in his head that prompted him to think about the people he had lost in the past year. \"I started singing to myself and wrote it right there.\" He played it for the others the next day and it landed on the album.\n\n\"I don't write a lot of songs,\" Bonsall says. \"But when I do they come to me pretty quick.\"\n\nWhere this journey will lead is anyone's guess. But it's a pretty safe bet at least one fan will approve. Former President George Bush is such an Oak nut he asked the group to sing at his 80th birthday celebration in June. \"He's going to jump out of a plane at the Bush library,\" Bonsall reports, \"and we're going to be there.\"\n\nThe group will sing \"This is America\" and, if his son, George W. Bush, asks, the four will go back out on the stump to help his re-election campaign. While the current president hasn't declared the Oak Ridge Boys his favorite group, his father has. \"He's such a fan, he asks for songs like 'Freckles,'\" Bonsall says.\n\nGeorge Sr.'s wife, Barbara, even wrote the foreward to Bonsall's book. \"I laughed and cried when I read 'G.I. Joe and Lillie,'\" Barbara Bush writes. \"It reminded me of when I fell in love with a man in uniform. (It's) a wonderful love story to be cherished by all.\"\n\nBonsall thinks his mother would approve. \"It showed everything she would have wanted to share. I talk about my dad (in it) and I'm proud of him. But it will always be my mother's book. That's why it's dedicated to her,\" he says. \"It's her book. Her story.\"\n\n0 Comments Love 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n\nStay up-to-date on what's happening\n\nReceive the latest in local entertainment news in your inbox weekly!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.", "source": {"uri": "siouxcityjournal.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sioux City Journal"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Bonsall", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Bonsall"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_in_the_Park_(song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Saturday in the Park (song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Oak_Ridge_Boys", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Oak Ridge Boys"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siouxland", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Siouxland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sioux_City,_Iowa", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sioux City, Iowa"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sioux City, Iowa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonsall,_Derbyshire", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bonsall, Derbyshire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bonsall, Derbyshire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McCook_Lake", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "McCook Lake"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G.I._Joe", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "G.I.

First thing in the morning, I'll wake up, and I'll be listening to John Conlee, The Oak Ridge Boys, or Keith Whitley, or the Bellamy Brothers, you know, all those guys from the 1980s that I grew up listening to.\"\n\nHe added, \"It just inspires me all over again, and I'm inspired every single day when I hear those records I've fallen in love with.\"", "source": {"uri": "country1025.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Country 102.5"}, "authors": [{"uri": "nancy_brooks@country1025.com", "name": "Nancy Brooks", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Bonsall", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Bonsall"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Oak_Ridge_Boys", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Oak Ridge Boys"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blake_Shelton", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Blake Shelton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Country music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country_Music_Association_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Country Music Association Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country_Music_Association_Award_for_Single_of_the_Year", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Country Music Association Award for Single of the Year"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country_Music_Association_Award_for_Vocal_Group_of_the_Year", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Country Music Association Award for Vocal Group of the Year"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elvira_(song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Elvira (song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country_Music_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Country Music Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oak_Ridge,_Tennessee", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oak Ridge, Tennessee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oak Ridge, Tennessee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vocal_Group_Hall_of_Fame", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vocal Group Hall of Fame"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gospel_Music_Hall_of_Fame", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gospel Music Hall of Fame"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Conlee", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "John Conlee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bellamy_Brothers", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Bellamy Brothers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keith_Whitley", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Keith Whitley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country_Music_Hall_of_Fame_and_Museum", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Ole_Opry", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Grand Ole Opry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_Football_Hall_of_Fame", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pro Football Hall of Fame"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gwen_Stefani", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gwen Stefani"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Education", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Education", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Music/Sheet_Music", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Music/Sheet Music", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Sound_Files", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Sound Files", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/History", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/History", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Computers", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Computers", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 87}], "image": "https://content.bbgi.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2024/07/blakejoeoaks.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9718643", "eventUri": "eng-9718643", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-09", "textStart": 225, "textEnd": 231}], "sentiment": -0.02745098039215688, "wgt": 163, "relevance": 1}

While he was more than happy to lend his voice to the group's rich harmony, the Philadelphia, Pennsylvania native was no stranger to the spotlight. In fact, he sang lead on some of the band's biggest and most memorable songs.\n\nVideos by American Songwriter\n\nThere's no denying that Bonsall was a major part of the Oaks' sound for the five decades he spent in the band. Without his voice, these three songs may not have gone on to be the classics they are today.\n\n\"Elvira\" -- Joe Bonsall Leads the Oak Ridge Boys' Signature Song\n\nDallas Frazier wrote and originally released \"Elvira\" in 1966. Twelve years later, Rodney Crowell released the song as his debut single. Both Crowell and Frazier saw minor success with the song. However, when Joe Bonsall and the rest of the Oak Ridge Boys recorded it for their 1981 album Fancy Free, it became a huge hit. It was a No. 1 country hit for the group. It also reached No. 5 on the all-genre Billboard Hot 100.\n\n[RELATED: Joe Bonsall Tells the Story Behind The Oak Ridge Boys' Hit Song \"Elvira\"]\n\nBetween Bonsall's lead vocals and Richard Sterban coming in with the unforgettable \"oom pa-pa mow mow\" chorus, it's easy to see how \"Elvira\" became the Oaks' signature song.\n\n\"Bobbie Sue\" -- A Crossover Hit for the Group\n\nWood Newton, Dan Tyler, and Adele Tyler co-wrote the songs that would be the first single and title track from the Oak Ridge Boys' 1982 album. It went on to become the group's sixth No. 1 single. Additionally, it was a crossover hit for the group, landing at No. 12 on the all-genre Billboard Hot 100 chart.\n\n\"Bobbie Sue\" sees Joe Bonsall leading the group in a song about rebellious young love. The song's narrator and it's focus -- Bobbie Sue -- run off together to elope despite her parents' protests. The throwback style of the song makes it feel like something from an earlier era, drawing on the nostalgia of the Oaks' older listeners.\n\n\"American Made\" -- Joe Bonsall and the Oak Ridge Boys' Ode to American Women\n\nBob DiPiero and Pat McManus co-wrote \"American Made\" and the Oak Ridge Boys released it as the lead single and title track from their 1983 album. It went to the top of the Billboard Hot Country Songs Chart for a week. Additionally, a re-imagined version of the song became a jingle for Miller beer.\n\nIn the song, Joe Bonsall takes on the role of the narrator who is disappointed by all of the foreign-made things that he uses in his daily life. However, that all falls by the wayside as he celebrates the fact that the woman he loves is 100% made in the good ol' U. S. of A.\n\nFeatured Image by Jason Kempin/Getty Images", "source": {"uri": "americansongwriter.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "American Songwriter"}, "authors": [{"uri": "clayton_edwards@americansongwriter.com", "name": "Clayton Edwards", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elvira_(song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Elvira (song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Bonsall", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Bonsall"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Oak_Ridge_Boys", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Oak Ridge Boys"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Frazier", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Frazier"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodney_Crowell", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rodney Crowell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bobbie_Sue_(song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bobbie Sue (song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Songwriter", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American Songwriter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tenor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tenor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmony", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Harmony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billboard_Hot_100", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Billboard Hot 100"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossover_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Crossover music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Sterban", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Richard Sterban"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refrain", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Refrain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adele", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Adele"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Singing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Made_(song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American Made (song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_DiPiero", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bob DiPiero"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jingle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jingle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hot_Country_Songs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hot Country Songs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead_single", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lead single"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Lyrics", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Lyrics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Recordings", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Recordings", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Charts", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Charts", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Team_Spirit/Fight_Songs", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Team Spirit/Fight Songs", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Weddings/Music", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Weddings/Music", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://americansongwriter.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/download-2024-07-10T124913.528.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9718643", "eventUri": "eng-9718643", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1529411764705881, "wgt": 162, "relevance": 1}

The cause of death was complications of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis.\n\nBonsall had announced his retirement from touring with the group in January, citing his illness, as the Oak Ridge Boys continued their farewell tour without him.\n\nThe group was best known by crossover audience for the 1981 smash \"Elvira,\" which not only hit No. 1 on the country chart but landed at No. 5 on the pop chart. The following year, \"Bobbie Sue\" also registered success in pop as well as country. Altogether the band landed 17 No. 1 country songs and 34 that made the top 10.\n\nBonsall was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame along with three of his fellow group members in 2015. The Oak Ridge Boys were also elected into the Gospel Music Hall of Fame in 2000.\n\nThe origins of the Oak Ridge Boys go back to the 1940s, and the group took on that name in the mid-1960s, but the combo was primarily known as a gospel act before Bonsall joined in 1973. Johnny Cash helped them get signed to Columbia Records, but the group didn't find major secular success until a subsequent signing to Dot/ABC and the release of a song called \"Y'all Come Back Saloon\" that went to No. 3 on the country chart in 1977. Subsequent No. 1 songs during that early period of success included \"Trying to Love Two Woman,\" \"I'll Be True to You,\" \"Leaving Louisiana in the Broad Daylight\" and \"(I'm Settin') Fancy Free.\"\n\nBonsall had written 11 books, including a memoir due to be published this November, \"I See Myself.\"\n\nSaid a death notice issued by Bonsall's reps, \"Joe loved to sing. He loved to read. He loved to write. He loved to play banjo. He loved working on the farm. And he loved the Philadelphia Phillies. But Jesus and his family always came first -- and we will see him again on the Promised Day.\n\nBonsall is survived by his wife, Mary Ann, daughters Jennifer and Sabrina, granddaughter Breanne, grandson Luke, two great grandsons, Chance and Grey, and a sister, Nancy. He was preceded in death by his parents Joseph S. Bonsall Sr. and Lillie Bonsall.\n\nAt his request, no funeral will be held.

The Philly native typically ceded lead vocals to bandmate Duane Allen. However, \"Elvira,\" written and first released by Dallas Frazier in the 1960s, became the Oak Ridge Boys' most iconic hit.\n\nVideos by American Songwriter\n\nBonsall passed away on July 9 from complications due to ALS. Along with his family, love of animals, and membership in the Country Music Hall of Fame and Grand Ole Opry, \"Elvira\" is part of his legacy.\n\nThe RIAA certified \"Elvira\" double platinum for 2 million in sales, a milestone that only \"Islands in the Stream\" by Kenny Rogers and Dolly Parton had reached at the time. In 1982, the song won the Oak Ridge Boys a Grammy for Best Country Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals.\n\nBonsall remembers being in the recording studio finishing recording the \"Fancy Free\" album when a song plugger arrived and said he'd heard a Texas bar band do a version of Rodney Crowell's \"Elvira\" and thought the song was perfect for The Oaks.\n\nAllen first heard the song when Frazier played it on WSM in 1966 and never forgot it, which he said is how to know a song is truly a hit.\n\nWhen the song plugger suggested it to the group, it wasn't hard to convince them to record it. Although Kenny Rogers & The First Edition, Frazier, and Crowell had each recorded versions of \"Elvira,\" Bonsall told NPR that he wanted to reimagine his performance as something new.\n\n\"I never did it like the old 'Elviras,'\" Bonsall said. \"I kind of did my own take, which, looking back on it, was a good idea.\"\n\nJoe Bonsall Thought the Other Versions of \"Elvira\" Had \"Weird\" Elements\n\nHe said the other versions, including Rogers, presented the song in a \"weird kind of minor key.\"\n\n\"We just put our spin on it and had a lot of fun in the studio,\" Bonsall said.\n\nAllen told The Tennessean the Oaks wanted 'Elvira' to be a summer record for families of four. The group imagined Moms singing the verses, the kids singing the 'giddy up' lyrics, and dads swooping in with Richard Sterban's um-poppa-um-poppa, mow, mow.\n\n\"It's the best planning we ever did,\" Allen said.\n\nBonsall remembered their producer, Ron Chancey, was ready to give the song a go.\n\n\"We get in the studio with the musicians, and we sang through it a couple of times,\" Bonsall said. \"I think we sang through it three times. All I remember about that session was everybody was smiling, everybody was having fun, and it worked out well.\"\n\nThe Oak Ridge Boys didn't know how well it worked out until a couple of months later when they were on a tour of the Pacific Northwest. They told fans they'd been rehearsing new songs and asked if they could share them. When the crowd agreed, the men debuted \"Fancy Free\" and a couple of other songs before they played \"Elvira.\"\n\n\"Holy cow, man,\" Bonsall said. \"The audience acted like we gave him a\n\n(Photo

He was 76.\n\nHis publicist, Jeremy Westby, said the cause was complications of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, the neuromuscular disorder also known as Lou Gehrig's disease. (Mr. Bonsall issued a statement in January saying that he was retiring from touring with the Oak Ridge Boys but would remain a member of the group.)\n\nOriginally a Southern gospel quartet, the Oak Ridge Boys had 17 Billboard No. 1 country singles, as well as 17 more that made the country Top 10, after reinventing themselves as a country act in the early 1970s. The group, which has sold more than 41 million records worldwide, was formed in Oak Ridge, Tenn., in the early 1940s, and disbanded and reformed twice before its lineup stabilized with Mr. Bonsall's arrival in 1973.\n\n\"Elvira\" (1981) and \"Bobbie Sue\" (1982), two of the group's best-known No. 1 hits, featured Mr. Bonsall on lead vocals in place of the regular lead singer, Duane Allen. William Lee Golden and Richard Sterban, who sang baritone and bass, rounded out the four-part harmony quartet during its heyday in the 1970s and '80s.\n\nAmong the group's other No. 1 hits were \"Leaving Louisiana in the Broad Daylight\" (1979), an early Rodney Crowell composition, and \"American Made\" (1983), a wry topical number that showcased Mr. Bonsall's clean, resounding tenor.

He saw the band through its golden period in the '80s and beyond, which included its signature 1981 song, \"Elvira,\" its 1982 hit \"Bobbie Sue\" and 1983's \"American Made.\" \"Elvira\" marked a massive crossover moment for the group, reaching No. 1 on the country chart and No. 5 on Billboard's all-genre Hot 100.\n\nAmyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or ALS, is a disease that damages nerve cells and connections that are necessary to control muscles for movements such as walking, talking and breathing. Most patients die within three to five years of a diagnosis.

The country-gospel outfit has delivered countless hits through the years, from \"Elvira\" to \"Bobbie Sue\" to \"American Made\". That being said, the band has released over 30 studio albums in the decades since they got together. There are so many underrated songs out there, and picking just a few to recommend isn't easy. But we think you'll love these four Oak Ridge Boys deep cuts!\n\nVideos by American Songwriter 1. \"Don't Break The Code\"\n\nThis 1986 deep cut comes from The Oak Ridge Boys' album Seasons. The harmonies are right, the melody is catchy, and the lyrics are quite relatable. It's surprising that this song wasn't released as a single on the album.\n\n2. \"I Guess It Never Hurts To Hurt Sometimes\"\n\nThe late great Randy VanWarmer wrote this little track for the 1984 album Deliver. It's notably about the death of VanWarmer's father, and it turned into one of The Oak Ridge Boys' best ballads of their career. Joe Bonsall's vocals on this song are notably emotional and passionate.\n\n3. \"Come On In\"\n\nThe Oak Ridge Boys are known for splitting up the lead vocals among most of their hits fairly evenly. However, the 1979 hit song \"Come On In\" features each of the band members' singing abilities beautifully, all in just one track. Nobody does melodies quite like The Oak Ridge Boys!\n\n4. \"Leaving Louisiana In The Broad Daylight\"\n\n\"Leaving Louisiana In The Broad Daylight\" was The Oak Ridge Boys' very last single of the 1970s from their 1979 album The Oak Ridge Boys Have Arrived. The song was originally written by Rodney Crowell and Donivan Cowart, and performed by Emmylou Harris in 1978. However, The Oak Ridge Boys put their own unique spin on it, and it managed to hit no. 1 on the Hot Country Songs chart.\n\nPhoto by Jason Kempin\n\nWhen you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.", "source": {"uri": "americansongwriter.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "American Songwriter"}, "authors": [{"uri": "em_casalena@americansongwriter.com", "name": "Em Casalena", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Oak_Ridge_Boys", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Oak Ridge Boys"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Made_(song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American Made (song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bobbie_Sue_(song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bobbie Sue (song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elvira_(song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Elvira (song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_chart", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Record chart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Album", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Album"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randy_VanWarmer", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Randy VanWarmer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Bonsall", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Bonsall"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurt_(Nine_Inch_Nails_song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hurt (Nine Inch Nails song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Songwriter", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "American Songwriter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballad", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ballad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Singing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodney_Crowell", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rodney Crowell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmylou_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Emmylou Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hot_Country_Songs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hot Country Songs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead_vocalist", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lead vocalist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Lyrics", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Lyrics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Bands_and_Artists", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Bands and Artists", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Musical", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Musical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Charts", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Charts", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Weddings/Music", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Weddings/Music", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://americansongwriter.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/hhuf32z40io.jpg?fit=1280%2C720", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9718643", "eventUri": "eng-9718643", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 128, "relevance": 1}

Joe had already retired from touring with the Oak Ridge Boys earlier in the year as a result of the progression of the disease, with bluegrass and gospel performer Ben James taking his place in touring shows. At this time, there are no further details on his passing while his family and friends privately mourn.\n\n\"It has been a great 50 years and I am thankful to all the Oak Ridge Boys, band, crew and staff for the constant love and support shown to me through it all,\" he told The Nashville Tennessean in January. \"I will never forget, and for those of you who have been constantly holding me up in prayer.\"\n\nJoe became part of the Oak Ridge Boys in 1973, holding his position in the group for five decades. Throughout Joe's tenure with the group, they began to focus more on the entertainment than the gospel of the quartet's original messaging, packaging their performances as a more mainstream country act. This helped to skyrocket the group to success, marked by 14 songs hitting the Top 10 Billboard Country charts.\n\nIn addition to music, Joe was also an author, penning 11 books (mostly children's books) and a memoir that's still scheduled to be published in November 2024.

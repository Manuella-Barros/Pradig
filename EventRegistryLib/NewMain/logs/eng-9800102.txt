But honestly I am living a dream and I don't want to wake up.\"\n\nFrance have fulfilled their objective by being guaranteed a medal, with Henry succeeding in moulding together a cohesive team after initially being met by a series of rejections from clubs unwilling to release their players.\n\nClubs have no obligation to let their players take part in the Olympics, where the men's tournament is reserved for those aged under 23 with the exception of three who are over-age.\n\nKylian Mbappe, the captain and star of the senior national side, wanted to come but was not allowed by his new club Real Madrid. Hopes of getting Antoine Griezmann onboard were also quickly dashed.\n\nBut Les Bleus have been expertly led by the experienced Alexandre Lacazette and his fellow forwards, the bruising Jean-Philippe Mateta and the flying Michael Olise.\n\nThey won all three group games without conceding a goal, before seeing off Argentina 1-0 in a fiery quarter-final and then showing great character to come from behind and beat Egypt 3-1 after extra time in the last four.\n\n\"We have been talking about the Games for a year and a half now and finally we get to go to Paris (for the final),\" said Mateta, the Crystal Palace striker who netted twice against the Egyptians.\n\nThis may be the Paris Games, but so far Henry's team have played all their matches elsewhere around the country, in Marseille, Nice, Bordeaux and Lyon.\n\nSpain, meanwhile, began their campaign with a 2-1 win over Uzbekistan in Paris. After easing past Japan in Lyon in the last eight, they had to come from behind to beat Morocco 2-1 in their semi-final in Marseille.\n\nThat victory in front of a hostile crowd, achieved thanks to goals by the outstanding Barcelona midfielder Fermin Lopez and the substitute Juanlu Sanchez, will give the Spaniards confidence that they can handle the crowd and the pressure in the French capital.", "source": {"uri": "straitstimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Straits Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parc_des_Princes", "type": "wiki",

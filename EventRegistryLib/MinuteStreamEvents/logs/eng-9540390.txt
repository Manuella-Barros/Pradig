Nunez's work ethic is admired by fans and is considered a low-cost option due to Barca's financial constraints and La Liga's salary cap. While Nunez shows promise with 11 goals this season, critics doubt his ability to match Lewandowski's prolific goalscoring record.\n\nSpanish giants Barcelona are eyeing up a shock summer move for Liverpool ace Darwin Nunez, according to The Sun, as Xavi and his entourage plan to replace the talismanic Robert Lewandowski.\n\nThe Uruguayan has been a divisive figure among the Anfield faithful since joining for a club record \u00a385 million in the summer of 2022, with his substandard conversion rate being among the many worries.\n\nStill just 24 years of age, Artigas-born Nunez has recorded 33 goals and 17 assists in 93 outings in a Liverpool strip and his tally for the current season sits at 11 goals and eight assists.\n\nHowever, amid news that Barcelona are in dire need of a squad shake-up, the former Benfica man, thanks to his low wage demands, has been earmarked as a potential successor for Lewandowski ahead of the summer transfer window.\n\nBarcelona Eye Nunez For Financial Reasons La Liga salary cap may force Barca's hand\n\nWhile Nunez has obvious deficiencies in his game, his work ethic has been praised by fans and pundits alike and Barcelona, according to the report, are not only willing to meet Liverpool's price tag, but they also feel like he is capable of taking over from Lewandowski's duties.\n\nIn terms of Lewandowski, the 148-cap Poland international still has two years to run on his current contract, but the fact that La Liga imposed a \u00a3175 million salary cap earlier this season may force his employers to offload him once July hits.\n\nGIVEMESPORT Key Statistic: Lewandowski is Bayern Munich's second-highest goalscorer of all time, having notched 344 strikes in 375 games.\n\nSince arriving at the Nou Camp in a deal worth \u00a342.5 million from Bayern Munich back in the summer of 2022, Lewandowski - who is still considered one of the best strikers in world football - has remained one of Barcelona's highest-earning stars amid their ongoing financial difficulties.\n\nAnd despite Nunez pocketing a healthy \u00a3140,000-per-week, making him one of the best-paid assets at Anfield, his take home is still considerably less than the Barcelona centre forward, who has chalked up 57 goals and 17 assists in 91 outings since his arrival.\n\nNunez and Lewandowski's 23/24 League Stats Compared\n\nStat\n\nNunez\n\nLewandowski\n\nAppearances\n\n22(11)\n\n28(3)\n\nGoals\n\n11\n\n17\n\nAssists\n\n8\n\n8\n\nShots per game\n\n3.2\n\n2.8\n\nDribbles per game\n\n0.5\n\n0.5\n\nKey passes per game\n\n1\n\n0.8\n\nOverall rating\n\n6.97\n\n7.18\n\nThe Sun's report also insists that Nunez is keen to play for the Spanish outfit one day but, regardless, is still happy to continue plying his trade for the Merseysiders.\n\nBefore Benfica acquired his services from Almeria in 2020, Barcelona were adamant they had completed a deal for the now 24-year-old, but they fell short at the final hurdle as the Portuguese giants managed to strike a deal.\n\nRelated The 8 Premier League Players Caught Offside the Most This Season The likes of Liverpool's Darwin Nunez and Chelsea's Nicolas Jackson feature on the list of most offsides this season. Nunez's Wastefulness In Front of Goal Arne Slot could look to upgrade\n\nThe question is: can Nunez match Lewandowski's goalscoring output? Admittedly, in his second season at Anfield, the improvements in his all-round play have been evident, but whether he is on par with the Pole in terms of his prowess in front of goal is questionable.\n\nThe Athletic's Simon Hughes recently suggested that Arne Slot, who will succeed the much-beloved Jurgen Klopp in the Anfield hot seat, must try and upgrade on Nunez this summer amid criticism over his potency.\n\nRelated Liverpool and Klopp Disagreed Over Darwin Nunez Signing Liverpool forward Darwin Nunez has come under plenty of scrutiny this season, and Paul Joyce has suggested it was a Jurgen Klopp signing.\n\nThere's no doubt that he has progressed well, while not establishing himself as a reliable source of goals, since arriving in 2022 - but his 19.4% conversion rate of big chances this term is the lowest among any striker in Europe's top five leagues.\n\nShould Barcelona be willing to take a gamble on Nunez, whose pace and power could provide them with a different dimension, and table a genuine offer, they will certainly be wary of his substandard goalscoring ability.\n\nAll statistics per WhoScored - correct as of 05/05/2024", "source": {"uri": "givemesport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GiveMeSport"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Assist (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salary_cap", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Salary cap"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Lewandowski", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Robert Lewandowski"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Liga", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "La Liga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darwin,_Northern_Territory", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Darwin, Northern Territory"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Darwin, Northern Territory"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anfield", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Anfield"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xavi", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Xavi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S.L._Benfica", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "S.L.

A solid return for the investment in the player, which has now sparked the interest of Barcelona in La Liga.\n\nAccording to The Sun, the Catalan club is now plotting a move for Nunez in the summer transfer window as they search for a successor to legendary Polish striker Robert Lewandowski.\n\nSince arriving from Bayern Munich in 2022 for around \u00a342.5m, the 35-year-old has remained one of the top earners at the club. Lewandowski has two years left on his deal and the club will now look to offload his salary after the 2023/24 season.\n\nBarcelona reportedly believe Nunez is capable of replacing Lewandowski as the starting number nine in Xavi's squad next season, after the former midfielder reversed his decision to leave the club and will now continue as head coach.\n\nNunez is one of the top earners at Liverpool - on around \u00a3140,000-per-week - but this would still be significantly less than Lewandowski's deal amid the financial trouble Barcelona is currently dealing with.\n\nFormer Reds defender Jamie Carragher gave an honest assessment of Nunez recently, where he said: \"I think I'm at the stage with Nunez now where I don't think there is a question to ask.\n\n\"He gives it everything, he runs, he causes trouble, he gets the odd goal and assist, but after two years, with Liverpool this season going for the title and those big games, you need him to score at Old Trafford, Goodison, at Atalanta.\n\n\"This is not October or November, this is the business end of the title race.\n\n\"We've all been in squads where first year we say he needs to get to speed, but you're looking at it now, I don't think there will be a massive improvement. I think after two years we've seen what he is, he can cause trouble and be erratic with his finishing\n\n\"I don't think it's enough to win the biggest trophies, so I think there's a big decision to be made on him.\"", "source": {"uri": "sportbible.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "www.sportbible.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Lewandowski", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Robert Lewandowski"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer_window", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Transfer window"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erling_Haaland", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Erling Haaland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_football_league_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "English football league system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uruguay_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Uruguay national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anfield", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anfield"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manchester City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assist (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xavi", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Xavi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Bayern_Munich", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FC Bayern Munich"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sun_(United_Kingdom)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Sun (United Kingdom)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Liga", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "La Liga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalonia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Catalonia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Catalonia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamie_Carragher", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jamie Carragher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atalanta_B.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Atalanta B.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Trafford", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Old Trafford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/UEFA", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/UEFA", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Work-Life_Balance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Work-Life Balance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://images.ladbible.com/resize?type=webp&quality=70&width=1200&fit=contain&gravity=auto&url=https://images.ladbiblegroup.com/v3/assets/blta90d05ad41a54a71/bltc968ec16edf4ec28/66374e6f53af03698b05cb22/440520140_3733182133624796_5985405872153819853_n.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9540390", "eventUri": "eng-9540390", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "wgt": 216, "relevance": 1}

Klopp's belief in Nunez contrasts board's view - managerial change could see forward leave Anfield. Nunez linked to Barcelona move as potential departure looms - funds could aid new manager's plans.\n\nDarwin Nunez's Liverpool career could end as soon as this summer, The Independent's Miguel Delaney suggests. The Uruguayan forward deleted all recent Liverpool-related posts from his Instagram account following a 4-2 victory over Tottenham on the weekend, leading to speculation about his departure.\n\nNunez's lack of clinical finishing has been a talking point all season, with the forward scoring only 11 times in 34 Premier League outings. In the victory over Tottenham, he came on as a substitute in the second half and yet again failed to convert a huge opportunity to increase the advantage as he received a pass from Mohamed Salah but shot straight at the keeper Guglielmo Vicario.\n\nLiverpool Could Move Nunez on\n\nThe \u00a385m star's recent social media activity and poor form this season have fueled reports about him potentially leaving the club in the summer. Delaney, speaking on the Sky Sports Back Pages podcast, hinted at a potential departure for Nunez:\n\n\"It's obviously a big red flag if someone deletes photos that indicate their connection to the club. Darwin Nunez has become a cult hero among Liverpool fans, and there's clearly a player there.\n\n\"There's also a lot of frustration there. When reading between the lines it wouldn't be a complete surprise if they moved him on, given that he came into the club in a summer that was perceived as having upheaval behind the scenes. He was considered Klopp's man.\"\n\nDelaney suggests that it is 'a big red flag when someone deletes photos' of the club on social media. However, a managerial change could also see Nunez out of the club, as the forward was \"considered Klopp's man\" upon his arrival at Anfield last summer.\n\nThe Times reported that Jurgen Klopp was the one who believed in Nunez, while the Liverpool board suggested signing Christopher Nkunku, who eventually joined Chelsea and spent the majority of this season injured.\n\nThe arrival of new Liverpool manager Arne Slot in the summer could result in several Liverpool players departing, including defenders Joel Matip and Joe Gomez. Fabrizio Romano reports that Nunez is \"looking forward\" to speaking with the new manager to determine his future.\n\nNunez Has Been Linked With Barcelona\n\nDespite his poor chances conversion, Nunez's potential has caught the eye of many admirers in Europe. If he were to leave Merseyside this summer, top European clubs could vie for his signature. This includes Barcelona, who are looking to trim their wage bill this summer and potentially part ways with some star players, including forward Robert Lewandowski.\n\nDarwin Nunez Stats (2023/24)\n\nCompetition\n\nGames\n\nGoals\n\nAssists\n\nPremier League\n\n34\n\n11\n\n8\n\nEuropa League\n\n10\n\n5\n\n1\n\nFA Cup\n\n3\n\n1\n\n1\n\nEFL Cup\n\n5\n\n1\n\n3\n\nBarcelona's salary cap was slashed to \u00a3175m by La Liga, with Lewandowski set to earn \u00a327m next season. The Polish striker is the highest earner at the club, and manager Xavi has hinted that Barcelona will decide on the 35-year-old's future at the end of the season. Earlier this year, reports emerged suggesting that Lewandowski could be among the latest European names to join MLS, leaving Barcelona in search of a new forward.\n\nAccording to The Sun, Nunez is already on Barcelona's radar for next season, and Liverpool could seize the opportunity to cash in on the Uruguayan striker. New manager Slot will be looking to implement his style of play by bringing in new faces to Anfield, and the sale of Nunez could generate funds for the Dutchman's plans.\n\nRelated Liverpool Told

Fabrizio Romano suggests Nunez is excited to speak to new manager Arne Slot after deleting his recent Instagram posts. Poor finishing by Nunez has cost Liverpool, with 27 missed big chances and only 11 goals scored.\n\nLiverpool forward Darwin Nunez is enduring an inconsistent season at Anfield and has been on the receiving end of plenty of criticism, and Italian journalist Fabrizio Romano has provided the latest update on his future, suggesting that he's looking forward to speaking to soon-to-be manager Arne Slot.\n\nThe Uruguayan striker's goal record this campaign hasn't been disastrous, but there's an argument to suggest he should be finding the back of the net more often than he has considering the number of chances presented to him. The fans at Anfield want to see more from Nunez, especially after the Reds forked out \u00a385m to secure his signature.\n\nNunez Looking Forward to Slot Joining Liverpool It could be a fresh start for the striker\n\nAt the weekend following Liverpool's 4-2 victory over Tottenham Hotspur, Nunez proceeded to delete any of his recent Instagram posts that were related to the Merseyside club. It sparked confusion among the fanbase, especially after a game where the Reds secured an impressive win.\n\nItalian journalist Romano has now had his say on the matter, and in terms of a potential transfer for Nunez, it's all quiet at the moment, while the former Benfica striker is looking forward to speaking to new coach Slot...\n\n\"A lot of fans are asking about Darwin Nunez deleting all Liverpool-related posts from his Instagram. However, these are private things, so only Darwin can clarify why he did that; for sure it's not the best moment for him, but I'd never link social media activities with transfer market movements. It's all quiet so far, nothing is happening and for sure Darwin is looking forward to speaking to new coach Arne Slot.\"\n\nAlthough Slot is yet to be officially appointed as manager, Liverpool have agreed a compensation fee with Feyenoord and he looks set to take over from Jurgen Klopp at the end of the season. Nunez might be hoping that a new coach can help get the best out of him after a difficult campaign at Anfield.\n\nBBC Sport writer Phil McNulty recently claimed that Nunez's poor finishing in front of goal can't be forgiven. The Uruguayan striker has missed an incredible number of chances for Liverpool this term, and a more clinical striker might see the Reds having a greater chance of securing the Premier League title.\n\nGIVEMESPORT Key Statistic: Darwin Nunez has missed 27 big chances in the Premier League this season while only scoring 11 goals for Liverpool.\n\nRelated Alisson Furious as Liverpool Fail to Keep Clean Sheet Again Amidst the chaos of Liverpool's win over Tottenham this weekend, Brazilian stopper fumes at visitors halving deficit late on Klopp and Liverpool Disagreed Over Nunez Signing Liverpool's recruitment team preferred Nkunku\n\nWhen Nunez arrived at Anfield, it might have been a surprise to many that the Reds forked out such a significant fee for a relatively unknown quantity. After a string of poor performances, The Times journalist Paul Joyce wrote about the young forward, confirming that it was Klopp who was pushing to get a deal over the line...\n\n\"Nunez was very much a Klopp signing (Liverpool's recruitment thinktank preferred Christopher Nkunku, then of RB Leipzig, who has spent this season injured at Chelsea) and the manager spoke about how it is his responsibility to provide the player with the confidence to perform.\"\n\nNkunku has struggled with injuries during his time at Stamford Bridge, but it would have been interesting to see if he could have made more of a positive impact than Nunez at Liverpool.\n\nAll stats courtesy of Premier League", "source": {"uri": "givemesport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GiveMeSport"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arne_Slot", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Arne Slot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anfield", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Anfield"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darwin,_Northern_Territory", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Darwin, Northern Territory"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Darwin, Northern Territory"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uruguay", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Uruguay"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Uruguay"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J\u00fcrgen_Klopp", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "J\u00fcrgen Klopp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S.L._Benfica", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "S.L.

The Uruguayan has caught the eye of head coach Xavi as he is seeking fresh options ahead of Robert Lewandowski's potential departure. Liverpool are in a strong negotiating position ahead of a possible offer thanks to Nunez's Anfield contract still having four years to run.\n\nLiverpool star Darwin Nunez could be offered a route out of Anfield when the transfer window reopens for business in the summer as La Liga giants Barcelona have pinpointed the Uruguayan as a potential long-term replacement for Robert Lewandowski, according to The Sun.\n\nThe Reds are already braced for plenty of change in the coming weeks as boss Jurgen Klopp is preparing to step down from his position at the end of the season, having run out of energy during another campaign which has seen his charges battling for the Premier League title and achieving Carabao Cup glory.\n\nArne Slot is edging towards being appointed as the German tactician's successor, thanks to Liverpool agreeing a compensation package worth up to \u00a39.4million with his current employers Feyenoord, but members of the current squad may embark on a fresh challenge ahead of the new regime getting underway.\n\nBarcelona Eyeing Nunez Summer Deal La Liga heavyweights have been searching for a Lewandowski replacement\n\nNunez has emerged as a shock target for Barcelona, according to The Sun, as head coach Xavi has set his sights on offloading Lewandowski during a mass clear-out in the summer transfer window after missing out on the La Liga title to arch-rivals Real Madrid this weekend.\n\nThe report suggests that the Spanish heavyweights have been informed that they need to slash their salary cap to just over \u00a3174million, leading to them being open to cashing in on the Poland international as he is on a contract which allows him to pocket close to \u00a3450,000-per-week, and they are eyeing the Liverpool marksman as a potential acquisition.\n\nGIVEMESPORT Key Statistic: Darwin Nunez registered 11 shots during Liverpool's 4-1 home win over Chelsea in January, which is the only time he has broken into double figures for attempts at goal in the Premier League this season\n\nAlthough Nunez will go into Sunday's clash with Champions League qualification-chasers Tottenham Hotspur having found the back of the net 18 times this season, while also providing a further 13 assists for his teammates, he has been guilty of failing to take advantage of numerous golden opportunities as his current employers' challenge for the Premier League title has waned in recent weeks.\n\nStatistics highlight that the striker has been posting better figures than Lewandowski in various metrics since the campaign got underway, and he is firmly in Xavi's sights after the Barcelona head coach made a U-turn and agreed to remain in the hot-seat heading into next term.\n\nDarwin Nunez's statistical averages per 90 minutes this season compared to Robert Lewandowski\n\nDarwin Nunez\n\nRobert Lewandowski\n\nShots on target percentage\n\n42.3\n\n39.8\n\nShots\n\n4.68\n\n3.03\n\nKey passes\n\n1.49\n\n0.91\n\nExpected goals\n\n0.71\n\n0.63\n\nAssists\n\n0.36\n\n0.29\n\nStatistics correct as of 05/05/2024\n\nReds Will Not Sell Nunez for Cut-Price Fee Uruguayan still has four years remaining on Anfield contract\n\nLiverpool are in a strong negotiating position if Barcelona decide to up the ante by making a formal offer for Nunez in the coming months as he still has four years remaining on a contract worth \u00a3140,000-per-week, and they would set lofty demands after they paid a lucrative sum to lure him to Anfield.\n\nThe Merseyside heavyweights parted with \u00a385million to convince Portuguese side Benfica to sanction the South American's exit in June 2022, resulting in him becoming the most expensive acquisition in the club's entire history, and they would not be open to green-lighting his departure for a cut-price fee during the opening stages of a new era.\n\nRelated Szoboszlai Will be 'Even Better' Under Slot at Liverpool Liverpool midfielder Dominik Szoboszlai was brought to Anfield last summer under Jurgen Klopp, but he could thrive when Arne Slot arrives.\n\nBarcelona's interest in Nunez comes after he has sent his tally up to 33 goals in a Liverpool shirt, while he has contributed a further 17 assists over the course of 93 appearances as he prepares to do battle with Tottenham on Sunday afternoon and attempt to return to the starting line-up.\n\nThe 24-year-old's development since his arrival from the Primeira Liga has resulted in Spanish football expert Guillem Balague claiming that he is 'becoming a world-class player', and it remains to be seen whether he will feature at the forefront of Slot's plans when he arrives on Merseyside.\n\nAll statistics courtesy of WhoScored and FBref", "source": {"uri": "givemesport.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

The striker is under the spotlight after a run of six games without a goal with Jurgen Klopp's side seeing their Premier League title challenge fizzle out.\n\nNunez has 18 goals and 13 assists in 52 matches this season, a marked improvement on 15 goals and four assists in 42 games last campaign. However, the Uruguayan has frustrated fans with his finishing in recent matches and has seen his place in the Reds' starting lineup come under considerable threat as a result.\n\nHe has only started one of Liverpool's past three matches and recently wiped any photo of him in action for the club on his Instagram profile. That has prompted considerable speculation about Nunez's future and what the future may hold for the 24-year-old, signed from Benfica for \u00a364 million in 2022.\n\nHere, the LiverpoolECHO's sports writers have had their say on Nunez and what may be next for the Uruguay international...\n\nREAD MORE: Liverpool face obvious change as Alisson makes 'pretty serious injury' admission\n\nREAD MORE: Emre Can sends clear Liverpool message after reaching Champions League final\n\nKeifer MacDonald\n\nYour view of Darwin Nunez will depend on whether you believe the glass to be half full or half empty.\n\nIndeed, it has been a much improved second season at Anfield for the Uruguayan, who has scored 18 goals across all competitions and provided a further 13 assists. Sure, there have been big moments - see his game-winning brace against Newcastle United in August or his spectacular effort against Bournemouth in November's League Cup tie - but there have also been some pretty horrific misses along the way. Plenty of them too.\n\nAnd when the dust settles on Jurgen Klopp's final season at Anfield, Nunez's misses against Luton Town, Manchester United, Crystal Palace and Everton will all be scrutinised as moments that could have swung the pendulum in Liverpool's favour.\n\nBut football doesn't work like that and instead, Nunez will head into his third season as a Red with the bit between his teeth and ready to embrace the challenge of becoming Arne Slot's first-choice No.9 at Anfield.\n\nRealistically, there would be little point in Liverpool cutting ties with the Uruguayan after successfully negotiating such tedious teething stages during his first two years on Merseyside. But this summer will see Nunez lose his biggest ally in Klopp and, therefore, any assurances he's previously had will count for nothing.\n\nThe only way Nunez can guarantee his future is by taking his chances.\n\nAmie Wilson\n\nDarwin Nunez has not scored the number of goals he should have in a Liverpool shirt since making the move from Benfica in the summer of 2022. There have been chances that you'd expect any striker in the Premier League, let alone one that cost a total of \u00a364m to put away.\n\nBut it might still be too early to give up on the Uruguayan just yet, at 24-year-old he is coming into his prime, and it may take just one lucky goal to boost his confidence and see him go on a goalscoring run. The arrival of Arne Slot as manager in the summer may also help the striker with a fresh outlook on the situation, despite the departure of Jurgen Klopp who has kept the faith in him.\n\nNunez's social media activity doesn't exactly help the situation, it only adds to the spotlight on him and the scrutiny surrounding him. Given that they would struggle to get close to the fee that they paid for him just two years ago, Liverpool may just be better in hoping that he can turn his career at Anfield around.\n\nJack Flintham\n\nWhile Nunez will be the first to admit that this season has not been as good as he expected it to be, the Uruguayan is still showing signs of why Jurgen Klopp purchased him. A tally of 18 goals across all competitions is modest to say the least.\n\nBut for me, it shows there is enough there for Arne Slot and Co. to work with in pre-season and justifies keeping him at the football club. There is a danger of falling into the trap that some other Premier League clubs have found themselves in and going through a huge turnover of players after a couple of seasons when they haven't quite met the grade yet.\n\nHe has already managed to beat his tally from the last campaign and perhaps purchasing another striker in the summer would help ease the pressure on his shoulders. Perhaps if a Victor Osimhen was targeted in the transfer window, the focus would be taken off Nunez helping him to continue to adapt to the top flight.\n\nKieran Horn\n\nDarwin Nunez very rarely has a quiet game and that was very evident from his Anfield debut when he was sent off for headbutting Joachim Andersen.\n\nHe is Liverpool's agent of chaos and having a player like him in your squad is better than not. While the departure of Jurgen Klopp will likely have an impact on Nunez, selling him should not be a priority for incoming new manager Arne Slot.\n\nIt is very possible that the Uruguay international realises his true potential under the Dutchman, however if he continues to show signs of struggling it may be worth reconsidering. Despite often frustrating Liverpool fans with his lack of a cutting edge in front of goal, Nunez has still scored 18 goals this season.\n\nTherefore, his stock has not drastically fallen and Liverpool can reassess his future this time next year, but in the meantime, he is absolutely worth keeping.", "source": {"uri": "liverpoolecho.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Liverpool Echo"}, "authors": [{"uri": "amie_wilson@liverpoolecho.co.uk", "name": "Amie Wilson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "jack_flintham@liverpoolecho.co.uk", "name": "Jack Flintham", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "keifer_macdonald@liverpoolecho.co.uk", "name": "Keifer MacDonald", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "kieran_horn@liverpoolecho.co.uk", "name": "Kieran Horn", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J\u00fcrgen_Klopp", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "J\u00fcrgen Klopp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anfield", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Anfield"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uruguay", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Uruguay"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Uruguay"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arne_Slot", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arne Slot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emre_Can", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Emre Can"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S.L._Benfica", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "S.L.

Transfer interest might make Liverpool's decision for them\n\nPaul Gorst: As far as Darwin Nunez goes, the raw materials for a top-class striker are there for all to see.\n\nUnfortunately, though, the shortcomings are just visible and nearly two years on from his signing that has become a club-record-equalling one of \u00a375m - with the potential for it to rise further to \u00a385m - it's only fair that big questions are not being asked.\n\nWith 31 goal contributions this season, it appears at first glance that Nunez has enjoyed an impressive sophomore term at Anfield having registered 19 in his maiden campaign, but that figure could - and should - be significantly higher than it is.\n\nFew players have enjoyed the unwavering support of the Kop like Nunez, whose name has been chanted vociferously after incidents as mundane as winning throw-ins and closing down defenders. Understandably there's been a willingness for him to succeed and that has been obvious since he made his Anfield debut in August 2022.\n\nBut as the goals have dried up - it's now just two since the start of March - the missed chances, the rash finishes and the panicked snatches have become more difficult to digest, particularly as the team's fortunes plummeted during an abject April.\n\nThe deleting of the social media images that were Reds-related suggest a player feeling the brunt of what is almost certain to have been criticism that has sadly manifested as online abuse but he has never had anything less than full backing of those who visit the ground most weeks.\n\nTwo years on, however, the issue is whether he can truly develop into the world-class centre-forward those at Liverpool felt he could be when they broke the bank to sign him from Benfica. The evidence that he can is becoming tougher to spot and a major decision could now await the new power axis of Michael Edwards, Richard Hughes and Arne Slot.\n\nStick or twist? A return of anything near the initial fee paid out to sign him could see Liverpool opt for the latter.\n\nThe goodwill has largely waned for Nunez from supporters\n\nIan Doyle: Christian Benteke lasted a season. Mario Balotelli likewise. Dean Saunders managed just over a year. Andy Carroll about 18 months. Djibril Cisse had two campaigns but was injured for most of the first one. Stan Collymore had two years. Robbie Keane, though, was given about six months.\n\nWhen a big-money striker signing fails at Liverpool, they simply do not make it into a third year. Which brings us to the decision Arne Slot may have to make over Darwin Nunez, regardless of whether or not the Uruguayan agitates for a move after his clear show of discontent following a poor cameo against Tottenham Hotspur on Sunday.\n\nIn terms of numbers at Liverpool, Nunez has far outstripped those aforementioned forwards with the exception of Collymore, whose tally of 35 goals and 16 assists in his two seasons is almost matched by Nunez's 33 goals and 17 assists.\n\nAnd, in some respects, there is a comparison to be made between Collymore and Nunez, with both undoubted talents that Liverpool haven't quite managed to fully unlock. There is also a turbulence to their Reds careers, albeit for differing reasons.\n\nJurgen Klopp simply hasn't been able to get the best out of Nunez. Slot might believe he can, but will surely know what to expect when he steps in at Anfield.\n\nNunez has been a crowd favourite with his endeavour and clear desire to win. But that can only take a player so far, especially for a team chasing major honours. The goodwill has largely waned.\n\nIn truth, if Slot decides Nunez isn't a player around whom his attack can occasionally be built, Liverpool have to cash in immediately while they can still garner a good price for the 24-year-old. Otherwise, the debate over Nunez must stop - and the Uruguayan simply be accepted as one of many forwards on which the new manager can call upon next season.\n\nHard to see how Nunez becomes the player he was billed to be\n\nTom Cavilla: It is becoming increasingly difficult to defend Darwin Nunez, who continues to split opinion for good reason.\n\nThe 24-year-old has been struggling in front of goal for several weeks now, his most damaging miss arriving in last month's Merseyside derby defeat at Goodison Park.\n\nUnlike the Uruguayan in this part of the pitch Liverpool supporters used to worship, Nunez has all the madness of Luis Suarez with none of the conviction.\n\nSupporters believed the current campaign would be the year the former Benfica star showed the division just why he was brought to Merseyside. Instead, it has left fans pondering how the club could move him on after only two seasons.\n\nNunez's 15-minute cameo against Tottenham Hotspur on Sunday told the story of his Liverpool career to date, missing a brilliant one-on-one chance having moments before been flagged for offside having failed to time his run. No Premier League player has been caught offside on more occasions than the Reds' No.9 in 2023/24.\n\nThere was another moment where Nunez tripped over the ball before winning a free-kick seconds later, once again highlighting his chaotic style of play that is becoming less enjoyable to watch by the week.\n\nIn June of last year, I argued Nunez was under pressure to deliver for the Reds this term. Put simply, that hasn't happened. Erling Haaland, rather surprisingly, has missed more big chances than Nunez this season, but the Manchester City star still finds a way to get on the scoresheet each week.

Barcelona have even been linked with an interest in his services.\n\nHowever, according to Mundo Deportivo, Barcelona are unlikely to make a move for Nunez. The Liverpool forward is on a long-term contract, and would cost too much for the Catalans at this stage.\n\nThis might be disappointing to some Liverpool fans, but the reality is Liverpool still have to back Nunez to succeed.\n\nThe club spent a lot of money to acquire him from Benfica. They've invested a lot of time now to get the best out of him.\n\nThere is no point in giving up on Nunez just yet.\n\nThe underlying numbers and the data suggests, there is a player there who has the potential to be a potent goal-scorer. As per FBref, Nunez is underperforming his xG in the Premier League by 0.20 per 90. In a 38 game season, that could equate to minus 7.6 goals.\n\nNunez is still creating chances and getting on at the end of goal-scoring opportunities. It would be more of a concern if he was not finding himself in scoring situations.\n\nThat would be a lot more difficult to coach. However, composure and finishing can always be enhanced and improved. That's what Liverpool need to get right, and then they will have a formidable player on their hands.", "source": {"uri": "rousingthekop.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Rousing The Kop"}, "authors": [{"uri": "bence_bocsak@rousingthekop.com", "name": "Bence Bocsak", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mundo_Deportivo", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mundo Deportivo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anfield", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anfield"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalonia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Catalonia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Catalonia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S.L._Benfica", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "S.L.

There will be a big change in the dugout, too, with Arne Slot poised to take over from Jurgen Klopp.\n\nThe Reds will have some big decisions to make over a number of stars. Mohamed Salah, Virgil van Dijk and Trent Alexander-Arnold will all be entering the final year of their deals, with questions over whether to cash in or attempt to agree extensions.\n\nNunez, who joined from Benfica in 2022, hasn't been on as many people's lips as a potential summer departure. However, Barcelona could capitalise on uncertainty on Merseyside - especially if they offload top scorer Robert Lewandowski in the coming months.\n\nAccording to The Sun, Nunez has been lined up as Barcelona look to offload high earners and rebuild their squad. One of those who could be sacrificed is Lewandowski, despite the former Bayern Munich striker indicating he doesn't feel ready to stop playing at the highest level.\n\n\"Saying goodbye [to Barcelona] is definitely out of the question for me [this summer],\" Lewandowski told SportBILD (via Goal) in April. \"I feel physically good again now. I had physical problems in the first half of the season. Things got better in 2024.\n\n\"As long as I continue to feel as good as I do now and notice in training that no one is outrunning me, I want to keep playing,\" he added. \"As of today, I say: This will continue for at least two more years. Only when I notice that I am no longer physically at top level and am in pain would I start to think. That's not the case.\"\n\nCan you see Barcelona replacing Lewandowski with Nunez? Have your say in the comments section\n\nBarcelona have a decision to make over Robert Lewandowski's future\n\nBarcelona aren't expected to make a decision on Lewandowski until the end of the season. He scored from the penalty spot in Saturday's 4-2 defeat to Girona, taking his tally for the season up to 17 in the league - the same number as Liverpool top scorer Mohamed Salah.\n\nSalah, like Nunez, could end up being offloaded to give incoming boss Slot money to spend in his first transfer window. Liverpool are likely to go into that window off the back of a third-place finish, with Manchester City and Arsenal tightening their hold on the top two spots, and former Reds star Jamie Carragher opened up on the future of both frontmen after the recent draw with West Ham.\n\n\"There is a real discussion for the new manager about what the future holds for Mo Salah - it's the first time we've asked that question,\" Carragher told Sky Sports. \"He only has a year to go on his contract.\n\n\"He's looked a shadow of himself for a lot of this season but especially since he's come back from injury. He is Liverpool's legend, superstar, one of the all-time greats. But he's been so far off it.\"\n\nCarragher also accused Nunez of having \"ground to a halt\". The 24-year-old has 11 goals and eight assists in the league this term, but has gone a month without scoring in any competition as Liverpool's season has unravelled.\n\n\"After two years there's going to be no improvement in him. This is what he is,\" Carragher said. \"He can cause trouble but he's erratic with his finishing - it's not enough to win you trophies so there's a big decision to be made on him.\"\n\nJoin our new WhatsApp communityand receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

Barcelona are reportedly keen to move for Liverpool's Darwin Nunez this summer, viewing the Uruguay international as the ideal replacement for Robert Lewandowski.\n\nThe Catalan outfit's head coach Xavi recently refused to rule out a summer departure for Lewandowski, with the 35-year-old's future the subject of much speculation.\n\nThe Poland international has scored 24 times in all competitions this season, in addition to contributing nine assists, while he has another two years left to run on his contract at Camp Nou.\n\nHowever, Barcelona are under pressure to make some sales this summer, and Lewandowski's exit would also see a large salary removed from the wage budget.\n\nAccording to The Sun, Xavi's team have identified Nunez as a target amid suggestions that the forward could leave Liverpool when this summer's transfer window opens for business.\n\n\u00a9 Reuters\n\nBarcelona 'keen to explore summer move for Darwin Nunez'\n\nThe report claims that Barcelona are confident that they will be able to meet Liverpool's asking price for Nunez despite their well-documented financial problems.\n\nThere remains speculation surrounding Mohamed Salah's future at Anfield, while the Merseyside giants are facing the monumental task of replacing inspirational head coach Jurgen Klopp this summer.\n\nFeyenoord manager Arne Slot is widely expected to replace Klopp, and it is likely to be a busy upcoming transfer window for the Reds.\n\nThere has been criticism of Nunez's finishing throughout his time at Anfield, especially this season, but the forward has managed to score 18 goals and contribute 13 assists in 51 appearances this term.\n\n\u00a9 Reuters\n\nLiverpool are believed to be open to selling the forward\n\nMeanwhile, the South American has 33 goals and 17 assists in 93 appearances for Liverpool since his arrival from Benfica in the summer of 2022.\n\nNunez is allegedly content at Liverpool and will not force a summer exit, but he is said to be attracted by the possibility of representing Barcelona.\n\nThe Catalan team had also been planning to replace their manager at the end of the season, with Xavi announcing at the end of January that he would be standing down this summer.\n\nHowever, Xavi has since changed his mind, and he will enter the 2024-25 campaign as Barcelona's head coach.\n\nBlaugrana will be looking to wrestle the La Liga title back from Real Madrid next season, with Carlo Ancelotti's side being confirmed as champions for the 2023-24 campaign on Saturday.\n\nID:542978:1false2false3false:QQ:: from db desktop :LenBod:collect5017:",

The Uruguay international has hinted that he is ready for a fresh challenge by deleting all Reds-related photographs from his Instagram account. Transfer insider Dean Jones has refused to rule out the possibility of Liverpool entertaining offers for Nunez during the summer window.\n\nLiverpool star Darwin Nunez heading through the Anfield exit door during the summer window is 'not impossible' after he has attracted interest from Barcelona, but transfer insider Dean Jones has told GIVEMESPORT that the Uruguayan will be forced to remain in his current surroundings if Mohamed Salah quits.\n\nThe Reds are preparing for plenty of changes ahead of the 2024/25 campaign getting underway, with boss Jurgen Klopp set to step down from his position following the clash with Wolverhampton Wanderers on the final day of the season due to running out of energy during a hugely successful spell at the helm.\n\nArne Slot is on course to replace the former Borussia Dortmund chief, thanks to Liverpool agreeing a compensation package worth up to \u00a39.4million with Eredivisie side Feyenoord, and the Dutchman will be given the opportunity to freshen up the squad he inherits when he arrives on Merseyside.\n\nNunez Identified as Potential Recruit for Barcelona\n\nNunez has been pinpointed as a target for Barcelona after the La Liga heavyweights have set their sights on overseeing a mass clear-out in the aftermath of missing out on bagging the title at the hands of arch-rivals Real Madrid, according to The Sun, meaning he could follow Klopp in walking away from Liverpool in the coming weeks.\n\nThe report suggests that Robert Lewandowski is in danger of being offloaded as he is on a contract which allows him to pocket close to \u00a3450,000-per-week and head coach Xavi has been informed that he will need to slash his side's salary cap to just over \u00a3174million, resulting in the Reds' marksman working his way onto the Blaugrana's radar as a potential replacement.\n\nDarwin Nunez's statistical averages per 90 minutes this season compared to Robert Lewandowski\n\nDarwin Nunez\n\nRobert Lewandowski\n\nShots on target percentage\n\n42.9\n\n39.8\n\nShots\n\n4.71\n\n3.03\n\nShot-creating actions\n\n3.54\n\n2.12\n\nExpected goals\n\n0.72\n\n0.63\n\nGoals\n\n0.49\n\n0.62\n\nAssists\n\n0.36\n\n0.29\n\nStatistics correct as of 06/05/2024\n\nLiverpool forked out \u00a385million to convince Primeira Liga giants Benfica to sanction Nunez's exit from the Portuguese capital in June 2022, resulting in him becoming the most expensive acquisition in the club's history, but it remains to be seen whether he will be at the forefront of the incoming Slot's plans.\n\nGIVEMESPORT Key Statistic: Darwin Nunez was limited to just 16 minutes of action as Liverpool sealed a 4-2 win over Tottenham Hotspur on Sunday, which is his joint-fourth lowest amount of time on the pitch in a Premier League clash this season\n\nDean Jones - Nunez Will Not be Allowed to Quit at Same Time as Salah\n\nAlthough Jones has refused to rule out the possibility of Nunez embarking on a fresh challenge during the summer, he believes that a switch to Barcelona may not be on the cards as Lewandowski is keen to remain with his current employers despite their financial difficulties meaning they are open to his departure.\n\nThe respected journalist feels that Klopp pushing to land the 24-year-old could backfire when the German tactician leaves the dugout, but Fenway Sports Group will stop short of allowing him to move onto pastures new if talisman Salah is tempted away from the Premier League high-flyers.\n\nJones told GIVEMESPORT:\n\n\"It's not really possible to know yet whether Darwin Nunez could actually be on the move before next season, but it is not impossible.\n\n\"The link to Barcelona seems a bit of a stretch, especially given Robert Lewandowski wants to stay, but I found it interesting recently that there were stories from very well-placed Liverpool reporters about how he was a Jurgen Klopp signing, not a club signing. It was a bit of a warning, in my eyes.\n\n\"I'm sure that a lot will be dependant on whether Mohamed Salah stays. I can't imagine both players leaving at the same time as Klopp, but it is going to be a storyline that crops up again at the end of the season, for sure.\"\n\nRelated Liverpool Could Trigger \u00a338m Salah Replacement's release clause The Reds could be in the market for a winger this summer Nunez Appears to Hint at Wanting Summer Move\n\nNunez has fuelled speculation that he is ready to seal his exit after deleting all Liverpool-related photographs from his Instagram account, according to MailOnline, with family pictures and snaps of him featuring for Uruguay and previous employers Benfica being the majority that remain.\n\nBut the Reds will go into the summer transfer window in a strong negotiating position ahead of Barcelona and other suitors potentially attempting to pounce as he still has four years remaining on a contract worth \u00a3140,000-per-week, meaning they can set lofty demands for his services.\n\nAll statistics according to FBref and WhoScored", "source": {"uri": "givemesport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GiveMeSport"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arne_Slot", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Arne Slot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Lewandowski", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Robert Lewandowski"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anfield", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Anfield"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darwin,_Northern_Territory", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Darwin, Northern Territory"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Darwin, Northern Territory"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohamed_Salah", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mohamed Salah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J\u00fcrgen_Klopp", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "J\u00fcrgen Klopp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Liga", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "La Liga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uruguay_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Uruguay national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eredivisie", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eredivisie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolverhampton_Wanderers_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borussia_Dortmund", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Borussia Dortmund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assist (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Madrid_CF", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Real Madrid CF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_F.C.\u2013Manchester_United_F.C._rivalry", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool F.C.\u2013Manchester United F.C. rivalry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xavi", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Xavi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feyenoord", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Feyenoord"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salary_cap", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Salary cap"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primeira_Liga", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Primeira Liga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S.L._Benfica", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "S.L.

potential long-term replacement for Robert Lewandowski, who has been linked with a move to the Saudi Pro League and MLS this summer.\n\nTuesday afternoon saw further speculation surrounding Nunez's future after the Liverpool star was pictured alongside Barcelona centre-back and international team-mate Ronald Araujo in an Instagram story.\n\nNunez has scored 33 goals in 94 games for the Reds

His social media activity has thrown his future with the Reds even further into doubt after inconsistent performances in front of goal. Liverpool may look to sign a new elite striker to bolster their title ambitions if Nunez is moved on in the summer.\n\nDarwin Nunez's latest social media activity suggests it could be time for the Uruguayan forward and Liverpool to part ways at the end of the season. The striker has had an up-and-down time at Anfield since joining from Benfica in 2022, and it looks like his time at the club could be coming to an end.\n\nIt was noticed just hours after Liverpool defeated Tottenham 4-2 at Anfield that Nunez had deleted all Instagram posts related to the club from the current campaign. His account now only has a picture from the day he signed for the Reds, as well as many from his Benfica days and international duty with Uruguay.\n\nThere have been suggestions in recent weeks that the English giants could look to cut their losses on the 24-year-old after his wasteful finishing has cost them in big moments during their campaign. The latest development of Nunez removing almost all mentions of his club from his Instagram could prove it's now time for him to move on, to everyone's benefit. Below are some of the reasons it may be in everyone's interest to find a proactive solution.\n\nDarwin Nunez Statistics (2023-24)\n\nCompetition\n\nGames\n\nGoals\n\nAssists\n\nPremier League\n\n34\n\n11\n\n8\n\nEuropa League\n\n10\n\n5\n\n1\n\nEFL Cup\n\n5\n\n1\n\n3\n\nFA Cup\n\n3\n\n1\n\n1\n\nNunez Appears Low on Confidence His performance levels have dropped significantly\n\nIn the aforementioned victory against Tottenham, Nunez was brought on as a second-half substitute to replace Luis Diaz. However, the forward failed to convert his big chance as he was set free by Mohamed Salah before firing his shot straight at the onrushing goalkeeper. Unfortunately for Nunez, this sums up his career in the Premier League so far.\n\nGIVEMESPORT Key Statistic: Darwin Nunez has a goal-per-game ratio of 0.32 in the 2023-24 Premier League campaign.\n\nWhile he's improved his all-round game to become extremely involved in matches, his lack of a clinical edge has made some question his long-term ability to lead the line for one of the top teams in the country. There was a spell earlier in the season where Nunez looked to be full of confidence and playing really well, but since then, his confidence looks to have dropped significantly. A return of more than 30 goal contributions is impressive on the face of it, but there could have been so many more goals than the 18 he has managed at the time of writing.\n\nRelated 10 Players With Worst Big-Chance Conversion Rates in Europe in 23/24 From the likes of Erling Haaland to Vinicius Jr, there are some leading names that have missed big chances aplenty this season. A New Manager Signals a Fresh Start Arne Slot could prefer Cody Gakpo\n\nArne Slot looks set to be the next permanent boss at Anfield with Jurgen Klopp departing at the end of the season after nine years in charge. It was reported in April that the German manager was the biggest driving force behind the signing of Nunez from Benfica and some within the club were unsure of the deal.\n\nWith Klopp moving on comes uncertainty for the Uruguay international. Michael Edwards has returned to lead the football operations at the club and could show a ruthless edge by moving the striker on if a suitable offer arrives in the summer. Slot's pending appointment could also spell danger for Nunez's Merseyside career, as the Dutch boss could prefer compatriot Cody Gakpo as his first-choice centre-forward.\n\nRelated How Liverpool Could Line Up Under Arne Slot The Feyenoord manager is in talks to take over from Jurgen Klopp and this is how his side could line up next season Supporters Losing Patience With Forward Jamie Carragher has questioned Nunez's future\n\nLiverpool supporters have started to voice their frustration at Nunez's inconsistency in front of goal in recent weeks. The fan base has previously shown unconditional support for their Uruguayan forward, but that patience appears to now be running thin.\n\nEven Jamie Carragher has weighed in on the debate as the Sky Sports pundit questioned whether the striker's future lay at Anfield or elsewhere after the Reds were beaten in the Merseyside derby. The ex-Liverpool defender said:\n\n\"After two years there's going to be no improvement in him. This is what he is. He can cause trouble but he's erratic with his finishing - it's not enough to win you trophies so there's a big decision to be made on him.\"\n\nCarragher is a Liverpool fan at heart, and he was simply echoing the sentiments of other supporters. However, with the recent events of Nunez deleting Liverpool posts from his social media account, the forward needs to feel support from everyone at the club until that decision on his future is made. View a post below that suggests the same.\n\nLiverpool Need an Elite Striker The Reds have title ambitions\n\nHad there been a clinical finisher leading the line for the Reds in the 2023-24 campaign, there's every chance they could have become champions. Liverpool's title charge has stuttered after some poor results due to a lack of a good goalscorer. Nunez has missed 27 big chances in the Premier League season, which hasn't helped Klopp's side's chances.\n\nShould all ties be cut between the club and the player in the summer transfer window, it's likely Edwards and Richard Hughes will be in the market to bring in a deadly forward that can propel the Reds to a higher level in the 2024/25 season.\n\nRelated 7 Potential Darwin Nunez Replacements at Liverpool Darwin Nunez's poor form in front of goal could force Liverpool into the transfer market to sign one of these seven strikers in the summer.\n\nAll statistics in this article are courtesy of Transfermarkt and the Premier League (Correct as of 06/05/2024)", "source": {"uri": "givemesport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GiveMeSport"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uruguay_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Uruguay national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anfield", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Anfield"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S.L._Benfica", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "S.L.

Liverpool striker Darwin Nunez appears to have removed nearly all traces of the club from his Instagram account amid rumours of a possible exit from Anfield this summer.\n\nThe Uruguay international has been praised for bringing unpredictability and chaos to the Reds' attack since joining from Benfica in 2022, but his low big-chance conversion rate has been criticised heavily.\n\nNunez has still managed a respectable 18 goals and 13 assists from 52 matches this term, but he has been guilty of alarming wastefulness in front of goal and has lost his place in Jurgen Klopp's starting lineup in recent weeks.\n\nThe former Benfica striker is on a six-game scoring drought in the Premier League and has started just one of the Reds' last four top-flight contests, completing the full 90 in their 2-0 loss to Everton.\n\nNunez has been forced to accept late cameos in clashes with Fulham, West Ham United and Tottenham Hotspur, and in the latter match, he came out second best in a late one-on-one with Guglielmo Vicario.\n\n\u00a9 Reuters\n\nNunez removes Liverpool posts from Instagram\n\nNunez's wasted opportunity at the weekend took him up to 27 big chances missed in the current Premier League season - second only to Erling Haaland's 32 - while an offside offence also denied Mohamed Salah his second in injury time.\n\nNo player has been caught offside more times than the 24-year-old (32), and he was allegedly the target of online abuse after his forgettable 15 minutes in Sunday's 4-2 win over Spurs.\n\nThe morning after the beating of Tottenham, Liverpool fans noticed that Nunez had deleted a plethora of Liverpool-related photos from his Instagram account, where his most recent posts are either Uruguay or family-based.\n\nThe only image from his time at Liverpool still up is from when he first joined the Reds in 2022, although his display picture still features his name and number on the back of a Liverpool jersey.\n\nFurthermore, the South American still has the Liverpool account tagged in his bio, but his social media activity has only fuelled speculation over a possible departure amid claims that Barcelona want him to replace Robert Lewandowski this summer.\n\nShould Liverpool fans be reading into Nunez's activity?\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\nA post shared by Darwin Nu\u00f1ez Ribeiro (@darwin_n9)\n\nPlayers removing traces of a club from their online accounts can sometimes be a tell-tale sign that a transfer is imminent, and the timing of Nunez's deletions alongside the Barcelona links have naturally sent tongues wagging.\n\nHowever, the explanation for Nunez's activity may not be transfer-related at all, as the purported online abuse that the striker experienced after the weekend's game would undoubtedly have taken its toll.\n\nFrom Liverpool's side, Nunez still has four years left to run on his Anfield contract, and the Reds are not believed to be actively trying to sell the Uruguay international, who should be given the chance to prove himself under new boss Arne Slot.\n\nThe 24-year-old also has the Copa America to look ahead to when the domestic season is over, and a strong tournament in Uruguayan colours could be the catalyst for improved fortunes in a Liverpool shirt for 2024-25.\n\nID:543017:1false2false3false:QQ:: from db desktop :LenBod:collect11642:", "source": {"uri": "sportsmole.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Mole"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ben_knapton@sportsmole.co.uk", "name": "Ben Knapton", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darwin,_Northern_Territory", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Darwin, Northern Territory"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Darwin, Northern Territory"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S.L._Benfica", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "S.L.

But tellingly, South American sources insist the idea of playing for the Spanish giants does appeal to him.\n\nBarcelona tried to sign him from Almeria three years ago and thought they had a deal in the bag before Benfica nipped in to sign him.\n\nNunez was a sensation in Portugal and has become a huge hit with fans since moving to Merseyside in 2022.\n\nBut despite scoring 23 goals this term, he has gone seven games without finding the net -- and no player in Europe's top five leagues has missed more big chances.\n\nHe racked up an unwanted list of missed sitters against Luton, Manchester United and Crystal Palace.\n\nNunez was dubbed the Uruguayan Andy Carroll, the forward who scored just 11 goals in two years for Liverpool, by cruel critics -- a year after Kop legend Jamie Carragher compared him to Alan Shearer due to the ferocious way he strikes the ball.\n\nWith everyone in a Reds shirt keen to show incoming boss Slot they should be part of his plans -- home to Tottenham today is the latest chance -- Nunez is under a brighter spotlight than most.\n\nWhile some in England question his resolve, 6,600 miles away in hometown Artigas those who know him best have no doubt who will have the last laugh.\n\nNunez has won greater battles, both physical and mental.\n\nFirst with homesickness when he left San Miguel, the amateur club where he cut his teeth and moved 430 miles to join Penarol, Uruguay's biggest club.\n\nBeing away from parents Bibiano and Silvia was bad enough but when brother Junior -- who was also at Penarol -- quit to find work and support the family, suddenly he was alone.\n\nNunez was so heartbroken he nearly packed it all in then -- and came even closer when a cruciate knee injury sidelined him for a year.\n\nIf it had not been for his elder sibling and support from his San Miguel pals, he may have done.\n\nSo once he was convinced to stay, Nunez vowed nothing would stop him.\n\nFew know Nunez better than Daniel Suarez, the San Miguel president and close pal who lifted the lid on those dark early days.\n\nSuarez revealed: \"Junior was playing at Penarol when Darwin arrived but then returned to Artigas because he was looking for a job.\n\n\"It was really hard as his brother was such a strong presence for him.\n\n\"He was on his own in Montevideo and it was a difficult time, missing his parents. Then more bad luck struck when he had a cruciate knee injury. That's when frustration really hit.\n\n\"He wanted to go home and retire from football at 16. He was really down.\n\n\"Junior was key in convincing him to fight back and even moved back to Montevideo to help him to adapt. And of course his parents visited regularly.\n\n\"Everybody at the San Miguel club was also sending messages to lift Darwin's morale.\n\n\"Once he made the decision, he exploded as a player and after he made his Penarol debut at 17, the rest is history.\"", "source": {"uri": "thesun.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Sun"}, "authors": [{"uri": "phil_thomas@thesun.co.uk", "name": "Phil Thomas", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camp_Nou", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Camp Nou"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Lewandowski", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Robert Lewandowski"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anfield", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Anfield"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S.L._Benfica", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "S.L.

Either way he needs to grow up,' said one Liverpool fan on X in response to Nunez walking off.\n\n'Just shows wat an emotional guy he is and this is the problem when he's on the pitch .

And, on Tuesday, he shared a story from international team-mate Araujo showing the pair together with the caption 'Mi hermano' ('My brother').\n\nA Barcelona move has been floated for the former Benfica striker, who has 11 league goals for Liverpool this term. Any move might depend on what happens with Robert Lewandowski, who has himself been linked with a summer move away from Catalunya.\n\nLiverpool remain unlikely to cash in on Nunez, after signing him for what could become a club record fee with add-ons. That hasn't stopped plenty of fans from speculating, though.\n\n\"Swap deal [Vitor] Roque to Liverpool Darwin to Barcelona who says no?\" one Barcelona fan asked on social media. \"Nunez to Barca here we go,\" said another.\n\nOthers weren't so sure, though. \"That's his international friend. All the players is off a few days,\" wrote one, indicating they felt it was nothing more than two good friends meeting up.\n\n\"After [Luis] Suarez telling him to keep his head up + this. Think it's more than likely he's not in a great headspace rather than looking to move to Barca tbh,\" another suggested.\n\nWill Darwin Nunez leave Liverpool this summer? Have your say in the comments section\n\nNunez has come in for criticism in recent weeks after losing his scoring touch. The 24-year-old has gone eight games without finding the net, with former Liverpool defender Jamie Carragher laying into the frontman after April's defeat in the Merseyside Derby.\n\n\"I think there is a question to ask [about selling him[,\" Carragher said. \"You want him to do well because there is so much that you like because he gives everything, he runs and causes trouble and gets the odd goal and gets an assist.\n\n\"But after two years when Liverpool this season are going to the title and those big games, you need your man to score away at Old Trafford, away at Goodison, in the European game at Atalanta. There is no time to waste, this is not October or November. This is the business end\n\n\"In terms of Nunez and where the club go forward now, we have all been in squads where someone comes in and maybe you talk about the first year and maybe say, okay he's getting up to speed with and he's improving, and it looked like he was at the start of the season. But it has ground to a halt.\n\n\"You are looking at it now and after two years, I don't think there is going to be a massive improvement in him. What we have seen in the last two years is what he is.\n\n\"He can cause trouble, he can be erratic with his finishing. I don't think it is going to be enough to win you the biggest trophies so I think there is a big decision to be made on him in the summer.\"\n\nDON'T SCRAP REPLAYS!

Although chances continue to be created with regularity, opportunities have been frequently squandered.\n\nNunez has been particularly guilty of losing his way in the final third, scoring just one Premier League goal since March 10 and going 13 appearances in all competitions having netted just twice.\n\n\u00a9 Reuters\n\nLiverpool to keep faith in Nunez\n\nAs a result, stronger criticism has gone the way of the Uruguay international, which has led to the forward deleting any photos associated to Liverpool on his official Instagram page.\n\nOn X, formerly known as Twitter, a supporter account 'Watch LFC' also revealed that Nunez had blocked them, despite seemingly offering support to the 24-year-old.\n\nNevertheless, according to the Daily Mail, Liverpool do not intend to entertain offers for Nunez during the summer transfer window.\n\nThe report suggests that the Merseyside giants plan to keep faith in the attacker, who will be plying his trade under a different manager next season should he remain at Anfield.\n\nFurthermore, it is noted that Liverpool are aware that they are not in a position to generate a fee for Nunez that would see them recoup the fee, that could rise to \u00a385m, that they shelled out for the player in 2022.\n\n\u00a9 Reuters\n\nHas Nunez's contribution really been that bad?\n\nRegular watchers of Liverpool will highlight without hesitation why they have grown frustrated with Nunez's form in the final third, the belief being that they would be far closer to Arsenal and Manchester City had he converted more opportunities.\n\nThat said, this is still a player that has contributed 11 goals and eight assists in the Premier League this season, a further seven goals and five assists coming in other competitions.\n\nA return of 20 goals and 11 assists from 63 Premier League appearances is also respectable enough, yet the disappointment stems from what could have been given that Nunez often gets himself into the right positions.\n\nIn terms of shots taken, Nunez has had 106 efforts in this season's Premier League. Only Erling Haaland, who has 25 goals, has had more with 112 attempts.\n\nID:543068:1false2false3false:QQ:: from db desktop :LenBod:collect4774:", "source": {"uri": "sportsmole.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Mole"}, "authors": [{"uri": "darren_plant@sportsmole.co.uk", "name": "Darren Plant", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer_window", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Transfer window"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J\u00fcrgen_Klopp", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "J\u00fcrgen Klopp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tottenham_Hotspur_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tottenham Hotspur F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uruguay_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Uruguay national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merseyside", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Merseyside"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Merseyside"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erling_Haaland", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Erling Haaland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assist (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anfield", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anfield"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsenal_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arsenal F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manchester City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Work-Life_Balance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Work-Life Balance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Skittles", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Skittles", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cue_Sports/Pool", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cue Sports/Pool", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://sm.imgix.net/24/11/mohamed-salah-darwin-nunez.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9540390", "eventUri": "eng-9540390", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-03-10", "textStart": 694, "textEnd": 702}], "sentiment": -0.02745098039215688, "wgt": 186, "relevance": 1}

Despite securing a move to the English Premier League big hitters in an \u00a385million deal, Nunez has struggled to consistently deliver on the pitch. His inconsistent performances have drawn criticism, particularly regarding his finishing skills. Although he has netted 33 goals for Jurgen Klopp's team, he has missed crucial opportunities in several key matches this season.\n\nWith a managerial change on the horizon, speculation about Nunez's future at the club is rife. Adding fuel to the fire, the 24-year-old has removed all photos of himself in Liverpool kit from his Instagram account, leaving only family photos and images from his time with Benfica and the Uruguayan national team. However, his profile picture remains one of him in Liverpool colours, reports the Mirror.\n\nWhile Nunez has not publicly expressed any intention to leave Liverpool, the incoming manager, rumoured to be Arne Slot, will likely reassess the squad. Several high-profile players, including Mohamed Salah, are also set to have their futures at the club reviewed. Nunez and Salah are among several strikers currently at Anfield, including Diogo Jota, Luis Diaz and Cody Gakpo, who have all shown their potential.\n\nHowever, Jamie Carragher recently questioned whether it's time for his old club to seek new attacking options. Speaking on Sky Sports, he said: \"I think there is a question to ask. You want him to do well because there is so much that you like because he gives everything, he runs and causes trouble and gets the odd goal and gets an assist. But after two years when Liverpool this season are going to the title and those big games, you need your man to score away at Old Trafford, away at Goodison, in the European game at Atalanta. There is no time to waste, this is not October or November.

It marked the end of a miserable few minutes for the striker, and summed up both his own frustrations and those of Anfield's supporters.\n\nIn the following minute, he was released in behind again. This time he executed the pass for Salah to convert, only to be flagged offside himself -- a trait that has crept into his game and has increased criticism. Nunez removed the white tape on his right wrist and threw it to the ground.\n\nHis next action was to attempt to dribble past Pedro Porro near his own penalty area. He got the ball stuck under his feet, but recovered to win a foul and relieve the pressure eventually.\n\nLiverpool had one more counter-attack and Nunez was released in behind again. Goalkeeper Guglielmo Vicario committed himself so the striker had the simple option of taking it around the goalkeeper on the edge of his box. Instead, Nunez saw his first-time shot saved, and off came the white tape on his left wrist. The whole episode felt like a literal unravelling of Nunez's confidence.\n\nThose four minutes were a showcase of Nunez's extremes, both good and bad. However, in the context of the last month, and with Nunez having only scored once in his last 11 games -- against Sheffield United, when he charged down goalkeeper Ivo Grbic's kick -- patience has waned.\n\nThe 'Nunez, Nunez, Nunez' chant that has reverberated around Anfield on countless occasions, even when he has missed a chance or made a poor decision, was conspicuous by its absence on Sunday.\n\nNunez himself seems to have lost some of his fizz. Assistant manager Pep Lijnders twice spoke to him individually as he was getting changed ahead of coming on, but when he did enter the field, he did so with markedly little enthusiasm.\n\nThis may have been down to the scoreline -- Liverpool were 4-1 up and comfortable -- but it hardly helped his cause. Shortly after coming on, Alisson sent a long kick downfield but Nunez was unable to contest it as he was standing offside.\n\nHe did liven up, especially after Spurs made it 4-2 and the game became more of a contest. From a starting position on the left flank, he charged down a lofted pass...\n\nOn one occasion, he charged down three Tottenham players in an attempt to win the ball back for his team but that felt the exception rather than the rule.\n\nTo compound his problems, Nunez then whipped up a post-match storm by deleting all Liverpool-associated posts from his Instagram account. It can be a ploy used by professional athletes, usually as a way of signalling frustration without having to say anything, but it felt unnecessary and raised more questions over his future as Liverpool prepare for the arrival of new manager Arne Slot.\n\nNunez, having looked so promising earlier this year, is ending the season back where he was a year ago. Then, he frequently found himself on the bench as Liverpool's fifth strike option, with Gakpo and Diogo Jota ahead of him in the queue to start as the No 9.\n\nJota is currently injured but, while Nunez has laboured, Gakpo has seized his chance.\n\nRewind a few weeks, and the Netherlands international was in a similar position to Nunez now. Gakpo was struggling for rhythm and form after a handful of disappointing substitute performances, most notably the FA Cup quarter-final defeat to Manchester United.\n\nBut he has answered any doubts emphatically and is ending his first full campaign on Merseyside with a flourish. A goal and an assist on Sunday capped an excellent performance that showcased his attributes as both the central striker and left winger as he frequently switched positions with Luis Diaz.\n\nGakpo and Nunez are very different players, operating at different speeds. Nunez is often an emotional, unpredictable whirlwind while Gakpo exudes calmness -- sometimes too much -- in everything he does.\n\nIt is too easy to say that Gakpo will be an ideal player for Slot because the pair are Dutch, but the 24-year-old does possess a versatility and skill set that should make him a valuable asset. Based on Slot's 4-2-3-1 set-up at Feyenoord, Gakpo's profile suits the No 10, No 9 and wide roles.\n\nIt was noticeable that when Nunez came on against Spurs, Gakpo remained as the No 9 and his team-mate went onto the left flank. It proved effective, given the chances Jurgen Klopp's side were able to create on the break despite Liverpool's loss of control.\n\nOn another afternoon, Nunez could have ended the day with a goal and an assist and perceptions would have shifted again. Instead, the questions are heightened and it feels like the point where Liverpool have to stick or twist with him.\n\nNunez may not be the elite, consistent striker Liverpool thought they were signing from Benfica. Neither is he anywhere near as bad as some suggest. Had his price tag (an initial \u00a364million) been more in Gakpo's ballpark (an initial \u00a337million) attitudes would doubtless be softer.\n\nWhat Nunez does next will reveal plenty.

Nunez may be struggling at Liverpool right now.\n\nBut he's shown enough in the last few seasons to get Liverpool fans excited about the future.\n\nNunez has the potential to be a top class forward, and follow in Suarez's shoes.

His erratic nature shone through, with the Uruguayan being lively in the final third, but ultimately being wasteful when it mattered.\n\nHis game was pretty much summed up by what he did at the full-time whistle. According to The Athletic, Nunez went straight down the tunnel and into the dressing room after the game had finished.\n\nAfter the game, Nunez also appeared to delete all his Liverpool related posts on Instagram.\n\nWhat his reasoning behind that is moot at this point. He has come under a lot of fire recently by a section of the club's supporters on social media. So, it might have been a way to protect himself from negative and abusive comments.\n\nBut we cannot be sure for certain. It could also be a sign of frustration.", "source": {"uri": "rousingthekop.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Rousing The Kop"}, "authors": [{"uri": "bence_bocsak@rousingthekop.com", "name": "Bence Bocsak", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tottenham_Hotspur_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tottenham Hotspur F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anfield", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anfield"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S.L._Benfica", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "S.L.

Nunez's inconsistency, missed chances, and lack of goals indicate a failed transfer so far. Uncertainty looms over Nunez's future; though a potential move to Barcelona has been speculated.\n\nDarwin Nunez's recent form for Liverpool has not been ideal with the striker missing chances galore and going missing in games on a regular basis for the Anfield club - and further fuel has been added to the fire over the Uruguayan's future on Merseyside with the talisman deleting all of his Liverpool-centric posts on Instagram.\n\nNunez came with a lot of hype after his club-record move from Benfica in 2022, and a decent start to life at Anfield gave Liverpool fans hope that he would be the man to fire them to Premier League glory amid the loss of Roberto Firmino later that season. But for all of the promise and potential that Nunez shows in terms of his movement, pace and physicality, he's become known for his inconsistency and ability to miss easy chances, taking flak from many in the game such as pundits and fans for his knack of passing up gilt-edged situations.\n\nNunez has scored just one goal in his previous nine Premier League games for the Reds, contributing massively to their title collapse with missed chances against Everton, Crystal Palace and more - and even his goal was somewhat fortunate as he charged down Sheffield United goalkeeper Ivo Grbic, with his clearance cannoning into the livewire forward. But his future now seems incredibly unknown with the talisman deleting anything Liverpool-based on his Instagram.\n\nDarwin Nunez's Instagram Antics Nunez appears to be distancing himself from Liverpool\n\nA post on X (formerly Twitter) from Anfield Sector showed a screenshot of Nunez's Instagram, with most of his pictures showing him in a Uruguay shirt or with his family - though none of Liverpool showed on the screenshot.\n\nUpon further inspection of his page, there are no photos posted showing the striker in a Liverpool shirt at all - with the only team other than Uruguay to feature prominently being Benfica, who he joined Liverpool from two years ago.\n\nPlayers sometimes delete their social media accounts temporarily to take a break from being online, though with Nunez deleting all of his Liverpool posts and keeping the ones of his time with Uruguay, Benfica and even former club Almeria from back in 2020, it doesn't bode well for the future.\n\nLiverpool and Klopp Disagreed Over Nunez Deal\n\nNunez has only started 22 games in the Premier League and whilst he endured somewhat of a purple patch at the turn of the new year, his long periods of games without goals - with one goal in 12 Premier League games from October until Boxing Day and his current run of poor form - suggests that this is a transfer that simply hasn't worked out yet.\n\nTimes journalist Paul Joyce recently revealed that Klopp and the Liverpool board actually disagreed over the signing of the South American, with the latter preferring to get Christopher Nkunku from RB Leipzig instead.\n\nIt begs the question as to who the \u00a3140,000-a-week forward could potentially join next, though that is largely yet to be seen. Barcelona have been linked with a move for his services to replace talisman Robert Lewandowski, with the Polish poacher set to turn 36 at the start of the campaign - and the Blaugrana may need a backup to come in and replace him.\n\nBut a glut of poor performances, a hefty price-tag and a striker market that is clad with other options means that Liverpool may well have to hope it's a third season lucky for Nunez when they begin next season under Arne Slot.\n\nRelated Darwin Nunez's Instagram Activity Suggests Liverpool Exit Will Benefit All Darwin Nunez's latest social media activity indicates it could be the right time for Liverpool to part ways with the Uruguay international.", "source": {"uri": "givemesport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GiveMeSport"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anfield", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Anfield"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darwin,_Northern_Territory", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Darwin, Northern Territory"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Darwin, Northern Territory"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S.L._Benfica", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "S.L.

I think he has more upside than downside going forward - 31 goal involvements this season is, well, pretty decent, right?! - and I think he has the mentality to handle both the change of manager and the criticism that has come his way in recent weeks. He misses too many chances, I know, and there are times when he has to be tidier, smarter and more switched on within games.\"\n\nHe added: \"But were Liverpool to look to sell, then I would expect considerable interest.

The Uruguayan forward's actions have ignited speculation about his future at Anfield, prompting fans and pundits alike to ponder the implications of his latest move.\n\nThe catalyst for the speculation came in the form of Nunez's decision to remove all Liverpool-related images from his Instagram profile. While his profile picture still features the iconic red Liverpool shirt, all other traces of his time at Anfield have been conspicuously erased. Instead, his Instagram feed now only showcases images of him representing Benfica, his former club, as well as the Uruguayan national team.\n\nNunez's tenure at Liverpool commenced in the summer of 2022 when he completed a high-profile transfer to Anfield for a staggering fee of \u00a385 million ($107m). Since his arrival, the Uruguayan striker has made a significant impact, tallying an impressive 33 goals in 94 appearances for the Reds. However, despite his goal-scoring prowess, Nunez has occasionally come under scrutiny for his missed opportunities, leading to speculation about his long-term future with the club.\n\nAmid mounting speculation about Nunez's potential departure, La Liga giants Barcelona have emerged as a rumored destination. With Barcelona reportedly in search of a successor for prolific striker Robert Lewandowski, Nunez has been identified as a prime candidate to fill the void. The prospect of Nunez donning the iconic Blaugrana colors has further fueled speculation about his future in the upcoming transfer window.\n\nDespite the swirling transfer rumors, Nunez remains under contract with Liverpool for the next four years, with his current deal set to expire in 2028. However, reports suggest that Nunez harbors ambitions of eventually joining Barcelona, raising questions about his commitment to Liverpool in the long term. As fans eagerly await clarity on Nunez's future, the uncertainty surrounding his next move continues to captivate football enthusiasts worldwide.\n\nWhat lies ahead for Darwin Nunez\n\nAs Nunez navigates the complexities of his professional career, the coming months are poised to offer insights into his aspirations and intentions. While he remains contractually bound to Liverpool for the foreseeable future, the allure of joining Barcelona looms large in the background.

But on the flip side, they bring with them an infectious energy, and that's something that the Anfield crowd appreciates.\n\nFor Nunez, his first two years at Liverpool have been difficult.

Nunez is currently on 11 league goals in his second season as well and has 18 in all competitions.\n\nIn his third and fourth season at the club, Suarez scored 23 goals and then 31 goals.

In his second season, just like Nunez, he was only 24-years-old.\n\nBut he grew as a player, and when Brendan Rodgers arrived in his third season at the club, Suarez started to really thrive under his attacking style of football.\n\nThere will be a similar change at Liverpool this summer with Arne Slot coming in, and Nunez has everything to follow in Suarez's footsteps.

His display picture still has him in a Liverpool kit\n\nDarwin Nunez has left fans perplexed after he deleted all Liverpool-related content on his Instagram account, following an impressive victory by the Reds over Tottenham Hotspur on Sunday (May 5).\n\nLiverpool returned to winning ways in the Premier League, having gone on a hara-kiri spree in recent weeks that saw them lose ground in the title race. However, the team, freshened up after a relatively long break, played Spurs out of the park and managed to grab a 4-2 win in front of a packed Anfield crowd.\n\nThe only blemish remained Nunez's after-match deleting spree on Instagram where all photos and videos related to the club no longer appear. The only reference to the club remains on his profile bio, in which Nunez has tagged both Liverpool FC and the Uruguay national team. His display picture still has him in a Liverpool kit.\n\nFans have speculated that the heavy criticism levelled by certain sections of the online fanbase against Nunez had finally got to him.\n\n\"Online abuse or direct criticism is not acceptable, no matter what,\" said one user, while another commented: \"Back your players, even on a rough patch. Even on a human level, we all struggle mentally and need support. You'll Never Walk Alone, Darwin Nunez.\"\n\nThe pacy forward is coming to the end of his second year on the Merseyside and despite 18 goals and 13 assists in 53 games, the no. 9 is yet to completely win over the fans.\n\nWhile the Uruguayan has shown marked improvement from his first season on the Merseyside, his consistency has still left a lot to be desired. Nunez leads the chart in the most number of big chances missed in the league, which on the flip side, shows that he is a chance magnet - continuously generating scoring opportunities for himself and the team.\n\nAlso read | 'I'm not sure...': Jurgen Klopp provides update on his spat with Liverpool forward Mo Salah\n\nThe lack of teeth shown by the Liverpool forward line in the month of April was perhaps the reason why the team went from challenging for a quadruple to only settling for the Carabao Cup in manager Jurgen Klopp's final season.\n\nThe speculations around Nunez's future at Liverpool comes a week after Klopp and Mohamed Salah had a very public touchline spat during the match against West Ham United at the London Stadium.

He eventually headed to Liverpool in a deal worth \u00a385million but hasn't shown his quality regularly enough.\n\nNunez's inconsistency has been held against him with the striker's finishing becoming a major concern. He's scored 33 times for Jurgen Klopp's side but has fluffed his lines in numerous big games this term and, with a change of manager incoming, there is talk of a move away.\n\nThe 24-year-old has been the subject of criticism and has only aided the rumour mill by removing all pictures of himself playing for Liverpool on his Instagram. All that remains are family pictures and images of the striker playing for Benfica and Uruguay, although his profile picture is a snap of him playing in Liverpool colours.\n\nNunez has never been vocal about any desire to leave Merseyside but the new man in the dugout, expected to be Arne Slot, is likely to review his squad options and go from there. A number of major names at Liverpool, including Mohamed Salah, are due to have their futures reviewed.\n\nNunez and Salah are two of a number of strikers of the books at Anfield. Diogo Jota has regularly delivered when fit whilst Luis Diaz and Cody Gakpo have shown in flashes that they can produce.\n\nThe Uruguayan's all round game has often been hailed but Jamie Carragher recently questioned whether it is time to seek a new source of firepower. He said on Sky Sports: \"I think there is a question to ask. You want him to do well because there is so much that you like because he gives everything, he runs and causes trouble and gets the odd goal and gets an assist.\n\nThe forward's Instagram doesn't feature any Liverpool-related content The forward's future is the subject of speculation\n\n\"But after two years when Liverpool this season are going to the title and those big games, you need your man to score away at Old Trafford, away at Goodison, in the European game at Atalanta. There is no time to waste, this is not October or November. This is the business end.\n\n\"In terms of Nunez and where the club go forward now, we have all been in squads where someone comes in and maybe you talk about the first year and maybe say, okay he's getting up to speed with and he's improving, and it looked like he was at the start of the season.

Listen to the It's All Kicking Off! podcast\n\nAt Old Trafford they referred to it as 'unlocking' Paul Pogba. After winning a continental scrum to complete the big-money signing of the midfielder, Manchester United spent six seasons trying to mine his elite natural talent.\n\nWhen returning to Manchester from his first stint at Juventus, he was Europe's most wanted. But like so many before him at that decaying club, he ended up on the scrap heap. He showed off his supreme skills in glimpses, most notably for France, but overall was a seismic flop.\n\nPogba could have been this generation's answer to Zinedine Zidane or Steven Gerrard but English football fans were never treated - or put through the trauma - of watching him glide and rip through midfields at ease. He left these shores with a stench of what-might-have-been.\n\nThere could be a similar situation for a certain striker at Liverpool. Though a completely different profile of player, will Reds fans ever see the real Darwin Nunez on a consistent basis? On his day, he is an unstoppable force who can torment the best defenders in the world.\n\nBut those days can be few and far between. Rival fans have poked fun at him ever since his arrival in England, while even his own so-called supporters have abused him in recent weeks after a sub-par run of form and several high-profile misses.\n\nLiverpool are on a mission to 'unlock' Darwin Nunez's full potential - and succeed where Man United failed in doing the same to Paul Pogba (R)\n\nPodcast All episodes PODCAST: Listen to the latest episode of 'It's All Kicking Off!'

It bounced in. His recent scoring rate stands at two in his last 13 games, with him often consigned to a seat on the bench now.\n\nA cameo in the 4-2 win over Tottenham on Sunday was littered with errors and the online insults reached fever pitch, resulting in Nunez removing all Liverpool-related posts from his Instagram account and stormed off the pitch. It fuelled speculation that he wanted out of Anfield.\n\nThe sharks of the Spanish media immediately jumped on the story and, within hours, he was being linked to Barcelona. It would be easier for them to report which players the Nou Camp club are not interested in, given the never-ending rumour mill of Catalonia.\n\nBut president Joan Laporta is said to be actively trying to offload veteran striker Robert Lewandowski, now 35, which would mean they need a new No 9. Nunez's agent Jorge Mendes has four clients at Barcelona, plus another out on loan.\n\nOn his day, Nunez is an unstoppable force who can torment the best defenders in the world\n\nSaying that, the club is significantly in deficit with their La Liga-set wage bill and it seems financially tough to see how they could afford him. The speculation was not helped, though, when Nunez was snapped in Barcelona with their defender Ronald Araujo on Tuesday.\n\nThat trip was just a quick break as players were given a few days of annual leave, with Ibrahima Konate also jetting to a French coastal resort and several stars, including Mohamed Salah, heading to London. Diogo Jota was less glamorous with a jaunt to Sheffield to watch snooker.\n\nBarcelona defender Araujo is also a Uruguay team-mate of Nunez and the pair have been good mates having been born three months apart and advanced through the age-group international teams together. Nunez's partner, Lorena Manas, is also from the Catalan region.\n\nBut even though he took a bit of downtime this week, the striker has still been the topic of endless debate back in England, from podcasts to pub patter. So, is it time for Liverpool to wash their hands of Nunez?\n\nBut those days can be few and far between, with his last goal coming on April 4\n\nLiverpool certainly do not think so. The club's position is believed to be a staunch stance: Nunez is going nowhere. Liverpool see Nunez as key to their plans for the future and sources in Merseyside point to how everyone will start afresh when Jurgen Klopp leaves in a fortnight.\n\nIncoming head coach Arne Slot was hired for many reasons but one of the main selling points was his ability to develop players. One case study would be Argentine striker Santiago Gimenez, who was plucked from the relative obscurity of Mexican side Cruz Azul.\n\nIn Gimenez's last full season in Liga MX, he scored eight goals in 42 games. Across 86 matches under Slot's tutelage at Feyenoord, he has netted 49 times. 'It was a big step for me to come from Mexico to the Netherlands and Arne gave me confidence,' said Gimenez on Sunday night.\n\n'He always pushed me to be better. I am really grateful, I hope he can do it well everywhere. As a person and as a coach, he is complete. He understands when to tell you that you did well, and also when to tell you if you did bad. He can talk really well with the players.'\n\nNunez scored 15 goals in his first season at Anfield, and has netted 18 in this campaign\n\nAnother example is Bournemouth forward Luis Sinisterra, who worked with Slot at Feyenoord before joining Leeds. 'Sinisterra did not work out at first here and everyone wanted to give up on him,' says one source who has known Slot since he was a player at Sparta Rotterdam.\n\n'I don't know what he did but all of a sudden he was fulfilling his potential. He went to Leeds for \u00a325million, one of Feyenoord's biggest sales ever. Before Slot, he could have gone for a nickel and dime! He puts belief in players.'\n\nIt would make little financial sense for Liverpool to sell Nunez, who signed in 2022 on a long-term deal that could rise to \u00a385million with add-ons based on appearances and team success. On the same note, cash-strapped Barcelona would do well to afford him.\n\nGiven his form, Liverpool would be unlikely to recoup the mega fee they paid for him. And the club value him extremely highly regardless, noting his age - still just 24 - and the lack of elite-level forwards on the European transfer market.\n\nThe forward will lose two of his biggest fans this month when Klopp and right-hand man Pep Lijnders depart. Lijnders, who speaks five languages including Spanish, spent a lot of time with Nunez on the training pitches last summer working on finding more calmness in front of goal.\n\nLiverpool still have huge confidence in Nunez, with Jurgen Klopp and his staff working with him extensively to improve his finishing\n\nHe also issued a passionate defence when covering for Klopp at a press briefing earlier this season and said it is 'unfair' to judge Nunez solely on his scoring stats. Even when he has not been on hot scoring form, the view inside the club was that Nunez was still contributing highly.\n\nFor other outside observers, though, his statistics speak volumes. Since joining Liverpool, he has scored just 13 of 60 Opta-defined 'big chances', with a big chance conversion rate of 21.7 per cent. Of players with at least 20 big chances, only Danny Welbeck has been more wasteful.\n\nHe has yielded an expected goals (xG) tally of 28.3 in his time in the Premier League but actually scored just 20 times. The only player with a bigger gap between their xG and actual goals in that time is Everton's Dominic Calvert-Lewin.\n\nNunez has an overall shot conversion rate in the league of just 10.5 per cent, meaning he scores roughly one goal for every 10 attempts. To compare, team-mate Diogo Jota has converted 22.4 per cent of his efforts in that time period.\n\nOf course only the goal-scoring stats make headlines but if you delve deeper, his numbers in other aspects have improved somewhat this season. He has 13 assists this term compared to four last season, while he has created more chances and had more touches.\n\nThe Uruguayan will likely get a chance of a fresh start when incoming boss Arne Slot arrives\n\nNunez is adored by match-going fans and his name is often chanted louder than any by the Kop, who are mostly desperate for him to succeed. But even the most hardened Liverpool supporter will acknowledge that all is not well with the striker right now.\n\nDeleting his Liverpool-related Instagram posts caused a storm on social media. It could be nothing but it felt symbolic and it is said Nunez regularly finds himself reading comments about him. When the going gets tough, he will understandably get into a spiral of sadness.\n\nHis career has followed a theme of getting over disappointments. Nunez wanted to quit football when, at just 17, his knee buckled and he tore his anterior cruciate ligament playing for Penarol in Montevideo. He struggled with homesickness when leaving Uruguay for Spain and Almeria.\n\nNunez was also not helped by being instantly put on Premier League billboards alongside fellow new arrival Erling Haaland. The striker's camp felt that did not help his confidence, especially when the Norwegian scored 52 goals to Nunez's 15 in their debut seasons in England.\n\nIn a pastoral sense, Liverpool offers support to all players who might be subject to online abuse. They have done a lot to help Nunez feel at home in England, such as South American menu choices and sending him on extra language courses.\n\nNunez is adored by match-going fans and his name is often chanted louder than any by the Kop\n\nIt is a lot more nuanced than a simple message of, 'Stay off social media', especially when players' accounts are a vehicle for commercial growth. On the same token, it is much easier said than done for Nunez to follow their advice of ignoring negative comments.\n\nMidfielder Dominik Szoboszlai has also struggled with online abuse. The Hungary captain told a Budapest-based TV station this week: 'When you don't play well, in some people's eyes, you're the worst player on the pitch. But it's not a problem, we get through these things together.'\n\nTeam-mates, led by captain Virgil van Dijk, will surely put an arm around Nunez when they return to the Kirkby training base after a tough personal week. The striker's idol, former Liverpool great and compatriot Luis Suarez, is regularly in touch privately.\n\nPublicly, Suarez told him: 'Thank you scorer for always being there! Always remember (to be) POSITIVE and looking forward!' Nunez will spearhead Uruguay's Copa America campaign this summer ahead of Suarez, now at Inter Miami, who is often left out by boss Marcelo Bielsa.\n\nSo while it is probably correct to label this juncture as a mini-crossroads, Nunez could return from the tournament - held outside South America in the United States - full of beans and raring to go having spent a summer with Bielsa. There will be a fresh start feel, too, when Slot arrives.\n\nBy then, we will be into season three of unlocking Nunez. Unlike Pogba at Old Trafford, Liverpool can be a habitat of success. His head could of course be turned by Barcelona but for both player and club, they would be foolish to give up on his time at Anfield just yet.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType":

This season he has scored merely 11 goals in the Premier League for the Reds.\n\nArne Slot will back himself to do what Jurgen Klopp could not. The Dutchman plays an exciting brand of attacking football, and he has gotten the best out of all the strikers who have played under him.\n\nIt was under him that Myron Boadu became a striker coveted by some of Europe's biggest clubs. He also brought the best out of Rangers forward, Cyriel Dessers, and transformed Santiago Gimenez into one of the best strikers in the Eredivisie.\n\nSlot will have his own ways of bringing the best out of Nunez. His football is geared towards number nines, and that could very well be the key to unlocking Nunez's full potential at Anfield.\n\nThere has been some speculation that Edwards may be looking to shift Nunez out of the club this summer.\n\nHowever, being the data man that he is, that's unlikely to be the case because Nunez's underlying numbers are really strong.\n\nFor example, he may only have 11 goals in the Premier League, as per Wyscout for xG per 90 minutes out of forwards in the Premier League with at least 2000 minutes, only Erling Haaland (0.91 per 90), Mohamed Salah (0.68 per 90) and Alexander Isak (0.64 per 90) are more productive than Nunez (0.57 per 90).\n\nHe is currently underperforming his xG by 0.13 according to the data, but that can be changed. It would be more of a concern for Edwards if Nunez was not getting himself into goal-scoring situations. But the data clearly suggests he is.\n\nSo Edwards will simply trust the process and he will know the obvious solution is to keep faith in Nunez for now.", "source": {"uri": "rousingthekop.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Rousing The Kop"}, "authors": [{"uri": "bence_bocsak@rousingthekop.com", "name": "Bence Bocsak", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arne_Slot", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Arne Slot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myron_Boadu", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Myron Boadu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyriel_Dessers", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cyriel Dessers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eredivisie", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Eredivisie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J\u00fcrgen_Klopp", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "J\u00fcrgen Klopp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rangers_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rangers F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erling_Haaland", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Erling Haaland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Isak", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alexander Isak"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohamed_Salah", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mohamed Salah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anfield", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anfield"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Work-Life_Balance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Work-Life Balance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://cdn1.rousingthekop.com/uploads/4/2024/05/GettyImages-2150160292-1-scaled.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9540390", "eventUri": "eng-9540390", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.411764705882353, "wgt": 168, "relevance": 1}

I think you [co-host Chris Sutton] rate him as well. He has clear deficiencies in his game that we know. He hits the frame with a goal, the post and the bar with more power and venom than any other player we've ever seen.\n\n'But despite it all, Klopp has stood by him, he's kept picking him, he's been given his opportunities, so if he's p***** off with Liverpool, I cannot think for one minute why that would be.'", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anfield", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Anfield"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Ara\u00fajo", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ronald Ara\u00fajo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Tuchel", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Thomas Tuchel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cap_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cap (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Lewandowski", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Robert Lewandowski"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S.L._Benfica", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "S.L.

Team-mates including star forward Mohamed Salah have also been hugely wasteful in front of goal, but Nunez has born the brunt of frustration surrounding a glut of missed opportunities.\n\nNunez's most recent appearance was as a 75th minute substitute in Sunday's 4-2 victory against Tottenham Hotspur, when he was flagged offside when assisting Salah for a chalked-off strike, wasted a counter attack by failing to provide Cody Gakpo with a chance on goal, then squandered a one-on-one opportunity. The 24-year-old now holds the dubious distinction of being caught offside more times (32) than any other player in the top flight this season and is second in missing big chances (27).\n\nREAD MORE: Five problems Arne Slot must sort out immediately at Liverpool if he replaces Jurgen Klopp\n\nREAD MORE: Real Madrid 'don't deserve' Jurgen Klopp as their new manager, says Liverpool icon\n\nDespite registering a pretty impressive 18 goals and 13 assists in all competitions in his second season at Anfield, only 11 of those strikes have come in the Premier League, meaning speculation is rife about what lies ahead for the former Benfica forward.

But he could barely put a leg right throughout his 15 minutes on the pitch. All the passes he attempted (3) were inaccurate, and he also missed a big chance to score and was caught offside twice.\n\nHis impact on the game was so poor that Liverpool fans took to social media to lambast the star striker. Darwin Nunez has scored one goal in his last ten games across all appearances for the club. His 11 goals in the Premier League this season have come from 34 games, and the striker should certainly have more goals under his belt.\n\nHowever, he keeps struggling in the final third, and the club's fans have now lost their patience with him, as they made clear on social media:\n\n\"Nunez needs to be sold in the summer man. 85 mil & the guy can't even even stay onside.\" a fan complained\n\n\"Nunez as the football IQ of mashed potato. Absolutely useless.\" another fan lashed out\n\n\"Nunez was offside twice, missed a 1v1, messed up a 2v1. It is time to move on, Gakpo out of position is better,\" a third fan noted.\n\n\"Another season watching Nunez gonna be draining. Just put the guy out his misery,\" a fourth wrote.\n\n\"Big decision to make on Nunez in the summer,\" a fan wrote.\n\n\"One thing is very certain every time Nunez plays, he is going to miss a big scoring chance. It's just too sure. A dumb striker,\" another fan added.\n\n\"Let's hope d new guy work on him/work with him Better , he is NOT clinical enough,\" a fan complained about the Liverpool striker.\n\nLiverpool ran out 4-2 winners over Tottenham Hotspur in their Premier League clash at Anfield, consolidating their hold on third position.\n\nThe hosts opened the scoring in the 16th minute through Mohamed Salah, as the Egyptian star powered in a header. Andy Robertson doubled the hosts' lead in the 45th minute after he buried a shot spilled by Spurs goalkeeper Guglielmo Vicario. The Reds went into the break 2-0 up and came back looking to further their lead in the second half.\n\nLiverpool did just that five minutes after the restart through Cody Gakpo. The Dutchman connected with a fine Harvey Elliott cross to make it 3-0. Elliott went from provider to scorer in the 59th minute to make it 4-0.\n\nSpurs however didn't go down without a fight and pulled one back in the 72nd minute after Brennan Johnson found Richarlison. The former Everton man then set up Son Heung-min in the 77th minute to make it 4-2.

That is not acceptable at this level, certainly when Liverpool are going for the title,' Carragher said.\n\n'I think there is a question to ask. You want him to do well because there is so much that you like because he gives everything, he runs and causes trouble and gets the odd goal and gets an assist.\n\n'But after two years when Liverpool this season are going to the title and those big games, you need your man to score away at Old Trafford, away at Goodison, in the European game at Atalanta. There is no time to waste, this is not October or November.

The ball he laid on for Salah to make it 5-2 late on was a similar issue, having strayed just offside before the pass across the face of goal.\n\nFor a big-money striker whose last goal came when he charged down a clearance from Sheffield United goalkeeper Ivo Grbic before seeing it go in off his backside over a month ago now, the inability to convert has become a glaring issue and one that was magnified during an abject April when treble dreams turn to dust.\n\nOn another day, Nunez might have had a goal and an assist to show for his late cameo but that is the very conundrum itself, perfectly distilled into a 15-minute display. There's no lack of effort or desire from the Uruguay international but the clarity of thought or the finesse of the finish needed to turn opportunities into goals has been absent too often for some.\n\nAnd at a fee that now stands at a club-record-equalling \u00a375m, the cause for concern is now legitimate for those who are increasingly questioning whether those rough edges will ever be smoothed out.\n\nIt feels somewhat churlish and even cruel to be dissecting Nunez's cameo in such detail on a day when he was barely involved in a strange but largely enjoyable Anfield afternoon for supporters, but the subsequent deletion of his Liverpool-specific posts on social media on Sunday was always going to lead to fevered speculation over the intentions behind the move.\n\nFor those who place little stock on the importance of social media - like Klopp, for example - it is a non-story. But for a 24-year-old regular user of such platforms to remove all of his Reds-related posts on Instagram, it must be considered significant. Even more so when you factor in that Nunez has also been blocking certain Liverpool-centric fan accounts on Twitter to boot.\n\nThis, after all, is a player who wasted little time using such platforms to send his first message as a Liverpool player nearly two years ago when he spoke of 'resiliencia' (resilience) following some harsh critiques of a pre-season performance against Manchester United. That post came after a four-goal haul against RB Leipzig and was widely interpreted as a firm riposte to the naysayers.\n\nNunez will mark his two-year anniversary as a Liverpool man next month and it's difficult to assess where he really stands presently given few players have polarised quite like the speedy centre-forward. His detractors see the loose touches, wayward finishing and inability to stay onside as cast iron reasons for why he will never unlock his true potential.\n\nThose who champion his case argue his 18 goals and 13 assists as someone who can contribute to a winning Liverpool team for the long haul. In the world of social media, however, which is a place Nunez obviously places great value in, there is little scope for sensible and nuanced debate.\n\nBut should the real assessment be that the former Benfica striker is in fact somewhere in the vast, sprawling middle ground between him being an awesome force of nature and cumbersome, expensive write-off? A player capable of being a hugely useful weapon for new manager Arne Slot without ever being the main man to fire them to the game's biggest honours?\n\nPerhaps the great irony of all this is that Nunez's biggest problem is one that is not of his own making. Liverpool bet the house on the South American nearly two years ago, sanctioning an initial outlay of \u00a364m with a further \u00a321m in potential add-ons.\n\nHad that fee been more reflective of players like Cody Gakpo, Luis Diaz and Diogo Jota, at fees between \u00a337m and \u00a350m, then the wider analysis might be undertaken in a less harsh light.", "source": {"uri": "liverpoolecho.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Liverpool Echo"}, "authors": [{"uri": "paul_gorst@liverpoolecho.co.uk", "name": "Paul Gorst", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohamed_Salah", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mohamed Salah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tottenham_Hotspur_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tottenham Hotspur F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anfield", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Anfield"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virgil_van_Dijk", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Virgil van Dijk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offside_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Offside (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substitute_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Substitute (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J\u00fcrgen_Klopp", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "J\u00fcrgen Klopp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treble_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Treble (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uruguay_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Uruguay national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheffield_United_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sheffield United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goalkeeper_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Goalkeeper (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luis_D\u00edaz_(footballer,_born_1997)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Luis D\u00edaz (footballer, born 1997)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assist (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cody_Gakpo", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cody Gakpo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RB_Leipzig", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "RB Leipzig"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S.L._Benfica", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "S.L.

He firmly believes the midfielder has more to offer the Anfield club after impressing in their 4-2 win over Tottenham Hotspur in the Premier League on Sunday by scoring the Reds' last goal.\n\nIt was just the fourth goal that Elliott has scored through his 51 appearances so far this term. The 21-year-old has also offered nine assists but just four, plus three of his goals, have come during the midfielder's 32 Premier League outings that have also yielded just 1,178 minutes.\n\nJurgen Klopp has seldom trusted Elliott with playing a key role in Liverpool's Premier League title bid. He has started the England U21 talent just nine times, despite Elliott featuring in all 36 of their squads. But Foster believes Elliott will produce more under Klopp's replacement.\n\n\"Harvey Elliott's performance, I was doubly impressed with Harvey Elliott at the weekend,\" Foster said on his YouTube channel. \"I think next season he could really come into his own.\"\n\nRead more about what Foster has had to say about Liverpool's Elliott, here.\n\nReds hero Luis Suarez has sent Darwin Nunez a message of support amid the criticism fired at the Liverpool striker. The 24-year-old has come under fire in recent weeks for his ongoing struggles. Nunez has now failed to score in his last six appearances in the Premier League.\n\nJurgen Klopp even benched Nunez for Liverpool's last two fixtures against West Ham United and Tottenham Hotspur. He had recalled the Uruguayan in the Merseyside derby but did not see enough from the striker as Everton dealt the Reds a 2-0 defeat to justify retaining a role.\n\nJermain Defoe is among the pundits to criticise Nunez amid his barren spell. The ex-England striker felt Nunez was 'wrong' to try and chip Guglielmo Vicario as Liverpool beat Tottenham 4-2. Michael Owen also tore into Nunez's display at Everton which made his 'brain explode'.\n\nBut Suarez has urged Nunez to be positive and look forward in a message of support for his fellow Uruguayan. Suarez knows what it takes to perform as Liverpool's centre-forward after scoring 82 goals in 133 games. Nunez has so far scored 33 goals in 94 outings for Liverpool.\n\n\"Thank you scorer for always being there,\" Suarez messaged Nunez on X. \"Always remember [to be] positive and looking forward!\"\n\nRead more about what Suarez has told Liverpool forward Nunez, here.\n\nLiverpool legend Steven Gerrard now wants John Achterberg to join his coaching staff at the Saudi Arabian side, Al-Ettifaq. That is according to the Mirror, which reports that Achterberg is due to head to the Middle East this summer after confirming his decision to leave Anfield.\n\nAchterberg has spent 15 years at Anfield but will leave Liverpool after Jurgen Klopp opted to step down as their manager. Rafa Benitez first brought the goalkeeper coach to Anfield back in 2009.

His name is sung as much as anyone else's when he starts a game.\n\nBut modern football means there are always people looking to tear you down and you need to understand that there is also always pressure when you play for a club like Liverpool, especially when you are a big-money striker like Darwin is.\n\nThis is where he would benefit from having the right people around him and in his camp to give the right feedback and keep him on an even keel. Most of those nobodies online won't even be Liverpool fans, it will be people pretending to be so they can stick the boot in and feel good about themselves.\n\nLook, from his perspective, I can get it. I have to deal with plenty of myself on sites like Twitter and it is part and parcel of the game now, especially when you are in the public eye and have millions of people who follow you. But also you have to have the right mentality to block it all out. He has bit and taken the bait by the looks of it and it doesn't look good but the proper supporters are still backing him, that is for sure.\n\nHe should score more in my view and it looks like there are some misses that are playing on his mind when he is in front of goal but there is definitely a player in there. If I was him now I'd spend plenty of time working on my finishing before or after training sessions, I used to do it even when I was a player-manager and I loved it, out on the pitches working and working.\n\nYou've got to learn to love putting the ball in the back net and that will be the best way for Nunez to respond to all these people pretending to be Liverpool fans and giving him unwarranted abuse.\n\nThere's been some talk over what happens next for Nunez as a Liverpool player but under a new manager next season I feel it will present him with a fresh start and a chance to become a major player for the next few years at Anfield.\n\nElliott is a central midfielder now - no more right-wing duties\n\nI thought Harvey Elliott had a great game against Tottenham and I was so pleased to see him putting in that sort of performance.\n\nHe is a lifelong, die-hard Reds fan and I am always delighted to see players like that succeed. His goal was brilliant, the way he wrapped his foot around it to beat the goalkeeper was superb and his assist for Cody Gakpo was also right on the money.\n\nThis was the game that proved that Elliott is most definitely a central midfielder now at Liverpool and not someone who can fill on the right side of the attack whenever Mohamed Salah is rested.\n\nElliott struggles to get into the game when he is playing in front three and he is much more effective on the right side of the midfield, using his passing range and ability to keep the ball to knit it all together.\n\nHe can create and he can score and at 21, he is poised to continue his development under a new regime next season. It's an exciting future for him but it has to be in the centre of midfield.\n\nKlopp's final days are here - I'm fearful for future\n\nWith just two matches left for Jurgen Klopp as Liverpool manager, it's all starting to feel real now, isn't it?\n\nAnd I have to admit I am fearful for the future as the club looks to take steps forward without one of the best managers in the world.\n\nLife after Jurgen will feel surreal and while there are people at the club who you would back to make the right decisions on the appointments of the next manager, it is only natural to be concerned over Liverpool's ability to progress further without such a gifted coach overseeing it all.\n\nWe have seen it before, haven't we? Just look at Manchester United when Alex Ferguson left Old Trafford. That was over a decade ago now and they haven't been right since really, employing a handful of managers who have tried and failed to get them back to where they were under Ferguson.\n\nAnd make no mistake, even Manchester City will feel the pinch when Pep Guardiola leaves the Etihad and had it not been for them, Jurgen would have cleaned up during his time at Anfield. His trophy haul would look even better than it already does and that is saying something.\n\nLiverpool at least look like they have identified the man to fit the bill in Arne Slot but life without Klopp will take some getting used to.", "source": {"uri": "liverpoolecho.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Liverpool Echo"}, "authors": [{"uri": "john_aldridge@liverpoolecho.co.uk", "name": "John Aldridge", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tottenham_Hotspur_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tottenham Hotspur F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offside_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Offside (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohamed_Salah", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mohamed Salah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anfield", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anfield"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uruguay", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Uruguay"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Uruguay"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Player-coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Player-coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J\u00fcrgen_Klopp", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "J\u00fcrgen Klopp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvey_Elliott", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Harvey Elliott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cody_Gakpo", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cody Gakpo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_of_Manchester_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "City of Manchester Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pep_Guardiola", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pep Guardiola"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Ferguson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alex Ferguson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Trafford", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Old Trafford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manchester City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manchester United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goalkeeper_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Goalkeeper (association football)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://i2-prod.liverpoolecho.co.uk/incoming/article29121251.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_GettyImages-2150123631.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9540390", "eventUri": "eng-9540390", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 154, "relevance": 1}

The 24-year-old has now been caught offside 32 times in the Premier League this season, more than any other player, and has missed the second most big chances (27).\n\nREAD MORE: Why Jurgen Klopp could miss his Anfield farewell with Liverpool career at risk of ending early\n\nREAD MORE: What Liverpool supporters did on the Kop makes Mohamed Salah point as transfer decision nears\n\nThere has been talk of late regarding what the future holds for the former Benfica striker following a second season, which has seen little progress made by the club's potential record signing. Liverpool paid an initial \u00a364.1m for Nunez in June 2022, rising to a possible \u00a385m with add-ons.\n\nWhether or not Nunez's latest social media activity is a sign of what's to come remains to be seen, though the forward has chosen to delete all photos of him in action for Liverpool from his Instagram account, apart from one. The only post that has been spared is an image of the Uruguay international pictured at the AXA Training Centre a day after signing for the club in 2022. All pictures from his Benfica days remain, as well as those of Nunez representing his country.\n\nAsked to comment on the struggles of Nunez and Salah in front of goal at the end of April, Klopp told reporters: \"It's tricky. Strikers have to go through these things. That's how it is.\n\n\"That's a striker's life. A goalkeeper's life is make 500 saves, then one howler - and everybody talks about this. A striker's life is you score all the time, then you don't score for a while and then everybody asks why you don't score.\n\n\"It can be the most difficult thing in the world and sometimes it's the easiest thing in the world, depending on what chance you get. We had good chances against Everton but again we were a bit in a rush in finishing them off.\n\n\"So create again, create again and try and get in the right positions to finish the situations off.

The striker was named on the bench in the Reds' 4-2 win over Tottenham Hotspur on Sunday before coming on for Luis Diaz at 4-1 in the 75th minute.\n\nNunez has scored 18 times for Liverpool this season and assisted a further 13 times, but the quality of options in attack for Jurgen Klopp means he has been in and out of the squad. Since moving from Benfica in 2022, the Uruguay international has managed 33 goals in total in England but has often been criticised for his lack of composure in front of goal.\n\nNow, following the win over Spurs, Nunez has sparked rumours over his future in the Premier League by removing all of his posts associated with Liverpool from Instagram. A quick glance at his profile shows that only posts of him in action with Uruguay and Benfica remain.\n\nIt is currently unclear why the striker has opted to take down his Liverpool-related posts, though it comes after Barcelona were linked with a shock move for him. With changes expected to happen at Anfield with Klopp departing, Nunez's potential exit could leave Arsenal and Chelsea scrambling with their own transfer plans.\n\nBoth teams are likely to be in the market for a new striker for next season, with Mikel Arteta and Mauricio Pochettino looking to bolster their attack. However, should Liverpool sell Nunez, they themselves will be in the same market for a new number nine in the summer.\n\nMohamed Salah's uncertain future means Liverpool could be desperate for new attacking reinforcements.

Reports have been suggesting that the Reds were looking for a new midfielder. Darwin Nunez's future at Anfield has been questioned in recent days as Arne Slot looks to bring in a new attacker.\n\nLast summer, Liverpool rebuilt their squad with a brand-new midfield, and currently, the transfer priorities are elsewhere, according to Fabrizio Romano. New manager Arne Slot could be set to spend big in his first year at Anfield, but the Dutchman could leave one area untouched and rely on previous signings.\n\nThe departing manager Jurgen Klopp built a new midfield less than a year ago after the likes of Jordan Henderson, James Milner, Fabinho, Naby Keita, and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain all left the team. Liverpool have spent \u00a3146million on four new signings: Dominik Szoboszlai, Alexis Mac Allister, Ryan Gravenberch, and Wataru Endo, refreshing their team, which looks comfortably set to secure a top-four finish in the Premier League this year.\n\nLiverpool Transfer Plans Revealed\n\nWriting in his Daily Briefing, Romano suggested that the club under Slot will focus on other areas in the summer:\n\n\"Liverpool have different priorities - a new centre-back, and a new player in the offensive positions, so these are the areas to watch, more than a big signing in midfield.\"\n\nLiverpool are likely to lose two experienced centre-backs in the summer as both Joel Matip and Joe Gomez could leave the club to welcome a new challenge elsewhere. Alongside Virgil van Dijk, Ibrahima Konate, and Jarell Quansah, the club would need a fourth centre-back, and recently, Romano named Goncalo Inacio among the candidates as a potential target for the Reds.\n\nThe 22-year-old has become a key player for Sporting Lisbon in recent years and has caught the attention of most top European clubs. Reportedly, Inacio has a \u00a352 million release clause, which is already attracting huge competition for his signature this summer from the likes of Paris Saint-Germain and Manchester United.\n\nLiverpool have long admired the Portuguese defender and targeted him last year, but ultimately decided to bring reinforcements in the midfield. Inacio could heat up the competition for the starting centre-back spot alongside van Dijk and ultimately replace the Dutchman, who is about to turn 33 this July.\n\nNunez set to leave Liverpool?\n\nLiverpool are also keeping an eye on the forwards' market, Romano suggests. Scoring has been an issue for some of the club's forwards this season, most notably, Darwin Nunez. The Uruguayan attacker has only scored 11 goals in the Premier League this season and averages a goal every 183 minutes.\n\nThe 24-year-old, who cost Liverpool \u00a385 million in 2022, is still the club's record signing and one of the highest earners in the squad. In recent weeks, Barcelona has emerged as a potential destination for Nunez. Reportedly, the Catalans are looking to cut their wage bill and could replace Robert Lewandowski with the Uruguayan forward as soon as this summer.\n\nLiverpool will also be looking to answer questions over Mohamed Salah's future this summer. The Egyptian's contract expires next year, and the club could risk losing him for free. While fans still anticipate a contract extension, last summer, Liverpool already rejected a lucrative offer from Saudi Arabia for Salah, who faces a decisive summer for his career.\n\nRelated Nunez to Hold Talks With Slot After Deleted Liverpool Posts Liverpool forward Darwin Nunez is going through a tricky spell at Anfield, and Fabrizio Romano has provided an update on his future.\n\nStatistics

However, these are private things, so only Darwin can clarify why he did that; for sure it's not the best moment for him, but I'd never link social media activities with transfer market movements.\n\n\"It's all quiet so far, nothing is happening and for sure Darwin is looking forward to speaking to new coach Arne Slot.\"\n\nREAD MORE: Liverpool ready to offer bumper pay rise to 'amazing' maestro who lorded it against Spurs\n\nREAD MORE: 'He has a future at Anfield' - BBC pundit raves about Liverpool gem who was rejected by Premier League rivals\n\nFirstly, we must state that any individual sending personal abuse to Nunez is completely out of order and, in truth, not a genuine Liverpool fan.\n\nConstructive criticism of his performances (i.e. missing scorable chances, taking the wrong option in the final third) is fine and comes with the territory of playing at an elite level, but vicious comments attacking him as a person are simply unacceptable.\n\nLet's take a step back and outline the facts here - this is a 24-year-old man, a father to an infant son, who took the brave step of flying thousands of miles from his childhood home at a very young age to pursue his dream and now resides in a country where his native language isn't widely spoken.\n\nFOLLOW Empire of the Kop on Instagram (@empireofthekop) HERE\n\nHe also has to cope with the pressure which invariably comes with representing one of the biggest clubs in world football, with the spotlight ramped up even further by a big-money transfer which cost an initial \u00a364m (BBC Sport).\n\nCriticism is an inevitable part of the sport, but it's not right that Nunez has been the target of online abuse simply because of a few misses on the pitch.\n\nThankfully it seems that he has the support of the people who matter - his teammates, his club's management and, most importantly, his family.

Salah and Nunez, they shoot if that makes sense. They don't finish.\n\n\"Even Nunez, in the last action when he went through on goal, the obvious solution was to go around the goalkeeper and then pass it into an empty net.\n\n\"But, for whatever reason, he tries to dink it over him. It's the wrong thing to do in that situation. The chances, when it comes consistently, like week after week and game after game and you are missing all these chances, then you are competing against teams like Man City and Arsenal that get these chances and players are converting these chances, then you are going to fall behind.\"\n\nLet's assume Salah stays on Merseyside.

Alisson Becker's frustrations were evident as Liverpool let Spurs score two late goals. Darwin Nunez was another player angry on the day - perhaps having again started on the substitutes' bench.\n\nA frustrated Alisson Becker caught the attention of many this weekend in Liverpool's 4-2 victory over Tottenham. Contrary to being on the winning side in J\u00fcrgen Klopp's penultimate Anfield outing, the Brazilian international bore the brunt of a harsh home concession record.\n\nLiverpool initially strode out into a dominant 4-0 lead as Mohamed Salah, Andrew Robertson and Cody Gakpo netted for the hosts before a Harvey Elliott screamer looked to seal a top day all round. However, Richarlison and Son Heung-min notched two late consolations, meaning Liverpool continue a troublesome record that sees them without a home clean sheet since mid-December.\n\nKlopp Acknowledges Defensive Frailties\n\nAs the Athletic's James Pearce reported, Liverpool looked to have \"clocked off\" from a position of \"complete dominance at 4-0 up.\" The Reds haven't kept a clean sheet at home in the league for nearly six months, and with \"Alisson's displeasure at that wait being extended clear for all to see\".\n\n\"We lost a bit of organisation,\" explained Klopp. \"It's not great but it's human. We were outstanding until we were not good.\"\n\nAccording to Pearce, that sentiment \"was the club's season in microcosm -- scintillating at times, baffling at others - but the good far outweighed the bad.\" The journalist continued, \"Klopp's long goodbye is reaching an emotional crescendo. Two games to go with third place secured. Sunday changed the mood after Liverpool's recent woes and shone a light on some of the riches Slot will inherit.\"\n\nAlthough collective mood may have improved, it was still noticeable that Alisson wasn't the only Liverpool player showing his frustrations. Darwin Nunez was highlighted as particularly tetchy when he was introduced 15 minutes from the end. Fellow Liverpool-based Athletic journalist Andy Jones said on the 'Walk On' podcast:\n\n\"It was a very strange performance from Nunez. He looked like he had a bit of a bee in his bonnet when he was coming on. I think there was a point where he reacted really angrily to someone having a go at him. There were times that he wasn't getting back into position, but then in the next moment he was charging round the field pressing.\"\n\n'Complacency' Chatter Rears its Head Again\n\nAs Pearce earlier stated, the weekend's performance underlines the positives for Slot as he takes over at high-scoring Liverpool. However, with conceding late, and couple of key men becoming frustrated - Slot will also have to deal with a real bogey word of late. Complacency.\n\nPearce noted that \"a bit of complacency crept in\", while the \"array of substitutions made it disjointed and allowed Tottenham to half the deficit.\" This isn't new as a 3-0 defeat by Atalanta at Anfield sparked wild conversation back in April - playing a huge part in Klopp's side being knocked out of the Europa League at the Quarter-final stage.\n\nAs per GiveMeSport, Liverpool writer David Lynch didn't mince his words on social media:\n\nRelated Liverpool and Klopp Disagreed Over Darwin Nunez Signing Liverpool forward Darwin Nunez has come under plenty of scrutiny this season, and Paul Joyce has suggested it was a Jurgen Klopp signing.", "source": {"uri": "givemesport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GiveMeSport"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J\u00fcrgen_Klopp", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "J\u00fcrgen Klopp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shutout", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Shutout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tottenham_Hotspur_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tottenham Hotspur F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alisson_Becker", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alisson Becker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Pearce", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Alex Pearce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvey_Elliott", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Harvey Elliott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cody_Gakpo", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cody Gakpo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Robertson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Andrew Robertson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohamed_Salah", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mohamed Salah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brazil national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darwin,_Northern_Territory", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Darwin, Northern Territory"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Darwin, Northern Territory"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Son_Heung-min", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Son Heung-min"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anfield", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anfield"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richarlison", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Richarlison"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atalanta_B.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Atalanta B.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-elimination_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Single-elimination tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Europa_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Europa League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Work-Life_Balance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Work-Life Balance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 87}], "image": "https://static0.givemesportimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/alisson-vvd.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9540390", "eventUri": "eng-9540390", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2705882352941177, "wgt": 133, "relevance": 1}

In response to online criticism, he removed all Liverpool-related images from his Instagram account and appeared to block supporters who had expressed their displeasure.\n\nREAD MORE: Jose Mourinho admiration for Liverpool resurfaces after Manchester United decision\n\nREAD MORE: Liverpool agree new deal with 90-goal wonderkid who Antoine Griezmann loves\n\nThis isn't the first time a Reds player has taken such drastic action on Instagram. Dejan Lovren also deleted all traces of the club from his social media after facing criticism for his inconsistent performances under Jurgen Klopp.\n\nLovren, who was signed from Southampton for \u00a320million, came under particular fire following a 4-1 defeat to Spurs in October 2017, where he was blamed for allowing Harry Kane to score Tottenham's second goal.\n\nKlopp was so disappointed with his performance that he substituted him after just 30 minutes. Following the defeat, Lovren removed all references to Liverpool from his Instagram bio, changed his profile picture and turned off comments on his account, reports the Mirror.\n\nLFC: Join our WhatsApp community, sign up to a newsletter or listen to our podcasts HERE\n\nDespite this, Lovren returned to the starting line-up and remained a regular in defence for the rest of the season. However, Klopp sought to strengthen their defence by signing Virgil van Dijk in the January transfer window.\n\nAs a result, Lovren's playing time gradually decreased until he eventually left the club in 2020, marking a significant change in his career at Liverpool.

He mightn't be a centre-forward like the Uruguayan, but he's still an attacker with a Manchester City team which dominates almost every match they play.\n\nWe're not for a second inviting a pile-on against the England international, but rather pointing out how Nunez seems to get a vastly disproportionate amount of criticism for his output.\n\nAlso, while fans are entitled to be annoyed at moments such as the one that Defoe highlighted, the 24-year-old certainly doesn't warrant personal abuse over his performances on the pitch. If, as seems plausible, that's the reason for him deleting his Liverpool-related posts on Instagram, that's completely out of order.\n\nFor his sake as much as the team's, we hope that he can silence some doubters in our final two games of this season, and throughout the 2024/25 campaign.", "source": {"uri": "empireofthekop.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Empire of The Kop"}, "authors": [{"uri": "liam_togher@empireofthekop.com", "name": "Liam Togher", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tottenham_Hotspur_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tottenham Hotspur F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jermain_Defoe", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jermain Defoe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goalkeeper_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Goalkeeper (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diogo_Jota", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Diogo Jota"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uruguay", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Uruguay"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Uruguay"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arne_Slot", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arne Slot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Son_Heung-min", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Son Heung-min"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feyenoord", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Feyenoord"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohamed_Salah", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mohamed Salah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsenal_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arsenal F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Grealish", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jack Grealish"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfermarkt", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Transfermarkt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "England national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manchester City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Paper_and_Pencil/Tic-Tac-Toe", "label": "dmoz/Games/Paper and Pencil/Tic-Tac-Toe", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://icdn.empireofthekop.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/jermain-defoe.jpg?w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9540390", "eventUri": "eng-9540390", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2018-05-05", "textStart": 407, "textEnd": 416}], "sentiment": 0.2156862745098038, "wgt": 127, "relevance": 1}

The last Reds player to pull the Instagram stunt was the ever-divisive Dejan Lovren.\n\nHe too struggled to find consistency in Jurgen Klopp's side, despite regularly impressing for the Croatia national team and being bought as a highly-rated centre-back after just a season at Southampton for \u00a320million.\n\nLovren came in for particular criticism following a 4-1 defeat to Spurs in October 2017. He'd been at fault for their opponents' second goal of the game, missing a long ball and allowing Harry Kane to capitalise.\n\nIt was so bad that Klopp hauled him off after just half an hour.

He really was.\n\n'He set up a goal for Salah, he was offside. A couple of other runs through the middle, he was offside. He just looked like a player who was reaching the end of the tether.'\n\nLadyman added: 'I can't think for one minute why he would be dissatisfied with life at Liverpool. Jurgen Klopp has supported him throughout his first couple of seasons. A couple of seasons where you and I have spent a lot of time talking about him.\n\n'I'm a huge fan of his.

Kelleher, though, could be given an outing next week, while Adrian, who is set to leave in the summer, hasn't played a Premier League game in more than three years.\n\nAt centre-back, Ibrahima Konate hasn't featured since being substituted in the derby defeat at Everton and will be hopeful of minutes, although Jarell Quansah has been in on merit to partner Virgil van Dijk. Joel Matip had his season ended in December and at present won't play for Liverpool again.\n\nTrent Alexander-Arnold has retained the right-back berth despite Conor Bradley now being fit again while Joe Gomez is another option, but it was intriguing left-back Kostas Tsimikas didn't make the bench against Tottenham with the versatile Gomez replacing first-choice Andy Robertson midway through the second half.\n\nSzoboszlai wait\n\nWataru Endo has started five of the last six Premier League games and, with Alexis Mac Allister the only realistic alternative as number six, would be expected to see out the campaign in the position. Stefan Bajectic made his long-awaited return from injury at the weekend as substitute, but isn't ready for a start.\n\nMac Allister has been a regular on the left of the midfield triumvirate but could be rotated with Ryan Gravenberch having done well in recent starts. Curtis Jones is another option. On the right, Harvey Elliott was hugely impressive against Tottenham but could be challenged by Dominik Szoboszlai - who has started only two of the last seven games - or Gravenberch. Mac Allister can also play in the role should Klopp wish to completely overhaul his engine room.\n\nBobby Clark and Thiago Alcantara won't play again this season with youngsters James McConnell and Trey Nyoni on under-21 duty in the Premier League 2 play-offs.\n\nNunez return?\n\nThe big talking point after the weekend was the reaction of Darwin Nunez to criticism on social media after a disappointing cameo against Tottenham. Nunez has been benched in four of the last eight games with Cody Gakpo the man in form down the centre of the attack.\n\nMuch could depend on whether Diogo Jota is back available as expected following injury, with the Portuguese capable of playing down the middle or on the left, where Gakpo can also do a job and Luis Diaz has been the regular. Mohamed Salah's display against Tottenham suggests he is now back to form on the right flank.

Here's a breakdown of the situation, including Nunez's reported discontent, links to FC Barcelona, and the implications for Liverpool.\n\nSpeculation surrounding Nunez's departure from Liverpool intensified after the Uruguayan forward deleted all his club-related posts on Instagram. This move, interpreted by many as a sign of dissatisfaction, has drawn criticism from pundits and sparked rumors of an impending transfer. Former Chelsea striker Chris Sutton labeled Nunez's actions as \"dumb,\" suggesting that such conspicuous behavior indicates a desire to leave the club.\n\nIn an analysis on the It's All Kicking Off podcast, Sutton expressed his views on Nunez's Instagram purge, implying that it signals his intent to seek greener pastures elsewhere. Sutton reasoned that Nunez's decision to remove Liverpool-related content from his social media platform could be interpreted as a clear indication of his unhappiness or desire to move on. This move, according to Sutton, has brought unwanted attention to Nunez's situation and suggests underlying discontentment with his current club.\n\nSutton said: \"If somebody does that I assume he wants out or is off somewhere. If he's doing stuff like that, he's certainly brought attention to it and you've cottoned on to it. At least years ago when players wanted to leave they didn't have all this nonsense, they could have all their own thoughts and keep it under wraps.\"\n\n\"It's a pretty dumb move from his point of view if he wanted a move to sneak under the radar, or the way he's feeling at this particular time to sneak under the radar, and nobody cotton on to something. Why has he done it? It just looks like he's going to be on his way, or he's deeply unhappy with the club.\"\n\nDarwin Nunez struggles on the field\n\nNunez's Instagram activity coincides with a period of relative struggle on the pitch. Despite netting 18 goals in all competitions this season, the Uruguayan striker has endured a recent dry spell, finding the back of the net just once in his last 11 appearances for Liverpool. Criticized for his profligacy in front of goal and a decline in form, Nunez has seen his place in Jurgen Klopp's starting lineup come under threat, further fueling speculation about his future at Anfield.\n\nJurgen Klopp's departure and potential changes\n\nNunez's uncertain future comes at a pivotal moment for Liverpool, with the club undergoing significant changes. Jurgen Klopp's impending departure after nearly a decade at the helm marks the end of an era, while rumors swirl regarding the potential exit of star forward Mohamed Salah. Feyenoord's Arne Slot is poised to take over as manager, tasked with sustaining the success achieved under Klopp's tenure and navigating a period of transition for the club.\n\nConclusion: Nunez's Departure Looms Large\n\nAs Liverpool braces for a period of transition, the uncertainty surrounding Darwin Nunez's future adds another layer of complexity to the club's offseason plans. With links to FC Barcelona and indications of discontent, Nunez's potential departure could reshape Liverpool's attacking options and influence their transfer strategy in the coming months. As the saga unfolds, Liverpool fans await clarity on Nunez's situation and the club's plans for the future amidst a backdrop of change and transition.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "fremont_farkas@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Fremont Farkas", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sutton,_London", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sutton, London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sutton, London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darwin,_Northern_Territory", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Darwin, Northern Territory"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Darwin, Northern Territory"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Barcelona", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "FC Barcelona"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Sutton", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chris Sutton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goal_(website)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Goal (website)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anfield", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anfield"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pundit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pundit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelsea_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chelsea F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uruguay", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Uruguay"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Uruguay"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J\u00fcrgen_Klopp", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "J\u00fcrgen Klopp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_pitch", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Football pitch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feyenoord", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Feyenoord"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohamed_Salah", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mohamed Salah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hat-trick", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hat-trick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Future", "label": "dmoz/Society/Future", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Moving_and_Relocating", "label": "dmoz/Home/Moving and Relocating", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Moving_and_Relocating/Moving", "label": "dmoz/Home/Moving and Relocating/Moving", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Future/Essays", "label": "dmoz/Society/Future/Essays", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Future/Predictions", "label": "dmoz/Society/Future/Predictions", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 84}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Liverpools-Darwin-Nunez-gives-major-transfer-update-amid-FC-Barcelona-links.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9540390", "eventUri": "eng-9540390", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1607843137254902, "wgt": 110, "relevance": 1}

{"id": 232016164, "title": "First municipal elections held in Cyprus Republic in 1986", "text": "The first municipal elections in Cyprus were held on May 25, 1986, and citizens voted for mayors and municipal councils. These were the first municipal elections after the establishment of the Republic of Cyprus in 1960. Before 1960 municipal elections were held by the British colonial government. The last elections were held in 1953. Cyprus then had 15 municipalities, namely Municipality of Nicosia, Municipality of Limassol, Municipality of Famagusta, Municipality of Larnaca, Municipality of Paphos, Municipality of Kyrenia, Municipality of Athienou, Municipality of Akanthou, Municipality of Lefkoniko, Municipality of Karavas, Municipality of Kythrea, Municipality of Lapithos, Municipality of Morphou, Municipality of Pano Lefkara and Municipality of Poli Chrysochous. In 1962, two years after Cyprus gained its independence, the Municipality of Lysis was also founded but soon ceased to exist. After Cyprus\u2019 independence, these municipalities continued with appointed mayors until 1986. Because of the Turkish invasion in 1974, the territory of 8 of these municipalities was occupied by the Turkish troops (Ammochostos, Kyrenia, Lefkoniko, Karavas, Lapithos, Akanthou, Kythrea and Morphou Municipality). These municipalities continued to maintain their legal status. In addition, in 1986 the Municipality of Lysi was reestablished. On February 23, 1986, referendums were held and 11 new municipalities were introduced namely the Municipality of Agios Athanasios, Municipality of Agios Dometios, Municipality of Aglantzia, Municipality of Aradippou, Municipality of Engomi, Municipality of Kato Polemidia, Municipality of Lakatamia, Municipality of Latsia, Municipality of Mesa Geitonia, Municipality of Paralimni and Municipality of Strovolos. In total, in 1986, municipal elections were held for 7 old municipalities and for 11 new ones. The voters cast their vote for the Mayor and municipal councillors on two different ballots. Voting for the election of mayors was done by the simple majority system (whichever candidate received the most votes was elected mayor). Voting for the election of municipal councilors was carried out with proportional representation. Each voter chose either a party combination or an independent candidate. If he/she chose a party combination, he could additionally vote for municipal councillors of that combination. There was a total of 69 candidates for 18 town halls and 920 for councillors while the total number of voters in all 18 municipalities was 214,944. These include refugees, who voted in their places of temporary residence and 9,305 people who cast their vote for the first time as they turned 18. Voting was mandatory. A total of 197,678 (91.967%) voted for mayors and 197,668 (91.962%) for municipal councillors.

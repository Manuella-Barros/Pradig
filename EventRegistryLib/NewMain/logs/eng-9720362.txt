The meeting lasted over two hours, with Slovakia the only country not taking the floor.\n\n\"It's unprecedented that the presidency would be reprimanded in such a way by all the others,\" said one senior EU diplomat, who was granted anonymity to speak about a confidential meeting.\n\nSince Budapest took over the rotating EU presidency last week, Hungarian leader Viktor Orb\u00e1n has undertaken self-declared \"peace missions\" to Kyiv, Moscow, Beijing and Washington.\n\nHungary says it doesn't know what all the fuss is about.\n\nAt a packed press conference in Brussels on Wednesday, Hungary's EU Minister J\u00e1nos B\u00f3ka said the discussions \"were not on behalf of the EU, these were not conducted based on a mandate from the European institutions, these were not conducted in the name of the European Union or any of its institutions.\n\n\"The prime minister is aware of the responsibilities that the presidency of the Council of the EU entails, and in [the] spirit of this responsibility he debriefed the president of the European Council and heads of state and governments on these visits.\"\n\nBut EU ambassadors pushed back against those claims on Wednesday, echoing many of their leaders who have already publicly condemned the trips.\n\nThe envoys noted the \"timing and sequencing of the meetings, [the] use of presidency hashtags, and the reaction of [Russian President Vladimir] Putin,\" an EU diplomat said, like others in this piece granted anonymity to speak freely. \"The lines were clearly and deliberately blurred. And Orb\u00e1n went counter to the letter and spirit of EUCO conclusions, thereby hurting EU unity,\" the diplomat added, referring to summits of EU leaders.\n\nAnother EU diplomat marveled that \"it took nine days for the Hungarian presidency to lose any smidgen of trust they had left,\" adding that Orb\u00e1n's \"actions are not serving the EU or peace. They play into the hands of Putin and his war project. The Hungarian slogan to 'make Europe great again' is more about making Russia great again at this stage.\"\n\nWhat can be done?\n\nEuropean capitals are struggling to go beyond public condemnations of Hungary's rogue presidency, however.\n\n\"In reality, the options are limited,\" an EU official said. Changing the order of the presidencies or shortening Hungary's six-month turn at the helm of the EU might have been options at one point, but are now legally fraught as the presidency is underway, the official said.\n\nFormer Luxembourg Foreign Minister Jean Asselborn said the Court of Justice of the EU \"would rule against\" such moves, while \"other countries would fear creating a precedent.\"\n\nIn the Wednesday meeting not a single ambassador raised the possibility of scrapping the presidency, several EU diplomats said.\n\nBut that doesn't mean there isn't a lot of anger.\n\nEstonian MEP Riho Terras is rallying support in the European Parliament to call on the bloc's top leadership to trigger Article 7 of the Treaty on the European Union against Hungary. It's the most serious political sanction that can be imposed on a member country, and involves suspending its right to vote on EU decisions. But it's also a nuclear option that European capitals have shied away from so far.\n\n\"He's smart,\" the EU official said, referring to Orb\u00e1n. \"He knows exactly how far he can go without risking immediate retaliation.\"\n\nInstead, several EU ambassadors threatened \"practical consequences\" if Orb\u00e1n continues to pursue his current path, two other EU diplomats said.\n\nThe most immediate option would be to boycott the informal meetings of ministers organized by Budapest. At the first Hungarian Council meeting on Tuesday, only eight countries (including Hungary) sent a minister. Several EU ambassadors on Wednesday suggested a boycott of the informal meeting of foreign ministers in Budapest at the end of August.\n\nB\u00f3ka played down that possibility during his press conference, saying Hungary has received no indication that other member states won't be sending ministers to meetings.\n\nBut that doesn't mean retaliation is off the table in future, EU diplomats warned. One described Wednesday's meeting as a \"yellow card.\"\n\nGiven how fast the situation with Budapest has escalated in just the first fortnight of its presidency, nobody is ruling out even firmer pushback from Brussels if Orb\u00e1n crosses more red lines, such as in his dealings with former U.S. President Donald Trump.\n\nBrussels may yet consider showing Budapest the red card.

During a meeting on Wednesday, Hungary's envoy to the EU, B\u00e1lint \u00d3dor, faced an unprecedented verbal lashing from his European counterparts regarding Hungary's management of the EU presidency.\n\nThe intense session, which lasted over two hours, saw all nations except Slovakia expressing their discontent.\n\n\"It's unprecedented that the presidency would be reprimanded in such a way by all the others,\" noted a senior EU diplomat, who spoke to POLITICO on condition of anonymity due to the private nature of the discussions.\n\nSince taking over the rotating EU presidency last week, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n has initiated self-proclaimed \"peace missions\" to Kyiv, Moscow, Beijing, and Washington.\n\nHungary, however, appears baffled by the uproar. At a crowded press conference in Brussels on Wednesday, Hungary's EU Minister J\u00e1nos B\u00f3ka asserted that these discussions \"were not on behalf of the EU, these were not conducted based on a mandate from the European institutions, these were not conducted in the name of the European Union or any of its institutions.\"\n\nOrb\u00e1n has insisted that his initiatives align with the responsibilities of the EU presidency, noting that he has briefed the president of the European Council and other EU leaders on his visits.\n\nDespite these assurances, EU ambassadors on Wednesday challenged Hungary's claims, mirroring public condemnations from various leaders. The envoys raised concerns about the \"timing and sequencing of the meetings, [the] use of presidency hashtags, and the reaction of [Russian President Vladimir] Putin.\" They accused Orb\u00e1n of intentionally blurring lines, violating EUCO conclusions, and damaging EU unity.\n\nAn EU diplomat remarked that \"it took nine days for the Hungarian presidency to lose any smidgen of trust they had left,\" arguing that Orb\u00e1n's actions benefit Putin's agenda and undermine EU efforts for peace.\n\nEuropean capitals, despite their frustration, are finding it challenging to take concrete actions against Hungary's controversial presidency.\n\n\"In reality, the options are limited,\" acknowledged an EU official. Altering the order of presidencies or shortening Hungary's term is legally complicated now that the presidency has commenced.\n\nFormer Luxembourg Foreign Minister Jean Asselborn suggested that the Court of Justice of the EU \"would rule against\" such actions, and other countries might fear setting a risky precedent.\n\nDuring the meeting, no ambassadors proposed the possibility of cancelling the presidency, though the anger is significant.\n\nEstonian MEP Riho Terras is rallying support in the European Parliament to invoke Article 7 of the Treaty on the European Union against Hungary, which would suspend Hungary's voting rights on EU decisions. However, this severe sanction has been avoided by European capitals so far.\n\nOrb\u00e1n appears to be adept at navigating the limits of EU tolerance. \"He knows exactly how far he can go without risking immediate retaliation,\" observed an EU official.\n\nWhile eliminating Hungary's presidency is not on the table, several EU ambassadors have suggested practical retaliations if Orb\u00e1n persists in his current approach. One immediate measure could be boycotting informal ministerial meetings organised by Budapest.\n\nAt the first Hungarian Council meeting on Tuesday, only eight countries (including Hungary) sent ministers. Some ambassadors proposed boycotting the informal foreign ministers' meeting in Budapest at the end of August.\n\nB\u00f3ka downplayed this threat during his press conference, stating that Hungary has received no signals that other member states would avoid sending ministers to these meetings.\n\nNonetheless, EU diplomats cautioned that future retaliatory measures remain possible. One diplomat described Wednesday's meeting as a \"yellow card.\"\n\nGiven the rapid escalation in tensions during the initial fortnight of Hungary's presidency, further pushback from Brussels is conceivable if Orb\u00e1n crosses more red lines, particularly in his interactions with former U.S. President Donald Trump. Orb\u00e1n is scheduled to meet Trump in Florida this Thursday, less than a week after his meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow. According to Bloomberg, the meeting at Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate is described as informal, with no expectation that Orb\u00e1n will lay the groundwork for a peace deal between Ukraine and Russia.",

This primarily involves his international activities, notably the fake \"mediation\" regarding the cessation of the war in Ukraine, where he leverages his European presidency status without the consent of other EU members.\n\nThere is serious discussion within the EU about prematurely ending Hungary's presidency. The EU has never previously terminated a presiding country's term, but it is likely. Now it is about a political will.\n\nRead more in the article by Sergiy Sydorenko, a European Pravda editor - Unpunished Orb\u00e1n: How Hungary \"heading\" the EU breaks rules in negotiations about Ukraine.\n\nEuropean Pravda detailed Viktor Orb\u00e1n's visit to Kyiv, which was unusually appropriate for him.\n\nEU officials indicated that Orb\u00e1n, upon receiving additional EU powers, would become more constructive. In Kyiv, Brussels and European capitals, Orb\u00e1n's statements about using his EU Council powers for Ukraine's benefit were heard.\n\nHowever, things quickly deteriorated. Days after visiting Kyiv, Orb\u00e1n went to Moscow, breaking the informal veto on EU leaders' visits to the Kremlin, raising many questions but few surprises. After Moscow, Orb\u00e1n visited China, presenting these trips as his peace efforts, claiming he is mediating between Ukraine and Russia.\n\nThis week, Orb\u00e1n is in the US for a NATO summit, likely trying to meet Donald Trump to \"sell\" his mediation services.\n\nHowever, he faces backlash and condemnation from EU colleagues.\n\nIt is crucial to note that holding the EU Council presidency does not make Hungary the \"EU boss.\" On the contrary, Hungary is even more constrained. Its statements must be coordinated with other states. In certain areas, including foreign policy, Orb\u00e1n has no right to act without the unanimous agreement of EU members and the authorisation of the EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, Josep Borrell.\n\nOrb\u00e1n has violated this rule and developed a whole theory justifying his actions. Brussels is preparing for a tough discussion with Hungary on this matter.\n\nMoreover, the EU has a new way to punish Hungary without requiring unanimity.\n\nThere are no legal obstacles to stripping Hungary of its EU Council presidency at the next summit.\n\nSources in Brussels emphasise such a chance, which will likely be a \"soft threat\" to Orb\u00e1n at the EU member states' ambassadors meeting on Wednesday and later at the EU Foreign Affairs Council meeting on 22 July.\n\nHowever, will Europeans have the political will to take this step? The answer looks negative as of today.", "source": {"uri": "eurointegration.com.ua", "dataType": "news", "title": "\u0404\u0432\u0440\u043e\u043f\u0435\u0439\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0434\u0430"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viktor_Orb\u00e1n", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Viktor Orb\u00e1n"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungary", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hungary"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Hungary"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyiv", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kyiv"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pravda", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pravda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_of_the_European_Union", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Council of the European Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Russian invasion of Ukraine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_state_of_the_European_Union", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Member state of the European Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO_summit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NATO summit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow_Kremlin", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Moscow Kremlin"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brussels", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brussels"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brussels"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Belgium"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Affairs_Council", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Foreign Affairs Council"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josep_Borrell", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Josep Borrell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summit_(meeting)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Summit (meeting)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_the_Council_of_the_European_Union", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of the Council of the European Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Representative_of_the_Union_for_Foreign_Affairs_and_Security_Policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Foreign policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://img.eurointegration.com.ua/images/doc/0/f/0f57944-------1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9720362", "eventUri": "eng-9720362", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-22", "textStart": 2574, "textEnd": 2581}], "sentiment": -0.09019607843137256, "wgt": 197, "relevance": 1}

EU institutions, including the Commission, have started procedures against Hungary for EU treaty non-compliance. The European Court of Justice recently imposed heavy fines on Hungary for failing to correctly apply EU asylum and migration laws.\n\nThe EU froze \u20ac30bn in funding for Hungary from the Covid-19 recovery fund and the EU Cohesion Fund. Part of that money was recently released, but only in order to get Hungary to support further political and military assistance for Ukraine.\n\nHungary threatens to oppose Ukraine's' bid to join the EU. Under Orb\u00e1n, the country has maintained good economic ties with Russia, despite EU sanctions, and opposes EU aid for Ukraine, including \u20ac6.5bn of EU funds currently proposed for military aid.\n\nIn general, Hungary dislikes the EU's liberal social policies.\n\nOrb\u00e1n has even repeatedly likened EU membership to Hungary's more than four decades of Soviet occupation.\n\nNevertheless, Hungary has taken on the rotating presidency, the system by which the 27 member states take it in turns to do a six-month stint running the European Council.\n\nFrom July 1 to December 31, Hungary is expected to lead meetings of the Council, set its agenda, and head up its negotiations with the European Parliament as an \"honest broker\", an impartial mediator.\n\nHungary must chair meetings of EU members in all fields except foreign or euro zone matters, and seek consensus among EU member states. That won't be easy, because never in the history of the EU has an incoming presidency member state had as many conflicts of interests with the EU.\n\nAlready, Hungary's motto for its presidency, \"Make Europe Great Again\", has raised liberal EU eyebrows because of its resemblance to Donald Trump's \"Make America Great Again\" tagline.\n\nIt refers to Orb\u00e1n's assertion that the EU has lost competitiveness due to misguided Brussels decisions, of which the green transition is the chief example. Orb\u00e1n says imposing regulations that hinder industry and burden citizens is no longer sustainable. He says farmers' costs have risen, even while they try to navigate increasingly complex green obligations.\n\nEU farmers will welcome the sympathetic voice. However, it may not count for much because the six months of Hungary's presidency will be a quiet period in terms of legislation.\n\nThat is always the case after European parliamentary elections because big decision-making halts while the new European Commission is being appointed and settles in.\n\nThe important presidency role of moderator in trilateral legislative negotiations between the European Commission, the European Council and the European Parliament will be almost non-existent until the new institutions settle in.\n\nThe EU's lengthy summer break early in the Hungarian presidency, will also limit Orb\u00e1n's opportunities to upset EU leaders such as Ursula von der Leyen, bidding to continue as European Commission President, but unlikely to get any help at all from Orb\u00e1n, one of her member state enemies.\n\nIt may be a quiet six months for the EU, but the farmers who made their mark with protests earlier this year will welcome some peace, after years of green transition and CAP changes emanating from Brussels.", "source": {"uri": "irishexaminer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Irish Examiner"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Member states' permanent representatives in the Council discussed the issue on Wednesday.\n\nOrb\u00e1n visited Ukraine a few days after taking over the presidency, after which he also went to Russia, the meeting of the Turkic Council in Nagorno-Karabakh and then on to China. On several occasions, he posted photos of his trips with the logo of the Hungarian EU presidency, while during their press conference in Moscow, Vladimir Putin said that he believed Orb\u00e1n was there representing the EU presidency, a claim the Hungarian prime minister did not refute on the spot. Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade P\u00e9ter Szijj\u00e1rt\u00f3 blurred the line between the EU presidency and the \"peace mission\", with statements such as: \"The first week of the Hungarian EU presidency is over, and it should now be clear to everyone that this will be a peace mission for the next six months\"\n\nMembers of the Hungarian government can go wherever they want and negotiate bilaterally with whomever they like, but the rotating presidency is in no way authorized to represent the EU in matters of foreign policy, the President of the EU Council and the EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy have both pointed out.\n\nAccording to the sources of N\u00e9pszava and Euractiv, it was following a Polish proposal that EU ambassadors discussed the issue on Wednesday. They stand at a level below the ministers in the Council, so the rotating presidency belongs to the Hungarian government in this body as well, and it ensured that only the envoys were present at the meeting, thus preventing details from being leaked, the papers write.\n\nBoth newspapers report that the Hungarian representative argued that Viktor Orb\u00e1n had negotiated strictly on a bilateral basis, and that his meetings were aimed at trying to find out the feasibility conditions for a ceasefire.\n\nAll the senior diplomats, except for the Slovak ambassador made it clear that they did not consider the explanation credible, because the meetings took place within a few days of the start of the Hungarian Council presidency, the government used the Hungarian presidency logo in its reports and Russian President Vladimir Putin made a point of mentioning that Hungary was the country currently holding the presidency. The ambassadors believe that the Hungarians clearly and deliberately blurred the line between the bilateral and a presidency visit.\n\n25 of the 26 ambassadors \"expressed widespread dissatisfaction or anger at the way the Hungarian presidency has started\".\n\nA diplomat also told Politico that the envoys discussed the timing and sequence of the meetings, the use of the presidency hashtag and Putin's reaction. \"The lines were clearly and deliberately blurred\", and Orb\u00e1n also went against the \"letter and spirit\" of the European Council's conclusions, \"thereby harming the unity of the EU\". In the European Council, which is similar to the Council of the EU but functions as a separate institution, it is not the ministers but the heads of state and government who sit together, and their conclusions are reached unanimously, which means that Viktor Orb\u00e1n had to have agreed to them too.\n\n\"It took nine days for the Hungarian presidency to lose what little confidence there was left\"\n\n- another diplomat said, describing the situation.\n\nAt the meeting, the Council's legal service confirmed that the rotating presidency can only have a limited role in the EU's foreign representation, Politico reports. According to a Financial Times article, spotted by Portfolio, the legal service saw the case as a breach of the EU's founding treaties (i.e. the EU's quasi-constitution). The documents forbid any action that could jeopardise the attainment of the Union's objectives, and Orb\u00e1n has also breached the requirement according to which all members must conduct foreign policy in a spirit of loyalty and mutual solidarity, the paper writes.\n\nThe principle of sincere cooperation - or loyal cooperation as it is officialy used - is a principle that was also stressed by Hungarian EU Affairs Minister J\u00e1nos B\u00f3ka at the presentation of the presidency's programme. It is enshrined in one of the EU's founding treaties and has previously been the legal basis for lawsuits at the EU Court of Justice, for example against the Hungarian government in February 2023. Eric Mamer, the European Commission's chief spokesperson, warned last week, when asked about the Hungarian government's loyal cooperation in light of the Moscow trip, that they all operate \"under the supervision of the Court of Justice of the European Union\".\n\nOn the other hand, N\u00e9pszava and Politico have confirmed what Hungarian EU Affairs Minister J\u00e1nos B\u00f3ka said on Wednesday: once the debate concluded, no country's representative proposed ending or shortening the presidency. The decision on the duration of the presidencies is taken by the Council itself, so in principle it is possible that the beginning of the next-in-line Polish presidency might be brought forward.\n\n\"The reality is that the options are limited\"\n\n- an EU official told Politico, adding that at some point it would have been possible to change or shorten the order of presidencies, but that this could be legally problematic now that it is already under way. \"He's smart,\" he said of Orb\u00e1n, \"he knows exactly how far he can go without risking an immediate backlash\". Former foreign minister of Luxembourg, Jean Asselborn said, also arguing that such a move would fail in the EU court, and that other member states might be wary of setting such a precedent.\n\nTwo diplomats said that several ambassadors had floated \"practical consequences\". Informal meetings of the Council are usually held in the country holding the presidency, and the first such meeting in Budapest was attended by conspicuously few ministers. According to Politico, several ambassadors have suggested boycotting the informal meeting of foreign ministers at the end of August, but such meetings do not involve any decision-making, so it is rather symbolic if member states are represented at a lower level or not at all. Speaking at his press conference, B\u00f3ka said that there had been no indication from any government that they would not send ministers to the meeting.\n\nEuractiv understands that the rotating presidency will also be discussed at the European Parliament's Conference of Presidents, a body made up of the leaders of political groups. MEPs will meet next week for the first time since the body was elected in June. The Council of Ministers normally has to negotiate legislation with the EP and it needs to be agreed by both bodies. It will be a long time before the EP will be able to do this, as, for example, the parliamentary rapporteurs responsible for a piece of legislation will need to be appointed first.\n\nThe Liberals told Euractiv that boycotting the presidency has been on the table since the Kyiv trip, but the paper said it was still uncertain what steps would be taken.\n\nAs usual, the presidency will present its programme at the first meeting following the inaugural session, but Viktor Orb\u00e1n's speech is almost certain to be delivered in September at the earliest, given the busy programme of the new body.\n\nThe EP questioned whether the Hungarian government would be suitable for the presidency on two separate occasions ahead of the elections, but did not go as far as boycotting cooperation altogether.", "source": {"uri": "telex.hu", "dataType": "news", "title": "telex"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N\u00e9pszava", "type": "wiki", "score": 5,

Where traditionally the whole College of Commissioners travel to the respective host country, which was expected to take place just after the summer break.\n\n\"The EU's and member states' communication has left not a slither of doubt where everyone stands on this whole issue,\" a fourth diplomat said, adding that they, however, did \"not expect anything we do or say to make an impression on Hungary to change tracks.\"\n\nWhen it comes to Hungary's stint at the EU helm, the bloc's officials and diplomats stress that with the transition to the next institutional term, there are close to no files left where Budapest could \"leave a negative mark on.\"\n\n\"For the rest, we need to make sure that nothing he does in Moscow [or elsewhere] stands for what we stand for,\" a fifth EU diplomat said.\n\n\"The only thing we have are the instruments that we already use: Article 7 which is on the table and running, but will not have an impact quickly, the EU's conditionality mechanism and Recovery and Resilience Facility (RRF) funds,\" they added.\n\nLegal experts and observers, meanwhile, are going even further, saying that Hungary's actions could be seen as going against the EU's treaties.", "source": {"uri": "euractiv.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "EurActiv.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The minister spoke about the upcoming programs of the Hungarian presidency of the Council of the EU, but EUrologus stressed that the questions raised by the journalists were not about that.\n\nAt the request of member states, their permanent representatives to the EU had been discussing Viktor Orb\u00e1n's \"peace missions\" at their meeting on Wednesday. The body is also part of the Council, so they also meet under Hungarian presidency. As N\u00e9pszava previously reported, the rotating presidency had banished the report on the Hungarian prime minister's recent visits abroad among \"other\" agenda items, listed after the important topics to be debated, which inherently limited the space for discussion.\n\nOrb\u00e1n visited Ukraine a few days after taking over the presidency, after which he also went to Russia, the meeting of the Turkic Council in Nagorno-Karabakh and then on to China. On several occasions, he posted photos of his trips with the logo of the Hungarian EU presidency, while during their press conference in Moscow, Vladimir Putin said that he believed Orb\u00e1n was there on behalf of the EU presidency, a claim the Hungarian prime minister did not refute on the spot. Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade P\u00e9ter Szijj\u00e1rt\u00f3 blurred the line between the EU presidency and the \"peace mission\", with statements such as: \"The first week of the Hungarian EU presidency is over, and it should now be clear to everyone that this will be a peace mission for the next six months\".\n\nThe problem is that, while members of the Hungarian government can go wherever they want and negotiate bilaterally with whomever they like, the rotating presidency is in no way authorized to represent the EU in matters of foreign policy.\n\nAs previously reported, the Council is the only one with the authority to influence the duration of the Presidency. D\u00e1niel Heged\u0171s, an analyst at the German Marshall Fund, suggested on X (formerly Twitter) that this option is in principle still available. For instance, the beginning of the Polish presidency that will follow the Hungarian one could be brought forward to 1 September, right after the end of the summer break. There is no mention in the N\u00e9pszava article discussing this, whether this is something that has been considered in relation to any government so far, but Politico says that such plans are starting to gather momentum. \"Not yet,\" a diplomat said when asked if they would consider shortening Hungary's presidency. \"But I will say again: not yet.\"\n\nAs EUrologus reported on Wednesday, B\u00f3ka said there were currently no motions before member states that would affect the mandate of the Hungarian presidency. He expressed his confidence that the presidency \"can contribute to the EU in the next six months\".\n\nB\u00f3ka also said that Orb\u00e1n had not organized the trips of his \"peace mission\" in the name and on behalf of the EU. He did inform member states and the president of the European Council afterwards, although he is not obliged to do so. \"I am deeply shocked by the tragic loss of life,\" the minister said of the Russian attack on a children's hospital in Kyiv, adding that this also underlines the need for a sustainable peace.\n\nThe European Commission is also starting to get fed up\n\nThe European Commission has not analyzed the standards, the body's senior spokesman said on Wednesday in response to a question. Eric Mamer recommended that this question be referred to the Council, as it is for the Council to decide, and added that they would cooperate with the rotating presidency as far as the EU treaties allow.\n\nMamer had previously indicated that it was not certain that they would visit Budapest in September, although such a visit is customary during all presidencies. (The visit has already been postponed once, citing scheduling difficulties.)\n\nAccording to Szabad Eur\u00f3pa, the body's budget chief Johannes Hahn canceled his visit to Budapest, originally scheduled for just an hour and a half on Monday at the last minute, citing \"recent events\" according to his colleagues. The only official confirmation provided to the paper was that the visit had indeed been canceled.\n\nThe body was also not represented at commissioner level at the first informal meeting of the Council presidency in Budapest. At Tuesday's press conference at the end of the event, M\u00e1rton Nagy, who chaired the meeting on competitiveness, was not able to say why this was so. \"It was not our decision. We welcome everybody, our doors are kept open,\" the Minister for Economic Affairs said.\n\nThe European Commission said on Wednesday that an EU commissioner, Werner Hoekstra, would be present at the next informal Council meeting in Budapest on 11-12 July.\n\nCould member states be launching a silent boycott?\n\nHowever, Szabad Eur\u00f3pa and Politico also noted that not only was the EU Commissioner absent from the meeting on competitiveness, there were hardly any ministers present. It is not uncommon for a member state to be represented at a lower level, for example by state secretaries, if, as in the Hungarian government, some areas (such as the environment in Hungary) do not have a minister responsible for them, and summer holidays may have affected attendance as well.\n\nHowever, Politico was told that Orb\u00e1n's trips to Moscow and Beijing \"definitely played a role\" in this, and that the idea of a boycott is \"gaining momentum\". \"The low turnout at the Competitiveness Council is probably just the beginning.\"\n\n\"It was a good start\"\n\n- B\u00f3ka said in spite of all of the above on Tuesday, according to the paper, adding that the presidency \"has been very political and very active from the beginning\". At Wednesday's press conference, he described it as \"distinctive\", according to EUrologus, while a Dutch journalist commented that it seemed as if he and the minister were not on the same planet.",

Whichever member-state is at the helm drives the EU's legislative agenda and represents the Council in negotiations with the EU's other law-making institutions. The presidency lacks hard powers, however, and given the complicated and consensual nature of EU decision-making, its priorities often get watered down or subsumed by crises and unexpected developments.\n\nThe incoming Hungarian presidency is worrying. Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n's years-long, consistent policy of undermining EU unity on Ukraine and other issues prompted many to question whether Hungary should should take on the role. The Hungarians will hold the presidency immediately after the EU elections and when key positions in the Commission are still being negotiated. This, and the technical nature of the presidency's responsibilities, including planning and chairing meetings, will limit major policy-level damage. The main risks will be to day-to-day functioning and the EU's reputation.\n\nAn EU beset by wayward leadership could have a harder time navigating challenges, especially in a geopolitically uncertain period. Hungary could undermine unity in the face of foreign policy challenges, such as a potential Trump presidency, Russian advances in Ukraine or further instability in the Middle East. While Hungarian diplomats reassured critics that it will be \"a presidency as usual,\" the provocative motto of 'Make Europe Great Again' complementing its priorities cast doubt on that.\n\nAn EU beset by wayward leadership could have a harder time navigating challenges, especially in a geopolitically uncertain period.\n\nThere are ways to limit Hungary's impact. Other member-states could decide to prevent it from chairing discussions related to the rule of law; they could also boycott important events. But with as many as seven governments containing populist parties sitting in the Council from this autumn, there may be little appetite to do so. In fact, there could be more overlap with Hungary's positions than previously expected.\n\nThe commotion before its start made it clear that Hungary's presidency will not be business as usual. Last year, a European Parliament resolution questioned Hungary's ability of \"credibly fulfilling\" the role, arguing that a country subject to rule of law sanctions should not represent the EU. Several politicians called for Budapest's presidency to be postponed altogether, and experts claimed that the move was feasible. In the end, however, the so-called presidential trio, the three countries co-ordinating their priorities, remained intact. The other two members of the trio, Spain and Belgium, argued that postponing Hungary's presidency would be \"counterproductive\".\n\nBut why does the presidency matter? In general, two tasks are expected of the country fulfilling this role: to run things smoothly and to build consensus. These tasks mean that the country in charge can influence EU policies and politics.\n\nThere are a number of organisational responsibilities that fall on every presidency, from planning and chairing meetings (except for foreign affairs, which is the remit of the High Representative, and the Eurogroup, which includes eurozone countries), to co-ordinating policy work, and representing the Council in negotiations with other institutions. A good presidency should also be an 'honest broker' and work to build consensus between member-states ahead of Council meetings. This is a diplomatically challenging part of the job.\n\nPresidencies can have an impact on the EU's agenda. This is more likely if their programme fits with broader priorities, if they have realistic objectives, if they can avoid conflict with other EU institutions, and, of course, if they are a larger and more influential member-state. The rotating presidency can, to some extent, leave an imprint on the country fulfilling the role as well. As Belgian Foreign Minister Hadja Lahbib indicated when lambasting Hungary at the end of the Belgian presidency, the experience should remind the country of its responsibilities in the EU. It should help train its civil servants and political elites and infuse them with a sense of belonging in the Union.\n\nIt would be incorrect to say, however, that the presidency itself plays an important role in setting the agenda for the EU as a whole. In fact, the role of presidencies as agenda-setters narrowed after the 2009 Lisbon Treaty created the posts of President of the European Council and High Representative for Foreign Policy. Their impact is more indirect - they can drive forward certain initiatives by actively including them on the agenda or, on the contrary, they can try to stall on certain topics.\n\nThe main question ahead of the Hungarian presidency is whether - and to what extent - Budapest will want to impose controversial or outright destructive items on the agenda and whether it can fulfil its role as an honest broker.\n\nWhen it comes to controversial issues, the presidency is institutionally constrained in its ability to put items on the agenda. To be successful, it needs to have support of other member-states or EU institutions. In practice, this means that Hungary cannot just hijack the presidency to further its own agenda - it can propose topics, but these need to be approved by the Council or the Committee of Permanent Representatives (Coreper), the preparatory body of the Council.\n\nSimilarly, the presidency may be able to stall certain items, but it cannot block initiatives outright. Should the Commission or member-states want to progress on the Article 7 sanctions mechanism - which could result in Hungary losing its voting rights - they can request its inclusion on the agenda. The Commission, for example, was particularly active on Poland's Article 7 process in the past. Hungary has been stuck in the first stage of the mechanism, during which member-states have to decide whether there is a \"clear risk of a serious breach\" of EU values, for six years. Organising hearings on it to progress further is clearly possible - even if it is unlikely given that the new Commission is just being set up.\n\nWhether Hungary will fulfil its role as an honest broker is a more difficult question. Hungary's previous chairmanship in 2011 started with Orb\u00e1n comparing the EU to a Soviet dictatorship. The presidency had to navigate choppy waters following the sovereign debt crisis, while its priorities on cohesion policy, enlargement and economic growth were overshadowed by the adoption of a controversial media law and a new constitution at home. Despite this significant conflict between its politics and administrative responsibilities, Hungary performed relatively well as an honest broker at the time.\n\nBudapest seems much more interested and invested in forcing its agenda onto Brussels this time around. While no presidency has 'failed' so far - not even the eurosceptic Czech presidency back in 2009 - its public stance on several issues as the \"stick between the spokes,\" in Viktor Orban's own words, makes it ill-disposed to steer the continent. Hungary has been a very difficult partner on many issues ranging from Russia to China, and it has been willing to use its veto to block EU decision-making. The fear is that Hungary will prove a fundamentally dishonest interlocutor - and one that is unlikely to credibly represent the Council in negotiations.\n\nThe fear is that Hungary will prove a fundamentally dishonest interlocutor - and one that is unlikely to credibly represent the Council in negotiations.\n\nA mitigating factor ahead of the presidency is that it will take place in a lame-duck period of institutional transition. It will take several months for the new Parliament and the new Commission to start their work. It is doubtful that there would be much legislative progress before late autumn, diminishing Hungary's importance in the driver's seat.\n\nThe current trio's overarching priorities include competitiveness, delivering the green and digital transitions, defence and EU values. Drilling down into the details, the three countries had promised to work on the mid-term review of the current seven-year multi-annual financial framework (MFF), deliver progress towards a capital markets union and develop plans to reform the EU's cohesion policy. The original programme of the trio reaffirmed a commitment to the rule of law but also promised to finalise the migration pact. At the two-thirds mark, the Spanish and Belgian presidencies shepherded through several important agreements, including on the migration pact, the Artificial Intelligence Act and the Nature Restoration Law.\n\nHungary's priorities focus on competitiveness, defence, migration, enlargement, agriculture, demography and cohesion policy. In each of these seven areas there is possibility for discord, but the Hungarian presidency is unlikely to trigger major policy damage in the next six months.\n\nCohesion policy has always been a priority for the Central European region and especially for Hungary, which has been its largest net beneficiary. The Hungarian presidency's dedicated focus on the topic is not surprising, given the suspension of a significant chunk of EU funds to the country due to rule of law concerns. Budapest will undoubtedly try to recover the money during the presidency. It could additionally slow-walk attempts at reforming cohesion funding and oppose the introduction of performance-based criteria similar to those in the Reconstruction and Resilience Facility (RRF).\n\nZselyke Csaky is a senior research fellow at the Centre for European Reform.", "source": {"uri": "pubaffairsbruxelles.eu", "dataType": "news", "title": "pubaffairsbruxelles.eu"}, "authors":

Budapest has been reprimanded by other European Union nations for Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban's visits to Moscow and Beijing following the country's takeover of the Presidency of the Council of the EU, Politico writes.\n\n\"It's unprecedented that the presidency would be reprimanded in such a way by all the others,\" the media outlet cited a senior EU diplomat as saying. Another source said that \"it took nine days for the Hungarian presidency to lose any smidgen of trust they had left.\" In his view, Orban's \"actions are not serving the EU or peace.\"\n\nSeveral EU ambassadors warned of \"practical consequences\" for Hungary if Orban continued to pursue his current path. \"Changing the order of the presidencies or shortening Hungary's six-month turn at the helm of the EU might have been options at one point, but are now legally fraught as the presidency is underway,\" Politico writes, citing an EU official. Another diplomat said that the EU in fact showed \"a yellow card\" to Hungary at the July 10 meeting of the Permanent Representatives Committee.\n\nThe Euractiv news website reported earlier that EU member states had not presented any specific measures to end Hungary's presidency of the Council of the EU due to Orban's trips to Russia and China. According to Euractiv, despite \"wide dissatisfaction\" with Budapest's actions, the only decision that some EU nations made was to send \"more junior officials than expected to informal meetings organized by the Hungarians.\"\n\nOrban visited Moscow on July 5 to discuss ways to resolve the conflict in Ukraine with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Earlier, on July 2, the Hungarian premier made a trip to Kiev where he held a meeting with Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky. On July 8, Orban met with Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing to exchange views on the prospects for resolving the Ukraine crisis.", "source": {"uri": "tass.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TASS"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viktor_Orb\u00e1n", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Viktor Orb\u00e1n"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungary", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hungary"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Hungary"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politico", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Politico"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Hungary", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of Hungary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_the_Council_of_the_European_Union", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of the Council of the European Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budapest", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Budapest"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Budapest"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Hungary"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brussels", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brussels"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brussels"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Belgium"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euractiv", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Euractiv"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volodymyr_Zelenskyy", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Volodymyr Zelenskyy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyiv", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kyiv"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russo-Ukrainian_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Russo-Ukrainian War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarians", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hungarians"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_People's_Republic_of_China", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "President of the People's Republic of China"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xi_Jinping", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Xi Jinping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_Ukraine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "President of Ukraine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_state_of_the_European_Union", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Member state of the European Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Putin", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vladimir Putin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 75}], "image": "https://cdn-media.tass.ru/width/1200_4ce85301/tass/m2/en/uploads/i/20240711/1423731.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9720362", "eventUri": "eng-9720362", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brussels"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Belgium"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-11", "textStart": 10, "textEnd": 17}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-10", "textStart": 1029, "textEnd": 1036}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-05", "textStart": 1538, "textEnd": 1544}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-02", "textStart": 1647, "textEnd": 1653}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-08", "textStart": 1768, "textEnd": 1774}], "sentiment": 0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 172, "relevance": 1}

The bloc has previously taken steps against Hungary for perceived democratic backsliding, including invoking Article 7 proceedings.\n\nThis led the European Parliament to question whether Viktor Orb\u00e1n's country should be the one to drive forward the EU's agenda.\n\nHungary's EU presidency predecessors, the Belgians, rushed against time to close as many files as possible, as many raised questions about Budapest's ability to act as an unbiased leader during its term.\n\nHe talked about the importance of combating \"illegal migration\", describing it as an \"existential threat\" to Europe and pointed to the Hungarian model as a successful example of border protection.\n\nThis, for example, involves constructing physical barriers, enforcing strict legal measures, and increasing border patrols.\n\nFor Deputy Minister at the Ministry of Interior Bence R\u00e9tv\u00e1ri, illegal migration is a critical European task, referencing the economic migrants travelling through multiple safe countries to reach the EU without proper visas or permits.\n\nThese priorities reflect long-standing national policies that have often put the country at odds with broader EU views.\n\nHungary's border protection measures have been criticised by other EU member states, with the EU Court ordering a \u20ac200 million fine over the country's migration policy in June.\n\nInstead, the Hungarians want to emphasise supporting traditional family models and addressing demographic challenges, said Kov\u00e1cs.\n\nThough B\u00f3ka talked about \"European security, defence, agriculture, cohesion, enlargement, migration and demographic challenges,\" all of which the presidency will also focus on.\n\nThis concentration on family policies and demographic challenges is an extension of the Hungarian government's domestic agenda, aimed at boosting population growth and reinforcing traditional family structures, which attracted a backlash from LGBTQIA+ organisations.\n\nIn the same vein, Euractiv already reported, that the health agenda will focus on addressing cardiovascular diseases, mental health, promoting organ donation, and improving the overall quality of healthcare services. This was also confirmed during one of the briefings.\n\nHungary is aiming to foster economic growth and improve competitiveness within the EU. This includes addressing economic challenges and enhancing the EU's competitive edge globally. Kov\u00e1cs called this a major challenge, with Hungary aspiring to have a charter on this matter by the end of the presidency.\n\nThe focus on competitiveness aligns with Hungary's domestic agenda of economic development and attracting foreign investment.\n\nAnother official cited an example with the AI Act, comparing Australia's swift investor support with the EU's lengthy approval process, saying that such delays, which can exceed two years, hampers competitiveness in fast-evolving sectors like artificial intelligence.", "source": {"uri": "euractiv.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

At least two people were killed at the hospital and about 50 were injured, including seven children.\n\nPressed on whether Hungary's overtures to Putin were appropriate given the Kremlin's coinciding atrocities in Ukraine, B\u00f3ka replied: \"The bombing, it's horrible, it's terrible.\"\n\n\"I think the loss of human life and the damage that has been caused in this war (...) just underscores the importance of the peace mission of the prime minister of Hungary,\" he explained.\n\nIn a letter addressed to Michel and EU leaders, seen byGerman news agency DPA, Orb\u00e1n justified his Moscow trip given its economic knock-on effect on the 27-country bloc.\n\nOrb\u00e1n is reported to have claimed in the letter that Putin expects a rapid collapse on the Ukrainian side in the coming months.\n\nB\u00f3ka told Euronews that the Hungarian premier's trip was designed to \"find out whether there is any willingness\" on either side for a ceasefire and assess how the EU institutions can be \"helpful\" in brokering a way out of the conflict.\n\n\"Quite a few member states believe that our strategic objectives can be reached by military means on the battlefield. The intention of the prime minister was to provide additional information and clarification that could feed into these discussions,\" B\u00f3ka said, adding that Orb\u00e1n had confidentially briefed both Michel and EU heads of state and government on the outcome of his trip.\n\nZelenskyy has consistently said Ukraine will not contemplate talks with Moscow until Russian forces leave all Ukrainian territory, including Crimea.\n\nThe minister also explained that Hungary saw China as a key actor in future peace talks despite Beijing's role in enabling Moscow to circumnavigate Western sanctions by supplying banned components to Russia's military sector.\n\nThe EU has already sanctioned Chinese companies forhelping the Kremlin get hold of lethal forbidden items.\n\nOrb\u00e1n stands ready to address the newly-elected European Parliament to set out his priorities for the EU presidency, branded by the Hungarian government under the slogan \"Make Europe Great Again\", the minister also said.\n\nIt is convention for the leader of the country taking up the presidency to speak during the first plenary session of their rotation, but Orb\u00e1n has not been invited to the inaugural sitting in Strasbourg scheduled for next week.\n\nTwo sources familiar with the issue told Euronews that Orb\u00e1n's speech before the hemicycle had been intentionally blocked by the Parliament amid discomfort over his trip to Russia and continuous efforts to derail EU aid to Kyiv.\n\nBut B\u00f3ka brushed off any suggestions that Orb\u00e1n had been excluded for political motives, claiming that the fact that only one plenary session takes place this July makes it feasible to delay the prime minister's speech.\n\n\"I would stop short of seeing any, any political intricacies here,\" he explained. \"I think it's completely understandable that for the first session of the European Parliament, when they elect their own officials and when they elect or do not elect the president designate of the Commission, it's perfectly clear that they have no time for this.\"\n\n\"I believe that this is only a scheduling issue.

Signatures to the appeal are being collected from all members of the European Parliament.\n\nComplete text added to the press release:\n\nDear President von der Leyen,\n\nDear President Michel,\n\nDear President Metsola,\n\nWe, the undersigned Members of the European Parliament, call on you to do your utmost to suspend Hungary's voting rights in the Council according to the procedure set out in Article 7 of the Treaty on the European Union.\n\nThe Hungarian Presidency of the Council of the European Union has barely started, and Prime Minister Orb\u00e1n has already caused significant damage by exploiting and abusing the role of the Council Presidency.\n\nMr Orb\u00e1n undertook several diplomatic visits, notably to visit Putin in Russia and Xi Jinping in China, during which he intentionally misrepresented his empowerments. In his so-called \"peace mission\" Prime Minister Orb\u00e1n deliberately left the impression that he was acting on behalf of the entire European Union, whereas in reality he has no authority to represent the EU or any other EU Member States apart from his own. This is clearly evidenced by the fact that several EU leaders, diplomats, EU officials, and even High Representative Borrell have felt the need to publicly emphasize that these trips took place exclusively in the framework of bilateral relations, and that the Hungarian Prime Minister is not representing the EU in any form. This kind of behavior amounts to usurping the powers and prerogatives of the EU Member States in the filed of foreign policy.\n\nFurthermore, Mr Orb\u00e1n is actively undermining common EU positions. For example, by pushing for a ceasefire at any cost, instead of a ceasefire on Ukraine's terms. Not only is he exceeding his powers when he pretends to represent the EU as a whole, but he is actively pursuing a policy agenda which is contrary to common EU positions. He is seeking to undermine existing EU decisions, the entire decision-making process, as well as EU unity on highly important matters. This cannot be allowed to continue.\n\nBearing in mind the aforementioned abuses of power, we call on you to take decisive action as soon as possible in order to limit further damage, not only to the credibility of the EU as a whole, but also regarding the current geopolitical situation. This requires real actions, such as suspending Hungary's voting rights in the Council, since practice has shown that mere verbal condemnations of this situation have no effect.\n\nCommentsCopy", "source": {"uri": "news.postimees.ee", "dataType": "news", "title": "Estonian news - news.postimees.ee"}, "authors": [{"uri": "riho_terras@news.postimees.ee", "name": "Riho Terras", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viktor_Orb\u00e1n", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Viktor Orb\u00e1n"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_the_Council_of_the_European_Union", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of the Council of the European Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_the_European_Parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Member of the European Parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungary", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hungary"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Hungary"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ursula_von_der_Leyen", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ursula von der Leyen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffrage", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Suffrage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Michel", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Charles Michel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roberta_Metsola", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Roberta Metsola"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Hungary", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of Hungary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Council", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "European Council"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Parliament", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "European Parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Commission", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "European Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estonia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Estonia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Estonia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xi_Jinping", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Xi Jinping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_state_of_the_European_Union", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Member state of the European Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Putin", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vladimir Putin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josep_Borrell", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Josep Borrell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceasefire", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ceasefire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Representative_of_the_Union_for_Foreign_Affairs_and_Security_Policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Foreign policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geopolitics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Geopolitics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilateralism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bilateralism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://f8.pmo.ee/mrN5mm0SAuTZ8ram8d_FFj0u_zI=/1200x630/filters:focal(1604x491:2289x1335):format(webp)/nginx/o/2024/06/12/16145467t1h3969.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9720362", "eventUri": "eng-9720362", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 162, "relevance": 1}

Welcome to Wednesday's Brussels Playbook, where we'll start by revisiting an item from our previous edition. Our observation about a bus-riding MEP prompted several to write in with this baffled question: Do MEPs have the right to a driver?\n\nIndeed, they can request a lift from the Parliament's fleet of 32 cars, which includes, as of 2020, 11 BMWs, 11 Mercedes and a Jaguar. Another 145 vehicles were leased. (H/t Aitor Hern\u00e1ndez-Morales.)\n\nTHE EASY RESPONSE TO ORB\u00c1N? JUST LEAN OUT: In Europe's capitals, two schools of thought are emerging on how to deal with Hungary's rogue Council presidency: Quiet quitting vs. overachieving.\n\nTHE QUIET QUITTERS are essentially delegators. Don't send a political bigwig to Budapest for Council discussions. Send a faceless bureaucrat. That was the approach on display Tuesday, when only seven countries (plus Hungary) sent their industry ministers to Hungary's first Council meeting, on Chinese EV tariffs.\n\n**A message from GAIA: Kind words are not enough. Animal welfare needs a more serious and constant commitment of the European institutions with adequate resources, transparency, accountability, and proper enforcement. We need an EU Commissioner for Animal Welfare. Ms von der Leyen, will you propose this necessary integration in the new Commission? #EUforAnimals**\n\nSending their regrets: Internal Market Commissioner Thierry Breton, usually ubiquitous, opted out, with the Commission represented instead by a top civil servant. Germany swapped Sven Giegold, its state secretary for economic affairs, with a lower-ranking official at the last minute. France only sent the director of its European department. And Lithuania snubbed the hosts by sending its ambassador based in Budapest.\n\n\"This is the Hungary effect,\" one national EU official told Koen Verhelst, who was on the ground in Budapest. Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n's trips to Moscow and Beijing \"certainly play a role,\" the official added. \"The Commission's not going to do his marketing for him.\" More from Koen for Trade Pros.\n\nSetting a precedent: Diplomats preparing for today's meeting of EU ambassadors in Brussels liked what they saw. The idea of a \"boycott\" of informal Council meetings (the negotiations that take place in the presidency's country, instead of Brussels) is \"gaining traction,\" said one EU diplomat. \"The low turnout at the Competitiveness Council was probably just the beginning.\"\n\nOr not: European Climate Commissioner Wopke Hoekstra is planning to attend the informal meeting of environment ministers taking place today and tomorrow, his team told POLITICO's Zia Weise.\n\nTHE OVERACHIEVERS are looking for a more dramatic confrontation, boldly and creatively wielding the force of the Treaties to shut Orb\u00e1n down.\n\nLaying the groundwork: Most member countries have signed on to a Polish demand for a discussion about the legality of Orb\u00e1n's \"peace mission.\" They want the legal service to weigh in on the role of the Council presidency on external relations, and more details on the call for \"sincere cooperation\" in the Treaties, as one diplomat described the situation to Barbara Moens.\n\nPessimism: Ultimately, scenarios like starting the Polish presidency early don't seem likely. \"The other EU foreign ministers should now make it clear in a joint statement that Orb\u00e1n does not speak for them,\" Luxembourg's long-standing former Foreign Minister Jean Asselborn told my colleague Jakob Hanke Vela. Echoing what we've heard privately from current EU diplomats, Asselborn argued that attempts to shorten the Hungarian presidency would fail. \"The ECJ would rule against that, and other countries would fear creating a precedent,\" he said.\n\nCivil society assist: NGOs are definitely in the Overachievers camp. Alberto Alemanno, The Good Lobby founder and longtime agitator for curtailing the Hungarian presidency, filed a complaint with the Council's secretariat and EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell late Tuesday. It asks them to \"put an end to these ongoing violations\" by the Hungarian presidency. However, Alemanno didn't have a clear answer when we asked what, concretely, the likes of Council Secretary-General Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Blanchet are supposed to do to stop Orb\u00e1n from jetting off to geopolitical hotspots.\n\nBUDAPEST'S REBUTTAL\n\nWHAT ORB\u00c1N WILL LIKELY TELL AMBOS: Orb\u00e1n is likely to push his version of a Russia reality check on EU ambassadors during a debrief on his \"peace mission,\" also added to the Coreper agenda. \"The Russian side estimates the monthly losses and casualties of the Ukrainian forces at 40-50 thousand soldiers,\" he said in a letter to Council President Charles Michel, viewed by POLITICO, before pressing the case for an immediate cease-fire. Csongor K\u00f6r\u00f6mi and Barbara Moens have the key points -- and context Orb\u00e1n left out -- here.\n\nDROPPING THE APOLITICAL PRETENSE: In the runup to the presidency, Orb\u00e1n's emissaries sent mixed signals about the approach they'd take. At this point, they've pretty much dropped the pretense that they'll be a neutral referee on EU debates.\n\n\"Good start\" is how Hungary's EU Affairs Minister J\u00e1nos B\u00f3ka characterized the first nine days, adding that it's been \"very political and very active from the beginning.\" Speaking at the summer reception of the Fidesz-linked Foundation for a Civic Hungary, B\u00f3ka said the presidency would \"represent the voice of those who want to change and keep alive the hope of change for the next institutional cycle.\" (Scroll down to see more on who was there, including members of the newly formed Patriots for Europe group.)\n\n\"Buckle up because the Hungarian presidency is coming,\" B\u00f3ka concluded. He's set to take reporters' questions at a Brussels press conference today.\n\nNATO AND UKRAINE\n\nBIDEN'S BIG DAY AT NATO SUMMIT: U.S. President Joe Biden is in the spotlight today as he leads a three-hour meeting of NATO leaders in Washington. His health continues to be a top political issue in the U.S., even though he's refusing to step aside after his disastrous performance in the debate against Donald Trump.\n\nWith the eyes of the world on him, Biden delivered a forceful speech on Tuesday night to kick off three days of meetings in the U.S. capital. Hoping to extinguish doubts about his fitness for the job domestically and demonstrate that he can still rally allies to Ukraine's cause for the long haul, the president spoke clearly and appeared energized, my colleagues Alexander Ward and Myah Ward reported. \"Ukraine can and will stop Putin,\" Biden said at the ornate Mellon Auditorium, where the North Atlantic Treaty was signed in 1949. \"Russia will not prevail. Ukraine will prevail.\"\n\nZELENSKYY DODGES ON TRUMP: Ukraine's President is also in Washington for the summit, where he was inevitably asked for a view on the prospect of Donald Trump returning to the White House. But Zelenskyy was diplomatic, saying he's had good conversations with the former president in the past and is optimistic he would have them again if Trump is reelected.\n\nThe Ukrainian leader implored the U.S. -- and the rest of the world -- not to wait for the outcome of the presidential election to take decisive action to resist the Russian invasion. \"It's time to step out of the shadows to make strong decisions to act and not wait for November.\"\n\nMAR-A-NATO: European leaders are hedging their bets. As POLITICO's Miles Herszenhorn reports, Baltic defense ministers \"made a forceful case for the NATO alliance that was conspicuously Trump-friendly\" at a POLITICO panel on Sunday. The FT notes that EU delegations are sneaking meetings with Trump advisers on the side. And Polish President Andrzej Duda told POLITICO in an interview he's happy to work with whoever American voters choose as president -- as long as that person shares his goals of securing Europe from Russia.\n\nMAKING EUROPE DEFEND AGAIN: The EU's foreign policy chief Josep Borrell touted the Union's progress on defense and emphasized its commitment to Ukraine during a speech on Tuesday at an EU Defense Night event, Miles writes in to report. \"We know, we are fully aware, we are convinced that we have to improve the capacity of our armies, of our defense in order to be able to defend ourselves,\" Borrell said. \"Not as an alternative to NATO -- there is not an alternative to NATO for the territorial defense of Europe -- but to make NATO stronger and share the burden.\"\n\nKEEP MINCING THE WORDS: Negotiations for the leaders' declaration remain open ahead of expected publication on Thursday, according to the French Ambassador to NATO Muriel Domenach. \"As is always the case, deputies re-read the text until the last moment,\" Domenach said in reply to my colleague Stuart Lau on X, adding: \"Absolutely no worries.\"\n\nNEW NATO COMMAND IN GERMANY: White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan said the alliance will create a new command that would help train and bolster Ukraine's armed forces. It'll be based in Germany and led by a three-star general.\n\nBoosting links to Kyiv: Sullivan also announced that 20 countries and the U.S. would join a new \"Ukraine compact.\" NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg, he added, would appoint a new NATO military representative to Kyiv to bolster the ties between Ukraine and the alliance.\n\nNew air defenses: The U.S., the Netherlands, Italy, Romania and Germany said overnight that they'll each chip in a new strategic air defense system for Ukraine.\n\nCountermoves: The Wall Street Journal has a detailed report on how Moscow is learning to defeat precision munitions in Ukraine.\n\nLOWEST COMMON DENOMINATOR? Lithuania's Foreign Minister Gabrielius Landsbergis didn't sound especially impressed with what NATO could deliver for Ukraine at this summit, Stuart writes in to report. \"Allies really want to stick to a consensus, avoid any political battle when it comes to negotiations, and bring what you could call a clean text that has a bar [that's] lower, but where everyone finds an agreement ... [and] some level of comfort,\" Landsbergis told the Hudson Institute Tuesday.\n\nUKRAINE THREAT SPILLS OVER: American military bases around Europe were placed on heightened alert last week after intelligence reports suggested Russian actors were plotting sabotage, CNN reports. It's part of a pattern of fires and explosions in recent months that authorities linked to Moscow in Riga, London, Warsaw, Prague and Paris.\n\nTURKEY PLAYS LAST-MINUTE GAMES: According to a NATO diplomat, Turkey made a \"rare\" last-minute intervention as allies prepare to seal the declaration, Stuart also wrote in to report. A few hours before Playbook went to pixel, Turkish diplomats suggested that the 2026 summit take place in Turkey and that NATO provide additional air defense for the easternmost country in the alliance, the diplomat said.\n\nTurkey's careful balancing act: Ankara is friends with Russia, supplies weapons to Ukraine, and is wary of the EU playing a greater role in defense, El\u00e7in Poyrazlar reports.\n\nPOLITICAL FAMILIES\n\nPOLITICAL GROUPS DIVIDE UP VICE PRESIDENCIES: The political families in the European Parliament have doled out the 14 vice presidencies, which give MEPs prestige and a big say on how the institution is run. Playbook's Eddy Wax has this dispatch ...\n\nShare of the spoils: According to two people familiar with the negotiations, the European People's Party group should get the presidency (the incumbent Roberta Metsola is so far the sole candidate), plus three vice presidents. The Socialists and Democrats are in line for four vice presidencies. Renew Europe and the European Conservatives and Reformists would get two, and the Greens and Left groups would get one each. The Patriots are also entitled to a vice president, but centrist groups will likely block them by proposing another candidate from one of their groups. The vote is next Tuesday.\n\nWhat Wilm\u00e8s wants: Ex-Belgian Prime Minister Sophie Wilm\u00e8s aims to be one of Renew's veeps, Le Soir reports.\n\nANOTHER FAR-RIGHT GROUP? Yet another far-right political grouping could today be launched in the European Parliament, as the \"Europe of Sovereign Nations\" -- which will probably be known as the Sovereignists -- takes shape. Around half the group's MEPs will be from the Alternative for Germany party, though probably without Maximilian Krah, its scandal-prone lead candidate.\n\nCzech mates: Our reporter Ketrin Jochecov\u00e1 reported that a far-right Czech party has already announced the group will be founded today -- despite giving few details. Some parties, like Poland's Confederation and the sole French Reconquest party MEP, were on the fence Tuesday. A meeting to launch the is tentatively scheduled at 6 p.m. Playbook bumped into AfD MEP Christine Anderson huddling from the torrential rain at Beer Factory on Place du Luxembourg, and she said they have the numbers.\n\n**As NATO leaders gather in Washington for a tumultuous three-day meeting, POLITICO's reporters will blanket the summit, and will come back with details on the public declarations as well as gossip from the corridors. Join us online on July 12 at 4 p.m. CEST, register here.**\n\nURSULA 2024\n\nSOCIALISTS QUIZ VDL: The S&D group spent three hours questioning Ursula von der Leyen in Parliament Tuesday evening, Eddy writes in to report. The vote on her second term is tentatively scheduled for Thursday next week.\n\nPositive vibes: MEPs leaving the meeting were hesitant to say whether she had got their votes, though a few intimated it was a yes. One gave von der Leyen an 8 out of 10 grade. In general, the feeling was that she had performed well. Von der Leyen faced questions on topics dear to the Socialists' hearts including housing, labor rights, the Green Deal, cohesion, media freedom, collective bargaining and blocking the far right in the Parliament. Spanish MEP Hana Jalloul said she wanted to hear more on foreign affairs but praised von der Leyen, saying she didn't dodge questions.\n\nNo firewall against ECR: According to three people in the room, von der Leyen said that the new Patriots for Europe grouping will be covered -- as expected -- by a cordon sanitaire but the ECR won't be. She won't negotiate with the ECR to get their votes, she said, but she will meet them. That will happen at an unspecified date in the coming week.\n\nHome run: The Socialists' President Iratxe Garc\u00eda called on von der Leyen to create a commissioner for housing in a tweet posted during the meeting, something VDL said she'd be open to, according to two participants.\n\nMixed opinions: Has she got the vote of the French Socialists, widely perceived as one of the most critical delegations inside the S&D? \"We are open to all possibilities,\" said French MEP Christophe Clergeau. The delegation would meet today to debrief. \"We haven't had all the answers for the moment tonight,\" he added.\n\nPriorities: Many Spanish MEPs were seen leaving before the meeting ended. After all, Spain vs. France was starting at 9 p.m.\n\nGreens up next: Von der Leyen will have to walk an even finer line today, as she meets with the Parliament's Greens in a bid to expand her coalition. Her meeting with The Left is slated for Monday.\n\nNOW READ THIS: Will the secret ballot help von der Leyen's prospects, or hurt them? POLITICO considers the different scenarios.\n\nRECOUNTS AND LAWSUITS\n\nRECOUNT FOR CZECH SEAT: Czech former EPP MEP Michaela \u0160ojdrov\u00e1 is not ready to say bye to Brussels just yet. The Czech Supreme Court recently ordered a recount of preferential votes -- as in votes cast for a specific candidate, not just the list -- after she complained that a counting mistake cost her reelection. \u0160ojdrov\u00e1, who was only 615 votes short of winning a new term, estimates that about 5,500 of her preferential votes erroneously went to other candidates.\n\nCould really suck for the other guy: If the court proves her right, the newly elected MEP Ond\u0159ej Kol\u00e1\u0159, who was on the same candidate list, would lose both his European and Czech mandate (he resigned as a Czech MP after having been elected an MEP).\n\nUNSEATED CATALAN MEP MOVES TO SUE METSOLA: Catalan separatist MEP Toni Com\u00edn will file suit against European Parliament President Roberta Metsola at the Court of Justice of the EU today, alleging the Maltese politician is violating his fundamental rights by refusing to recognize his reelection.\n\nOngoing saga: As we've reported previously in this space, Com\u00edn was reelected to his European Parliament seat in June. He won't go back to Spain out of fear of arrest, but he can't get certified on the official list of Spanish MEPs without an in-person visit to Spain's Central Electoral Board. And the Parliament's position is that if Com\u00edn's name isn't on the list, he cannot be seated.\n\nSee you in court: After receiving no reply to a letter he sent to Metsola on Friday -- seen by POLITICO -- Com\u00edn is appealing to the EU's top court. He has reason to expect the Luxembourg court's sympathy: The lawmaker already sued one of Metsola's predecessors, former EP president Antonio Tajani, for refusing to seat him and separatist leader Carles Puigdemont for identical reasons after the 2019 election. While a final ruling on that case is still pending, earlier this year the Court of Justice's top adviser sided with the Catalans and said Tajani had broken EU law by refusing to recognize their election and barring them from the Parliament.\n\n-- Jean Luc M\u00e9lenchon and the French delegation of The Left will hold a press point in the Parliament at 12:30 p.m. on the impact of the French legislative elections on EU policies.\n\n-- European Economic and Social Committee President Oliver R\u00f6pke chairs the plenary session on the \"Priorities of the Hungarian Presidency of the Council of the European Union\" at 3.00 p.m., with Hungary's Minister of EU Affairs J\u00e1nos B\u00f3ka. Watch.\n\n-- EU High Representative Josep Borrell is in Washington, D.C.; gives a keynote address at the EU Defense Night.\n\n-- Justice Commissioner Didier Reynders is in The Hague, the Netherlands, where he participates in a Eurojust high-level conference with prosecutor generals from Latin American countries.\n\n-- Education Commissioner Iliana Ivanova is in Bologna, Italy; participates in the G7 ministerial meeting on science and technology.\n\n-- Enlargement Commission Oliv\u00e9r V\u00e1rhelyi is in Chi\u0219in\u0103u, Moldova; signs the EBRD residential energy efficiency project; meets Moldova's President Maia Sandu.\n\nLET THE BELGIAN COALITION TALKS BEGIN: Five Belgian parties have agreed to enter formal coalition talks led by Bart De Wever, the president of the nationalist New Flemish Alliance (N-VA).

This can and should be achieved by explicitly mentioning Animal Welfare in the name of the relevant Directorate-General and the job title of the competent EU Commissioner. In the existing context, the Commissioner's responsibility would become for \"Health, Food Safety and Animal Welfare\". 208 MEPs joined this call in the 2019-24 term of the Parliament, and nearly 100 have done it already since the 2024 elections. 70% of the European citizens (IPSOS, June 2024) want an EU Commissioner for Animal Welfare. Animal welfare needs adequate resources, clarity of roles, transparency, accountability, and proper enforcement. This is why a Commissioner for Animal Welfare is necessary. Ms von der Leyen, will you listen to the call of EU citizens and propose this necessary integration in the new Commission? #EUforAnimals**", "source": {"uri": "politico.eu", "dataType": "news",

The role of the Council presidency is of a much more technical nature. For example, the country assuming the presidency chairs meetings of the different Council configurations, with the important exception of the Foreign Affairs Council.\n\nFor the same precaution, the so-called \"trio of presidencies\" was institutionalised - to shoulder a weaker, inexperienced or problematic member state into fulfilling its duties without rocking the boat.\n\nThis was one of the safeguards after the big bang enlargement of 2004-2007.\n\nThose who decided on the rules of the Lisbon Treaty wanted to limit the powers of individual countries assuming the presidency role. Their fear was precisely the hypothesis that regimes like Orb\u00e1n's could one day be tasked with the EU presidency.\n\nThey were right.\n\nThe Lisbon treaty entered into force in December 2009. Orb\u00e1n took power in May 2010 and ever since, he has taken measures to secure his power forever. Who knows what the future holds for him and the EU.\n\nAs regards his \"peace tour\", we believe Orb\u00e1n is misleading the public opinion, in Hungary and abroad. The general public doesn't read the Maastricht and the Lisbon treaties.\n\nBut we don't think he can mislead his foreign counterparts. Any regime, be it in Russia or Beijing, has professional advisers who know the EU inside out. One of their jobs is precisely to identify its weaknesses and make use of them.\n\nOf course, for the Russian propaganda, Orb\u00e1n is \"our man in the EU\", who is now in charge. For Putin, who can usually only meet Eurasian dictators, to pose for photos with the representative of the EU is a bonanza.\n\nBut now we are arriving at the more important question. Why is Orb\u00e1n doing this?\n\nThe short answer is simple: Because he can.\n\nMaybe the time to talk about peace has not arrived. But is there any other EU leader capable of embarking on a similar initiative?\n\nThe leaders of the EU institutions worry about their jobs.\n\nUrsula von der Leyen has anxieties whether MEPs will confirm her as Commission president for a second mandate. Charles Michel is uncertain if the Belgian federal government will be able to give him a ministerial job after his term as Council president expires later this year.\n\nEmmanuel Macron should normally be the first among equal heads of state and governments. But he has self-inflicted himself such a handicap with the snap election he called (and lost), that he isn't even sure if he can propose the name of the new French commissioner without unleashing a storm of criticism.\n\nOlaf Scholz is weak domestically, wrestling with a disparate coalition government, and undecisive on the foreign front.\n\nMost of the other heads of state and government lack the calibre, or have domestic issues to worry about.\n\nMeloni is in better shape, but she is probably right to hold her horses at this stage. She needs to become stronger in the EU, and for this, she doesn't need to be suspected of making eyes at Putin.\n\nOrb\u00e1n took the driving seat because it was empty.\n\nAnd let's not dismiss Orb\u00e1n's chances of achieving something, especially if Donald Trump, who famously called him \"leader of Turkey\", returns to the White House.\n\nRussia is in a bad shape and Putin has interest in putting a temporary end to this catastrophic war he personally started. The next peace conference, whether we like it or not, will be in the presence of both Zelenskyy and Putin.\n\nShould we be surprised then if the only European sitting at the table then will be Orb\u00e1n? Should we be surprised if he drafts the agenda of the talks, bringing to the discussion issues like the rights of minorities in Ukraine under the future settlement?\n\nAnd he is not doing it only for the show. For Orb\u00e1n, it's first for the money.\n\nPeace conferences are also about financing and reconstruction, and Orb\u00e1n will be in pole position to carve out his share in terms of contracts.\n\nThis also means bringing more corruption into Ukraine. But who cares?\n\nToday and tomorrow (11 and 12 July) the Hungarian Presidency will host an informal meeting of Environment Ministers in Budapest, where they will discuss COP29, the circular economy's potential to boost competitiveness and water scarcity.\n\nThe Conference of Presidents is set to discuss Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n's recent controversial trips to Kyiv, Moscow, and Beijing in a meeting on Thursday (11 July), even considering possible repercussions, Euractiv has learned.\n\nMonika Be\u0148ov\u00e1, a Slovak MEP for Robert Fico's Smer-SD (NI) party, proposed ending negotiations with the Party of European Socialists (PES), which suspended the party's membership last year, claiming she would instead present a \"different plan\" to her colleagues.\n\nGermany plans to largely exclude Chinese components such as those from Huawei and ZTE from its 5G mobile network by 2029, with an interim step in 2026, according to a media report.\n\nWith the right in flux, increasing fragmentation of the political landscape in member states, and the need for von der Leyen to secure a governing majority in the European Parliament, group formation has never looked so messy.

For \"the room\" read the EU - and the West more broadly - and, for both the enfant terrible and the adult in the room, Viktor Orb\u00e1n, prime minister of Hungary, and there you have it: the shortest possible description of what the big brouhaha about his recent trips to first Kiev, then Moscow and Beijing is really all about.\n\nThe EU, in reality, has no policy worthy of the name to address the single most urgent issue in Europe at this point, namely, how to end the war in and over Ukraine. As Orb\u00e1n himself has correctly pointed out in an interview with the German newspaper Die Welt, all the EU does is copy America's \"policy of war.\" In other words, Brussels, like Washington, has ruled out diplomacy and compromise to end the war. Indeed, if the US and EU had engaged in genuine diplomacy, then the war could have been prevented or ended quickly, in spring 2022. Orb\u00e1n may be putting too much weight on - and too much trust in - a single Western leader, but that is his larger point when he claims that the large-scale war would not have happened if Angela Merkel had still been in office as chancellor of Germany.\n\nAgainst this backdrop of EU non- or, really - anti-diplomacy, Orb\u00e1n has dared stand out by going on what, using social media to great effect, he has loudly announced as his \"peace mission.\" That appeal to public opinion has, of course, angered his detractors even more: Not only has he dared speak to \"the autocrats\" out there, he has also addressed the masses at home in the West. Perish the \"populism\"! Yet it is a traditional and legitimate move among politicians worth their salt: Before practicing the art of - back then - radio reach-out to perfection in World War II, no lesser a leader than young Charles de Gaulle, in his 'The Edge of the Sword', recognized the absolute need to \"dominate opinion,\" since \"nothing is possible\" without that true \"sovereign.\"\n\nYet Orb\u00e1n's \"populism\" is not even the main problem this time. That rather has to do with the fact that he has turned his own initiative into a foil against which the EU's mainstream's lack of imagination, rigidity, and, last but not least, complete subservience to the US are glaringly obvious. In the EU it is now going \"rogue\" to do what is not only obvious but reasonable and urgently needed: seek at least dialogue instead of stonewalling. That reflects badly on the EU.\n\nSo does the fact that the Hungarian leader has a habit of realism where the EU establishment prefers fictions maintained by - aggressively enforced - group think. Orb\u00e1n has no time for the silly idea that Russia is a threat to European states inside NATO, he observes - rightly - that Russian policy is rational, and he recognizes the fact that Russia cannot be defeated in Ukraine. All of this is true, and all of it is taboo in Brussels.\n\nTo complete his register of sin and heresy, the Hungarian prime minister also has the temerity to cultivate a memory and a sense of history. In a Newsweek editorial, he has just reminded NATO of two essential facts: that the alliance was founded for defensive purposes (to which it has badly failed to stick) and that the recent habit of treating a future war with \"the world's other geopolitical power centers,\" that is, Russia and China, as de facto inevitable can turn into a \"self-fulfilling prophecy.\"\n\nWhen you are thin on substance, rely instead on formalities and, if need be, legalism. Much of the EU elites' response to Orb\u00e1n's initiatives has taken that self-revealing form. As soon as Orb\u00e1n dared go to Moscow, leading EU cadres, such as Josep Borrell, Ursula von der Leyen, and Charles Michel could hardly stop falling over themselves with denunciations and reminders that Hungary's leader does not speak for the European Union, even if his country holds the rotating presidency of the Council of the EU. That is true, but to be frank, uninteresting. What is intriguing instead is the compulsive need to keep saying it.\n\nBy now, after Orb\u00e1n's visit to China, this odd, anxious, slightly comical, and exorcism-like ritual of banishing the faintest suspicion the EU could, almost by accident, have engaged in an act of diplomacy is reaching an elevated level of displaced collective aggression. A bloc that can't even name the fact that its Washington \"ally\" has committed an act of war and eco-terrorism against it by having Nord Stream detonated, is now producing voices - some of them courageously anonymous - calling for punishing Hungary, for instance by cutting short its Council presidency.\n\nWe also see painstaking analyses of how Orb\u00e1n's trips could be construed to be in contradiction with EU treaties. Here, the key idea is to accuse him of infringing on not merely the great if, really, rather baseless and improvised \"don't-play-with-the-Russians\" rule but, more profoundly, the duties that all member states have toward the EU's Common Foreign and Security Policy, and, beyond that, toward a \"general principle of sincere cooperation.\"\n\nAnd that is where we have definitely entered the realm of self-defeating irony. The essence of this attempt to go after Orb\u00e1n - and Hungary - would be to remind everyone that the EU has paragraphs stacked away in its treaties that, if read in the right (wrong) way, massively restrict national sovereignty, deep into the realm of foreign policy. Anyone silly enough to try to use that cudgel against a past master of political Judo and convinced believer in sovereignty like Orb\u00e1n can as well drub himself right away.\n\nBut there are sadder ironies in play here as well. What Orb\u00e1n is schooling an irate EU elite in is the use of leverage that comes from maintaining effective freedom of action; and that freedom of action does not stem from great military power or a massive population. While Hungary's forces are modern, it remains a country of not quite 10 million people. Rather the secret of Orb\u00e1n's room for maneuver is a classical instrument of the comparatively weak - balancing between bigger powers by cooperating with all of them but selling out to none of them.\n\nIt's a hard act, but it is - and here's the sad irony - exactly what Ukraine's president Vladimir Zelensky should have done. Maintaining neutrality, formally but also de facto, would have been Ukraine's best chance not only to avoid war but also to benefit from - instead of being devastated by - its challenging, but not unique, geopolitical location.\n\nIt is true that Hungary and Ukraine are not perfect matches: For Hungary there has been an option of leveraging independence from inside NATO and the EU that Ukraine does not have. But Kiev could have carved out a place fundamentally similar, if, as it were, on the other side: as closer to Moscow than to Brussels and Washington but still a player with its own weight, interests, and views, facilitated by also maintaining contacts with the West, just as Hungary does with Russia and China.\n\nIf anyone, moreover, had a mandate for trying out such a strategy, it was Zelensky. Following through on Minsk II - already in place when he entered office - and ending the conflict before massive escalation would have been the first step to doing so. Yet the Ukrainian leader opted for a much more primitive and, predictably, extremely risky approach: siding with one side to the total exclusion of the other. Zelensky is, of course, annoyed with Orb\u00e1n. But for the wrong reasons: Where the Ukrainian president may see a Putin ally, he should recognize a superior practitioner of a realistic foreign policy in the national interest that he could have learned from.", "source": {"uri": "rt.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "RT"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viktor_Orb\u00e1n", "type": "person", "score": 5,

But other capitals believe Orb\u00e1n abused that status to give his meeting with Putin more weight.\n\nPutin is under EU sanctions, and the bloc's stated position -- which Orb\u00e1n has agreed to -- condemns Moscow as the aggressor in the Ukraine war. Orb\u00e1n endorsed immediate peace talks to end the war, in direct contravention of stated EU and Nato policy that there can be no such discussions without Ukraine's backing.\n\nUS secretary of state Antony Blinken said any leader visiting Russia or China must make Nato's positions clear that the military alliance is \"not going anywhere, Ukraine's not going anywhere, the European Union is not going anywhere\", he said on Wednesday from the sidelines of the Nato summit.\n\nRussia will \"continue to be ostracised\" so long as it continues to attack civilian targets such as its missile strike on a children's hospital in Kyiv earlier this week, Blinken said.\n\nMichel described the strike on the hospital as a \"war crime\", saying it showed Putin's \"political answer\" to Orb\u00e1n's so-called peace mission.\n\nMichel said he had met Orb\u00e1n at the Nato summit and was in touch with the other EU leaders to decide how to proceed.\n\n\"With an attempt to divide the union\u2009.\u2009.\u2009. we have to avoid falling into a trap,\" said Michel. \"We don't want to punish ourselves in a collateral effect of trying to punish someone\u2009.\u2009.\u2009. Let's be smart.\"\n\nMany EU member states have discussed boycotting the traditional informal ministerial meetings to be held in Hungary during the country's presidency, several diplomats told the FT. A smaller group of capitals has also begun informal discussions on how to use the EU treaty to restrict Orb\u00e1n's room for manoeuvre during the presidency.\n\nSome EU officials have privately floated stripping Hungary of the rotating presidency, officials said.\n\n\"EU institutions should not have fallen into Orban's trap in the first place,\" said one senior diplomat. \"EU legislation should be used to protect the union.\"\n\nElina Valtonen, Finland's foreign minister, told the FT that Orban needed to understand it was impossible for countries to be \"abstract, neutral observers\" of what Russia depicts as its conflict with the west, and that all sides must be clear in where they stand.\n\nOrb\u00e1n's actions made a strong case for removing unanimous decision-making in the EU,

Orb\u00e1n's visit to Kyiv", "body": "On 2 July, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n and President Volodymyr Zelensky met in Kyiv. This was his first visit to Ukraine in seven years, taking place a day after Budapest assumed the rotating presidency of the Council of the European Union. The two leaders discussed both bilateral issues, including the rights of the Hungarian ethnic minority in Zakarpattia, as well as the Ukrainian-Russian war. During a brief press conference, Orb\u00e1n emphasised that he had encouraged Kyiv to call for a ceasefire, as this, in his opinion, could expedite peace negotiations. Zelensky, for his part, said that the dialogue, which was initiated during the visit could be used as a starting point for developing a comprehensive document that would regulate relations between Ukraine and Hungary.\n\nAlthough no binding agreements were made, the tone of the discussions was surprisingly positive, which contrasts sharply with Orb\u00e1n's previously unfriendly rhetoric towards Ukraine. The mere fact that the meeting took place in Kyiv is a step towards a new start in Hungarian-Ukrainian relations, which have been in deep crisis since Ukraine adopted its law on education in 2017. However, the visit does not mean that Budapest's foreign policy will change significantly or that it will discontinue its close cooperation with Moscow. According to the Russian Foreign Ministry, on the day of Orb\u00e1n's meeting with Zelensky, Hungarian Foreign Minister P\u00e9ter Szijj\u00e1rt\u00f3 initiated a telephone conversation with his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov, during which they agreed on the need to advocate for the rights of all national minorities in Ukraine.\n\nHungary: a tactical adjustment\n\nIn recent months, the Hungarian government has softened its previously antagonistic stance on Ukraine. The first constructive move to this effect was Mr Szijj\u00e1rt\u00f3's visit to Ukraine in January this year. On that occasion he came to Uzhhorod, a town near the Ukrainian western border, where he met his Ukrainian counterpart Dmytro Kuleba and the Head of the President's Office, Andriy Yermak. Hungary is no longer blocking some key EU decisions regarding Ukraine - in February, it withdrew its veto on the Ukraine Facility and agreed to commence accession negotiations with Kyiv in June. However, Hungary still refuses to approve the allocation of additional tranches from the European Peace Facility for arms deliveries to Ukraine. This stance has forced EU member states to agree to allocate profits from frozen Russian assets to provide military support to Ukraine without Hungary's involvement. Orb\u00e1n has also promised he will not stand in the way of any decisions on aid for Ukraine during the upcoming NATO summit, provided that Hungary is not required to participate in their implementation.\n\nWhat made Orb\u00e1n soften his anti-Ukrainian stance is most likely the increasing political costs of obstructing EU policies towards Kyiv. In December 2023, the Hungarian government attempted to leverage the threat of vetoing significant decisions concerning Ukraine to force EU institutions into concessions regarding frozen funds for Hungary (see 'Orb\u00e1n's blackmail: Hungary threatens to block Ukraine's integration with the EU'). However, standing in the way of EU initiatives only made Orb\u00e1n more isolated amidst the united stance adopted by all the other member states. Therefore, it seems his visit to Kyiv was also intended to mitigate the concerns of EU member states following Budapest's assumption of the EU Council presidency and to show Hungary in a more constructive light. Orb\u00e1n emphasised that he had come to Kyiv as a \"representative of the EU\" advocating for peace. This message is also directed at Fidesz's electorate, who have been subjected to harsh anti-Ukrainian propaganda in recent years, so this sudden policy shift might be problematic at home. It is worth noting, however, that Orb\u00e1n's call for a ceasefire is not the position of either the EU or NATO.\n\nThe Hungarian Prime Minister's visit to Kyiv needs also to be viewed in the context of his ongoing efforts to garner allies for Fidesz in an attempt to consolidate the European political right. The newly formed group Patriots for Europe, announced by Orb\u00e1n on June 30, currently includes three other parties alongside Fidesz: the Czech ANO, the Austrian FP\u00d6 and the Portuguese CHEGA. However, political parties from three more member states must join the group so that it can be formally established in the European Parliament. This provides grounds to suspect that the Hungarian government has adjusted its policy towards Ukraine to gain room for manoeuvre in European politics, especially since even some parties known for their pro-Russian views, such as Marine Le Pen's National Rally, at least declaratively, support Ukraine. Now, with a softened pro-Russian image, the Hungarian Prime Minister may find it easier to build a broader right-wing alliance around Patriots for Europe, which is likely to become the new incarnation of the Identity and Democracy (ID) group.\n\nUkraine: a pretended openness\n\nThe Ukrainian government had been seeking Orb\u00e1n's visit for several months in an attempt to convince the Hungarian leaders to soften their opposition to Ukrainian efforts to integrate with the EU. Since Kyiv applied for membership in February 2022, Hungary has been blocking its progress, as well as other EU decisions favourable to Ukraine. This is due to Budapest's pro-Russian policy and the strained relations with Kyiv, which have been exacerbated by disputes over the rights of the Hungarian ethnic minority in Zakarpattia since Ukraine adopted the law on education in 2017 (see 'Ukraine-Hungary: the intensifying dispute over the Hungarian minority's rights'). Although Ukraine realises that high-level talks will not lead to a breakthrough, its government has used Orb\u00e1n's visit to demonstrate to EU partners its openness to resolving the main contentious issues and to show that the deadlock in the talks over minority rights is the result of Budapest's confrontational policy.\n\nOver the past few months, the Hungarian government has insisted that before such a meeting can be scheduled, Ukraine should first implement the 11 points that were presented in Uzhhorod concerning amendments to legislation on the rights of the Hungarian minority in Ukraine. These points were presented after Kyiv fulfilled Hungary's most important demand in December 2023 and refrained from increasing the share of the Ukrainian language in schools (see 'Ukraine: another amendment to the law on national minorities'). On 25 June in Brussels, when accession negotiations with Ukraine were formally opened, Deputy Prime Minister Olha Stefanishyna confirmed her country was ready to implement the points Hungary had submitted. This statement was preceded by several weeks of private negotiations by bilateral working groups on Hungarian demands. However, it appears that this declaration was driven by immediate necessity, as from Kyiv's perspective, at least some of these demands go too far. These include extending special status to regions in Zakarpattia where the Hungarian minority constitutes less than 10% of the population or guaranteeing a seat in Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine to a representative of the minority.\n\nOrb\u00e1n and Zelensky did not address the issue of Hungarian minority rights in detail during the press conference. They announced that it should be regulated in a bilateral cooperation agreement which would encompass the entirety of Ukrainian-Hungarian relations. However, they did not provide details regarding the nature of this agreement or a timeline for its development. Therefore, it is expected that negotiations preceding the agreement will be quite a lengthy process.\n\nThe positive atmosphere of the visit was overshadowed by the Hungarian Prime Minister's proposal for a ceasefire and for Kyiv to start negotiations with Moscow. Orb\u00e1n claims that Zelensky rejected this proposal during their meeting, yet during the press conference Zelensky reminded Orb\u00e1n that a Hungarian representative had signed the final declaration of the peace summit held from 15-16 June in Switzerland (see 'Pax Ukrainica. Ukraine's hopes and expectations ahead of the summit in Switzerland'), thereby suggesting that Budapest had supported resolving the conflict on Ukraine's terms.\n\nProspects\n\nThe Orb\u00e1n-Zelensky meeting in Kyiv marks a first step towards improving the strained relations that have persisted for years, though fundamental differences between Hungary and Ukraine remain. Budapest will not abandon its close cooperation with Moscow and will continue to oppose military support for Kyiv. Ukraine, however, will not make any further substantial concessions regarding its policy towards the Hungarian minority, especially while the war continues. The announcement of a formal arrangement of bilateral relations (such as signing a bilateral treaty) is more a declaration of intent than a real plan with a specific timeline. Although the high-level meeting might facilitate cross-border or economic cooperation, both sides aim to use the initiation of dialogue primarily to achieve immediate political objectives. Easing current tensions with Ukraine is beneficial for Orb\u00e1n, given his ambitions in European politics and increasing pressure from the US.", "source": {"uri": "osw.waw.pl", "dataType": "news",

He certainly wasted no time in putting Hungary's six-month turn as rotating president of the Council of the EU to good use. Orb\u00e1n has assigned himself a peace mission that has already taken him to Kiev, Moscow, and Beijing. He's now in Washington, D.C. for the NATO summit.\n\nOrb\u00e1n might have his own reasons for pursuing a role in an eventual peace in Ukraine, but he says that he's simply trying to find the quickest way to stop the conflict. He also argues he's about the only leader in the West who can talk to both Moscow and Kiev due to other leaders burning so many bridges with Russia or simply refusing to talk. He's probably right. Not only do the diplomats in Brussels not want to conduct a dialogue, but they are, according to Politico, \"plotting ways to ground [Orb\u00e1n's] shuttle diplomacy initiative.\"\n\nNevertheless, after his meetings, Orb\u00e1n said he reports back to the EU27 leaders to \"inform them and make some suggestions as to how we can proceed.\" One can only imagine the level of outrage that provokes in the halls of government across the continent. As Politico describes:\n\nEU diplomats aren't buying it. There is growing annoyance over what they see as Orb\u00e1n using his turn in the rotating Council chair to promote Hungary's worldview. It's one that's been so often at odds with the EU majority, especially on aid to Ukraine and sanctions against Russia. They're planning to force the issue at Wednesday's ambassador's meeting.\n\nEU diplomats against diplomacy are pressuring Orb\u00e1n to shut down his efforts, and bloc countries are throwing tantrums, opting to send low-ranking officials to Hungary's first Council meeting on Tuesday. That might be a sign of what's to come as there is talk of boycotting the upcoming Council meetings in Budapest, but EU diplomats are also already throwing around the threat of stripping Hungary of the rotating presidency, advocated for and the process of which is laid out here:\n\nEU diplomats deride Orban for conducting diplomacy, but polls show that Europeans are increasingly in favor of a negotiated end to the war. The question is why won't other European officials acknowledge that fact.\n\nAgain, diplomats want to punish Hungary for conducting diplomacy - for the crime of conducting dialogue with one side of a war taking place in Europe. This is more of the same from the European elite who shut down and punish those who would even consider the Russian point of view.\n\nWhether Orb\u00e1n's efforts ultimately help lead to a negotiated end to the conflict remains to be seen. He's been roundly criticized by both Kiev and Brussels, but I wanted to focus here on the statements from other EU leaders that Orb\u00e1n does not \"represent the EU.\"\n\nFor example: \"The speed with which he's been doing this trolling has been quite baffling,\" one diplomat told Politico. \"To use an expression from Lenin: Orb\u00e1n is acting as a 'useful idiot' for attempts to undermine the unity of the EU.\"\n\nEuropean Council President Charles Michel, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, and the current and future high representatives, Josep Borrell and Kaja Kallas, criticized Orb\u00e1n's trips and emphasized that he does not have an EU mandate and that the presidency does not represent the EU.\n\nIt might be currently set up so that positions of power in Europe are almost exclusively filled with Atlanticist hacks who will do whatever the Americans tell them to do, but that does not mean Orb\u00e1n's peace efforts are only the product of one \"useful idiot.\"\n\nHe might not represent the EU in an official capacity in talks or have a mandate, but his peace efforts are representative of the positions of the EU people, which are increasingly opposed to the war. If there's a problem with representation, it's that there is but one Orb\u00e1n willing to engage in talks while the halls of governments across the continent are chock full of slavish Atlanticists who only want war.\n\nMaybe that's precisely what bothers von der Leyen, Kallas, Michel, and others so much about Orb\u00e1n's efforts. They want to maintain the illusion that the EU is solidly behind the war effort - both in Ukraine and economically - against Russia until the end of time. Yet, their own polling shows that at best, Europeans are torn over the issue of Ukraine.\n\nIn many cases, clear majorities oppose the bloc's role in prolonging the conflict. And overall, support has been falling ever since the euphoria wore off in 2022.\n\nApologies in advance for the abundance of polling, but there are an abundance that could be read in support of Orban's position. These are also sources friendly to the war effort, so if anything, they might even oversell support. Additionally, these numbers emerge from an incredibly one-sided information environment where mainstream media and political figures regularly compare Putin to Hitler and anyone advocating for dialogue is demonized.\n\nHere are results from the Spring 2024 Eurobarometer survey requested and coordinated by von der Leyen's European Commission.\n\nA closer look shows, once again, how the working class and less well-to-do, which have taken the brunt of the pain from the war through inflation, real wage declines, industrial decline, remains more opposed to the war than wealthier respondents:\n\nThe questions that the Commission is likely paying the most attention to, however:\n\nLet's take a look at polling conducted in December from the European Council on Foreign Relations (ECFR):\n\nIf the war tribe needed a capital, it would probably be Tallinn - as the capital of the country with the largest percentage of people in that tribe, although Poland and Denmark also see the war at the top of their crisis lists (in Denmark it is tied with climate).\n\nNaturally, the likely incoming EU foreign policy chief is Estonian Prime Minister and rabid Russophobe Kaja Kallas. Maybe she'll be able to remind Europeans of the threat that Moscow is determined to march to the English Channel because fear of Russia is waning. From Euractiv:\n\nRespondents fear climate-change-driven migration more than the security threat posed by Russia, according to a fresh survey for the Munich Security Conference (MSC) published on Monday (12 February).\n\nEuropean voters are also increasingly worried by \"migration through war and climate change\" and by the threat of radical Islamic terrorism, according to the latest Munich Security Index survey, which canvassed 12,000 people in the G7 countries, as well as Brazil, India, China, and South Africa.\n\nThe survey, which focused on 32 perceived risks, found that those threats are now viewed as even more important than a security threat posed by Moscow, which ranks fourth overall this year.\n\nIn last year's survey, Russia's war on Ukraine had been rated as the biggest threat to global security, particularly in the G7 countries.\n\nWhile Russia was still the top risk for five G7 countries last year, only UK and Japanese citizens still consider it so this year, according to the survey. German citizens now only see Russia as the seventh greatest concern and Italians see it as the 12th.\n\nThe question that the Commission is likely paying the most attention to, however:\n\nPolling That the European Commission Should Be Paying Attention to but Likely Won't\n\nQuality of life getting worse for anyone not wealthy:\n\nAmong respondents who aren't wealthy polls show widespread dissatisfaction with the economy and very little belief that prospects will improve:\n\nIn conclusion, while it's unlikely that Orb\u00e1n is going to end the war, he can remind Europeans that dialogue is possible. Maybe it leads people to wonder just what other European leaders are doing not meeting with Putin, Xi, Zelensky and trying to find some pathway to end the conflict. Maybe they start to look at Borrell, Kallas, Baerbock, whoever the French foreign minister is, etc. and wonder what exactly these people do all day other than repeat Washington talking points.",

It will be followed by a meeting of energy ministers on Monday and Tuesday next week (15-16 July), both in Hungary.\n\nThe first significant test of how far member states are willing to go to sideline Budapest will be an informal meeting of EU foreign ministers at the end of August.", "source": {"uri": "euractiv.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "EurActiv.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_state_of_the_European_Union", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Member state of the European Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budapest", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Budapest"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Budapest"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Hungary"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungary", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hungary"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Hungary"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thierry_Breton", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Thierry Breton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Hungary", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of Hungary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viktor_Orb\u00e1n", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Viktor Orb\u00e1n"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Putin", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vladimir Putin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brussels", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brussels"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brussels"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Belgium"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volodymyr_Zelenskyy", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Volodymyr Zelenskyy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euractiv", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Euractiv"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyiv", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kyiv"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramount_leader", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paramount leader"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xi_Jinping", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Xi Jinping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_Ukraine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "President of Ukraine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://www.euractiv.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/12308257-800x450.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9720362", "eventUri": "eng-9720362", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Budapest"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Hungary"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-11", "dateEnd": "2024-07-12", "textStart": 2979, "textEnd": 2989}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-15", "dateEnd": "2024-07-16", "textStart": 3078, "textEnd": 3088}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-10", "textStart": 23, "textEnd": 30, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-01", "textStart": 357, "textEnd": 363}], "sentiment": 0.03529411764705892, "wgt": 153, "relevance": 1}

He has also cracked down on the press and judiciary in Hungary and been accused by the EU of violating rule-of-law and democracy standards.\n\nThe Mar-a-Lago meeting -- Orb\u00e1n's second since March -- comes as the latest stop on what he calls a \"peace mission\" aimed at finding a path toward ending Russia's war in Ukraine.\n\nWidely considered to have the warmest relations with the Kremlin among all EU leaders, Orb\u00e1n made an unannounced visit to Kyiv last week where he held talks with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.\n\nSome of his critics interpreted the Kyiv visit as a sign that Hungary could take steps closer to the EU mainstream's pro-Ukraine stance as it took over the bloc's six-month rotating presidency earlier this month.\n\nBut those hopes were dashed when he made an unannounced trip to Moscow days later to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin, a rare trip to Russia by a European leader that drew condemnation from Kyiv and other European capitals.\n\nAfter that, he flew to Beijing to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping, where he described China as a stabilizing force amid global turbulence and praised its \"constructive and important\" peace initiatives.\n\nSpeaking on the sidelines of the NATO summit on Thursday, Finnish President Alexander Stubb rebuked Orb\u00e1n for his visits to Moscow and Beijing, which EU leaders have rushed to clarify were not endorsed by other European leaders.\n\n\"I'll say it out loud, I don't think there's any point in having conversations with authoritarian regimes that are violating international law,\" Stubb said. \"He can do it on his own behalf. But I fundamentally disagree about doing that. I simply do not see the purpose.\"\n\nOrb\u00e1n has sought close ties to Trump and other conservative Republicans, and expressed his belief that a new Trump presidency was the \"only serious chance\" for an end to the war in Ukraine.\n\nTrump has repeatedly said he could settle the war \"in 24 hours\" if he's elected president again by meeting with both Putin and Zelenskyy -- a claim Russia's United Nations ambassador has disputed .\n\nIn April 2023, when charges were filed in the first of Trump's four criminal cases, Orb\u00e1n posted a message of support for the former president urging him to \"keep on fighting.\" Trump in early 2022 said he was giving his \"complete support and endorsement\" to Orb\u00e1n's reelection campaign that year.\n\nSome observers have raised concerns that Orb\u00e1n's pursuit of a separate foreign policy on Russia and China than that of his EU and NATO partners threatens to undermine those groups' unity.\n\nEuropean governments, meanwhile, have engaged in deep consultations on what they could do to ensure that NATO, Western support for Ukraine and the security of individual NATO countries will endure should Trump -- one of the military alliance's most prominent critics -- win back the presidency in November and temper U.S. contributions.\n\n___\n\nSpike reported from Budapest, Hungary.

He added that France should withdraw from the European Union, which he just considers a war machine.\n\nThis could be the reason why no representatives of the European Commission attended the ministerial meeting organized by Hungary. Asked by a journalist, the country's Economy Minister Marton Nagy said he did not know why no one from the Commission had turned up, but that the Hungarian government had invited everyone and the door was open. Furthermore, as reported by Magyar Nemzet, as things currently stand, Viktor Orban will be denied the opportunity to address the next plenary session of the European Parliament (EP), which will be held in Strasbourg from July 16-19, as the presidency simply \"did not find a time slot\" for him in the agenda. This despite it being the customary practice for the PM of the member state taking over the rotating presidency of the Council of the EU to present his six-month program at the plenary session.\n\nAccording to Politico, EU ambassadors will discuss the presidency and Orban's recent trips at their meeting Wednesday in Brussels, in a first sign that EU officials could move from mere public condemnations to concrete action to restrain Budapest's presidency. Some sources say Germany and the Baltics, others say Poland are driving the demand for curtailing as they believe the Hungarian prime minister's meetings are distracting attention from the main focus, which they insist is Ukraine's victory and its EU and NATO membership.\n\nThe Brussels-based news portal itself is reluctant to admit that the peace mission could lead to the end of the Russia-Ukraine war, instead mocking the Hungarian prime minister's peace ambitions by comparing Viktor Orban to a cat on methamphetamines.\n\nBut the Brussels leaders want to go even further than just thwarting the Hungarian EU presidency. According to the author of an opinion piece in the German newspaper Bild, the prime minister should have been denied entry to the NATO summit in Washington, for risk of sharing secret information with

Orb\u00e1n's visit to Moscow last week violated EU rules, Brussels said yesterday.\n\nThe meeting with Trump is likely to further rile other EU leaders angry at Orb\u00e1n breaching the bloc's unified foreign policy positions. Orb\u00e1n did not inform his allies of the planned meeting, two EU diplomats told the FT.\n\nOrb\u00e1n, who had dinner with President Joe Biden and Nato's other 30 leaders at the White House on Wednesday evening, will fly to Florida on Thursday, the final day of the military alliance's two-day summit.\n\nHungary took over the six-month rotating presidency of the EU council of ministers -- a role that allows members of Orb\u00e1n's government to chair meetings -- on July 1.\n\nOrb\u00e1n has met Trump multiple times and is a frequent guest speaker at pro-Trump events, aligning his nationalist, anti-migration politics with the former president's rhetoric. The Hungarian was last at Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort in March.\n\nBalazs Orb\u00e1n, the prime minister's influential political director, said on Wednesday he believed Trump's \"is the most pro-European position when it comes to defending ourselves: first and foremost, we are responsible for our own safety\", in a comment posted on X.\n\nOther European capitals are fearful of a potential second Trump presidency, but given the former US leader's protectionist trade stance and his questioning of the US commitment to defend Nato allies if they are attacked, Orb\u00e1n has long spoken warmly of Trump's election bid.\n\nOrb\u00e1n's trip, first reported by Bloomberg, comes as other European leaders, ministers and officials in Washington for the Nato summit meet Trump-affiliated

Merchan to end what they deemed an \"extraordinary, unprecedented, and unwarranted restriction\" on the presumptive Republican presidential nominee's free speech rights.\n\nThe 23-page defense filing reiterated arguments Trump lawyers Todd Blanche and Emil Bove made days after Trump's May 30 guilty verdict in a letter they sent to Merchan seeking to lift the gag order. They contend the restrictions should have been rescinded after the verdict.\n\nProsecutors have suggested keeping that the gag order in effect at least until Trump's sentencing on July 11, saying it's necessary \"to protect the integrity of these proceedings and the fair administration of justice.\"\n\nMerchan issued the gag order on March 26, a few weeks before the start of the trial, after prosecutors raised concerns about Trump's propensity to assail people involved in his cases. Merchan later expanded it to bar comments about his own family after Trump made social media posts attacking the judge's daughter, a Democratic consultant.\n\nComments about Merchan and District Attorney Alvin Bragg are allowed, but the gag order bars statements about court staff and members of Bragg's prosecution team.\n\nBlanche and Bove argued that leaving the gag order in place is unconstitutionally restricting Trump's ability to respond to rivals and critics, including President Joe Biden's comments in the wake of the verdict and continued public criticism from his ex-lawyer Michael Cohen and porn actor Stormy Daniels, both key prosecution witnesses. Trump and Biden are scheduled to debate on June 27.\n\n\"Trump's opponents and adversaries are using the Gag Order as a political sword to attack President Trump with reference to this case, on the understanding that his ability to mount a detailed response is severely restricted by the Gag Order,\" Blanche and Bove wrote.\n\nTrump was convicted of 34 counts of falsifying business records arising from what prosecutors said was an attempt to cover up a hush money payment to Daniels just before the 2016 presidential election. She claims she had a sexual encounter with Trump a decade earlier, which he denies.\n\nHis conviction is punishable by up to four years behind bars, but prosecutors have not said if they would seek incarceration and it's not clear if Merchan would impose such a sentence.

Merchan to end what they deemed an \"extraordinary, unprecedented, and unwarranted restriction\" on the presumptive Republican presidential nominee's free speech rights.\n\nThe 23-page defense filing reiterated arguments Trump lawyers Todd Blanche and Emil Bove made days after Trump's May 30 guilty verdict in a letter they sent to Merchan seeking to lift the gag order. They contend the restrictions should have been rescinded after the verdict.\n\nProsecutors have suggested keeping that the gag order in effect at least until Trump's sentencing on July 11, saying it's necessary \"to protect the integrity of these proceedings and the fair administration of justice.\"\n\nMerchan issued the gag order on March 26, a few weeks before the start of the trial, after prosecutors raised concerns about Trump's propensity to assail people involved in his cases. Merchan later expanded it to bar comments about his own family after Trump made social media posts attacking the judge's daughter, a Democratic consultant.\n\nComments about Merchan and District Attorney Alvin Bragg are allowed, but the gag order bars statements about court staff and members of Bragg's prosecution team.\n\nBlanche and Bove argued that leaving the gag order in place is unconstitutionally restricting Trump's ability to respond to rivals and critics, including President Joe Biden's comments in the wake of the verdict and continued public criticism from his ex-lawyer Michael Cohen and porn actor Stormy Daniels, both key prosecution witnesses. Trump and Biden are scheduled to debate on June 27.\n\n\"Trump's opponents and adversaries are using the Gag Order as a political sword to attack President Trump with reference to this case, on the understanding that his ability to mount a detailed response is severely restricted by the Gag Order,\" Blanche and Bove wrote.\n\nTrump was convicted of 34 counts of falsifying business records arising from what prosecutors said was an attempt to cover up a hush money payment to Daniels just before the 2016 presidential election. She claims she had a sexual encounter with Trump a decade earlier, which he denies.\n\nHis conviction is punishable by up to four years behind bars, but prosecutors have not said if they would seek incarceration and it's not clear if Merchan would impose such a sentence. Other options include a fine or probation.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

The gag order does not impact Trump's ability to make comments about the judge, Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, or Biden. During the trial, Judge Merchan held Trump in criminal contempt 10 times for violating the limited gag order, which does not apply to President Biden.\n\nBragg responded last week by arguing that the gag order should remain in place at least until Trump's sentencing -- scheduled for July 11 -- in order to protect the integrity of the proceedings. Judge Merchan asked for further briefings on the topic.\n\nTrump's filing this week renewed their main argument that the gag order is no longer necessary since the trial has ended, arguing that Trump's remarks no longer present a clear danger to the proceedings. Defense lawyers argued that Trump should be able to respond to \"attacks\" from his political opponents, citing a Biden campaign event on May 28 featuring DeNiro as well as remarks from Biden himself following the verdict.\n\n\"On May 31, following carefully scripted remarks about the verdict at a press conference, President Biden offered a disturbing grin to the gathered media cameras when asked whether President Trump is his 'political prisoner,'\" the filing said.\n\nDefense lawyers also argued that Cohen, Trump's former attorney and the trial's star witness, repeatedly \"mocked\" Trump following the verdict and that Daniels suggested in a interview that Trump's wife Melania should leave him.\n\n\"President Trump's opponents and adversaries are using the Gag Order as a political sword to attack President Trump with reference to this case, on the understanding that his ability to mount a detailed response is severely restricted by the Gag Order,\" the filing said.\n\nTrump's lawyers also argued, without providing evidence, that Bragg's push to keep the gag order in place was part of a coordinated \"lawfare strategy\" with \"President Biden and their overlapping cast of associates\" to silence the former president in the runup to the election.\n\n\"Such an unlawful restraint would be egregious here, where District Attorney Bragg is seeking to help President Biden and his political associates by asking the Court to silence President Trump during and after the upcoming presidential debate,\" the filing said. \"Worse still, the District Attorney is pursuing that strategy in a case he claims, falsely, is about influencing the 2016 election by allegedly withholding information from voters. The irony is palpable.\"\n\nThe filing was docketed the same day that a top Department of Justice official confirmed that an extensive search of Justice Department records found no contacts between Bragg's office and senior DOJ officials related to the Trump case, discrediting the former president's repeated claim that federal officials coordinated the prosecution.\n\nMORE: Biden reacts to Trump's conviction for the 1st time, calls attacks on judicial system 'reckless'\n\nSpeaking a day after Trump was found guilty, President Biden said the case \"was a state case, not a federal case.\"\n\n\"Now he'll be given the opportunity, as he should, to appeal that decision, just like everyone else has that opportunity,\" Biden said. \"That's how the American system of justice works, and it's reckless, it's dangerous, it's irresponsible for anyone to say this was rigged just because they don't like the verdict.\"\n\nTrump cites Biden's 'disturbing grin' in effort to terminate

New York Supreme Court Justice Juan Merchan issued a limited gag order before Trump's six-week criminal trial citing grave safety concerns, but Trump and his attorneys argued his rights were being trampled on.\n\n\"President Trump's opponents and adversaries are using the Gag Order as a political sword to attack President Trump with reference to this case, on the understanding that his ability to mount a detailed response is severely restricted by the Gag Order,\" Trump lawyers Todd Blanche and Emil Bove wrote in the document that was made public Wednesday.\n\nBiden and Trump are scheduled to participate in presidential debates June 27 and Sept. 10.\n\nMerchan barred Trump from talking about individuals involved in the case before the trial and some of their families members. The order remained in place after Trump's May 30 conviction. Trump violated the order 10 times during the trial, incurring a $1,000 fine per offense, and was threatened with incarceration if he were to do so again -- which he did not.\n\nTrump was found guilty on 34 counts of falsifying business records in New York Supreme Court in a historic case that brought an unprecedented complication to the campaign of the presumptive Republican nominee in this year's election. In less than two full days of deliberations, a jury found Trump purposely concealed the nature of a $130,000 reimbursement to his former lawyer Michael Cohen in 2016.\n\nCohen paid adult-film actress Stormy Daniels on Trump's behalf to keep quiet about an alleged sexual encounter that was potentially going to be made public weeks before the 2016 election. Prosecutors argued that Trump called his reimbursements to Cohen \"legal fees\" to hide what they were to protect his campaign. He did not disclose the expense in disclosure forms.\n\nTrump is scheduled to be sentenced on July 11. He faces up to four years in prison but incarceration is not mandatory.\n\nProsecutors have repeatedly cited an urgent and continuing need to protect people involved in the case, including the judge's family, after Trump's rhetoric resulted in safety concerns. Trump was still free to speak about Merchan and Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, whose office handled the case. He routinely did so and continues to speak about them at campaign events and in social media posts.\n\nTrump and his lawyers have argued consistently that their client has a right to defend himself publicly and to exercise free speech as the leading Republican candidate for president in this year's election. The motion claims that Trump's foes have weaponized his conviction and have taken advantage of his inability to respond.\n\nPresident Biden \"offered a disturbing grin\" to news cameras when asked to comment about the verdict, the lawyers argued, they also said Cohen and Daniels publicly attacked the candidate and his qualifications \"based on their deeply biased views about the evidence and to make even more money for themselves.\"\n\nBragg's office said in a letter to Merchan last week that they opposed the immediate termination of the order and they formally responded to the defense's new bid.

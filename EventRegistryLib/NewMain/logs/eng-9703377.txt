This was stated by two former Trump national security officials who are likely to serve during his second term.\n\nThis was reported by Politico. According to the article, Trump is considering an agreement under which NATO pledges not to expand eastward, particularly to Ukraine and Georgia, and is negotiating with Putin over \"how much of Ukraine's territory Moscow can keep.\"\n\n\"According to one national security expert familiar with Trump's thinking, who asked to remain anonymous, Trump would be open to something that would exclude NATO expansion and not go back to 1991 borders for Ukraine. That would be on the table. But that doesn't mean ruling out any other possibility, including supplying large quantities of weapons to Ukraine,\" the newspaper writes.\n\nIn April, The Washington Post reported that Trump's preliminary plan also includes pressure on Ukraine to hand over Crimea and the Donbas border area to Russia.\n\n\"I would expect a very quick deal to end the conflict,\" said Kevin Roberts, president of The Heritage Foundation, an influential think tank affiliated with Trump.\n\nTrump himself has not publicly disclosed his plans for Ukraine. However, during the campaign, he repeatedly promised to end the war as one of his first priorities, saying he would do so \"before he even get to the Oval Office, shortly after winning the presidency,\" during a June 22 rally in Philadelphia. When asked in a June 21 podcast about his readiness to withdraw the question of Ukraine's accession to NATO, Trump replied that the promise of NATO membership was a \"mistake\" and the reason \"why this war started.\"\n\nIn addition, Trump plans that when he becomes president, European countries will not only dramatically increase their spending on NATO but will also create a \"radical reorientation\" in the alliance. Trump is unlikely to abruptly withdraw from NATO. However, even if he does not officially withdraw from the organization, this does not mean that NATO will not undergo changes during his second term.\n\nEarlier, it was reported that NATO is preparing a number of measures to strengthen long-term support for Ukraine in case former President Donald Trump wins the US election. The plans include sending a high-ranking civilian official to Kyiv and establishing a new command in Germany.\n\nAs a reminder, US President Joe Biden and former leader Donald Trump met in the first round of election debates. The politicians exchanged mutual accusations, spoke about the state of the country's economy, touched on abortion, the situation at the border, the withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan, and the wars in Ukraine and Israel.", "source": {"uri": "eng.obozrevatel.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Obozrevatel"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Putin", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vladimir Putin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enlargement_of_NATO", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Enlargement of NATO"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NATO"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politico", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Politico"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(country)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Georgia (country)"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Georgia (country)"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donbas", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donbas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Heritage_Foundation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Heritage Foundation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oval_Office", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oval Office"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Think_tank", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Think tank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Washington_Post", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Washington Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crimea", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Crimea"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Withdrawal_of_United_States_troops_from_Afghanistan_(2020\u20132021)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Withdrawal of United States troops from Afghanistan (2020\u20132021)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyiv", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kyiv"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Abortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://i2.obozrevatel.com/news/2024/7/3/filestoragetemp-83.jpg?size=2010x1050", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9703377", "eventUri": "eng-9703377", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-22", "textStart": 1464, "textEnd": 1471}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-21", "textStart": 1511, "textEnd": 1518}], "sentiment": 0.1058823529411765, "wgt": 212, "relevance": 1}

Newsweek has contacted the former president's campaign team about the report.\n\nThe Politico article, quoting both named and unnamed officials, suggests if he retakes the White House, Trump would shift the U.S. position on Ukraine, as well as create a two-tier NATO system; only members who met the 2 percent spending threshold would get the \"security guarantee of the U.S.\"\n\nFormer Trump national security officials and defense experts likely to serve in a second Trump term told the publication he was unlikely to quit the alliance, but would expect that European countries increase defense spending.\n\nTwo Trump-aligned national security experts said he is considering a plan to block NATO's eastward expansion, in particular into Ukraine and Georgia. He would also look to negotiate with Putin over how much Ukrainian territory Moscow can keep.\n\nOne unnamed source told Politico that Trump \"would be open to something foreclosing NATO expansion and not going back to the 1991 borders for Ukraine,\" but that did not mean stopping the supply of weapons to the Ukrainians.\n\nSocial-media users expressed concern at the Trump proposals contained in the Politico article.\n\n\"How King Trump plans to weaken NATO,\" Hans Kristensen, director of the Nuclear Information Project, posted on X, formerly Twitter, next to the article. \"Talk about a Fifth Column.\"\n\n\"Russia would get rewarded for military aggression\" wrote Jelger Groeneveld, from East Watch, a website about Georgia.\n\n\"Trump Probably Won't Quit NATO. He'll Just Make It Unrecognizable,\" posted Camille Grand, NATO's former assistant secretary-general for defense investment.\n\nUkrainian internal affairs adviser Anton Gerashchenko posted how \"concern is growing that Donald Trump plans to redefine the U.S. role in NATO very significantly if he becomes president.\"\n\nMeanwhile, pro-Ukrainian X user, Arnaud Castaignet, wrote, \"Trump advisers envision a 'radical reorientation' in which Washington takes a back seat to Europe -- and cuts a deal with Putin over Ukraine.\"\n\nPutin said last month Russia could negotiate an end to the war if Ukraine renounced plans to join NATO and withdrew troops from the four regions that Moscow has claimed as its own, terms that Trump said in his debate with Biden last week were \"not acceptable.\"\n\nThe Washington Post had reported in April that Trump privately said he could end the war by pressuring Ukraine to cede Crimea and Donbas to Moscow.\n\nLast month, Trump advisers said they had presented the former president with a plan to end the war if Kyiv were to be told it would only get more U.S. military support upon entering peace talks.\n\nMeanwhile, Moscow would be told that, if it did not negotiate, U.S. would step up support for Kyiv in the proposal that called for a ceasefire on prevailing battle lines, according to Reuters.\n\n\"Negotiations are only going to occur if they are forced,\" Matthew Hoh told Newsweek. He is associate director of the Eisenhower Media Network (EMN), which emphasizes peace and diplomacy in American foreign policy.\n\n\"Conditioning aid on a good-faith attempt at resolving the conflict through negotiations has always been an option, but it's an option that hasn't lined up with the U.S. or NATO's policy in Ukraine, so it's not been pursued.\"\n\n\"Perhaps that will change under a Trump presidency,\" Hoh said, adding he did not trust the former Republican president's campaign rhetoric on foreign policy.\n\nA May poll by the European Council on Foreign Relations (ECFR) released Wednesday found that 71 percent of Ukrainians would not support the offer of joining NATO in exchange for agreeing not to reclaim occupied territory.\n\nIt also found that 45 percent would prefer to lose parts of their currently occupied territory but remain sovereign, \"with its own army and freedom to choose its alliances, like the EU and NATO.\"\n\nCo-author and ECFR founding director Mark Leonard said that the poll also found that Europeans predominantly see a negotiated settlement as the most-likely outcome.\n\nBut Leonard told Newsweek in an emailed statement that, despite this, \"Ukrainians are not yet ready to countenance territorial trade-offs for NATO accession, nor engage with the idea of 'Finlandization', in which they would keep their territory but forgo their EU and NATO ambitions.\"", "source": {"uri": "newsweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsweek"}, "authors": [{"uri": "brendan_cole@newsweek.com", "name": "Brendan Cole", "type": "author", "isAgency":

The deal would also involve negotiations over how much Ukrainian territory Moscow could retain.\n\nTwo Trump-aligned national security experts, some of them speaking on condition of anonymity, revealed these plans to Politico.\n\n\"I would expect a very quick deal to end the conflict,\" said Kevin Roberts, the president of The Heritage Foundation, the influential Trump-aligned think tank that has produced Project 2025.\n\nThe other source, speaking anonymously, added that Trump \"would be open to something foreclosing NATO expansion and not going back to the 1991 borders for Ukraine. That would be on the table.\"\n\nThis potential strategy aligns with Trump's campaign rhetoric. In a 22 June rally in Philadelphia, he vowed to end the war in Ukraine \"before I even arrive at the Oval Office, shortly after we win the presidency.\"\n\nTrump has also criticized the promise of NATO membership to Ukraine, stating in a 21 June podcast that it was a \"mistake\" and \"really why this war started.\"\n\nThe Politico report suggests that Trump's approach to NATO would involve a \"radical reorientation\" of the alliance.\n\nDan Caldwell, a defense expert familiar with Trump's national security advisory circle, told Politico, \"We don't really have a choice anymore,\" citing rising US debt, flagging military recruiting, and a defense industrial base struggling to keep up with challenges from Russia and China.\n\nWhile Trump's campaign has not officially named a new national security team or openly embraced a new agenda for NATO, the experts interviewed by Politico are engaged in ongoing debates within Trump's circle about how to push European countries toward a security architecture more aligned with Trump's vision.\n\nThe proposed changes would significantly reduce America's security role in Europe. As Caldwell explained, this would involve \"stepping back instead of being the primary provider of combat power in Europe, somebody who provides support only in times of crisis.\"\n\nAnother key aspect of Trump's potential NATO strategy is implementing a two-tier system. This idea, proposed by retired Army Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg, would mean that countries not meeting the target of spending 2% of GDP on defense \"wouldn't enjoy the defense largess and security guarantee of the United States,\" according to an anonymous Trump-aligned national security expert.\n\nCritics argue that pressuring Ukraine to surrender its territory would validate Putin's actions. However, Trump has expressed skepticism about Ukraine's importance to US interests.\n\nDuring a visit to Capitol Hill in June, he reportedly told House Speaker Mike Johnson that Ukraine is \"never going to be there for us\" and suggested redirecting funds from Ukraine aid to US troops.\n\nThe report also highlights concerns about Europe's readiness for a dramatically expanded military role. Jeremy Shapiro, research director for the European Council on Foreign Relations, told Politico, \"They don't really have any idea of how to replace the United States.\"\n\nAs the 2024 election approaches, the future of NATO and US-Europe relations hangs in the balance. Trump's potential return to the White House could significantly reshape the transatlantic alliance and the geopolitical landscape in Europe.", "source": {"uri": "euromaidanpress.com", "dataType":

This plan would also reportedly involve talks with Putin \"over how much Ukrainian territory Moscow can keep.\"\n\nAsked by reporters on Wednesday to comment on whether such a dialogue was taking place, Peskov said that \"this is not true.\" In May, the spokesman said that Putin and Trump maintain no contact.\n\nThe 45th US president has repeatedly said that he would end the Ukraine conflict within 24 hours if elected, although the exact details of this plan are unclear. Reuters reported last month that Trump advisers had drawn up a roadmap for peace in Ukraine that would include an initial ceasefire based on the battle lines during peace negotiations, while Kiev would not have to formally cede any disputed territories to Moscow. As part of the plan, Russia would also reportedly receive a promise that Ukraine's NATO accession talks would be put on hold.\n\nCommenting on the report, Peskov did not dismiss the roadmap out of hand, but noted that the \"value of any plan lies in the nuances and in taking into account the real state of affairs on the ground.\"\n\nLast month, Putin said that Russia is ready to immediately open peace talks with Ukraine once it withdraws troops from Donbass and two other of its former regions and agrees to commit to a neutral status, adding that the final deal should be recognized internationally and pave the way for the lifting of Western sanctions against Moscow. Trump has said that those terms are unacceptable.\n\nBoth Ukraine and its Western backers have dismissed the offer. Since late 2022, Ukraine's Vladimir Zelensky has been promoting his ten-point 'peace formula', which demands Moscow withdraw from all territories it claims as its own and calls for a tribunal to be established to prosecute Russian officials and service members for alleged war crimes.

Meanwhile, the document also labelled the conflict a war, something Russia has been keen not to name it as, rather calling it a \"special operation\".\n\nSpeaking after the summit, Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy told reporters: \"Russia can start negotiations tomorrow if they pull out of our territories.\"\n\nAnd Dutch PM Mark Rutte said: \"We are totally united at a shared vision on principles, on values, on decency.

And you do not endanger nuclear safety.\"\n\nFor the latest breaking news and stories from across the globe from the Daily Star, sign up for our newsletters.", "source": {"uri": "dailystar.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Star"}, "authors": [{"uri": "adam_cailler@dailystar.co.uk", "name": "Adam Cailler", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Putin", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vladimir Putin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NATO"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politico", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Politico"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Despotism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Despotism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(country)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Georgia (country)"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Georgia (country)"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delia_Smith", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Delia Smith"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summit_(meeting)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Summit (meeting)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GoFundMe", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "GoFundMe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disappearance_of_Madeleine_McCann", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Disappearance of Madeleine McCann"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volodymyr_Zelenskyy", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Volodymyr Zelenskyy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zaporizhzhia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Zaporizhzhia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyiv", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kyiv"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Rutte", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mark Rutte"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radicalization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Radicalization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_power_plant", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nuclear power plant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article33162697.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Vladimir-Putin-Donald-Trump-meeting-in-Osaka.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9703377", "eventUri": "eng-9703377", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.223529411764706, "wgt": 175, "relevance": 1}

Zelenskyy warned that any proposal must avoid violating Ukraine's sovereignty.\n\nPutin told reporters that he saw some of last week's election debate between Trump and Joe Biden but declined to comment on it. President Biden is facing growing pressure to drop his reelection bid following criticism of his poor performance in the debate.\n\nTrump hasn't explained how he believes he'll bring an end to the war that's now in its third year. Politico reported this week that he's considering a deal with Russia under which NATO would commit not to expand further east, including to Ukraine and Georgia, citing two national security experts aligned with the former president.\n\nPutin said last month that Ukraine had to pull out of four eastern regions partly occupied by Russian forces as a condition for peace talks. Under his terms, immediately rejected by Kyiv and its U.S. and European allies, Ukraine would also have to rule out ever joining the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.\n\nPutin said in Astana that Russia won't declare a halt to fighting before Ukraine agrees to take \"irreversible\" steps demanded by Moscow, without specifying what those would be.\n\n\"A cease-fire without reaching such agreements is impossible,\" he said.\n\nFeatured Local Savings\n\nThe Russian president also ruled out a resumption of talks with the U.S. on strategic stability until after the election. Russia must first \"understand the moods and preferences of the future administration,\" Putin said.\n\nSeparately, European Union foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said it would be \"very difficult to continue arming Ukraine\" without U.S. support.\n\n\"Will Europeans be able to continue supporting Ukraine militarily even if the U.S. doesn't?\" Borrell said at a meeting in Madrid of the European Council on Foreign Relations. \"It's certainly difficult but not impossible. But is there the political will? I have my doubts.\"\n\n--------\n\n(With assistance from Kevin Whitelaw.)\n\n(Updates with more detail from the fifth paragraph)\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.

Kyiv has previously rejected similar proposals, saying it would only provide a window of opportunity for Moscow to regroup its forces.\n\nMerezhko highlighted the catastrophic U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021, which Trump has repeatedly used to criticize President Joe Biden, saying he is \"haunted\" by the idea of being held responsible for a similar geopolitical disaster.\n\n\"He doesn't want to be a failure,\" he said. \"He is haunted by Afghanistan, and he doesn't want to be the person responsible for losing Ukraine.\n\n\"Democrats will be criticizing him heavily, and saying 'look, it was fine under Biden, but you have failed.'\"\n\nTrump is also reportedly considering the possibility of making a deal with Russia to block the future NATO accession of certain countries, namely Ukraine and Georgia, Politico reported on July 2.\n\nMerezhko said that while still important, Trump's NATO plans are \"secondary\" to discussions about a peace plan, though now is not the right time to be having them.\n\n\"Those statements made right now are made in the heat of the presidential campaign and are not made seriously,\" he says.\n\n\"So we can only talk about the plan after the election when he has a team and when we know who will be the experts leading the team.\n\n\"Whatever peace plan ideas he has now, they are very vague to me, but the reality will be very

They are also discussing about NATO. In a significant move, it has been reported that presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump has been negotiating with Russian President Vladimir Putin on a range of issues pertaining to Ukraine and Russia's national security. Trump had earlier criticized his successor and said that Putin would not have invaded Ukraine had he been the President of the United States. This was during the first presidential debate. Two national security experts, according to Politico said that Trump is holding discussions on the extent to which Russia can be permitted to retain the invaded Ukrainian territories and also on carving out territories from Ukraine.\n\nPolitico reported that Trump has no problem with the Russians keeping some amount of territory which it has invaded in Ukraine as part of an aggressive strategy which seeks to invade territories which are formerly part of the USSR. The two leaders have also reportedly sought to stop the eastern expansion of NATO forces. Trump has apparently assured Putin that the organization will not expand into Ukraine or even Georgia.\n\nAlso Read: Beverly Hills Cop 5: Will fans witness another chapter of Axel Foley's adventures? Producer reveals details\n\nAccording to Russia, the threat of NATO's eastward expansion is one of the foremost reasons for its invasion of Ukraine. The latter had on multiple occasions expressed their interest in joining NATO. This is perceived as a national security threat by Russia. There are other reasons why Russia invaded Ukraine.\n\nMany of the former officials who have worked with Trump earlier and are hoping to be included as part of his team if he wins the presidential election have said that the US will not pull out of NATO when Trump wins the election. They point out that the US will ensure that the European countries increase their funding and will seek to control NATO's activities in a more concerted manner.\n\nIn a recent summit held in Switzerland, Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky called on the Russians to withdraw from Ukraine before a peal deal could be discussed.\n\nWhen was Crimea invaded by Russia?\n\nIt was in 2014 that Russia invaded and captured Ukraine.

This plan would also reportedly involve talks with Putin \"over how much Ukrainian territory Moscow can keep.\"\n\nAsked by reporters on Wednesday to comment on whether such a dialogue was taking place, Peskov said that \"this is not true.\" In May, the spokesman said that Putin and Trump maintain no contact.\n\nThe 45th US president has repeatedly said that he would end the Ukraine conflict within 24 hours if elected, although the exact details of this plan are unclear. Reuters reported last month that Trump advisers had drawn up a roadmap for peace in Ukraine that would include an initial ceasefire based on the battle lines during peace negotiations, while Kiev would not have to formally cede any disputed territories to Moscow. As part of the plan, Russia would also reportedly receive a promise that Ukraine's NATO accession talks would be put on hold.\n\nCommenting on the report, Peskov did not dismiss the roadmap out of hand, but noted that the \"value of any plan lies in the nuances and in taking into account the real state of affairs on the ground.\"\n\nLast month, Putin said that Russia is ready to immediately open peace talks with Ukraine once it withdraws troops from Donbass and two other of its former regions and agrees to commit to a neutral status, adding that the final deal should be recognized internationally and pave the way for the lifting of Western sanctions against Moscow. Trump has said that those terms are unacceptable.\n\nBoth Ukraine and its Western backers have dismissed the offer. Since late 2022, Ukraine's Vladimir Zelensky has been promoting his ten-point 'peace formula', which demands Moscow withdraw from all territories it claims as its own and calls for a tribunal to be established to prosecute Russian officials and service members for alleged war crimes.

He has repeatedly demanded that the government in Kyiv abandon its ambition of joining the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, which has expanded since the start of the war after Finland and Sweden joined in response to Russia's attack on Ukraine.\n\nPutin spoke a day after holding talks in Astana with Chinese President Xi Jinping, who lauded ties with Russia and reaffirmed Beijing's position on the invasion despite growing Western frustration over its perceived support for Moscow's war efforts.\n\nThe summit of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, a regional group that took in Iran last year and added Russian ally Belarus to membership on Thursday, highlighted the growing ambitions of anti-US powers led by China and Russia.\n\nPutin has set out few details of how his proposed new Eurasian security agreement would work.

However, he added that these had been ignored or rejected by Kiev and its backers.\n\n\"Russia has always advocated and continues to advocate a peaceful political and diplomatic resolution to the situation in Ukraine - a crisis that arose as a result of the absolutely unceremonious policy of the United States and its satellites,\" the Russian leader said.\n\nHe noted that Russia had presented its latest plan last month, which could \"immediately\" end hostilities, save countless lives, and initiate negotiations if accepted by Kiev and its Western backers.\n\nThe president was apparently referring to his earlier promise to order a ceasefire if Ukraine withdraws its troops from all territories claimed by Russia, vows not to seek membership of NATO, and completes a process of demilitarization and \"denazification.\"\n\nThe proposal has been rejected by both Kiev and its foreign backers, who insist on returning Ukraine to its 1991 borders. Nevertheless, Putin has said his offer will remain \"on the table\" for the time being, while the Kremlin has encouraged the Ukrainian leadership to \"think about it.\"\n\nPreviously, Putin had pointed out that Kiev's reluctance to accept Russia's proposals had already resulted in it losing sovereignty over the regions of Kherson and Zaporozhye early in the conflict. The president noted last month that Moscow had initially been prepared to withdraw its troops from these territories if it was promised an uninterrupted land connection to the Crimean peninsula.

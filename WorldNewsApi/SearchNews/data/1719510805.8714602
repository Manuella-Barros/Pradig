The message played an AI-generated voice similar to Biden's that told Democrats not to vote in New Hampshire's the ballot.Separately, the Federal Communications Commission said it was fining Kramer $6 million for \"scam calls he set up to defraud voters\" that violate the Truth in Caller ID Act, while the company accused of transmitting the calls, Lingo Telecom, faces a $2-million fine.Kramer told NBC News in February that he planned the robocall to draw attention to the dangers of artificial intelligence in politics, not to influence the election. He could not immediately be reached for further comment.Joyce Vance, a former U.S. attorney in Alabama who was nominated by former President Barack Obama, said in her Civil Discourse newsletter that the speed at which prosecutors and regulators acted is \"the kind of stuff that restores some of our confidence in government.\"\"Voter suppression, no matter who commits it, can't be tolerated in a democracy,\" Vance wrote. \"This is not just going to be one-and-done in New Hampshire, a point FCC Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel made in connection with the announcement of the fine.\"Rosenworcel said in a statement on Thursday that regulators are committed to helping states go after perpetrators.\"This is unnerving,\" Rosenworcel said. \"Because when a caller sounds like a politician you know, a celebrity you like, or a family member who is familiar, any one of us could be tricked into believing something that is not true with calls using AI technology. It is exactly how the bad actors behind these junk calls with manipulated voices want you to react.\"Recent election cycles have been \"filled with foreign influence and disinformation spread on social media,\" Vance wrote. \"Add deepfake robocalls to the list of dirty tricks to be on the alert for as November gets closer.\"She added that New Hampshire's \"fast action serves as a warning to other would-be deep fakers, but this obviously won't be the last one. Voters in New Hampshire alerted law enforcement to the fake calls because, even though it sounded like President Biden and used some of his catchphrases, the message didn't make sense.\"It's a good reminder to apply common sense this election season, something all of us can do, whether it's online or off. Be alert to and ready to report this sort of trickery.\"", "summary": "Charges were announced this week against a political consultant who sent AI-generated robocalls imitating Biden's voice ahead of New Hampshire's primary.", "url": "https://www.newsweek.com/fake-joe-biden-robocalls-arrest-warning-1904807", "image": "https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2399240/president-joe-biden-speaks.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-26 12:49:23", "author": "Khaleda Rahman", "authors": ["Khaleda Rahman"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": -0.478}

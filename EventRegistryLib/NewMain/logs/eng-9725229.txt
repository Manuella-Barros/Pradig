She was 75. Duvall, who worked frequently with acclaimed filmmaker Robert Altman, has been open about her mental and physical health struggles in recent years. Duvall reportedly died in her sleep, due to complications from diabetes, at her home in Blanco, Texas. Her passing was announced by her life partner, Dan Gilroy, via The Hollywood Reporter. Discovered by Altman's casting crew in her hometown of Houston, Duvall made her screen debut in 1970' Brewster McCloud. She would go on to star in and produce numerous movies and TV shows in the following two decades, before largely retreating from the spotlight and returning to Texas in the 1990s.\n\n\"My dear, sweet, wonderful life partner and friend left us. Too much suffering lately, now she's free. Fly away, beautiful Shelley,\" Gilroy said in a statement.\n\nHer early career was almost entirely defined by her work with Altman, with whom she collaborated on McCabe & Mrs. Miller (1971); Thieves Like Us (1974); Nashville (1975); Buffalo Bill and the Indians, or Sitting Bull's History Lesson (1976); and 3 Women (1977) for her role in 3 Women, Duvall won the best actress award at the Cannes Film Festival.\n\nAltman also directed 1980's Popeye, in which Duvall played the role of Olive Oyl opposite Robin Williams as Popeye. At that point, Williams had not yet become a superstar, and the movie was a critical and box office disappointment. It has since become a cult classic, with audiences praising its highly-stylized look and performance styles.\n\nDuvall's most recognizable role -- as Wendy Torrance in The Shining -- would be one that haunted her. She recalled being terrorized on set, with a method acting Jack Nicholson and a notoriously perfectionist director in Stanley Kubrick, she found herself crying for hours at a time, with little in the way of support from her collaborators.

Too much suffering lately, now she's free.

He discovered the actress and gave her her first part in his 1970 film \"Brewster McCloud\" as the love interest of the title character played by Bud Cort.\n\nShe also played a kooky Californian in Altman's 1975 epic ensemble \"Nashville,\" and won the Cannes Best Actress Award for her largely improvised performance in his 1977 mystery, \"3 Women,\" which costarred Sissy Spacek and Janice Rule.\n\nA 1977 profile in the Boca Raton News described the rising actress as \"a 5' 7'' stick figure of a girl, with bangs, a blank-page expression and an overbite.\" Altman raved to the paper that Duvall was able \"to swing all sides of the pendulum: charming, silly, sophisticated, pathetic -- even beautiful.\"\n\nShe also appeared in the Altman films \"Thieves Like Us,\" \"McCabe and Mrs. Miller\" and \"Buffalo Bill and the Indians, or Sitting Bull's History Lesson.\" She played Olive Oyl in the director's 1980 live-action \"Popeye\" film that starred Robin Williams as the comic book character, a role that she was \"born to play,\" Roger Ebert wrote at the time.\n\n\"Shelley Duvall is like a precious piece of china with a tinkling personality. She looks and sounds like almost nobody else, and if it is true that she was born to play the character Olive Oyl. It is also true that she has possibly played more really different kinds of characters than almost any other young actress of the 1970s,\" wrote Ebert.\n\nDuring the '80s, she created and hosted the anthology series \"Faerie Tale Theatre,\" which ran for six seasons on Showtime. The fanciful series boasted directors including Tim Burton and Francis Ford Coppola and talent from Mick Jagger to Vanessa Redgrave to Jean Stapleton. In 1985, it won a Peabody Award, a Golden CableAce Award and the Television Critic Association's Outstanding Achievement in Children's Programming.\n\nDuvall followed the series with another Showtime anthology series, \"Shelley Duvall's Bedtime Stories.\"\n\nIn the '90s and '00s, she appeared sporadically in films, including Jane Campion's \"Portrait of a Lady,\" before taking a 21-year absence from acting to take care of her cancer-stricken brother.\n\nShe was back in the spotlight in 2016 thanks to a bizarre interview with Dr. Phil, which was condemned by viewers, including Stanley Kubrick's daughter, Vivian, who called it \"exploitative\" and \"appallingly cruel.\" During the interview, Duvall said she believed Robin Williams, who had died two years earlier, was still alive, and told the TV host, \"I'm very sick. I need help.\"\n\nAccording to a 2021 Hollywood Reporter profile, \"Coco\" director Lee Unkrich was among those who were concerned for Duvall's well-being. \"Unfortunately, on 'Dr. Phil,' the world saw what it's like to have untreated mental illness,\" he told the publication, noting that it \"has helped make Shelley mostly forgotten by Hollywood.\" Unkrich located Duvall in Texas and found that while she was prone to panic attacks, the actress could \"converse for long, coherent stretches.\"\n\nIn 2023, Duvall returned to acting in the independent horror film \"The Forest Hills.\" Ahead of the film's release, she told People that she was eager for more roles, pointing out that if Jessica Tandy could win an Oscar at age 80, so could she. \"Acting again -- it's so much fun. It enriches your life,\" she told the magazine.\n\nIn the 70s, Duvall dated singer Paul Simon for two years; She and musician Dan Gilroy had been together since 1989.", "source": {"uri":

I am proud of her for overcoming adversity to act again and will always be forever grateful for her friendship and kindness.\"\n\nDuvall was born July 7, 1949, in Fort Worth, Texas. She considered pursuing a career in science before she was \"discovered\" by three crew members on director Robert Altman's 1970 film Brewster McCloud at a party in Houston where Shelley's then-fianc\u00e9 Bernard Sampson was displaying artwork, according to the Los Angeles Times.\n\nThe crew members invited Duvall to something of a secret casting call for Altman's movie under the guise of an event featuring \"art patrons\" attended by the director. This led to Duvall's first on-screen appearance in Brewster McCloud.\n\nDuvall went on to appear in more than a dozen movies and television shows over the course of the '70s, including an appearance in 1977's Annie Hall, before she made her best-known movie: Stanley Kubrick's 1980 horror masterpiece The Shining.\n\nThe film, which required a 56-week shoot and holds a Guinness World Record for \"most retakes for one scene with dialogue,\" starred Duvall and Jack Nicholson in an adaptation of Stephen King's 1977 horror novel of the same name.\n\n\"[Kubrick] doesn't print anything until at least the 35th take.

That's difficult.\"\n\nIn order to get herself into the right headspace, Duvall said she would \"listen to sad songs\" before each scene or \"just think about something very sad in your life or how much you miss your family and friends.\"\n\n\"But after a while, your body rebels. It says: 'Stop doing this to me. I don't want to cry every day.' And sometimes just that thought alone would make me cry,\" she added. \"To wake up on a Monday morning so early and realize that you had to cry all day because it was scheduled -- I would just start crying. I'd be like, 'Oh no, I can't, I can't.' And yet I did it. I don't know how I did it. Jack [Nicholson] said that to me, too. He said, 'I don't know how you do it.'\"\n\nThe Shining made Duvall a household name. \"When somebody recognizes you at a Dairy Queen in Texas you're a star,\" she told PEOPLE in 1981.\n\nDuvall tallied some 40 more television and film roles in the two-plus decades after The Shining's release, and she turned toward producing in the '80s with children's anthology series like Tall Tales & Legends and Faerie Tale Theatre, the latter of which she convinced stars like Robin Williams, Teri Garr, Jeff Bridges, Mick Jagger and Liza Minnelli to appear on, according to the Los Angeles Times. The series won her a Peabody Award in 1984.\n\n\"Producing allows you to take control of your life,\" Duvall told PEOPLE in 1987. \"You don't have that kind of control in acting. You don't have to wait for someone to offer you a part. You can get things going by yourself.\"\n\n\"I like producing better,\" she continued. \"Acting doesn't promote sanity. I don't ever want to lose my joy in life. I guess I've got a bit of the Peter Pan syndrome. I don't ever want to lose my innocence or my dreams.\" Duvall was a two-time Emmy nominee for her children's TV productions.\n\nThe actress stepped out of the spotlight after the turn of the millennium and did not work in movies for 20 years after the release of 2002's Manna from Heaven.\n\nIn 2016, Duvall made an appearance on the Dr. Phil show that was widely criticized at the time as being exploitative of her mental health struggles. \"I found out the kind of person he is the hard way,\" she told The Hollywood Reporter in 2021 of Dr. Phil host Phil McGraw.\n\nDuvall made her return to film in the 2023 independent horror movie The Forest Hills, which she filmed remotely and was directed over Zoom by writer-producer-director Scott Goldberg. \"Acting again -- it's so much fun. It enriches your life,\" she told PEOPLE in 2023.\n\nDuvall was married to artist Bernard Sampson from 1970 until 1974, and later dated musician Paul Simon in the '70s before she began dating her longtime partner Gilroy in the late 1980s.", "source": {"uri": "people.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "PEOPLE.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

She was 75.\n\nDuvall was known for working with director Altman, who cast her in \"Brewster McCloud\" as her first screen role. She went on to appear in his films \"McCabe & Mrs. Miller\" and \"Thieves Like Us\" before starring as part of the ensemble cast of \"Nashville\" in 1975. After gaining attention in \"Nashville,\" Altman cast her in \"Buffalo Bill and the Indians,\" then gave her unusual screen presence a chance to shine in \"3 Women,\" for which she won the Cannes Film Festival Award for Best Actress as well as a BAFTA nomination.\n\nAlso in 1977, Duvall played a Rolling Stone journalist in Woody Allen's \"Annie Hall,\" and met Paul Simon on the set. They dated for two years.\n\nDuvall starred as Olive Oy in Altman's \"Popeye\" in 1980, a role that she seemed born to play, with her giant eyes. Her unnerving performance as a health spa worker in \"3 Women\" led Kubrick to cast her as Wendy Torrance, the wife of Jack Nicholson's character in Stanley Kubrick's \"The Shining,\" based on the Stephen King novel.\n\n\"The Shining\" required more than a year of shooting, and throughout, the legendarily demanding director pushed Duvall to her limit. Some of her scenes in \"The Shining\" required more than 100 takes, with the baseball sequence landing in the Guinness Book of World Records for the most takes of a scene with dialogue.\n\nYears later, she talked about the difficult shoot with the Hollywood Reporter. \"After a while, your body rebels. It says: 'Stop doing this to me. I don't want to cry every day.' And sometimes just that thought alone would make me cry. To wake up on a Monday morning, so early, and realize that you had to cry all day because it was scheduled -- I would just start crying. I'd be like, 'Oh no, I can't, I can't.' And yet I did it. I don't know how I did it. Jack said that to me, too. He said, 'I don't know how you do it.' \"\n\nAmong her other roles were Terry Gilliam's \"Time Bandits\" and the comedy \"Roxanne\" with Steve Martin.\n\nDuring the 1980s, Duvall produced a series of children's anthology shows based on classic stories. \"Faerie Tale Theatre,\" \"Tall Tales & Legends,\" \"Nightmare Classics\" and \"Bedtime Stories\" boasted notable directors including Tim Burton, Francis Ford Coppola and Ivan Passer and guest stars like Robin Williams, Jamie Lee Curtis, Elliot Gould, Laura Dern, Molly Ringwald and Ed Asner.\n\nBorn in Ft. Worth, Texas, she met Altman at a party while he was shooting \"Brewster McCloud\" in Texas.\n\nAfter returning to Texas, Duvall appeared in Steven Soderbergh's \"The Underneath\" in 1995 and the next year starred in Jane Campion's \"The Portrait of a Lady.\" She retired from acting in 2002.\n\nThough she lived a reclusive life, her appearance on \"Dr. Phil\" in 2016 garnered negative publicity for sensationalizing her struggles with mental health. In 2021, she was interviewed by the Hollywood Reporter writer Seth Abramovitch, who traveled to Texas and found her happy to reminisce over her career and fondly-regarded in her community in the Texas Hill Country, despite her eccentricities.\n\nIn 2023, she returned to acting after many years, appearing in the indie horror movie \"The Forest Hills,\" which was not widely available.\n\nShe is survived by her partner, musician Dan Gilroy.", "source": {"uri": "variety.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Variety"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

I need help,\" she said. Four years later, THR's Seth Abramovitch visited her for a memorable story.\n\nBefore she fled Hollywood for her native Texas in the mid-1990s, Duvall had a thriving career as a versatile, one-of-a-kind actress and head of her own production company, Think Entertainment, which created star-studded, innovative children's programming for cable television that netted her two Emmy Award nominations.\n\nWhile attending junior college in her hometown of Houston, Duvall was discovered by Altman staff members and talked into taking a screen test. She then made her onscreen debut as teenage seductress and Astrodome tour guide Suzanne Davis in Brewster McCloud (1970).\n\nA decade later, Duvall sang and starred opposite Robin Williams as the iconic comic-strip character Olive Oyl, the strong-willed damsel in distress, in Altman's live-action adaptation of Popeye.\n\nIn between, the childlike star collaborated with Altman as a mail-order bride in McCabe & Mrs. Miller (1971); as the woman who has a Mississippi romance with bank robber Keith Carradine in Thieves Like Us (1974); as the groupie L.A. Joan, fond of hot pants and platform shoes, in Nashville (1975); as the wife of President Grover Cleveland in Buffalo Bill and the Indians, or Sitting Bull's History Lesson (1976); and as Millie Lamoureaux, a fantasizing attendant at a Palm Springs health spa for the elderly, in 3 Women (1977).\n\nAsked by The New York Times in 1977 why she chose to keep working with Altman, she said: \"He offers me damn good roles. None of them have been alike. He has a great confidence in me, and a trust and respect for me, and he doesn't put any restrictions on me or intimidate me, and I love him.\n\n\"I remember the first advice he ever gave me: 'Don't take yourself seriously.' Sometimes I find myself feeling self-centered, and then all of a sudden that bit of advice will pop into my head and I'll laugh.\"\n\nAltman once noted that Duvall \"was able to swing all sides of the pendulum: charming, silly, sophisticated, pathetic, even beautiful.\"\n\nShe won the best actress award at the Cannes Film Festival for portraying Millie.\n\nFor the film adaptation of Stephen King's The Shining, Duvall said she was put to the test during the 13-month shoot in England. In the horror classic, she plays the besieged wife Wendy Torrance, who spends a harsh winter at the desolate Overlook Hotel with her writer husband (Nicholson) -- who slowly goes mad -- and their young son (Danny Lloyd).\n\nKubrick had her \"crying 12 hours a day for weeks on end,\" she said in a 1981 interview with People magazine. \"I will never give that much again. If you want to get into pain and call it art, go ahead, but not with me.\"\n\nBefore a scene, she told Abramovitch in January 2021, she would put on a Sony Walkman and \"listen to sad songs. Or you just think about something very sad in your life or how much you miss your family or friends. But after a while, your body rebels. It says: 'Stop doing this to me. I don't want to cry every day.' And sometimes just that thought alone would make me cry. To wake up on a Monday morning, so early, and realize that you had to cry all day because it was scheduled -- I would just start crying. I'd be like, 'Oh no, I can't, I can't.' And yet I did it. I don't know how I did it. Jack said that to me, too. He said, 'I don't know how you do it.'\"\n\nOne report said that she was forced to perform her iconic scene with the baseball bat an exhausting 127 times.\n\nMemorable every time she showed up onscreen, Duvall also portrayed a spacy rock journalist in Woody Allen's Annie Hall (1977); appeared as Pansy in funny scenes with Michael Palin in Terry Gilliam's Time Bandits (1981); and played Steve Martin's supportive pal Dixie in Roxanne (1987).\n\nRoger Ebert wrote in 1980 that Duvall \"looks and sounds like almost nobody else ... and has possibly played more really different kinds of characters than almost any other young actress of the 1970s.\n\n\"In all of her roles, there is an openness about her, as if somehow nothing has come between her open face and our eyes -- no camera, dialogue, makeup, method of acting -- and she is just spontaneously being the character.\"\n\nShe returned to acting in 2022 after two decades away with a role in The Forest Hills.\n\nShelley Alexis Duvall was born in Fort Worth on July 7, 1949, the oldest of four children (and the only daughter). Her parents, Bob, a cattle auctioneer turned attorney, and her mother, Bobbie, a realtor, brought the family to Houston when she was 5. She attended South Texas Junior College, where she studied to be a research scientist and was interested in nutrition.\n\nAt a party she threw for her fianc\u00e9, artist Bernard Sampson, she met members of Altman's crew while they were in town filming Brewster McCloud. They brought her to meet the director and producer Lou Adler, and they offered the gawky, 20-year-old with an overbite a role in the movie.\n\nDuvall, who had never traveled outside of Texas, turned them down at first but then agreed to take a screen test. \"I got tired of arguing and thought, 'Maybe I am an actress,' \" she said.\n\nThree years later, she created Tall Tales & Legends, a one-hour anthology series, also for Showtime, that featured adaptations of American folk tales.\n\nShe later dated musician Paul Simon, whom she met in New York around the time of Annie Hall (he also had a cameo in the movie). They lived together on Central Park West until he left her for her friend, Carrie Fisher. (She said he broke the news to her as she was about to board the Concorde to London to work on The Shining, and she cried during the entire flight.)\n\nDuvall also lived with Stan Wilson, who played the Oscar the barber in Popeye, before meeting singer-drummer Dan Gilroy, a member of the pop group Breakfast Club who earlier had been Madonna's boyfriend.\n\nShe and Gilroy fell for each other after starring in the 1990 Disney Channel movie Mother Goose Rock 'n' Rhyme and were together until her death.", "source": {"uri": "hollywoodreporter.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hollywood

We celebrate the best of her 20th century filmography, from her killer role in The Shining to her zonked-out cameo in Annie Hall\n\nDuvall has a few nice moments as a California housewife, but it's Christopher Lloyd as her husband who gets all the character development when they rent out their shed to Hulk Hogan as a burnt-out intergalactic superhero.\n\nWith a screenplay by Vince Gilligan (Breaking Bad), Dean Parisot (Galaxy Quest) directing, and Catherine O'Hara playing a vengeful widow, you'd be forgiven for expecting more from this black comedy. Alas, it misses all its marks, though Duvall is never less than sweet and supportive as Drew Barrymore's mom.\n\nRobert Altman deconstructs American mythology in sprawling satirical style, but forgets to include an engaging story. Duvall provides one of the few bright spots as the first lady (\"I'm always trying to spread culture\"), who visits Paul Newman's Wild West Show with her husband, President Grover Cleveland.\n\nDuvall and Christopher Lee are the most illustrious names in the otherwise second-tier Anglo-American cast of Russell Mulcahy's straight-to-video cheapie. Duvall plays a spiritual healer who tries to stop Londoners from being murdered by flying bandages from ancient Egypt.\n\nJuliette Lewis inherits a Manhattan apartment, where she is driven to paranoid extremes by her new neighbours, including Duvall striking a perfect balance between eccentric and sinister. But this half-baked rehash of The Tenant fails to capitalise on her compelling presence, and founders on a last-minute twist too absurd even for me.\n\nThis is the second of the short films Tim Burton made as a Disney apprentice; in 2012 he expanded it into a full-length animation, but that remake lacks the quirky appeal of this live-action original. It also lacks Duvall, delightful as the sweetly understanding mom whose son brings his dog back from the dead.\n\nApologies for sneaking a TV episode into this list, but Duvall's Faerie Tale Theatre series, which she created and presented, is one of the reasons she is still beloved by audiences who grew up with these witty, star-studded retellings. She and Jeff Bridges play dual roles, Gena Rowlands camps it up as the witch, Gustav Klimt provides visual inspiration.\n\nDuvall fits right into the wacky world of bonkers Canadian director Guy Maddin. A man gets out of jail and returns to his family's ostrich farm; Shelley plays his sister, who ends up hammering a nail through the head of Frank Gorshin (the Riddler in TV's Batman). Glorious arty-farty tosh filmed in sumptuous soft focus.\n\nAll the female characters (apart from Lily Tomlin's) are annoying, but Duvall's takes the biscuit. Kudos to her for embracing obnoxiousness as Martha AKA LA Joan, a heartless chick in hot pants, platform heels and legs for days. Ostensibly in town to visit her dying aunt, she's more interested in hooking up with every man she meets.\n\nAltman was on location in Texas when he first met Duvall, and he wasted no time in casting her in this whimsical fable starring Bud Cort as a bird-fixated recluse who lives in Houston's Astrodome. Duvall plays the kooky, long-lashed tour guide who takes his virginity. She's a natural!\n\nLovely little TV adaptation of F Scott Fitzgerald's 1920 short story, written and directed by Joan Micklin Silver. As always, Duvall looks perfectly at home in period clothes as she morphs from mousey wallflower to popular flirt so successfully that her sophisticated cousin (Veronica Cartwright) plays a mean trick on her.\n\nDuvall flexes her funny bone in Terry Gilliam's black comedy, an enchanting patchwork of historical and mythological persiflage. She and Michael Palin play eternal lovers Pansy and Vincent, whose flowery declarations of mutual devotion in the middle ages and on board RMS Titanic are rudely disrupted by time-travelling dwarves.\n\n\"Tell Roxanne that you love her!\" Duvall rocks a substantial supporting role in this charming update of Cyrano de Bergerac. She plays Dixie, friend and confidante to the local fire chief (Steve Martin), who is over-endowed in the nasal department. One does sometimes wonder why he pines for vapid astronomer Darryl Hannah when Shelley is right there, radiating empathy.\n\nIn her second Altman film, Duvall slips effortlessly into the ensemble supporting cast of the film-maker's gut-wrenching revisionist western. Conveying her character's plight with a few eloquent glances, she nails the small but poignant role of mail-order bride Ida Coyle, forced into sex work in Mrs Miller's brothel after her new husband is beaten to death.\n\nSome of Duvall's work was lost in the edit when Woody Allen's romcom was cut down to 93 minutes, but she still makes an indelible impression as Pam the Rolling Stone reporter, and serves up several of the screenplay's zingers with impeccable deadpan aplomb. \"Sex with you is really a Kafka-esque experience ... I mean that as a compliment.\"\n\nFirst-class deployment of Duvall's talents in Jane Campion's adaptation of the Henry James novel. At first glance, Countess Gemini seems frivolous and silly, dismissed as comical by her brother (John Malkovich), the abusive slimeball who will go on to make Nicole Kidman's life miserable. But behind the frippery and fancy earrings, the countess is sharp as a tack, and sees right through his schemes.\n\nDuvall had a miserable time on set, and having Jack Nicholson swipe at you with a baseball bat for 127 takes can be few people's idea of fun, though her own CV contradicts the canard that the experience put her off acting. Stanley Kubrick does her and the character of Wendy few favours, but Duvall's horrified reactions as her husband reveals himself to be a mortal threat provide the film with many of its iconic moments.\n\nSeventh and last of Duvall's collaborations with Altman was this musical folly co-starring Robin Williams in his first starring role. After all these years, it still looks downright weird, but Duvall is, as Pam from Rolling Stone might say, utterly transplendent as Olive Oyl, and gets to sing the show-stopping earworm He Needs Me, later co-opted by Paul Thomas Anderson for Punch-Drunk Love.\n\nDuvall's third Altman gig was an adaptation of Edward Anderson's novel, previously filmed in 1948 by Nicholas Ray as They Live By Night. She plays Keechie, a garageman's daughter who falls for small-time bank robber Keith Carradine in the Depression-era south. They're no glamorous Bonnie and Clyde, but hapless losers dreaming of a better life. After her heartbreaking performance in this, her director told her, \"I knew you were good, but I didn't know you were great.\"\n\nThe apogee of Duvall's collaborations with Altman is her semi-improvised tragicomic turn as Millie, attendant at a California desert spa for elderly people, who invites a waiflike co-worker (Sissy Spacek) to share her apartment, leading to a dreamlike blurring of identities. You don't know whether to laugh or cry at Millie's incessant mindless prattle, magazine-fuelled delusions and habit of shutting her skirt in the car door, but it's peak Duvall, won her a best actress award at Cannes, and is quite simply one of the greatest performances of the 1970s.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [{"uri":

She starred alongside Jack Nicholson and quickly became a household name.\n\nDuvall also starred in Popeye, Nashville, 3 Women and McCabe & Mrs Miller. The Hollywood Reporter said: \"Duvall died in her sleep of complications from diabetes at her home in Blanco, Texas, Dan Gilroy, her life partner since 1989, told The Hollywood Reporter.\"\n\nHe issued a heartwarming statement about Shelley: \"My dear, sweet, wonderful life partner and friend left us. Too much suffering lately, now she's free. Fly away, beautiful Shelley.\"\n\nThe Hollywood Reporter posted the news on X/Twitter and a number of comments flooded in with tributes to Shelley. One person wrote: \"Very sad news. Her performance in [The] Shining was immortal.\"\n\nAnother person typed: \"Oh no. Rest in heavenly peace, Shelley Duvall [broken heart, dove and sparkle emoji].\" Others gathered in the comment section to write \"RIP\" and brand the actress a \"legend\" and a \"icon\".\n\nFor many years, Shelley had stepped away from the limelight and back in 2016 she appeared on an episode of Dr Phil. Duvall revealed that she was suffering from mental illness and told the host: \"I am very sick. I need help.\"\n\nThis is a breaking showbiz story and is being constantly updated.

Not many people fall into the profession of acting, and that alone makes her career almost inexplicable but not nearly as mystifying as what followed when she plunged into the rabbit hole of stardom.\n\nThe story goes that in 1970, Robert Altman was shooting Brewster McCloud in Duvall's home state of Texas. At a party, he became captivated by the almost otherworldly presence of Shelley, who was inwardly a very reserved yet upbeat young lady, but her striking appearance and enigmatic ways gave the outward impression that she was some sort of benevolent alien entity bringing life and vividity to the drab gathering. In short, Altman wondered whether the party provided the perfect pastiche of what she might add to a movie scene.\n\nThereafter, Duvall was badgered to be part of the film, and she acquiesced to the demands of potential fame and fortune in the same sort of baffling way that someone might give in to working overtime. \"I got tired of arguing,\" she said in 1977 regarding her debut appearance, \"And I thought maybe I am an actress. They told me to come. I simply got on a plane and did it. I was swept away.\"\n\nNow, having passed away at the age of 75, having garnered awards and accolades throughout her career, the triumphs and trials of the life that followed are starkly apparent. The later years of her life were plagued by mental and physical stresses, with Duvall making appearances on Dr Phil to claim that Robin Williams was a shapeshifter and that she was being hunted by the Sherriff of Nottingham. This is the story of that unspooling tragedy.\n\nDuvall had never left Texas before flying to Hollywood to star in a Robert Altman movie no less. Whatever the director had seen in her at that party translated seamlessly to the screen and he was vindicated in his judgement. She subsequently formed a creative collaboration with the great American auteur and starred in many of his projects including the seminal film Nashville.\n\nAround 1976, she was even shacked up with Paul Simon. Duvall and the little folk songsmith lived together for two years until she introduced him to her friend, Carrie Fisher, in what was retrospectively a bad move. Fisher and Simon began a relationship shortly after, and Duvall was left alone in Hollywood once more following her earlier divorce from Bernard Sampson in 1974 after four years of marriage. Roles, however, continually came to her door and acting saved her from isolation.\n\nWithin her first decade of being in the film industry, with not a day's training or thespian work under her belt prior to it, she had established herself as a sui generis Hollywood go-to girl. The interesting paradox is that, in some ways, she remained a square peg in a round hole, but that was also ineffably part of her appeal. She seemed to be harnessing some sort of jazz acting; she might have been unconventional in every way, but she undoubtedly seized the mood of the moment and propagated emotion with an almost perturbing sense of personal poignancy. This brought her to the attention of Stanley Kubrick. He fatefully cast her alongside Jack Nicholson in The Shining, during which this jazz acting comes to the fore in such a way that she doesn't seem to realise that the whole thing is make-believe at all. Jack Nicholson really isn't an abusive husband cashing her around a haunted hotel with an axe and writing weird letters.\n\nWhile the long-term effects of the role are debatable, there is no doubt that it has a disturbing impact on her at the time. Kubrick once compelled Harvey Keitel to call him a \"fucking lunatic\" and quit Eyes Wide Shut after filming him walking through a door over 50 times. On that occasion, his supposed \"we don't print anything until at least the 35th take\" mantra was infuriating, but for Duvall, it was rather more exhaustive, both emotionally and physically. She spends most of The Shining sprinting around The Overlook Hotel carrying her superpowered toddler and bawling her eyes out in a state of delirious terror.\n\nThat is not an easy thing to do day-in-day-out for at least 200 days. To be in the correct state of mind, Duvall would induce emotional pain and sorrow by listening to sad songs on her Walkman and reliving unhappy memories. This was extremely exhaustive, \"You just think about something very sad in your life or how much you miss your family or friends,\" she said in an interview with Hollywood Reporter. \"But after a while, your body rebels. It says: 'Stop doing this to me. I don't want to cry every day.' And sometimes just that thought alone would make me cry.\"\n\nInterestingly, however, Duvall has also stated: \"[Making The Shining was] almost unbearable. But from other points of view, really very nice I suppose.\" This in itself seems unfathomable. From the outside, it seems too much of a dichotomy to endure such daily horrors that your hair begins to fall out and yet say that it was also \"really very nice\" while describing Kubrick as \"warm and friendly\".\n\nHer very next film following The Shining was playing Olive Oyl in Robert Altman's version of Popeye, starring alongside Robin Williams. The legendary film critic Roger Ebert described it as \"the role she was born to play\". Duvall relished in the light relief following her previous ordeal and often described it as her favourite moment in her career.\n\nShe continued acting, often in more lighthearted roles thereafter and eventually married former Breakfast Club lead singer Dan Gilroy in 1989 having met him on the Disney Channel show Mother Goose Rock 'n' Rhyme. They remained in a happy and contented relationship ever since, returning to Duvall's native Texas and retiring from the industry to live a more private life than fame affords.\n\nHowever, her 2002 retirement didn't always seem to have been the withdrawal by choice that it is often portrayed as. In an Instagram post of her swigging a beer, she wrote the caption: \"Life itself is one big roller coaster. When you reach fame it's as though you're right at the top of this wild ride and you don't come down until your image starts to, when you're getting less roles and the public aren't as interested. In some years time a person will mention your name and the other might go 'who in the world is that?' Unless you're Shakespeare or God. This hasn't happened to me yet, the point where I'm no longer relevant, but it will.\"\n\n\"It's not that I can predict things, it's just that after a certain age people in Hollywood are suddenly getting offered less roles in films,\" she added, \"It's a bit - okay, it's definitely - ageist, I know. To me the age that you are doesn't define the talent you have. A 20-year-old can be just as capable of remembering lines and doing what is needed just as much as a 55-year-old.\"\n\nIt would seem she spent her final days in the car with her husband, picking up takeout food and chatting with locals, and despite the widely condemned Dr Phil show, which shows her clearly in distress talking about alien surveillance and nefarious figures who work nights at the bank. She was contacted by many fans, old friends, co-stars and journalists and seemed to have found some solace and peace in the Texan hills of her childhood.\n\nWhile her film work clearly came with the sort of cost that makes you wonder whether she should have ever boarded that plane to Hollywood, this apparently peaceful final chapter offers hope that it will stand out in future as the transfigured artistry of a troubled star and allow the industry to learn from past mistakes.", "source": {"uri": "faroutmagazine.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Far Out Magazine"}, "authors": [{"uri":

The actor, whose brother is Hollywood star Robert Duvall, also starred in seven Robert Altman films throughout her career.\n\nNews of her death was announced by Dan Giloy, her partner since 1989. Gilroy told The Hollywood Reporter that she died in her sleep of complications from diabetes.\n\n\"My dear, sweet, wonderful life partner and friend left us. Too much suffering lately, now she's free. Fly away, beautiful Shelley,\" Gilroy said.\n\nDuvall, who was born in Texas, became the prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of director Altman in the 1970s, starring in films including McCabe & Mrs Miller (1971), Thieves Like Us (1974) and Nashville (1975), which was considered her breakthrough.\n\nShe also starred in the director's psychological drama 3 Women (1977), winning Best Actress at Cannes Film Festival and securing a Best Actress Oscar nomination.\n\nDuvall also had a supporting role in Annie Hall and, in the 1980s, had roles in Altman's live-action Popeye, playing Olive Oyl, and Steve Martin comedy Roxanne.\n\nBut it was her role in Kubrick's The Shining that has proved Duvall's most enduring. Over the years, rumours have abounded about Duvall's struggles on the set of the film, which took a year to complete due to Kubrick's perfectionism.\n\nTo maximise the hostility between his lead actors, it's been claimed Kubrick would antagonise and isolate both Duvall and Nicholson - and it was claimed that Kubrick made Duvall perform an infamous scene, when she hysterically retreats from her husband while wielding a baseball bat for protection, 127 times.\n\nDuvall said \"it was so difficult being hysterical for that length of time\", and described making the film as \"almost unbearable\". However, she was also complimentary about the experience, adding: \"But from other points of view, really very nice, I suppose.\"\n\nOver the years, Duvall repeatedly debunked claims that she struggled after filming The Shining.\n\nDuvall received a razzie nomination for Worst Actress for her role in the film - something that was officially rescinded by the awards committee in 2022.\n\nThe actor continued to make screen appearances up until retiring in 2002, but she made an unexpected return to acting 20 years later, for a role in horror-thriller The Forest Hills.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Duvall", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Robert Duvall"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Kubrick", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stanley Kubrick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Altman", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Robert Altman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wendy_Torrance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wendy Torrance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Diabetes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Actress", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Academy Award for Best Actress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_King", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stephen King"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinema_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cinema of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hollywood_Reporter", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Hollywood Reporter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_drama", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Psychological drama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thieves_Like_Us_(song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Thieves Like Us (song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Shining_(novel)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Shining (novel)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annie_(musical)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Annie (musical)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Martin", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Steve Martin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Live action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nashville,_Tennessee", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nashville, Tennessee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nashville, Tennessee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannes_Film_Festival", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cannes Film Festival"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Comedy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Raspberry_Award_for_Worst_Actress", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Actress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thriller_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Thriller film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forest_Hills,_Queens", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Forest Hills, Queens"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Forest Hills, Queens"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/c009cd5dc3230381337b6b01cf45a3b8", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9725229", "eventUri": "eng-9725229", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 458408296, "relevance": 2}

She said the stress of trying to achieve Kubrick's perfection caused her to start losing her hair.\n\nAside from bringing us the scream that made Jack Nicholson's iconic \"Here's Johnny!\" line so terrifying, Duvall's biggest Hollywood association was with her mentor, revered director Robert Altman. She starred in seven films for him.\n\nSome of her best-known films include her big-screen debut in 1970's Brewster McCloud, bringing Olive Oyl to life opposite Robin Williams' Popeye in 1980, starring in Terry Gilliam's Time Bandits in 1981, and alongside Steve Martin and Daryl Hannah in 1987's Roxanne.\n\nDuvall retired from acting after appearing in the 2002 film Manna from Heaven. While she stayed largely out of the public eye, her sporadic appearances tended to involve her health struggles.\n\nShe had a notable appearance on Dr. Phil in November 2016 where she said, \"I am very sick. I need help,\" referring to her mental health. Just a few months ago in May 2024, she spoke with The New York Times about her retreat from the spotlight.\n\n\"I was a star; I had leading roles,\" she told the publication, which noted she then \"solemnly\" shook her head. \"People think it's just aging, but it's not. It's violence.\"\n\n\"How would you feel if people were really nice, and then, suddenly, on a dime ... they turn on you?\" she elaborated. \"You would never believe it unless it happens to you. That's why you get hurt, because you can't really believe it's true.\"\n\nShe and Gilroy spoke about her career, that Dr. Phil appearance -- which Gilroy said \"just put her on the map as an oddity\" -- and her mental health struggles following a 1994 earthquake which destroyed their home.", "source": {"uri": "toofab.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Toofab"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shelley_Duvall", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Shelley Duvall"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Kubrick", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Stanley Kubrick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Shining_(novel)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Shining (novel)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Gilroy", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dan Gilroy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_King", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stephen King"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horror_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Horror film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filmmaking", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Filmmaking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hollywood_Reporter", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Hollywood Reporter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_meme", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Internet meme"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_adaptation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Film adaptation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood,_Los_Angeles", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hollywood, Los Angeles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RogerEbert.com", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "RogerEbert.com"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terry_Gilliam", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Terry Gilliam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Martin", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Steve Martin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McCloud_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "McCloud (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daryl_Hannah", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Daryl Hannah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Altman", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Robert Altman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robin_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Robin Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Nicholson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jack Nicholson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dr._Phil_(talk_show)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dr. Phil (talk show)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heaven", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Heaven"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earthquake", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Earthquake"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mental health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Online_Writing/Journals", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Online Writing/Journals", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://images.toofab.com/image/d3/16by9/2024/07/11/d331a51a9c674d35a042482659c1dd0c_xl.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9725229", "eventUri": "eng-9725229", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2016-11-", "textStart": 1473, "textEnd": 1486}], "sentiment": 0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 458408469, "relevance": 2}

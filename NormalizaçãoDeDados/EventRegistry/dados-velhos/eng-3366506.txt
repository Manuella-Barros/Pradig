I already told you the numbers that we have transferred in and transferred out and it is time to stop that. We really thought this was a good summer for that. Strength of the contracts, age of the group and the experiences of last year like going to a cup final gave us the feeling this is a group that tasted that winning and keeping them together would give us the chance to reach another level.\n\n\"Virgil is not the only player that is involved in this he is part of the whole strategy of not selling. Nobody is for sale that we don't want to sell and so he is not for sale in this window. We have said it more than once. We are not done with the window yet. We are still looking at some options. I am not going to promise anything. It has got to be something that truly strengthens the squad and fits into our group.\"\n\nSaints currently have Japanese international Maya Yoshida, England U-21 international Jack Stephens and Poland U-21 defender Jan Bednarek as their three central defensive options available, and it is likely Hoedt would come in to take a starting role in place of either Yoshida or Stephens.\n\nIf Van Dijk's situation can be resolved amicably and he returns to the squad then Saints' defense would be much stronger with two Dutch internationals at the heart of their defense. Conceding goals hasn't been the biggest issue over the past 12 months for the south coast club but a drought of six home Premier League games without a goal is perhaps the biggest concern for new manager Mauricio Pellegrino.\n\nFrench outlet L'Equipe are reporting that Tottenham have agreed to sign Paris Saint-Germain's Serge Aurier for $25.7 million.\n\nAurier was previously linked with a move to Manchester United and both Inter Milan and Juventus are said to be interested in the defender.\n\nThe right back, 24, has fallen down the pecking order for Les Parisiens after Dani Alves joined PSG from Juventus this summer, plus Thomas Meunier is also around at the Parcs des Princes.\n\nPer the report the deal for Aurier is fully agreed but is dependent on his appeal hearing against his conviction of assaulting a police officer in Paris. He was handed a two-year suspended prison sentence and that could complicate a move to the UK as Aurier could not travel to England to play in PSG's UEFA Champions League game at Arsenal last November.\n\nThe Ivory Coast international has pace, power and is versatile, making him a perfect fit for Spurs' defensive unit. After losing Kyle Walker to Manchester City for $64.3 million many believed Kieran Tripier would be the automatic starter for Tottenham at right back, but with the England international currently out injured Spurs academy product Kyle Walker-Peters (I know, confusing Stick with it) put in a man of the match display at right back against Newcastle United during the opening weekend of the Premier League season.\n\nAurier's added experience would help Spurs in the UCL this season and there's no questioning they need some extra cover in the back with Mauricio Pochettino also said to be closing in on a move for Ajax's Colombian center back Davinson Sanchez.", "id": "9527954", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-16", "title": "USMNT's John Brooks out three months with thigh injury", "image": "https://nbcprosoccertalk.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/806004288.jpg?w=640", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-16", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "France"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 2, "id": "74", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "label": {"eng": "France"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 2, "id": "76", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "France"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 2, "id": "113913", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 3, "id": "242110", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Juventus F.C."}, "id": "303113", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juventus_F.C."}, {"label": {"eng": "Inter Milan"}, "id": "303119", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter_Milan"}, {"label": {"eng": "Chelsea F.C."}, "id": "304434", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelsea_F.C."}, {"label": {"eng": "Manchester United F.C."}, "id": "304435", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C."}, {"label": {"eng": "Sheffield Wednesday F.C."}, "id": "304436", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheffield_Wednesday_F.C."}, {"label": {"eng": "Premier League"}, "id": "305673", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League"}, {"label": {"eng": "Manchester City F.C."}, "id": "305682", "score": 1, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C."}, {"label": {"eng": "Arsenal F.C."}, "id": "306200", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsenal_F.C."}, {"label": {"eng": "Tottenham Hotspur F.C."}, "id": "306207", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tottenham_Hotspur_F.C."}, {"label": {"eng": "S.S.

I already told you the numbers that we have transferred in and transferred out and it is time to stop that. We really thought this was a good summer for that. Strength of the contracts, age of the group and the experiences of last year like going to a cup final gave us the feeling this is a group that tasted that winning and keeping them together would give us the chance to reach another level.\n\n\"Virgil is not the only player that is involved in this he is part of the whole strategy of not selling. Nobody is for sale that we don't want to sell and so he is not for sale in this window. We have said it more than once. We are not done with the window yet. We are still looking at some options. I am not going to promise anything. It has got to be something that truly strengthens the squad and fits into our group.\"\n\nSaints currently have Japanese international Maya Yoshida, England U-21 international Jack Stephens and Poland U-21 defender Jan Bednarek as their three central defensive options available, and it is likely Hoedt would come in to take a starting role in place of either Yoshida or Stephens.\n\nIf Van Dijk's situation can be resolved amicably and he returns to the squad then Saints' defense would be much stronger with two Dutch internationals at the heart of their defense. Conceding goals hasn't been the biggest issue over the past 12 months for the south coast club but a drought of six home Premier League games without a goal is perhaps the biggest concern for new manager Mauricio Pellegrino.\n\nFrench outlet L'Equipe are reporting that Tottenham have agreed to sign Paris Saint-Germain's Serge Aurier for $25.7 million.\n\nAurier was previously linked with a move to Manchester United and both Inter Milan and Juventus are said to be interested in the defender.\n\nThe right back, 24, has fallen down the pecking order for Les Parisiens after Dani Alves joined PSG from Juventus this summer, plus Thomas Meunier is also around at the Parcs des Princes.\n\nPer the report the deal for Aurier is fully agreed but is dependent on his appeal hearing against his conviction of assaulting a police officer in Paris. He was handed a two-year suspended prison sentence and that could complicate a move to the UK as Aurier could not travel to England to play in PSG's UEFA Champions League game at Arsenal last November.\n\nThe Ivory Coast international has pace, power and is versatile, making him a perfect fit for Spurs' defensive unit. After losing Kyle Walker to Manchester City for $64.3 million many believed Kieran Tripier would be the automatic starter for Tottenham at right back, but with the England international currently out injured Spurs academy product Kyle Walker-Peters (I know, confusing Stick with it) put in a man of the match display at right back against Newcastle United during the opening weekend of the Premier League season.\n\nAurier's added experience would help Spurs in the UCL this season and there's no questioning they need some extra cover in the back with Mauricio Pochettino also said to be closing in on a move for Ajax's Colombian center back Davinson Sanchez.", "id": "9527945", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-16", "title": "Spanish federation maintains five-match ban for Ronaldo", "image": "https://nbcprosoccertalk.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/ap_17225784231039-e1502661563264.jpg?w=640", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-16", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "France"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 2, "id": "74", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "label": {"eng": "France"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 2, "id": "76", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "France"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 2, "id": "113913", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 3, "id": "242110", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Juventus F.C."}, "id": "303113", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juventus_F.C."}, {"label": {"eng": "Inter Milan"}, "id": "303119", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter_Milan"}, {"label": {"eng": "Chelsea F.C."}, "id": "304434", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelsea_F.C."}, {"label": {"eng": "Manchester United F.C."}, "id": "304435", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C."}, {"label": {"eng": "Sheffield Wednesday F.C."}, "id": "304436", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheffield_Wednesday_F.C."}, {"label": {"eng": "Premier League"}, "id": "305673", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League"}, {"label": {"eng": "Manchester City F.C."}, "id": "305682", "score": 1, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C."}, {"label": {"eng": "Arsenal F.C."}, "id": "306200", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsenal_F.C."}, {"label": {"eng": "Tottenham Hotspur F.C."}, "id": "306207", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tottenham_Hotspur_F.C."}, {"label": {"eng": "S.S.

I already told you the numbers that we have transferred in and transferred out and it is time to stop that. We really thought this was a good summer for that. Strength of the contracts, age of the group and the experiences of last year like going to a cup final gave us the feeling this is a group that tasted that winning and keeping them together would give us the chance to reach another level.\n\n\"Virgil is not the only player that is involved in this he is part of the whole strategy of not selling. Nobody is for sale that we don't want to sell and so he is not for sale in this window. We have said it more than once. We are not done with the window yet. We are still looking at some options. I am not going to promise anything. It has got to be something that truly strengthens the squad and fits into our group.\"\n\nSaints currently have Japanese international Maya Yoshida, England U-21 international Jack Stephens and Poland U-21 defender Jan Bednarek as their three central defensive options available, and it is likely Hoedt would come in to take a starting role in place of either Yoshida or Stephens.\n\nIf Van Dijk's situation can be resolved amicably and he returns to the squad then Saints' defense would be much stronger with two Dutch internationals at the heart of their defense. Conceding goals hasn't been the biggest issue over the past 12 months for the south coast club but a drought of six home Premier League games without a goal is perhaps the biggest concern for new manager Mauricio Pellegrino.\n\nFrench outlet L'Equipe are reporting that Tottenham have agreed to sign Paris Saint-Germain's Serge Aurier for $25.7 million.\n\nAurier was previously linked with a move to Manchester United and both Inter Milan and Juventus are said to be interested in the defender.\n\nThe right back, 24, has fallen down the pecking order for Les Parisiens after Dani Alves joined PSG from Juventus this summer, plus Thomas Meunier is also around at the Parcs des Princes.\n\nPer the report the deal for Aurier is fully agreed but is dependent on his appeal hearing against his conviction of assaulting a police officer in Paris. He was handed a two-year suspended prison sentence and that could complicate a move to the UK as Aurier could not travel to England to play in PSG's UEFA Champions League game at Arsenal last November.\n\nThe Ivory Coast international has pace, power and is versatile, making him a perfect fit for Spurs' defensive unit. After losing Kyle Walker to Manchester City for $64.3 million many believed Kieran Tripier would be the automatic starter for Tottenham at right back, but with the England international currently out injured Spurs academy product Kyle Walker-Peters (I know, confusing Stick with it) put in a man of the match display at right back against Newcastle United during the opening weekend of the Premier League season.\n\nAurier's added experience would help Spurs in the UCL this season and there's no questioning they need some extra cover in the back with Mauricio Pochettino also said to be closing in on a move for Ajax's Colombian center back Davinson Sanchez.", "id": "9517581", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-16", "title": "Transfer Rumor Roundup: Saints won't sell Van Dijk; Aurier to Tottenham", "image": "https://nbcprosoccertalk.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/631677616-e1498657113742.jpg?w=640", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-16", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 2, "id": "76", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 4, "id": "166", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "France"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 2, "id": "113913", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 3, "id": "242110", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Juventus F.C."}, "id": "303113", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juventus_F.C."}, {"label": {"eng": "Inter Milan"}, "id": "303119", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter_Milan"}, {"label": {"eng": "Chelsea F.C."}, "id": "304434", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelsea_F.C."}, {"label": {"eng": "Manchester United F.C."}, "id": "304435", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C."}, {"label": {"eng": "Sheffield Wednesday F.C."}, "id": "304436", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheffield_Wednesday_F.C."}, {"label": {"eng": "Premier League"}, "id": "305673", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League"}, {"label": {"eng": "Manchester City F.C."}, "id": "305682", "score": 1, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C."}, {"label": {"eng": "French language"}, "id": "305892", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_language"}, {"label": {"eng": "Arsenal F.C."}, "id": "306200", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsenal_F.C."}, {"label": {"eng": "Tottenham Hotspur F.C."}, "id": "306207", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tottenham_Hotspur_F.C."}, {"label": {"eng": "S.S.

But their days as a selling club are over.\n\nThat was the firm message from chairman Ralph Krueger who says this is now a new era at Southampton and insisted \"we are not playing games here.\"\n\nKrueger's defiance will be music to ears of Saints supporters who have grown tired of seeing their best players, from Theo Walcott to Jose Fonte, lured away from St Mary's in recent times.\n\nThough it is bad news for defender Virgil Van Dijk who has handed in a transfer request in his attempts to try and leave.\n\nKrueger said: \"This summer we needed to consolidate. We needed to stop the perception out there that 'ok, I want a player from Southampton and boom'.\n\n\"We needed to get control of that to stay competitive in the Premier League. And that's a step we have taken and we are standing proud and tall and strong and haven't been anything other than open and honest to everybody involved.\n\n\"We are not playing games here. This is just who we are now and a different era is beginning from what we needed to do business wise and player wise to get the numbers right.\n\n\"We had 13 Premier League players in the first summer I was here 13/14. We moved to maybe 16, to 18 to 21 and now we have 25 and it is time to consolidate.\"\n\nThe \"partnership\" with the Chinese Gao family, who bought 80 per cent of the club for \u00a3210m last week, has helped strengthen Southampton's position.\n\nAnd Krueger insisted it is the stance they have taken all summer, not just with Van Dijk, which has shown they mean business and he is convinced will pay off on the pitch.\n\nHe said: \"Everybody is personalising it on one player but there are potentially other players who could have had the same strategy or attitude and they are not.\n\n\"And we had summers where there were multiple situations like this. I see it generally. I see it as a philosophical stand, not an individual stand.\n\n\"The philosophy we put out in May we put it out for a reason. We put that out there quite clearly.\n\n\"I am sure there were doubters but it was also in the knowledge of this partnership potentially evolving that we had the courage to make a stand and say 'this is time for Southampton to evolve.'\n\n\"In sport - take any sport and especially football - the best clubs usually in a given year, if you took the clubs that went closest to their potential in a season you would probably find eight or nine of them have a certain continuity in them.\n\n\"The ones that win championships, the ones that win gold medals, there is a continuity in the core and it was time for us to do that and we believe the fruits of that labour will end up in results.\"\n\nPlayers sold (they would have liked to keep) since 2006\n\nJan 2006: Theo Walcott - Arsenal -

No team has shipped more goals from dead-ball situations than the Anfield club since the German coach took over in October 2015.\n\nThough Liverpool escaped from the first leg of their play-off with Hoffeheim with a credible 2-1 win, they were regularly put under pressure by the most proficient set-piece exponents in the Bundesliga and were fortunate to escape with a lead to take into the second leg.\n\nFormer midfielder Jamie Redknapp feels Liverpool must invest \u00a360m in bringing Van Dijk to the club, following months of speculation regarding the 26-year-old's future. But ex-manager Roy Evans it not so sure that the addition of the former Celtic defender will cure the club's defensive problems and would prefer a more vocal player to organise the back-four.\n\n\"They need somebody like a Jamie Carragher, someone who verbally puts people in their places, pulls people together,\" he told Talksport. \"I don't know if the Van Dijk lad is really verbal and is an organiser but if we were to have that sort of player, it would make a massive difference to the team.\"\n\nThe other major talking points regarding Liverpool's transfer window activity surrounds Philippe Coutinho, who missed his second consecutive game of the season with a back injury amid reports he has submitted a transfer request after Barcelona had two bids knocked back by the five-time European champions. Indeed, Evans believes the summer will become an unmitigated failure if the Brazil international departs.\n\n\"You plan your team, you plan who you're going to buy and it is getting towards the end of the transfer window now,\" he added. \"If he goes just before there is no chance to buy anyone else to take that place. It was always on the card that a club was going to come in for Coutinho and it is always last minute and that is when it catches you out sometimes. We haven't got the targets we wanted to buy and that becomes an issue as well.\"", "id": "9535330", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-16", "title": "Liverpool need a vocal defender like Jamie Carragher to solve problems says Roy Evans", "image": "https://d.ibtimes.co.uk/en/full/1631317/jamie-carragher.jpg", "extractedDates": [{"textStart": 786, "date": "2015-10-", "amb": false, "textEnd": 798}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-16", "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 5, "id": "86727", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool", "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 2, "id": "151106", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona", "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Association football"}, "id": "302552", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football"}, {"label": {"eng": "Brazil national football team"}, "id": "302789", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil_national_football_team"}, {"label": {"eng": "UEFA Champions League"}, "id": "304606", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League"}, {"label": {"eng": "Premier League"}, "id": "305673", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League"}, {"label": {"eng": "Germany national football team manager"}, "id": "305730", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany_national_football_team_manager"}, {"label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}, "id": "305737", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder"}, {"label": {"eng": "Transfer window"}, "id": "307959", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer_window"}, {"label": {"eng": "Southampton F.C."}, "id": "311377", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southampton_F.C."}, {"label": {"eng": "Anfield"}, "id": "311380", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anfield"}, {"label": {"eng": "Liverpool F.C."}, "id": "311810", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_F.C."}, {"label": {"eng": "J\u00fcrgen Klopp"}, "id": "313017", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J\u00fcrgen_Klopp"}, {"label": {"eng": "Celtic F.C."}, "id": "314761", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celtic_F.C."}, {"label": {"eng": "Bundesliga"}, "id": "315885", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundesliga"}, {"label": {"eng": "Jamie Carragher"}, "id": "329801", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamie_Carragher"}, {"label": {"eng": "Watford F.C."}, "id": "330362", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watford_F.C."}, {"label": {"eng": "Netherlands national football team"}, "id": "331717", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands_national_football_team"}, {"label": {"eng": "Talksport"}, "id": "367225", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talksport"}, {"label": {"eng": "Philippe Coutinho"}, "id": "432717", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippe_Coutinho"}, {"label": {"eng": "Virgil van Dijk"}, "id": "460422", "score": 5, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virgil_van_Dijk"}, {"label": {"eng": "Jamie Redknapp"}, "id": "536670", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamie_Redknapp"}, {"label": {"eng": "Roy Evans"}, "id": "640922", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roy_Evans"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 14, "label": "dmoz/Sports", "uri": "dmoz/Sports"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 33, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 36, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 673, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/AFC", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/AFC"}], "time": "17:44:00"}

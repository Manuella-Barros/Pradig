{"id": 237079566, "title": "Sir Paul McCartney: The Beatles legend announces UK dates as part of world tour - how to get tickets", "text": "Sir Paul McCartney is set to perform in the United Kingdom later this year, as part of his \u201cGot Back\u201d tour. The Beatles legend will be heading to South America firstly, performing in Uruguay, Argentina, Chile and Peru after promising the countries he would \u201cget back\u201d and perform for them sooner rather than later. Then it\u2019s a short sojourn in France and Spain before his homecoming in December 2024. McCartney is set to perform at the Co-Op Live Arena in Manchester for two nights, then heading down the motorway to perform at The O2 in London - however, no further live dates for the UK have been announced, so far. The European dates mark the first time since his headlining set at Glastonbury Festival 2022 that Sir Paul will have performed on the continent, including his first live performance in Paris in over six years, while the wait to see him perform in Spain has been even longer - an eight-year wait since his performance at the Estadio Vincente Calderon in 2016. Sir Paul launched his \u201cGot Back\u201d tour in 2022, completing 16 huge shows across the US before performing his history-making set at Glastonbury in June 2022. In 2023 Paul performed 18 incredible shows as the Got Back tour rocked through Australia, Mexico and Brazil. Sir Paul McCartney has so far announced only a handful of UK tour dates, but there\u2019s the potential for more when 2025 rolls around (we hope). Artist and venue presale tickets will be available for those eligible for them from June 19 2024 at 9am until June 21 2024 at 10am. General ticket sales for Sir Paul McCartney\u2019s performances in Manchester and London will then go on sale on June 21 2024 from 10am through Ticketmaster UK. Quite the \u201canthology\u201d of his previous works, pardon the pun. During his \u201cGot Back\u201d performance at Est\u00e1dio do Maracan\u00e3, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil on December 16 2024, Sir Paul McCartney and his band performed the following set (Credit: Setlist.FM.)

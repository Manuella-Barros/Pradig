{"id": 243323684, "title": "Amazon knocks 70% off 'game-changing' \u00a324 smartwatch that's a 'great Apple alternative", "text": "Smartwatches have become increasingly popular in recent years due to them not only telling the time, but providing useful information in terms of health and social media, and allowing you to make calls. Amazon is offering a huge 73 per cent discount on its best-selling Smartwatch, but you'll have to be quick to snap up this incredible offer. The black Smartwatch is designed for all genders and is currently on sale at Amazon for \u00a323.99, down from \u00a389.99. It connects to iPhone and Android mobiles that are iOS 9.0 or Android 6.0 and above via Bluetooth. An in-built microphone and speaker allow you to receive and make calls directly from your watch. The gadget, which is also available in pink, purple and white, supports information reminders and social media notifications - including WhatsApp, Facebook, Instagram and X - with a wrist vibration notifying you of any social updates. It has a 1.85-inch high-definition colour touch screen and four brightness levels.

The Smartwatch app allows you to personalise your watch, with over 200 dial wallpapers to choose from. You can even customise your dial screen with your favourite photos. Amazon's waterproof watch supports over 100 sports modes, including walking, running, cycling and football, allowing you to visually read data such as steps, distance, and calories. It's particularly handy if you want to keep track of your health, as it has an in-built high-performance optical sensor that can monitor your heart rate in real time 24 hours a day. The gadget can also track your sleep status - deep sleep, light sleep and awake - providing you with a sleep quality analysis, and for women the Smartwatch can also track your menstrual cycle. This all helps you to understand your health status and to make any adjustments. With its 310mAh large-capacity battery, the Smartwatch only takes two hours of charge time to provide seven days of usage and approximately 30 days of standby time. More than 4,300 Amazon customers have reviewed the Smartwatch, with it receiving an overall rating of 4.2 out of five. One shopper said: \"This Smartwatch is honestly amazing! I've been using it for over a month every day and it monitors all your vital signs including heart rate and oxygen sats. It also keeps track of your steps. The watch has lots of features for people who use it for fitness purposes, but it's also a great alternative to an Apple watch. It looks stylish too. The watch is easy to set up via the app and it connects automatically via Bluetooth even to your car. Battery life easily lasts me a week and I use it every day!\" A second wrote: \"This is a game-changer for me. A smartwatch that actually does what I need it to... the Bluetooth connection has been great, it stays connected all the time and allows me to control just about everything on my phone, including my music while using YouTube. It's excellent, great price, would recommend.\" A third commented: \"Lovely smartwatch, great product at a reasonable price. The watch looks very expensive and I love that it has so many different features and it's easy and quick to set up. I only remove it for charging and that is once a week. I love that I can track my steps, heart rate, and how many calories I've burned and even answer calls and messages. I shower, swim, exercise and sleep with my watch on. I will be ordering another one for my son. I heartily recommend this product.\" One shopper, however, struggled with the lack of instructions. They gave the Smartwatch four stars and explained: \"Very happy with this as my first smartwatch, battery lasts about a week, lots of functions, great for the money. The only gripe I had was the pretty poor instructions that came with it, but I was able to YouTube anything I needed to know about the set-up.\" The Apple Watch SE will set you back \u00a3219, whereas you can buy the Amazon Smartwatch for \u00a324.99 for a limited time. If you're after an alternative smartwatch, Argos is selling the Samsung Galaxy Watch4 for \u00a399.

Four council members abstained.\n\n'I don't want to see a billboard up with the name of a person who's throwing chairs off of balconies and who is saying racial slurs,' at-large council member Delishia Porterfield said, according to the outlet.\n\nA 20-foot sign featuring Morgan Wallen's name will not be constructed in downtown Nashville due to the country singer's controversial past\n\nA mock-up of the sign of the restaurant, which is set to open in Nashville this weekend\n\nAlso in agreement with her statements was council member Jordan Huffman, according to WSMV.com.\n\n'I rise to oppose this,' he said. 'Number 1 - Mr. Wallen is an East Tennessean - he gives all of us a bad name. His comments are hateful, his comments are harmful, and you don't belong in this town, as far as I'm concerned. I'm tired of this city bending over to just, make anybody happy that makes a comment that they want to. We continue to go down this road. I encourage my colleagues to vote against this.'\n\nEven the sponsor of the resolution, Jacob Kupin from District 19, had reservations about the sign. 'It struck me that we're putting up a sign with someone's name on it that hasn't been a good actor downtown,' he said.\n\n'I decided to move approval for this because I do support the efforts to move this bar forward...the restaurant group that's managing this facility, TC Restaurant Group, has been really a good partner in everything going on downtown,' he added.\n\nTC Restaurant Group, the company opening the eatery, also operates other restaurants named after iconic country singers, including Jason Aldean's Kitchen & Rooftop Bar and Casa Rosa Miranda Lambert's.\n\nMorgan Wallen's This Bar & Tennessee Kitchen is scheduled to open on Memorial Day weekend.\n\nLast month, Wallen was arrested after he chucked a chair off a rooftop bar in downtown Nashville.\n\nWallen was charged with three counts of felony reckless endangerment and one count of misdemeanor disorderly conduct, with officers alleging the chair landed three feet from them.\n\nWallen faced huge amounts of backlash in 2021 when TMZ released a video of the singer saying the N-word to one of his friends after a night out.\n\nThe restaurant is being opened by a third-party establishment, TC Restaurant Group\n\nAfter the footage of Wallen using the racial slur went viral, many radio stations stopped playing his music and the Country Music Association removed Wallen's appearances from their platforms.\n\nHis songs were removed from Apple Music, Pandora and Spotify featured playlists because of the sandal.\n\nWallen's record label, Big Loud, suspended its recording contract with him indefinitely.\n\nThe Academy of Country Music announced that Wallen and his most recent album at the time, Dangerous: The Double Album, would be ineligible for the 56th Annual Academy of Country Music Awards.\n\nLast month, Wallen made headlines after he launched a chair at cops from a rooftop bar in downtown Nashville; pictured November 2023\n\nIn the week after the racism, album sales for Dangerous surged and the digital sales went up over 100 per cent.\n\nHe even remained on top of the Billboard charts for seven more weeks.\n\nIn April, 2021, Wallen donated $300,000 to the Black Music Action Coalition in the names of 20 people who had counseled him after he used the racial slur.\n\nWallen publicly spoke of his comments on Good Morning America on July 23, where he said that 'he was around some of his friends, and they say dumb stuff together' and said that 'he was wrong' to express those words.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [],

Four council members, including 5th Congressional District challenger Courtney Johnston, abstained. Council approval is needed any time a sign is constructed over a public right of way -- in this case, a sidewalk in one of Nashville's most iconic districts.\n\nWallen's bar, called \"This Bar and Tennessee Kitchen\" after his 2019 song of the same name, is located at 107 Fourth Avenue North, adjacent to the Ryman Auditorium. The six-story building will feature six bars, a rooftop and three live music stages.\n\nPolice documents accuse Wallen of throwing a chair over the railing of Chief's, Eric Church's new six-story honky-tonk, around 11 p.m. on April 7. The chair landed just feet away from several Nashville police officers who were standing in front of the building, according to Wallen's arrest affidavit.\n\nChief's is located less than 600 feet down the street from Wallen's new bar.\n\nWallen will appear in court in Nashville on Aug. 15. The 30-year-old faces three Class E felony counts of reckless endangerment with a deadly weapon and one count of disorderly conduct, a Class C misdemeanor.\n\n\"I'm not proud of my behavior, and I accept responsibility,\" Wallen wrote on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter, several days after his arrest. \"I didn't feel right publicly checking in until I made amends with some folks. I've touched base with Nashville law enforcement, my family, and the good people at Chief's.\"\n\nThis is not the first time Wallen has been arrested in downtown Nashville -- police arrested him on charges of public intoxication and disorderly conduct in May 2020 after Wallen was kicked out of Kid Rock's Big Ass Honky Tonk Rock N' Roll Steakhouse for \"kicking glass items\" and verbally fighting with passersby. But those charges were likely expunged; they are absent from Davidson County Criminal Court records.\n\nMore: Timeline of Morgan Wallen's rollercoaster career after his most recent arrest\n\nCouncil members denounce Wallen's actions\n\nCouncil member Jacob Kupin, who represents downtown Nashville, sponsored the legislation and was one of three council members who voted in favor of green-lighting the sign's installation. Though aerial encroachment legislation typically sails through Metro Council, Kupin said he felt he could not \"let this individual just slide through quietly.\"\n\n\"It struck me that ... we're putting up a sign with someone's name on it who has not been a good actor downtown,\" Kupin said, adding that Wallen has since \"made efforts to apologize and to make amends.\"\n\nKupin said he voted in favor of the legislation because TC Restaurant Group, the company developing and managing the bar, \"has been really a good partner in everything going on downtown\" and he felt they should not be penalized for what happened.\n\n\"To me, it's important to remind those watching at home, the public, whether you're a celebrity or someone coming to our town or someone who lives here, that downtown needs to be a safe place,\" he said.\n\nBut the majority of council members said they could not overlook Wallen's actions, with several referring to a 2021 recording that showed Wallen drunkenly using a racial slur. He later pledged to donate a total of $500,000 to organizations including the Black Music Action Coalition and the National Museum of African American Music in Nashville -- donations verified as complete by USA TODAY in September 2021.\n\nDistrict 24 Council member Brenda Gadd remarked that Wallen is \"someone who continues to get second chances.\"\n\n\"Mr. Wallen is a fellow East Tennessean. He gives all of us a bad name,\" District 14 Council member Jordan Huffman said. \"His comments are hateful; his actions are harmful.\"\n\nDistrict 33 Council member Antoinette Lee, presumably referring to the Metro Council, said entities speaking up and saying no might \"help folks who are doing these harmful actions think twice.\"\n\nSigns of disagreement\n\nDebate over Lower Broadway signage has gripped city hall before.\n\nIn January 2019, Nashville's council debated approval of a 20-foot neon sign featuring a guitar with a base shaped like a woman's buttocks for Kid Rock's Big Ass Honky Tonk Rock N' Roll Steakhouse.\n\nThe council ultimately approved the sign 27-3, with three abstentions, but not without voicing their distaste.\n\n\"This one I feel crosses the line between good taste, family-friendliness, and I think what we would like Nashville to portray to people who come to visit us,\" then-Council member Kathleen Murphy said.\n\nThat legislation was sponsored by then-District 19 Council member Freddie O'Connell, now Nashville's mayor. Former Nashville Mayor John Cooper, then an at-large council member, voted against the measure, as did Lee, who was then serving her first term.\n\nSome council members who took issue with the sign relented after then-Metro Council attorney Mike Jameson advised that rejecting Rock's sign due to vulgarity or obscenity could lead to a First Amendment lawsuit.\n\nMetro Council members did not discuss the applicability of the First Amendment or potential legal challenges before voting Tuesday.\n\nOpposed: Zulfat Suara, Delishia Porterfield, Quin Evans-Segall, Burkley Allen, Olivia Hill, Joy

But the Metro Nashville City Council is making him change his plans for a sign that the country music superstar wanted to install outside of his bar.\n\nTC Restaurant Group, the hospitality company that partnered with Wallen for the bar (and also operates bars like Jason Aldean's Kitchen & Rooftop Bar, Luke's 32 Bridge, Miranda Lambert's Casa Rosa and Lainey Wilson's upcoming Bell Bottoms Up), had requested permission for an \"aerial encroachment\" for the sign to hang over the new bar, located at 107 4th Avenue North, just beside the Ryman Auditorium.\n\nThe sign would have hung above the entrance to the bar, but because it encroached on a city right of way, owners needed to get permission from the council to install it.\n\nBut the council made it clear that they weren't exactly happy with Wallen right now - with many members speaking out against the singer and his behavior during a meeting last night.\n\nCouncil member Delisha Porterfield referred to not only Morgan's latest incident when he was arrested for throwing a chair off the rooftop of Eric Church's downtown Nashville bar, Chief's, but also his racial slur incident from back in 2021 in arguing that he shouldn't be granted permission for the sign:\n\n\"We just passed legislation a little earlier tonight saying that we wanted to make sure that Nashville was a supportive place for everyone, so I don't want to see a billboard with the name of a person who's throwing chairs off of balconies and who is saying racial slurs and using the n-word, so I'm voting no.\"\n\nAnd councilman Jordan Huffman also expressed his concerns:\n\n\"Number one, Mr. Wallen is a fellow East Tennessean. He gives all of us a bad name. His comments are hateful, his actions are harmful, and you don't belong in this town as far as I'm concerned. I'm tired of this city bending over to just make anybody happy that makes a comment that they want to. We continue to go down this road. I encourage my colleagues to vote against this.\"\n\nEven the resolution's sponsor, who ultimately voted in favor of allowing the sign, expressed his reservations about rewarding Wallen's behavior:\n\n\"This is a sign encroachment for Morgan Wallen's new bar that crossed my desk right about the time that he decided to throw a chair off of a rooftop, nearly hitting some first responders...\n\nIt struck me that we're putting up a sign with someone's name on it who has not been a good actor downtown.\n\nHe has since made efforts to apologize and to make amends. And so I decided to move approval for this because I do support the efforts to kind of move this bar forward. I also want to say that the restaurant group that's managing this facility, TC Restaurant Group, has been really, really a good partner in everything going on downtown...\n\nThe fact that someone's name going up on a bar doesn't mean that we condone all the behavior, but again I appreciate the efforts to make amends, the positive response. And again, the operator themselves I don't think should be penalized for what happened.\"\n\nBut councilwoman Brenda Gadd said that TC Restaurant Group shouldn't be giving Morgan another chance - and said she too would be voting against the sign:\n\n\"Someone who continues to get second chances, I think the third party operator, surely they don't need any reminder about his racist comments, using the n-word, his pledge to the NAACP for funding and then him never fulfilling that commitment. Mr. Wallen has also received many more opportunities since then, and he'll receive one through other operators, but I can't with a good conscience support this because of that.\"\n\nUltimately the resolution failed, receiving only 3 votes in favor of the sign and 30 votes against it.\n\nTC Restaurant Group hasn't commented on the council not granting their request, but with the bar opening this weekend, it looks like they'll have to come up with other plans for a sign over the door.", "source": {"uri": "whiskeyriff.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Whiskey Riff"}, "authors": [],

The sign was proposed to hang from the bar over the sidewalk below; the venue already has a sign affixed to the top of the building.\n\nThe country star's \"Morgan Wallen's This Bar\" -- a bar and restaurant run by a third-party business but named after Wallen and his 2019 hit \"This Bar\" -- is set to open this weekend on Fourth Avenue North, adjacent the Ryman Auditorium.\n\nHowever, the city's council voted 30-3 to reject the establishment's bid to construct the neon sign with Wallen's name on it, citing both his arrest and felony charges in a rooftop chair-throwing incident -- which occurred at a Nashville bar just 600 feet from Morgan Wallen's This Bar, The Tennessean notes -- as well as the time that the singer was caught using a racial slur on camera.\n\n\"I don't want to see a billboard with the name of a person who's throwing chairs off of balconies and who's saying racial slurs and using the n-word,\" council member Delishia Porterfield said at Tuesday's hearing to vote on the matter.\n\n\"Mr. Wallen is a fellow East Tennessean. He gives all of us a bad name,\" council member Jordan Huffman said (via The Tennessean). \"His comments are hateful; his actions are harmful.\"\n\nCouncil member Jacob Kupin was one of the three who voted in favor the sign, citing the establishment's managing team, TC Restaurant Group, as a \"really a good partner in everything going on downtown.\" (TC Restaurant Group also operates branded bars by Jason Aldean, Luke Bryan, and Miranda Lambert, among others.) However, after the sign was resoundingly rejected by the council, Kubin later added on Twitter, \"I could not in good conscience let this one go through quietly. We are working hard on the safety and security downtown, and Morgan Wallen has continued to put others at risk. That said, I appreciate the restaurant group helping with these efforts.\"\n\nA similar issue arose in 2019 when the Nashville council had to vote whether to approve signage for Kid Rock's Big Ass Honky Tonk Rock N' Roll Steakhouse, which -- in addition to that singer's checkered past -- also featured a guitar shaped like buttocks. While some council members voiced their concern about Kid Rock and the sign, it overwhelmingly passed by a 27-3 vote.\n\nDespite the signage hiccup, Morgan Wallen's This Bar still plans to open this Memorial Day Weekend.", "source": {"uri": "rollingstone.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Rolling Stone"}, "authors": [{"uri": "daniel_kreps@rollingstone.com", "name": "Daniel Kreps", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morgan_Wallen", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Morgan Wallen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigger", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Nigger"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nashville,_Tennessee", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Nashville, Tennessee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nashville, Tennessee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadway_(Nashville,_Tennessee)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Broadway (Nashville, Tennessee)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lzzy_Hale", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lzzy Hale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skid_Row_(American_band)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Skid Row (American band)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tennessean", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Tennessean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryman_Auditorium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ryman Auditorium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Singing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Illinois"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Illinois"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neon_sign", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Neon sign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billboard", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Billboard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downtown", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Downtown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Felony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Aldean", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jason Aldean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honky-tonk", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Honky-tonk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kid_Rock", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kid Rock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luke_Bryan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Luke Bryan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miranda_Lambert", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Miranda Lambert"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_and_roll", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rock and roll"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buttocks", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Buttocks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memorial_Day", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Memorial Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guitar", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Guitar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Conventions", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Conventions", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-1792234893.jpg?w=1600&h=900&crop=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9590207", "eventUri": "eng-9590207", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 208, "relevance": 1}

However, you won't be seeing the singer's name on the outside of the building, thanks to a decision from Nashville's Metro Council.\n\nAccording to WZTV, the city council collectively voted to reject a 20-foot sign advertising the singer's bar on the side of the building on Tuesday (May 21).\n\n\"I don't want to see a billboard up with the name of a person who's throwing chairs off of balconies and who is saying racial slurs,\" at-large Council member Delishia Porterfield states (quote via the Tennessean).\n\nWallen was arrested after allegedly throwing a chair off the roof of Eric Church's Chief's bar in downtown Nashville on April 7. He faces multiple felony and misdemeanor charges stemming from that incident, which is part of a long pattern of legal and personal trouble for the singer.\n\nMorgan previously faced arrest on May 23, 2020, after he was kicked out of Kid Rock's bar in downtown Nashville for reportedly kicking glass items inside the establishment. Prosecutors later dropped charges of public intoxication and disorderly conduct.\n\nIn February of 2021, Wallen was caught on camera using the N-word, which he later admitted happened at the tail end of a 72-hour drinking bender. That resulted in widespread condemnation and career consequences for Wallen.\n\nAccording to the Tennessean, Nashville's council voted 30-3 to deny the installation of Wallen's new bar sign. Whenever a sign is situated over a public right of way -- in this case, the sidewalk -- the council has to vote to approve or deny.\n\n\"He gives all of us a bad name,\" says Metro Council member Jordan Huffman. \"His comments are hateful, his actions are harmful and he don't belong in this town as far as I'm concerned.

The sign was set to read \"Morgan Wallen's This Bar,\" and hang outside the upcoming establishment located on Broadway next to the Ryman Auditorium.\n\nWallen's bar, named This Bar and Tennessee Kitchen, is set to open over Memorial Day Weekend and will feature six bars, a rooftop and multiple music stages. On Tuesday, 30 council members voted against Wallen's sign while only three were in favor. Four abstained from the vote.\n\n\"I don't want to see a billboard up with the name of a person who's throwing chairs off of balconies and who is saying racial slurs,\" Council member Delishia Porterfield said, per The Tennessean newspaper, referring to Wallen's past indiscretions. (Wallen made headlines in 2021 after a video of him saying the N-word surfaced online. He has since apologized.)\n\nA second council member, Jordan Huffman, stated that Wallen \"gives all of us a bad name,\" during Tuesday's meeting. \"His comments are hateful; his actions are harmful.\"\n\nWallen has not spoken publicly about the council's decision.\n\nWallen was arrested in April after allegedly throwing a chair from the rooftop of Eric Church's bar in Nashville. Police officers were standing outside the establishment when a chair fell from above, landing next to them, the Metro Nashville Police Department told Us Weekly at the time.\n\nAfter employees claimed that Wallen had thrown the chair, he was arrested and ultimately charged with three felony counts of reckless endangerment and one misdemeanor count of disorderly conduct.\n\n\"I didn't feel right publicly checking in until I made amends with some folks. I've touched base with Nashville law enforcement, my family, and the good people at Chief's.

(AP) -- Nashville councilmembers have rejected plans for a glowing sign to be erected at Morgan Wallen's new bar along the city's neon-lit strip of honky tonks, citing his use of a racial slur that caused controversy in 2021 and recent criminal charges accusing the country star of throwing a chair off a rooftop near two police officers.\n\nThe Nashville Metro Council voted 30-3 Tuesday evening against the proposed sign at Morgan Wallen's This Bar & Tennessee Kitchen, which is set to open this weekend. The sign would have hung over a public sidewalk, similar to those at many neighboring bars. Such a sign requires local government approval and usually isn't a controversial process.\n\nDuring debate, councilmembers called Wallen's comments hateful and his actions harmful. They also said the performer has received multiple second chances.\n\n\"I don't want to see a billboard up with the name of a person who is throwing chairs off of balconies and who is saying racial slurs,\" said Councilmember Delishia Porterfield, who is Black.\n\nCouncilmember Jacob Kupin presented the proposal, but said he \"thought long and hard\" about what to do because of Wallen's behavior. He said the third-party organization managing the business, TC Restaurant Group, has been \"really, a good partner\" and has worked to make downtown Nashville safer.\n\nThe Associated Press reached out to Wallen's publicist and TC Restaurant Group seeking comment on the council vote.\n\n\"The fact that someone's name is going up on a bar doesn't mean that we condone all the behavior, but again I appreciate the efforts to make amends, the positive response, and again, the operator themselves I don't think should be penalized for what happened,\" Kupin said.\n\nAn initial hearing in Wallen's criminal case was postponed until Aug. 15. According to an arrest affidavit, the chair that Wallen is accused of throwing off the roof of the six-story Chief's bar on April 7 landed about a yard (meter) from two police officers. Witnesses told officers they saw Wallen pick up a chair, throw it off the roof and laugh about it.\n\nHe is facing three felony counts of reckless endangerment and one misdemeanor count of disorderly conduct.\n\nIn a statement issued by Wallen, he said he accepted \"responsibility\" and was \"not proud\" of his behavior. The statement mentioned making \"amends\" and touching base with law enforcement.\n\nWallen's \"One Thing at a Time\" album spent 16 weeks at the top of the Billboard 200 in 2023 and was the most-consumed album in the U.S. last year. Top 10 hits from the album included \"Last Night,\" \"You Proof\" and \"Thinkin' Bout Me.\"\n\nIn 2021, Wallen was suspended indefinitely from his label after video surfaced of him shouting a racial slur, which he would later say was ignorant of him to use.\n\nKid Rock's bar, not far from Wallen's new establishment, was the site of an earlier sign controversy. Ahead of a 2019 vote, some councilmembers bemoaned the design featuring a giant guitar in which the base of the instrument is intentionally shaped like a woman's buttocks. Ultimately, they approved it.\n\nTags Wire Morgan Wallen Nashville Bar Sign Law Enforcement Indictments Politics Celebrity U.s.

Only three members voted in favor of the sign, with 30 members voting against. Four council members abstained. Some members of the council cited Wallen's past controversial incidents as reasons for rejecting the sign.\n\nSignage requests for the outside of buildings that hang over public property -- including sidewalks -- are required to obtain council approval. \"I don't want to see a billboard up with the name of a person who's throwing chairs off of balconies and who is saying racial slurs,\" at-large council member Delishia Porterfield said, according to The Tennessean.\n\n\"Mr. Wallen is a fellow East Tennessean. He gives all of us a bad name,\" District 14 ouncil member Jordan Huffman added. \"His comments are hateful; his actions are harmful.\"\n\nHowever, such a decision is a case of government overreach, says the attorney: \"You can't as the government take negative action against something someone said. The Council was way out on a limb. It violates the First Amendment to say, 'You used the N-word therefore you can't put your name on a building.'\"\n\nPorterfield is referencing Wallen's January 2021 use of a racial slur that was caught on video, as well as his most recent arrest on April 7, when he was taken into custody on April 7 for allegedly throwing a chair off of the rooftop of Eric Church's six-story Chief's bar in downtown Nashville. Wallen was booked on three felony counts of reckless endangerment and one misdemeanor count of disorderly conduct. Wallen is slated to appear before a Nashville court in August.\n\nWallen's bar and restaurant, located at 107 4th Ave. N., adjacent to the Ryman Auditorium just off Nashville's Lower Broadway, is a partnership between Wallen and TC Restaurant Group, which licensed his name for the project. TC Restaurant Group is also behind other celebrity bars in downtown Nashville including Luke Bryan's 32 Bridge Food + Drink and Jason Aldean's Kitchen + Rooftop Bar.\n\nThe next step, says the attorney, is for TC Restaurant Group to take action in federal or chancery court against the Council. \"[TC Restaurant Group] has bought the right to use [Wallen's] name,\" the attorney says. \"Basically the city has taken that piece of property away from them. They can't do that without due process of law.\"\n\nA representative for Wallen declined to comment on the council's decision, as did Wallen's manager. Representatives for TC Restaurant Group declined to comment, adding only that the company is \"focused on This Bar's opening.\"", "source": {"uri": "billboard.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

(AP) - Nashville councilmembers have rejected plans for a glowing sign to be erected at Morgan Wallen's new bar along the city's neon-lit strip of honky tonks, citing his use of a racial slur that caused controversy in 2021 and recent criminal charges accusing the country star of throwing a chair off a rooftop near two police officers.\n\nThe Nashville Metro Council voted 30-3 Tuesday evening against the proposed sign at Morgan Wallen's This Bar & Tennessee Kitchen, which is set to open this weekend. The sign would have hung over a public sidewalk, similar to those at many neighboring bars. Such a sign requires local government approval and usually isn't a controversial process.\n\nDuring debate, councilmembers called Wallen's comments hateful and his actions harmful. They also said the performer has received multiple second chances.\n\n\"I don\u00b4t want to see a billboard up with the name of a person who is throwing chairs off of balconies and who is saying racial slurs,\" said Councilmember Delishia Porterfield, who is Black.\n\nCouncilmember Jacob Kupin presented the proposal, but said he \"thought long and hard\" about what to do because of Wallen's behavior. He said the third-party organization managing the business, TC Restaurant Group, has been \"really, a good partner\" and has worked to make downtown Nashville safer.\n\nThe Associated Press reached out to Wallen's publicist and TC Restaurant Group seeking comment on the council vote.\n\nFILE - Morgan Wallen arrives at the 56th annual CMA Awards, Nov. 9, 2022, in Nashville, Tenn.

According to an arrest affidavit, the chair that Wallen is accused of throwing off the roof of the six-story Chief\u00b4s bar on April 7 landed about a yard (meter) from two police officers. Witnesses told officers they saw Wallen pick up a chair, throw it off the roof and laugh about it.\n\nHe is facing three felony counts of reckless endangerment and one misdemeanor count of disorderly conduct.\n\nIn a statement issued by Wallen, he said he accepted \"responsibility\" and was \"not proud\" of his behavior. The statement mentioned making \"amends\" and touching base with law enforcement.\n\nWallen's \"One Thing at a Time\" album spent 16 weeks at the top of the Billboard 200 in 2023 and was the most-consumed album in the U.S. last year. Top 10 hits from the album included \"Last Night,\" \"You Proof\" and \"Thinkin\u00b4 Bout Me.\"\n\nIn 2021, Wallen was suspended indefinitely from his label after video surfaced of him shouting a racial slur, which he would later say was ignorant of him to use.\n\nKid Rock's bar, not far from Wallen's new establishment, was the site of an earlier sign controversy. Ahead of a 2019 vote, some councilmembers bemoaned the design featuring a giant guitar in which the base of the instrument is intentionally shaped like a woman\u00b4s buttocks.

With just days remaining until the bar opens its doors, local council members rejected the venue's request to add a 20-foot sign outside the building that would have featured Wallen's surname in big, blocky neon letters. The request was filed as an \"aerial encroachment\" resolution for local council members to consider because its proposed design had the sign sticking out from the side of the building.\n\nA total of 30 members of the Metro Council voted to reject the sign resolution on Tuesday, May 21, with many mentioning Wallen's recent behavior while explaining their hesitance about the proposal. Four council members abstained and only three, including one who sponsored the resolution, voted in its favor.\n\nRelated: Eric Church's Bar Commemorates Morgan Wallen's Chair-Throwing Incident With New Plaque\n\n\"These decisions should be based on city codes not personal reasons,\" one person wrote while commenting on an Instagram post about the decision that was shared by The Tennessean.\n\n\"Make it make sense \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffd\u2640\ufe0f,\" another wrote.\n\n\"So he's allowed to have a bar, just not a SIGN for the bar? Got it, makes sense,\" one fan wrote sarcastically.\n\n\"I can't stand him, but this is ridiculous,\" another Instagram user commented. \"This has nothing to do with his legal or social issues and shouldn't be connected. Doesn't the court decide such things?\"\n\nSeveral council members raised concerns about the \"Cowgirls\" singer while discussing the proposal, according to local news station WSMV-TV. The 31-year-old was arrested last month after allegedly throwing a chair off the roof of Eric Church's six-story Chiefs bar, which is also located in downtown Nashville. Others also pointed to a video from 2021 in which Wallen was heard using a racial slur.\n\nRelated: Morgan Wallen Gets Trolled at ACM Awards Following Recent Legal Trouble\n\nCouncil member Delishia Porterfield, who was among the \"no\" votes, cited Wallen's alleged chair-throwing incident and his use of a racial slur while explaining her decision to her fellow council members and constituents.\n\n\"We just voted down a resolution allowing an Aerial Encroachment with Morgan Wallen's name on it,\" Porterfield wrote on X, formerly Twitter. \"Yes THAT Morgan Wallen. The one who throws chairs & uses racial slurs. Nope! No thank you.\"\n\nPorterfield's tweet continued with a reference to \"Try That in a Small Town,\" a controversial song released by country music star Jason Aldean last year. \"Try that in a small town.... better yet....don't try it all,\" she wrote.\n\nJacob Kupin, the council member who sponsored the resolution, appeared conflicted about the proposed use of Wallen's name on the sign but ultimately decided to vote in favor of allowing its construction. He described the \"Last Night\" singer as a person who \"has not been a good actor downtown,\" according to The Tennessean, but said Wallen has also \"made efforts to apologize and to make amends.\"\n\nKupin further supported TC Restaurant Group, Wallen's partner in the venture, explaining that the company \"has been really a good partner in everything going on downtown.\" In addition to Wallen's new venue, TC Restaurant Group has restaurant partnerships with Aldean, Luke Bryan, Miranda Lambert and Florida Georgia Line's Brian Kelley and Tyler Hubbard.\n\nNext: Fans Are Divided

It is named \"Morgan Wallen's This Bar and Tennessee Kitchen.\" The group asked for permission from the city council for an \"aerial encroachment\" at the bar's location.\n\nThe group is required to ask permission before construction can start in downtown Nashville.\n\nThe majority of the Metro Council voted it down. On Tuesday, 30 members of the council voted against it. Some members said the country music star's April arrest after throwing a chair from the roof of a bar as well as his drunken behavior in which he used racial slurs led to their opposition.\n\n\"We want to make sure that Nashville was a supportive place for everyone, so I don't want to see a billboard with the name of a person who's throwing chairs off of balconies and who is saying racial slurs, using the n-word, so I'm voting no,\" said Delishia Porterfield, at-large council member.\n\nAnother council member from East Tennessee, Jordan Huffman, seconded her sentiments and said he takes offense at Wallen's behavior.\n\n\"I rise to oppose this,\" Huffman said. \"Number one - Mr. Wallen is an East Tennessean - he gives all of us a bad name. His comments are hateful, his comments are harmful, and you don't belong in this town, as far as I'm concerned. I'm tired of this city bending over to just, make anybody happy that makes a comment that they want to. We continue to go down this road.

(AP) -- Nashville councilmembers have rejected plans for a glowing sign to be erected at Morgan Wallen's new bar along the city's neon-lit strip of honky tonks, citing his use of a racial slur that caused controversy in 2021 and recent criminal charges accusing the country star of throwing a chair off a rooftop near two police officers.\n\nThe Nashville Metro Council voted 30-3 Tuesday evening against the proposed sign at Morgan Wallen's This Bar & Tennessee Kitchen, which is set to open this weekend. The sign would have hung over a public sidewalk, similar to those at many neighboring bars. Such a sign requires local government approval and usually isn't a controversial process.\n\nDuring debate, councilmembers called Wallen's comments hateful and his actions harmful. They also said the performer has received multiple second chances.\n\n\"I don't want to see a billboard up with the name of a person who is throwing chairs off of balconies and who is saying racial slurs,\" said Councilmember Delishia Porterfield, who is Black.\n\nCouncilmember Jacob Kupin presented the proposal, but said he \"thought long and hard\" about what to do because of Wallen's behavior. He said the third-party organization managing the business, TC Restaurant Group, has been \"really, a good partner\" and has worked to make downtown Nashville safer.\n\nThe Associated Press reached out to Wallen's publicist and TC Restaurant Group seeking comment on the council vote.\n\n\"The fact that someone's name is going up on a bar doesn't mean that we condone all the behavior, but again I appreciate the efforts to make amends, the positive response, and again, the operator themselves I don't think should be penalized for what happened,\" Kupin said.\n\nAn initial hearing in Wallen's criminal case was postponed until Aug. 15. According to an arrest affidavit, the chair that Wallen is accused of throwing off the roof of the six-story Chief's bar on April 7 landed about a yard (meter) from two police officers. Witnesses told officers they saw Wallen pick up a chair, throw it off the roof and laugh about it.\n\nHe is facing three felony counts of reckless endangerment and one misdemeanor count of disorderly conduct.\n\nIn a statement issued by Wallen, he said he accepted \"responsibility\" and was \"not proud\" of his behavior. The statement mentioned making \"amends\" and touching base with law enforcement.\n\nWallen's \"One Thing at a Time\" album spent 16 weeks at the top of the Billboard 200 in 2023 and was the most-consumed album in the U.S. last year. Top 10 hits from the album included \"Last Night,\" \"You Proof\" and \"Thinkin' Bout Me.\"\n\nIn 2021, Wallen was suspended indefinitely from his label after video surfaced of him shouting a racial slur, which he would later say was ignorant of him to use.\n\nKid Rock's bar, not far from Wallen's new establishment, was the site of an earlier sign controversy. Ahead of a 2019 vote, some councilmembers bemoaned the design featuring a giant guitar in which the base of the instrument is intentionally shaped like a woman's buttocks. Ultimately, they approved it.", "source": {"uri": "hosted.ap.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Associated Press"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morgan_Wallen", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Morgan Wallen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nashville,_Tennessee", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nashville, Tennessee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nashville, Tennessee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennessee", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tennessee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tennessee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigger", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Nigger"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_Council_of_Nashville_and_Davidson_County", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Metropolitan Council of Nashville and Davidson County"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honky-tonk", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Honky-tonk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Local government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downtown", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Downtown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billboard_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Billboard (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Thing_at_a_Time", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "One Thing at a Time"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_Proof", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "You Proof"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_Night_(Morgan_Wallen_song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Last Night (Morgan Wallen song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kid_Rock", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kid Rock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billboard_200", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Billboard 200"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misdemeanor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Misdemeanor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disorderly_conduct", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Disorderly conduct"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Felony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_chart", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Record chart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affidavit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Affidavit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guitar", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Guitar"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 88}], "image": "summary_large_image", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9590207", "eventUri": "eng-9590207", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tennessee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-08-15", "textStart": 1806, "textEnd": 1813}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-07", "textStart": 1939, "textEnd": 1946}], "sentiment": 0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 191, "relevance": 1}

Perhaps there, unlike most public places, chair-throwing will be welcome, or even encouraged?\n\nHowever, the city council has now voted to bar (ha, get it?) a 20-foot neon sign emblazoned with the musician's name from hanging from the bar and over the sidewalk below due to his reputation for being a not-so-upstanding citizen, The Tennessean reports.\n\nMorgan Wallen's This Bar, a bar and restaurant named after Wallen and his 2019 hit \"This Bar\" but run by a third-party business, is set to open this weekend on Fourth Avenue North in Nashville's famed Lower Broadway entertainment district, adjacent to the legendary Ryman Auditorium.\n\nCity council members voted 30-3 to deny the establishment's bid to construct a massive sign advertising the establishment with Wallen's name on it, citing the recent arrest -- which happened just 600 feet from the bar location -- and felony charges, as well as that time in 2021 when the singer-songwriter was caught on video yelling a racial slur.

He gives all of us a bad name. His comments are hateful; his actions are harmful.\"\n\nWait, are actions actually having consequences now? Huh! Last December, in his first major interview in two years, Wallen addressed the incident, saying, \"There's no excuse. I've never made an excuse. I never will make an excuse. ... I think, for me, in my heart I was never that guy that people were portraying me to be, so there was a little bit of like, 'Damn, I'm kind of actually mad about this a little bit because I know I shouldn't have said this, but I'm really not that guy.'\"", "source": {"uri": "exclaim.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "Exclaim.ca"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigger", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nigger"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morgan_Wallen", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Morgan Wallen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billboard", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Billboard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nashville,_Tennessee", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Nashville, Tennessee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nashville, Tennessee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neon_sign", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Neon sign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tennessean", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Tennessean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Church", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eric Church"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadway_(Nashville,_Tennessee)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Broadway (Nashville, Tennessee)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryman_Auditorium", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ryman Auditorium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Felony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanging", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hanging"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Park_Avenue", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Park Avenue"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jordan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jordan"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 62}], "image": "https://assets.exclaim.ca/image/upload/v1704479714/morgan_wallen_2023.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9590207", "eventUri": "eng-9590207", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-21", "textStart": 1645, "textEnd": 1651}], "sentiment": -0.04313725490196074, "wgt": 177, "relevance": 1}

Rather than discuss design standards, council members voted against signage 30-3 because of Wallen's behavior in recent years -- including the most recent allegation of Wallen throwing a chair from six stories down onto Broadway at the feet of Metro Nashville police officers. Four council members abstained from the vote.\n\n\"I don't want to see a billboard up with the name of a person who's throwing chairs off of balconies and who is saying racial slurs,\" said councilwoman Delishia Porterfield.

He later apologized.\n\nEarlier this month, Wallen's first appearance in court happened regarding throwing the chair via his attorney Worrick Robinson. He is charged with three counts of reckless endangerment because of the vicinity of the police officers and one charge of disorderly conduct.\n\nWallen was also previously arrested in downtown Nashville in 2020.\n\nThe country artist has since apologized for his actions around the thrown chair.\n\nHis next court date on the issue will happen Aug. 15 at 9 a.m.\n\nRhori recommends: Corbin, Vandy Boys support Sullivan family\n\nSmall gestures can have such a big impact.

(AP) -- Nashville councilmembers have rejected plans for a glowing sign to be erected at Morgan Wallen's new bar along the city's neon-lit strip of honky tonks, citing his use of a racial slur that caused controversy in 2021 and recent criminal charges accusing the country star of throwing a chair off a rooftop near two police officers.\n\nThe Nashville Metro Council voted 30-3 Tuesday evening against the proposed sign at Morgan Wallen's This Bar & Tennessee Kitchen, which is set to open this weekend. The sign would have hung over a public sidewalk, similar to those at many neighboring bars. Such a sign requires local government approval and usually isn't a controversial process.\n\nDuring debate, councilmembers called Wallen's comments hateful and his actions harmful. They also said the performer has received multiple second chances.\n\nPeople are also reading...

He said the third-party organization managing the business, TC Restaurant Group, has been \"really, a good partner\" and has worked to make downtown Nashville safer.\n\nThe Associated Press reached out to Wallen's publicist and TC Restaurant Group seeking comment on the council vote.\n\n\"The fact that someone's name is going up on a bar doesn't mean that we condone all the behavior, but again I appreciate the efforts to make amends, the positive response, and again, the operator themselves I don't think should be penalized for what happened,\" Kupin said.\n\nAn initial hearing in Wallen's criminal case was postponed until Aug. 15. According to an arrest affidavit, the chair that Wallen is accused of throwing off the roof of the six-story Chief's bar on April 7 landed about a yard (meter) from two police officers. Witnesses told officers they saw Wallen pick up a chair, throw it off the roof and laugh about it.\n\nHe is facing three felony counts of reckless endangerment and one misdemeanor count of disorderly conduct.\n\nIn a statement issued by Wallen, he said he accepted \"responsibility\" and was \"not proud\" of his behavior. The statement mentioned making \"amends\" and touching base with law enforcement.\n\nWallen's \"One Thing at a Time\" album spent 16 weeks at the top of the Billboard 200 in 2023 and was the most-consumed album in the U.S. last year. Top 10 hits from the album included \"Last Night,\" \"You Proof\" and \"Thinkin' Bout Me.\"\n\nIn 2021, Wallen was suspended indefinitely from his label after video surfaced of him shouting a racial slur, which he would later say was ignorant of him to use.\n\nKid Rock's bar, not far from Wallen's new establishment, was the site of an earlier sign controversy. Ahead of a 2019 vote, some councilmembers bemoaned the design featuring a giant guitar in which the base of the instrument is intentionally shaped like a woman's buttocks. Ultimately, they approved it.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Please try again later{{ /verifyErrors }}\n\nMorgan Wallen has been prevented from erecting a 20-foot sign bearing his name over Nashville's Broadway after the city council rejected his planning proposal citing his recent felony arrest and use of \"racial slurs\".\n\nThe country star, 31, is set to open a new bar this Friday (24 May) on the city's Honky Tonk Highway, a busy area known for its neon signs.\n\nThe establishment will be called Morgan Wallen's This Bar, a nod to his 2019 single \"This Bar\", but will not feature a sign of its own after council members voted against it by a margin of 30-3.\n\n\"I don't want to see a billboard up with the name of a person who's throwing chairs off of balconies and who is saying racial slurs,\" At-large Council member Delishia Porterfield said, as reported by The Tennessean.\n\n\"Mr Wallen is a fellow East Tennessean. He gives all of us a bad name,\" another council member reportedly said. \"His comments are hateful; his actions are harmful.\"\n\nWallen was arrested in April and charged with three felony counts after allegedly throwing a chair off the roof of another six-story Broadway bar.\n\nTwo police officers with the Metro Nashville Police Department said the chair landed just a few feet from them.\n\nOfficers reviewed the bar's security footage, which reportedly showed Wallen lunging and then throwing the object over the roof.\n\nThe incident came after Wallen spent years repairing his image after being filmed using a racial slur in 2021.\n\nWallen was suspended from his record label after the video emerged of him using the n-word.\n\nThe footage, reportedly filmed by neighbors annoyed at the late-night disturbance and then shared by TMZ, showed Wallen coming home from a night out with friends when he yelled the racial slur at a friend twice.\n\nIn a five-minute apology video shared a week after the incident, Wallen said he was on \"hour 72 of a 72-hour bender\" when he'd used the slur.\n\nRevealing he'd been sober since the video was shared, he said he had accepted \"some invitations from some amazing Black organizations and executives and leaders to engage in some very real and honest conversations\".\n\nDespite his string of controversies, Wallen has remained one of the most commercially successful artists in the US.\n\nEarlier this year his third studio album, 2023's One Thing at a Time, spent 19 weeks at the top of the Billboard 100 charts, making it the longest-running number-one country album of all time.\n\nMeanwhile, his single \"Last Night\" stayed atop the Billboard Hot 100 for 16 weeks, beating Harry Styles's \"As It Was\" for the record of longest number-one run for a non-collaboration.", "source": {"uri": "independent.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Independent"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

But the Metro Nashville City Council is making him change his plans for a sign that the country music superstar wanted to install outside of his bar.\n\nTC Restaurant Group, the hospitality company that partnered with Wallen for the bar (and also operates bars like Jason Aldean's Kitchen & Rooftop Bar, Luke's 32 Bridge, Miranda Lambert's Casa Rosa and Lainey Wilson's upcoming Bell Bottoms Up), had requested permission for an \"aerial encroachment\" for the sign to hang over the new bar, located at 107 4th Avenue North, just beside the Ryman Auditorium.\n\nThe sign would have hung above the entrance to the bar, but because it encroached on a city right of way, owners needed to get permission from the council to install it.\n\nBut the council made it clear that they weren't exactly happy with Wallen right now, with many citing his recent arrest for throwing a chair off the rooftop of Eric Church's downtown Nashville bar, Chief's, as well as his racial slur incident back in 2021, and ultimately voted against allowing the sign to hang in front of the bar.\n\nNow, is it petty? Sure. I mean, I don't exactly think of Broadway as a bastion of morals and upstanding citizens. People aren't going downtown looking for a role model: They're looking to get hammered.\n\nAnd it was also clearly a political move by the council to send whatever small message that they could to Wallen that they don't approve of his behavior. It had nothing to do with the actual sign and everything to do with the name on it.\n\nBut it's also not the first time the Nashville City Council got their panties in a wad over a proposed sign outside of a bar on Broadway.\n\nKid Rock's Big Ass Honky Tonk Rock & Roll Steakhouse (yes, that's the real name of it, for anybody who's not aware) opened back in 2018 ago on Lower Broadway, and at the time, some members of the city council were up in arms over the proposed neon sign on the front of the bar.\n\nThe design shouldn't have really come as a surprise for a bar called \"Big Ass Honky Tonk Rock & Roll Steakhouse.\" It was an ass.\n\nWell, it's a guitar that's meant to look like an ass. But it's clearly an ass. (Apparently it's one thing to have the word \"ass\" hanging out on the street, but it's another to have a sign depicting an actual ass).\n\nOne member of the city council said that the sign \"crosses the line between good taste, family-friendliness, and I think what we would like Nashville to portray to people who come to visit us.\" Yeah, because nothing says \"family friendly\" like a row of bars full of bachelorettes sipping beer out of penis straws at 11 AM on a Tuesday.\n\nKid Rock's sign was ultimately approved by the city council by a vote of 27-3, although the council was really only voting on whether to allow the hanging sign as opposed to the design of the sign.\n\nThe controversy seemed to be limited to city council, as online polls like one from local news station WKRN showed that the general public was just fine with the big ass sign (only 13% found it \"offensive\").\n\nI have a feeling that the sentiment around Morgan's bar is much the same. It's a half-hearted attempt to punish Morgan for reasons that don't even make sense when you consider the environment on Broadway.\n\nThe council can claim all they want that they're trying to make Broadway a safer place, but at the same time they're not about to take any steps that destroy the city's cash cow - so for now, they're limited to arguing about signs and sending meaningless messages that, if we've seen anything about Morgan and his fanbase in the past, is only going to make the bar more popular than it would have been before.\n\nBut hey, at least they felt like they did something -

His felony and misdemeanor charges are currently pending as he awaits his day in court.\n\n\"I don't want to see a billboard up with the name of a person who's throwing chairs off of balconies and who is saying racial slurs,\" said At-Large councilmember Delishia Porterfield, per a report from The Tennessean.\n\nThe council voted 30-3 to reject the sign's construction, while four councilmembers abstained. The bar is located adjacent to the Ryman Auditorium at 107 Fourth Avenue North. It is six stories, with six bars, three stages, and a rooftop. The project is in collaboration with TC Restaurant Group, which is also working on Lainey Wilson's bar.\n\n[RELATED: Morgan Wallen ACM Awards Troll Sends Social Media into a Tailspin]\n\nMorgan Wallen's Bar to Open on Broadway, TC Restaurant Group Also Working with Lainey Wilson\n\nAnother celebrity bar is coming to Nashville's Honky Tonk Highway.

(WKRN) -- Country artist Morgan Wallen's upcoming new honky-tonk will not have a large sign joining the ones on Broadway after the Metro Council soundly denied the application.\n\nAt its May 21 meeting, the Metro Council voted 3-30-4 against the application the bar's ownership group, 4th Avenue Property LLC, submitted for a large illuminated sign for the upcoming venue.\n\nBrought by Councilmember Jacob Kupin, the resolution would have allowed for the \"aerial encroachment\" at the bar's 4th Avenue home.\n\nDuring the meeting, Kupin said the matter came across his desk \"right about the time that he decided to throw a chair off of a rooftop, nearly hitting some first responders.\"\n\nSince then, Kupin said he'd heard from people who have had similar near-misses, and it struck him that \"we're putting up a sign with someone's name on it who has not been a good actor downtown.\" Because Wallen has since made efforts to make amends for his behavior, Kupin said he felt comfortable moving the issue forward, noting that TC Management Group, which is managing the food inside the upcoming bar, has been an excellent partner downtown.\n\n\"They've been easy to access; they've been conversational with me. They've worked on efforts to make downtown a safer place,\" he said.\n\nKupin added how supporting the sign resolution would not mean condoning the actions of the man whose name is associated with the bar, noting TC Restaurant Group's professionalism in the endeavor.\n\nBut the resolution quickly took a turn, with council members stating they could not support the sign or the bar while also passing legislation designed to affirm Nashville's status as a welcoming place for all.\n\nCM At-Large Delishia Porterfield said during the meeting she would not support the resolution, saying she couldn't support someone who throws chairs off of a downtown bar roof and using racial slurs.\n\nCM Brenda Gadd said she could not in good conscience support the resolution, given that Wallen has received multiple chances to improve his behavior and has not taken up the mantle at doing so.\n\nCM Jordan Huffman said Wallen gave East Tennesseans like himself \"a bad name.\"\n\n\"His comments are hateful. His actions are harmful, and he don't belong in this town, as far as I'm concerned,\" he said during the meeting. \"I'm tired of this city bending over to just make anybody happy to make a comment that they want to. We can't continue to go down this road. I encourage my colleagues to vote against this.\"\n\nHe later told News 2 the vote against Wallen's sign wasn't \"a political thing\" at all.\n\n\"It's just as simple as this: if you act a fool, you should be held accountable, and Republicans and Democrats came together and sent a unifying message to Mr. Wallen last night that if you want to own an establishment within our city, then you need to know that the city will hold you accountable for your actions,\" he said.\n\nKupin later told News 2 the situation was an interesting one for the Council, as most aerial encroachment measures sail through Council on the consent agenda without discussion.\n\n\"We don't tolerate hate or bigotry,\" Kupin said. \"We don't tolerate people throwing stuff off buildings. My goal was to make that statement clear and try to draw that distinction from the actual sign itself.\n\n\"It was a really tough balance, because you've got this individual that's working against some of the initiatives we have going on, but you also have a bar owner group that is working with the initiatives that we have going on, so it's really a tough balance to strike. What I settled on was, I'm going to carry it, I'm going to sponsor it, but I'm going to make sure that myself and my colleagues have an opportunity to weigh in and talk about it, because I think this is really an important thing for our body to look at as a whole.\"\n\nStill, Kupin remains hopeful Wallen and his fans can take Tuesday night's vote in the spirit in which it was meant and move forward.\n\n\"My hope is that Morgan and his fans take that as a message to say, you know, go have a good time; be a great country singer; perform, do all these things, but be a good actor. You know, take care of other people, treat other people right.

is nearly ready to open its doors over Memorial Day weekend despite Morgan's recent arrest.\n\nThis Bar and Tennessee Kitchen was spotted under active construction in recent photos obtained exclusively by The U.S. Sun.\n\nWorkers were pictured standing high up on a crane working on the sign on the front of the brick building.\n\nThe sign reads, \"Morgan Wallen's This Bar.\"\n\nThe entrance of the building was entirely blocked off.\n\nA giant black banner hung on top of the construction barriers.\n\nThe sign announced the opening of the country-themed watering hole for summer 2024, but didn't specify a date.\n\nHis website for This Bar confirmed the establishment's plans to open over Memorial Day weekend.\n\nIn light of Morgan's recent arrest, the Nashville Council rejected the plans for a twenty-foot-tall sign to advertise the establishment.\n\nThe council flagged concern regarding his past use of a racial slur and pending felony charges since an April incident, according to The Tennessean.\n\n\"I don't want to see a billboard up with the name of a person who's throwing chairs off of balconies and who is saying racial slurs,\" Council member Delishia Porterfield stated.\n\nOn April 7, Morgan was detained by officers and arrested for throwing a chair off the roof of Chief's Bar.\n\nThe arrest report claimed the chair landed three feet from where some cops were standing on the street below the six-story building.\n\nMorgan was charged with three counts of reckless endangerment and disorderly conduct.\n\nHe was booked after midnight on a $15,250 bail and was released hours later.\n\nIt's not the first occasion when the country music star has caused unrest in public.\n\nDating back to 2016, the singer was charged with a DUI, but the case was later dismissed.\n\nOn May 23, 2020, Morgan was asked to leave Kid Rock's Big Ass Honky Tonk Rock N' Roll Steakhouse due to him kicking glass items and engaging in verbal fights with pedestrians.\n\nAfter Morgan apologized for his actions the charges were dropped.\n\nThe country music star sparked controversy partying in Alabama at the height of the pandemic lockdown.\n\nOn February 2, 2021, Morgan was caught on camera using a racial slur.\n\nAs a result, his music was pulled from radio stations across the country and suspended by his record label, Big Loud.\n\nMorgan posted a public apology video on his social media on February 10, 2020.", "source": {"uri": "the-sun.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The US Sun"}, "authors": [{"uri": "teresa_roca@the-sun.com",

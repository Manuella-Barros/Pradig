All economists surveyed by Reuters are expecting the cash rate to remain steady at 4.35% for a fifth consecutive meeting. Attention is likely to focus on the wording of the RBA\u2019s statement and comments by governor Michele Bullock when she holds the now customary post-gathering media conference at the bank\u2019s temporary digs in Sydney. (Its HQ is in the midst of a costly and lengthy refurbishment after the Martin Place building was found to have more asbestos than expected.) The board is almost certain to have considered another rate rise \u2013 which would have been the 14th since the cycle began in May 2022. Mortgage holders on a typical $600,000 loan are already paying back about $1450 more each month since then, according to RateCity. Prospects of a rate cut before the end of 2024 dimmed after inflation slowed less than expected in the March quarter. The RBA even predicts consumer price increases will accelerate in the current quarter before resuming their retreat. The economy is also throwing up mixed signals about its strength. GDP growth all but stalled at the start of this year but employment has remained surprisingly strong with the jobless rate hovering at about 4%. The RBA will also be trying to anticipate the impact of May\u2019s federal budget. The stage three cuts and the first of four quarterly energy rebates of $75 per residence kick in from 1 July. Bullock, we might expect, will repeat her mantra of not \u201cruling anything in or out\u201d. Still, her comments will be listened to closely as to what direction the RBA\u2019s next move will be, and when. Watch out for the board\u2019s decision at 2.30pm AEST and the start of her media conference an hour later.", "summary": "<p>Australian prime minister says there\u2019s no point \u2018shaking your fist\u2019 over the incident.

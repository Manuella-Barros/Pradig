[+] call in the hallway getty More than a quarter of Americans have a disability, and disability is often intersectional with other dimensions of diversity (e.g., race, class, age). Accessibility is increasingly important to ensure that we're designing environments where people with different needs can thrive. Inclusive space design helps achieve that goal. In my interview with Cheryl Durst, IIDA executive vice president and CEO focused on inclusive space design, she shared, \u201cThe physical environment affects our emotions and our sense of belonging. When you walk into a space, you feel an experience viscerally if you belong or not.\u201d Inclusive Design Principles To create more inclusive spaces, start by asking the question: is this space inclusive to all human beings who utilize it? While there is no one-size-fits-all criteria, consider these principles to start: Accessibility: clear pathways, access for mobility aids and uncluttered spaces Flexible seating: chairs, stability balls, bean bags, cushions and standing desks Visual cues and signage: restroom, quiet spaces and collaboration spaces Sensory considerations: noise-canceling headphones, fidget tools Use of natural lighting: dimmable lights and adjustable window coverings Assistive technology: screen readers, text-to-speech software and alternative keyboards Inclusive decor: posters, artwork and photographs that represent a diverse range of cultures Safety considerations: secure heavy furniture, cover sharp edges and ensure ventilation Collaborate: let people co-create their physical space to empower them (when possible) Ongoing evaluation and improvement: be ready to pivot as needed Durst recommends that, when designing or redesigning spaces, you put yourself in the shoes of those who are using the space. \u201cBe deeply empathetic for those experiencing the space. Take into consideration the aggregate experience of most people,\u201d Durst suggests.

Ask groups that may need more accommodations for feedback, without blame or shame. Existing spaces often do not need full remodels, but instead small changes in how they are used and accessed. Consider these assessment questions: Ask, \u201cWhat do you need to feel included?\u201d or, more specifically, \u201cWhat do you need to complete X goal?\u201d or \u201cWhat do you need to feel good here?\u201d Share a story about a place or experience that made you feel good or at your best, or share other ideas to spur discussion. Facilitate a discussion where everyone shares what they need and make a community bulletin board or visual accountability space to remind the group of their needs.

It's important that it's a continued conversation over time. As organizations serve more employees, customers and community members, needs will change. As Durst summarizes, \u201cWhen we are comfortable, we tend to feel safer. Safe places mean more than physical security, they are also emotionally secure.\u201d Inclusive space design is about accessibility for the most marginalized parts of society\u2014creating spaces for all that work better for all.

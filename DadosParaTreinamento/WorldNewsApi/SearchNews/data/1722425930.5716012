(WSVN) - A senior-level Doral Police officer said he was forced off the force, less than two months after the dismissal of another high-ranking officer at the department. Speaking with 7News on Friday, former Doral Police Deputy Chief Manuel Arrebola said he thinks he knows why he was fired. \u201cI think that there is some political thing going on there in the city, something to do with the previous mayor\u2019s pension being taken away, and all this is retaliation,\u201d he said. \u201cI haven\u2019t told to this day why I was fired.\u201d Arrebola, a 38-year veteran, spent the last year as Doral Police\u2019s second-in-command. He was let go less than a week after 7News interviewed another officer booted from the department: Jose Seiglie. \u201cThis has taken a toll,\u201d Seiglie told 7News before he broke down in tears. Sieglie, a veteran of more than 40 years and former Doral Police administrator, filed a $2 million lawsuit against the city and Doral Mayor Christi Fraga for compensation and his job back. The seething Sieglie, 66, slammed his former place of work, its current chief, Edwin Lopez, and Arrebola. When asked whether he was fired because of the story that 7News aired about Sieglie and his lawsuit, Arrebola said, \u201cThey\u2019re totally unrelated.\u201d When 7News asked Sieglie why he was fired, he replied, \u201cFor calling the police chief \u2018a lightweight\u2019 and the deputy chief \u2018a piece of [expletive].\u2019\u201d When asked again whether Sieglie\u2019s comments and anything to do with the department\u2019s decision, Arrebola said, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Arrebola reiterated he doesn\u2019t think the firings are connected, adding Sieglie\u2019s termination was likely linked to a foul-mouthed rant to Doral\u2019s city manager . \u201cThey escorted me to my house like a common criminal, after 45 years in this profession, to pick up my uniforms, like if I was some kind of freaking criminal,\u201d said Sieglie. \u201cI would say \u2018unhinged\u2019 is pretty accurate,\u201d said Arrebola. Doral\u2019s current city manager, Rey Valdes, responded to 7News\u2019 inquiry about Arrebola\u2019s firing by stating: \u201cAs a mater of personal policy, I do not discuss personnel matters.\u201dDoral City Manager Rey Valdes As of late Friday night, neither Fraga nor Lopez have responded to 7News\u2019 requests for comment.

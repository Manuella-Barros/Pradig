A glut of votes from his own heartland in Headford appear to have given Cllr Reddington the jump on party colleague, Cllr Pete Roche who is just behind him on 16.5%. Cllr Donagh Killilea (FF) looks set to hold his seat with 9%, while former councillor Shaun Cunniffe, who lost his seat in 2019, is on course to make a return to local politics. The Independent Ireland candidate, Mr Cunniffe is in fifth position in this seven-seater, closely followed by sitting Councillor Mary Hoade on almost 9%. New candidate, Ollie Turner (FG) is well in contention for one of the final seats on 7.9% of first preferences, just ahead of his neighbour in Dunmore, sitting Cllr Joe Sheridan (FF) who is on 7.8%. Independent Councillor Karey McHugh Farag is in the danger zone, sitting in eight position with 6.8%, but all eyes will be on early transfers. Aont\u00fa candidate Luke Silke is on 3.59%, while Sinn F\u00e9in\u2019s Stiof\u00e1n De Lundres \u00d3 D\u00e1laigh is on 2.87%. Caption: Sean Cunniffe, set for a return to local politics.

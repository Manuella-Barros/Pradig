{"id": 225004138, "title": "Petition To Impeach Samuel Alito Passes 75K Signatures", "text": "A petition to impeach Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito over accepting gifts from conservative billionaire Paul Singer has been signed more than 75,000 times.The signees believe Alito should be punished for accepting a seat on Singer's private plane and for going on a luxury fishing trip to Alaska that was hosted by another right-wing businessman.He did not declare these gifts or recuse himself when Singer had dealings with the court, the nonprofit newsroom ProPublica first reported last June.The Move On petition, addressed to the United States Senate, has been active for almost a year, reaching 50,000 signatures 10 months ago.People who have signed over the past few weeks have done so amid the controversy around Alito's household flying an inverted flag in January 2021\u2014after it had become a symbol of the \"Stop the Steal\" campaign which aimed to overturn the 2020 election on the false claim that President Joe Biden did not win legitimately.On the back of this, Alito has faced calls to recuse himself from cases involving the 2020 election and the chaos which took place on January 6 over concerns he is too biased.People who have signed the petition recently do not mention the flag controversy directly, but rather write about being angry in general.Barbara said: \"Because we all have to be outraged. Tell me where to show up for the protests.\"Melanie K said Alito's \"behavior and ideology is unacceptable\" and called him a \"traitor to the Constitution and country\".Tim G. wrote that Alito \"has shown he believes he is above the law\u2014that is harmful to the justice in our beloved country.\"At the time the story about the gifts given to Alito came out, he said the ProPublica report \"misleads its readers.\"Newsweek has contacted Alito for comment via email to the Supreme Court's Public Information Office.Alito wrote an opinion piece for The Wall Street Journal in which he said: \"My recollection is that I have spoken to Mr. Singer on no more than a handful of occasions, all of which (with the exception of small talk during a fishing trip 15 years ago) consisted of brief and casual comments at events attended by large groups.\"On no occasion have we discussed the activities of his businesses, and we have never talked about any case or issue before the court.\"On two occasions, he introduced me before I gave a speech\u2014as have dozens of other people. And, as I will discuss, he allowed me to occupy what would have otherwise been an unoccupied seat on a private flight to Alaska.\"It was and is my judgment that these facts would not cause a reasonable and unbiased person to doubt my ability to decide the matters in question impartially.\"It comes as The New York Times published an article to debunk Alito's version of events with the inverted flag.He had claimed that, during a dispute with liberal neighbors who had put up anti-Donald Trump signs in their yard, his wife had been called \"the c-word\".The justice said she was \"distraught\" over this and hung the U.S. upside down \"for a short time,\" according to his interview with Fox News' reporter Shannon Bream.But the Times found that the flag was hung that way\u2014and taken down\u2014weeks before this incident took place, according to their analysis of a text message and the original police call, corroborated by Fairfax County authorities.", "summary": "It comes amid the controversy around his household hanging an inverted American flag in January 2021.", "url": "https://www.newsweek.com/samuel-alito-petition-impeach-inverted-flag-paul-singer-1905768", "image": "https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2400525/samuel-alito-testifies.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 12:12:53", "author": "Jordan King", "authors": ["Jordan King"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.214}

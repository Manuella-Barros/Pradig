{"id": 232061594, "title": "ITV Coronation Street star lets slip more Rowan victims ahead of dark Leanne twist", "text": "Coronation Street star Emrhys Cooper has let slip that his character Rowan Cunliffe could target more characters on the cobbles. Soap watchers will recall that mysterious newcomer Rowan has targeted Leanne Battersby with his \"self-improvement group\" The Institute. Rowan has also been pulling Leanne away from partner Nick Tilsley and even her sister Toyah Battersby during her time of need. Rowan has been encouraging Leanne to open up about her past and the trauma she has faced, using his tools and guiding her to speak aloud about parts of her life. In a shock twist, Rowan was recently revealed to be recording everything Leanne was saying without her knowledge. Of course, viewers will recall that Toyah has been concerned for Leanne and extremely sceptical of Rowan. In recent scenes, Leanne even headed off to a retreat with The Institute and she didn't even say goodbye to some of her family while on Friday night it was revealed that Rowan and The Institute had created an AI version of Leanne's late son Oliver, who tragically died in 2020 after a battle with mitochondrial disease. Next week, spoilers have revealed a dark twist for Leanne as Toyah receives a call saying that Leanne has been involved in a motorbike accident after travelling with Rowan. Talking about the current storyline, Rowan actor Emrhys has warned his character could recruit more cobbles' residents to The Institute. Speaking to Inside Soap, actor Emrhys said: \"I think that he really wants to open another resource centre, so he\u2019s on a mission to raise the investment needed, however he can do that. And he wants to \u2018help\u2019 more people, so there might be some more characters he\u2019s bringing into the organisation\u2026\" As Rowan continues to isolate Leanne from her family and shows more worrying signs, Toyah star Georgia Taylor recently teased the character's downfall. Talking about Rowan being exposed, Georgia said: \"It's going to be so good to play\", adding: \"But I have to say, I'm loving working with Emrhys [Cooper, who plays Rowan]. \"We've had quite a few scenes now where they have a big stand off and they're so delicious. Everything he's doing is just so understated but really creepy at the same time, and subversive. He's an absolute delight to be on set with, he's such a nice man in real life so I don't want it to be too soon but when he is taken down, I want it to be something massive and dramatic and humiliating.\" Coronation Street airs Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays at 8pm on ITV1 and ITV X.* Follow Mirror Celebs and TV on TikTok , Snapchat , Instagram , Twitter , Facebook , YouTube and Threads.", "summary": "Coronation Street's Leanne Battersby will be left in danger next week as the ITV soap's cult storyline with Rowan Cunliffe takes a very dark turn with more victims now teased", "url": "https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/itv-coronation-street-star-lets-32992973", "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article32993126.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/11_04_coro_toyah_rowan_02.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 16:10:33", "author": "Olivia Wheeler,Olivia-Wheeler", "authors": ["Olivia Wheeler", "Olivia-Wheeler"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": 0.201}

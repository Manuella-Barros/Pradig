The zoo made the announcement Wednesday, about half a year after it sent its three pandas back to China. Other American zoos also have sent pandas back to China as loan agreements lapsed amid heightened diplomatic tensions between the U.S. and China. The Smithsonian\u2019s National Zoo and Conservation Biology Institute said the pair of pandas are Bao Li (pronounced BOW'-lee) and Qing Bao (ching-BOW\u2019). Giant pandas are icons in Washington, D.C., and beloved around the nation and the world. For more than five decades, the institute has created and maintained one of the world\u2019s foremost giant panda conservation programs, helping move the panda from \u201cendangered\u201d to \u201cvulnerable\u201d on the global list of species at risk of extinction. \u201cWe\u2019re thrilled to announce the next chapter of our breeding and conservation partnership begins by welcoming two new bears, including a descendent of our beloved panda family, to Washington, D.C.,\u201d said Brandie Smith, the institute\u2019s John and Adrienne Mars director. \u201cThis historic moment is proof positive our collaboration with Chinese colleagues has made an irrefutable impact. Through this partnership, we have grown the panda population, advanced our shared understanding of how to care for this beloved bear and learned what\u2019s needed to protect wild pandas and preserve native habitat.\u201d In the video announcement released today on the institute\u2019s social media channels, first lady Dr. Jill Biden joined Smithsonian Secretary Lonnie G. Bunch III and Smith to reveal pandas are coming back to the nation\u2019s capital. This news comes just six months after giant pandas Tian Tian, Mei Xiang and their cub, Xiao Qi Ji, went to China last November, prompting a nationwide outpouring of farewell from millions of panda fans of all ages. Zoo Atlanta, the last U.S. zoo with pandas in its care, expects to say goodbye to the four giant bears this fall. The zoo was making preparations to return panda parents Lun Lun and Yang Yang to China along with their American-born twins Ya Lun and Xi Lun, zoo officials said earlier this month. There was no date for the transfer, they said, but it will likely happen between October and December. It\u2019s possible that America will welcome another new panda pair before the Atlanta bears depart. The San Diego Zoo said last month that staff members recently traveled to China to meet pandas Yun Chuan and Xin Bao, which could arrive in California as soon as this summer. Chinese President Xi Jinping had signaled during a trip in late 2023 that China would be sending new pandas to the United States. He called them \u201cenvoys of friendship between the Chinese and American peoples.\u201d \u201cWe are ready to continue our cooperation with the United States on panda conservation, and do our best to meet the wishes of the Californians so as to deepen the friendly ties between our two peoples,\u201d Xi said during a speech with business leaders while he was attending a summit of Indo-Pacific leaders and meeting with President Joe Biden. Pandas have long been the symbol of the U.S.-China friendship since Beijing gifted a pair to the National Zoo in 1972, ahead of the normalization of bilateral relations. Later, Beijing loaned the pandas to other U.S. zoos, with proceeds going back to panda conservation programs. \u201cI was told that many American people, especially children, were really reluctant to say goodbye to the pandas, and went to the zoo to see them off,\u201d Xi said in his speech. He added that he learned the San Diego Zoo and people in California \u201cvery much look forward to welcoming pandas back.\u201d When U.S-China relations began to sour in recent years, members of the Chinese public started to demand the return of giant pandas. Unproven allegations that U.S. zoos mistreated the pandas, known as China\u2019s \u201cnational treasure,\u201d flooded China\u2019s social media. The National Zoo said the pandas coming to Washington are: \u2014 Bao Li, a 2-year-old male whose name means \u201ctreasure\u201d and \u201cenergetic.\u201d He was born Aug. 4, 2021, at the China Conservation and Research Center for the Giant Panda in Sichuan to father An An and mother Bao Bao. The zoo said Bao Li\u2019s mother was born at the zoo in 2013, and his grandparents Tian Tian and Mei Xiang lived at the zoo from 2000 to 2023. It was Mei Xiang and Tian Tian, along with their cub Xiao Qi Ji, who left the zoo in November. \u2014 Qing Bao, a 2-year-old female whose name means \u201cgreen\u201d and \u201ctreasure.\u201d She was born Sept. 12, 2021.", "summary": "<a href=\"https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vYXBuZXdzLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL2dpYW50LXBhbmRhcy13YXNoaW5ndG9uLXpvby1jaGluYS03NjRmODAxNmQ5OGMwMWFiNTc5YmRiYjZkY2MzZGQ2YtIBAA?oc=5\" target=\"_blank\">Smithsonian says 2 new giant pandas returning to Washington's National Zoo from China by end of year</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color=\"#6f6f6f\">The Associated Press</font>", "url": "https://apnews.com/article/giant-pandas-washington-zoo-china-764f8016d98c01ab579bdbb6dcc3dd6b", "image": "https://dims.apnews.com/dims4/default/1f5b9aa/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3382x1902+0+176/resize/1440x810!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.apnews.com%2Fc4%2F1e%2F69094cc265243956d243348db814%2F71b160bbb0204eb594474a4934fb0df6", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 12:51:08", "author": "Dino Hazell", "authors": ["Dino Hazell"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": 0.267}

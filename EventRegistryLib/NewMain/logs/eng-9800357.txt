Following the commotion, the INDIA bloc members walked out from the Rajya Sabha.\n\nSoon after the listed papers were tabled in the House in the morning, Rajya Sabha Leader of the Opposition Mallikarjun Kharge stood up to raise Ms Phogat's issue, who was disqualified for being 100 gm overweight and sought to know \"who is behind\" it. However, Mr Dhankhar did not allow him to raise the issue.\n\n\"It is an important issue. It is not an issue of a particular individual,\" Mr Kharge said. However, Mr Dhankhar did not allow the Leader of the Opposition to raise the issue and went ahead with the scheduled Zero Hour listings.\n\nAmid the din, Mr O'Brien stood up to raise his point but could not be heard because of the uproar in the House.\n\nResponding to Mr O'Brien, Mr Dhankhar cautioned the TMC member, saying \"You are shouting at the Chair. Your conduct is the ugliest in the House. I condemn your actions. Next time I will show you the door.\"\n\nAs the uproar continued, the Opposition parties staged a walkout. \"They (the Opposition) think they are all wise. They think they are the only ones whose hearts are bleeding. The entire nation is in pain because of our girl. The entire nation is feeling the pain, from the President to the Prime Minister to myself and many more. Everyone is sharing that situation, but to... politicise it is the greatest disrespect to that girl. That girl has a long way to go,\" Mr Dhankhar said.\n\nThe Leader of the House and BJP president J.P. Nadda also condemned the behaviour of the Opposition members towards the Chair. He accused the Congress party of politicising the Phogat disqualification issue.\n\n\"The Opposition does not have a solid issue to discuss,\" he said.\n\nMr Nadda also emphasised the whole country is behind Ms Phogat and even the Prime Minister has described the wrestler as a \"champion of champions\".\n\nAfter Mr Nadda spoke, Mr Dhankhar expressed his anguish over the conduct of the Opposition members and left the House, saying he was not in a position to remain in the House for the time being.\n\nBefore leaving the Rajya Sabha, Mr Dhankhar said the behaviour of the Opposition members has crossed all limits by creating anarchy in the House and disrespecting the prestige of the Chair.\n\n\"They are not challenging me. They are challenging the post of Chairman. And they are challenging the Chair, as they think that the person who is sitting on this Chair is not capable,\" he said.\n\nMr Dhankhar rued that he did not get the desired support from the House despite making all efforts.\n\n\"I am not running away from the oath. But what I have seen today, the way a member has behaved, the way the Opposition benches have conducted, I am not finding myself in a position to sit here for some time,\" the chairman said, adding he was leaving the House \"with a heavy heart\".\n\nAfter Mr Dhankhar left the House, deputy Chairman Harivansh chaired the Zero Hour proceedings. Later, Mr Dhankhar chaired the Question Hour.\n\nAfter returning to the Chair, Mr Dhankhar said when a scene is created in the House and it becomes the epicentre of disruption for the entire nation, then it is a bounden duty to sometimes take a tough decision.\n\n\"I left my seat to introspect. Having witnessed (the scene)...which I found unprecedented and indigestible,\" Mr Dhankhar said, adding he will be \"walking away from the oath\" if he does not take tough decisions.\n\nThe Chairman also informed the House that he has called a meeting of floor leaders at 1.30 pm to discuss the matter.", "source": {"uri": "deccanchronicle.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Deccan Chronicle"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vinesh_Phogat", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vinesh Phogat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajya_Sabha", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rajya Sabha"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinamool_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Trinamool Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliamentary_opposition", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Parliamentary opposition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mallikarjun_Kharge", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mallikarjun Kharge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leader_of_the_Opposition", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Leader of the Opposition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jagdeep_Dhankhar", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jagdeep Dhankhar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derek_O'Brien_(politician)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Derek O'Brien (politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice-President_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vice-President of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._P._Nadda", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "J.

After this, the opposition MPs, particularly Trinamool Congress MP Derek O'Brien, started creating a ruckus by shouting slogans against the Centre in the House.\n\nThe Rajya Sabha Chairman condemned the conduct of the Trinamool stating, \"Mr Derek O'Brien, you are shouting at the Chair.

This followed an angry exchange between the Chair and TMC leader Derek O'Brien.\n\n\"It is an important issue. It is not an issue of a particular individual,\" Kharge said soon after the listed papers were tabled in the House.\n\nHe wanted to know \"who is behind\" the disqualification.\n\nHowever, Dhankhar did not allow Kharge to raise the issue and went ahead with the scheduled Zero Hour listings.\n\nIn the meantime, Derek O'Brien stood up to raise his point, but could not be heard because of uproar in the House.\n\nTo this Dhankar cautioned the TMC member, saying \"You are shouting at the Chair. Your conduct is ugliest in the House. I condemn your actions. Next time I will show you the door\".\n\nAs uproar continued, Opposition parties staged a walkout.\n\n\"They (Opposition) think they are all wise. They think they are the only ones whose hearts are bleeding. The entire nation is in pain because of our girl. Entire nation is feeling the pain from the President to the Prime Minister to myself and many more. Everyone is sharing that situation, but to... politicize it is the greatest disrespect to that girl. That girl has a long way to go,\" Dhankhar said.\n\nLeader of the House and BJP president J P Nadda also condemned the behaviour of Opposition members towards the Chair and also accused the Congress party of politicising the Phogat disqualification issue.\n\n\"Opposition does not have a solid issue to discuss,\" he said.\n\nNadda emphasised the whole country is behind Phogat and even the Prime Minister has described the wrestler as 'champion of champions'.\n\nAfter Nadda spoke, Dhankhar expressed his anguish on the conduct of Opposition members and left the House saying he was not in a position to remain in the House for the time being.\n\nBefore leaving the Rajya Sabha, Dhankhar said the behaviour of the Opposition members has crossed all limits by creating anarchy in the House and disrespecting the prestige of the Chair.\n\n\"They are not challenging me. They are challenging the post of the Chairman. And they are challenging the Chair, as they think that the person who is sitting on this Chair is not capable,\" he said.\n\nDhankhar rued that he did not get the desired support from the House despite making all efforts.\n\n\"I am not running away from the oath. But what I have seen today, the way a member has behaved, the way the Opposition bench has conducted, I am not finding myself in a position to sit here for sometime,\" Dhankar said, adding he was leaving the House \"with a heavy heart\".\n\nAfter Dhankhar left the House, Deputy Chairman Harivansh chaired the Zero Hour proceedings.\n\nDhankhar later chaired the Question Hour.\n\nAfter returning to the Chair, he said when a scene is created in the House and it becomes the epicentre of disruption for the entire nation, then it is a bounden duty to sometimes take a tough decision.\n\n\"I left my seat to introspect. Having witnessed (the scene)... which I found was unprecedented, and indigestible,\" Dhankhar said, adding he would be \"walking away from the oath\" if he does not take tough decisions.\n\nThe Chairman also informed that he has called a meeting of floor leaders at 1:30 PM to discuss the matter.

Jagdeep Dhankhar, who is also the Vice-President of India, accused the Opposition of insulting the chair by walking out of the discussions in the House.\n\nThe Rajya Sabha got off to a stormy start as the Opposition demanded a discussion on Vinesh Phogat's disqualification. The Opposition had walked out of the House on Wednesday after Leader of Opposition in Rajya Sabha Mallikarjun Kharge was purportedly denied an opportunity to speak on the issue.\n\nWhen the Opposition raised the issue again on Thursday, Rajya Sabha Chairman Jagdeep Dhankhar said,\"...They [Opposition] think they are the only ones whose hearts are bleeding...The entire nation is in pain because of the girl.

This is unbecoming conduct.\"\n\nDhankhar then invoked the 1975-77 Emergency and said: \"We know how it starts. It starts with a challenge to the Parliamentary institutions.\" At this, most of the Opposition members staged a walkout. Dhankhar reacted to this move of the Opposition and said that by walking out, the Opposition had insulted the Chair.\n\nHowever, as the proceedings continued, Congress leaders sought to disrupt them. Dhankhar said: \"The Opposition feels I am not fit to sit on this Chair. I did not get the desired support from the House.\"\n\nHe then alleged that senior Congress leader Jairam Ramesh of laughing at him and said: \"Don't laugh at me... I know your habit... I find myself left with no option after today. The behaviour meted out to me makes me feel inadequate to sit on this Chair.

Both Parliament and social media are abuzz with support for her. Today, the Rajya Sabha witnessed a major commotion over this issue, prompting Chairman Jagdeep Dhankhar to leave the house.\n\nOpposition leader Kharge attempted to raise the Vinesh Phogat issue in the Rajya Sabha, but Chairman Dhankhar did not permit it. When TMC MP Derek O'Brien tried to voice his concerns, the Chairman issued a stern warning, indicating that Derek would be expelled if he repeated such behavior. In response, opposition parties, including Congress and TMC, staged a walkout.\n\nFollowing the walkout, the frustrated Chairman Dhankhar remarked, \"The senior-most leaders of Congress are members of this House. I have observed their recent actions, including challenges made through words, letters, and newspapers. I have seen numerous incorrect comments. These challenges are not directed at me personally but at the office of the Chairman.

Shortly after the Rajya Sabha proceedings began, uproar ensued in the House, leading to Chairman Dhankhar leaving his seat emotionally.\n\n\"I have only one option, with a sad heart... I am not going away from my oath, but what I have seen today, is the way I have been treated. Physically, I am not able to sit here,\" he said before leaving the chair. Earlier, the Leader of Opposition, Mallikarjun Kharge, raised the issue of Phogat's disqualification, asking, \"Who is behind this and how only 100 grams led to her disqualification?\" Vinesh Phogat Disqualified From Paris Olympics 2024: Congress MP Balwant Wankhede Alleges 'Conspiracy' Behind Indian Wrestler's Disqualification Over Weight Issue, Says 'Some People Might Not Have Liked Honouring Her' (Watch Video).\n\nMeanwhile, the Chairman denied the permission to raise the issue. After this, the opposition MPs, particularly Trinamool Congress MP Derek O'Brien, started creating a ruckus by shouting slogans against the Centre in the House. The Rajya Sabha Chairman condemned the conduct of the Trinamool stating, \"Mr Derek O'Brien, you are shouting at the Chair. Your conduct is the ugliest in the House. I condemn your action. Next time, I will show you the door. How dare you shout at the Chair?\"\n\nAddressing the senior Opposition leaders, Dhankhar emphasised, \"This is unbecoming conduct. I will not countenance it.\" Reflecting on the broader implications, Dhankhar added, \"We have seen the ugliest of scenes. We saw a dark phase of our democracy during the Emergency.

From the President to the Prime Minister to myself, everyone is hurt by the situation. But to monetise and politicise it is the greatest disrespect to the girl. That girl has a long way to go.\"\n\nHe praised the Haryana government's immediate recognition and support for Phogat. He said, \"The state of Haryana immediately announced they will give her all commendations, all financial reliefs given to a medal winner.\" Later, the Leader of the House, J.P. Nadda, condemned the Opposition's behaviour, emphasising national unity. \"The people, who are working in the Parliamentary system for a long time, this behaviour is questionable and a matter of concern,\" he said.\n\nThe Union Minister reiterated the nation's support for Phogat, quoting Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who called her a \"champion of champions\". He slammed the politicisation of the issue, stating, \"The entire nation is standing with Vinesh.

In protest, the Opposition walked out. Within minutes, Mr. Dhankhar, accusing the Opposition of unruly conduct and of \"repeatedly\" challenging the Chair, also abruptly left the House.\n\nThe trouble started within a few minutes after the House sat for the day. Leader of the Opposition and Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge stood up to raise Ms. Phogat's disqualification and demanded to know \"who is behind it\". Four members from the Trinamool Congress, the Congress, the AAP and the CPI had also given a notice under Rule 267, requiring suspension of the day's business to discuss the \"circumstances surrounding the disqualification of Vinesh Phogat\". There was a clamour in the Opposition benches to speak on the issue.\n\nTrinamool MP pulled up\n\nAngered by the Opposition's conduct, especially Trinamool MP Derek O'Brien, he said, \"You are shouting at the Chair. Your conduct is the ugliest in the House. I condemn your actions. Next time I will show you the door.\" At this point, the Opposition walked out.\n\nMr. Dhankhar said the Chair had been repeatedly challenged on various platforms. \"These challenges are not directed at me; they are aimed at the Chair, implying that the person occupying it is unworthy. I have not received the support from the House that I ought to have. Despite my best efforts, I am disheartened... I have only one alternative. With a heavy heart, I find myself incapable of continuing to sit here for some time,\" Mr. Dhankhar said before leaving the House. He also accused the Opposition of turning the House into a \"centre of chaos\", and said this is an \"affront to Indian democracy.\"\n\nLeader of the House and BJP president J.P. Nadda also slammed the Opposition parties, and said they did not have any solid issue and that was why they were running away from debate.\n\nAt 1.30 p.m., a group of Opposition leaders met Mr. Dhankhar in his chamber. According to sources, the Opposition told the Chairman that the House should be run by \"rules and precedents\". At least one of the members who attended the meeting said that when the rules were not being followed, \"what else can the Opposition do other than protest?\". \"On July 29, five BJP MPs submitted a notice to discuss the tragedy of the flooding and deaths in an IAS coaching centre in Delhi. That discussion was allowed. But today, when a similar number of Opposition MPs wanted to raise an issue, we were disallowed,\" one of the members who attended the meeting said.\n\nThe relationship between the Opposition and the Chairman has been tense for long, but has deteriorated further in the last few days. According to sources, 14 Opposition MPs signed a memorandum addressed to Mr. Dhankhar on August 5, criticising his decision to deny their demand for a debate on the functioning of the Home Ministry. In their letter, they called Mr. Dhankhar's decision \"completely unilateral and unprecedented.\"\n\nMr. Dhankhar briefly returned to the Chair in the post-lunch session.\n\nRead Comments", "source": {"uri": "thehindu.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hindu"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vinesh_Phogat", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vinesh Phogat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Member of parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_National_Congress", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Indian National Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinamool_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Trinamool Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jagdeep_Dhankhar", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jagdeep Dhankhar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chairperson", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chairperson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mallikarjun_Kharge", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mallikarjun Kharge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_Party_of_India", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Communist Party of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajya_Sabha", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rajya Sabha"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aam_Aadmi_Party", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aam Aadmi Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leader_of_the_Opposition", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Leader of the Opposition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derek_O'Brien_(politician)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Derek O'Brien (politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharatiya_Janata_Party", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bharatiya Janata Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._P._Nadda", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "J.

When Leader of Opposition in Rajya Sabha and Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge raised the issue and wanted to know \"who's behind it,\" Chairman Jagdeep Dhankhar did not permit the discussion.\n\nPhogat, who announced her retirement from wrestling Thursday, had made history as the first Indian female wrestler to reach the 50kg Olympic final by winning three matches on Tuesday. The 29-year-old, typically competing in the 53kg category, had moved to the 50kg weight class for the Paris Olympics. Phogat lodged a protest at the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS), requesting a joint-silver medal. The matter is expected to be heard later in the day.\n\nSoon after, Trinamool Congress MP Derek O'Brien attempted to raise issues but was denied by the Chair. Dhankhar warned O'Brien, saying, \"You are shouting at the Chair. Your conduct is the ugliest in the House. I condemn your actions. Next time, I will show you the door.\" As the uproar grew, opposition leaders walked out in protest.\n\nDhankhar commented that the opposition believes they are the \"only ones whose hearts are bleeding\" after Phogat's unexpected Olympic exit. He said, \"The entire nation is in pain... But to politicize it is the greatest disrespect to her [Phogat].\" Later, Dhankhar walked out, expressing that he did not receive \"support\" from the House.\n\nEarlier on Tuesday, INDIA bloc members walked out of the Lok Sabha, expressing dissatisfaction with Union Sports Minister Mansukh Mandaviya's statement on Phogat. Some opposition leaders also criticized Mandaviya for detailing the financial assistance provided for her Olympic preparations. To recall, on Wednesday in the Lok Sabha, Mandaviya said that the government had offered all necessary assistance to Phogat, including personal staff.

When Kharge and Congress members asked why the Chair was not allowing him to speak, Dhankhar charged the Congress chief of questioning him at the drop of a hat.\n\nAs Dhankhar insisted the LoP and Congress MPs to take recourse to rules and declined to accept their demand to intervene when the discussion was on, the opposition members walked out of the House. Dhankhar criticised the conduct of opposition members, including Kharge, accusing them of \"questioning\" the Chair and \"walking out on their constitutional duty\".\n\nDuring the discussion on Appropriation (No 2) Bill 2024 and J&K Appropriation (No 3) Bill, 2024, the opposition members kept sloganeering demanding justice for Phogat but Dhankhar said nothing would go on record.\n\nAfter they walked out, Dhankhar said their act was \"indecorous, undignified, challenging the authority of Chair\". He added, \"An LoP, an important fulcrum in Parliamentary democracy... so painful. I have no words to take exception to such kind of conduct.\" He said the kind of sloganeering seen in the House is not resorted to even in the worst of the situation.\n\nDhankhar said that he had sent a blank paper to the LoP to mention the subject on which he wanted to speak. The chairman read out the note which mentioned the LoP's request to raise an emergent issue impacting countrymen and a short intervention time. \"Nothing is spelt out.

An enraged Dhankhar took Jaya Bachchan head on after the Samajwadi Party MP objected to the \"tone\" of Rajya Sabha chairman against opposition members.The opposition members were seeking an apology from BJP MP Ghanshyam Tiwari over his 'parivarvaad' taunt against Congress chief Mallikarjun Kharge made on August 1.\n\n\"I Jaya Amitabh Bachchan want to say, I am an artist. I understand body language and expressions. Forgive me but your tone is not acceptable. We are colleagues, Sir. You may be sitting in the Chair, and I remember when I went to school ... ,\" the SP MP said trigerring a storm.\n\nA visibly angry Dhankhar interrupted Jaya's speech and said: \"Enough of it ... You may be anybody, you may be a celebrity, but you have to understand the decorum ... .\"\n\n\"Jayaji, you have earned a great reputation. (But) you know the actor is subject to the director... you have not seen what I have seen from here (the Chair). Every day... I don't want to repeat, I don't want a schooling. I am a person who has gone out of the way ... and you say 'my tone'?\" \"No... no... enough of this. No. You can't have it. No...\" Dhnakhar shouted firmly.\n\nWhen an Opposition party member raised objection to how Dhankhar could call Bachchan a celebrity when she was a senior Member of Parliament, the chairman retorted: \"(Does) a senior member of Parliament has a licence to run down the reputation of the Chair ... to question the tone and tenor?\" Dhankhar then went on to say that he cannot be a party to the House being converted into an \"epicentre of disturbance\".\n\n'NDA 's censure motion a badge of honour '\n\nWhile the opposition accused Dhankhar of being partisan and walked out of the House led by former Congress chief Sonia Gandhi, ruling NDA sought a resolution condemning the \"charges\" of Jaya Bachchan against Jagdeep Dhankhar.\n\n\"Today's incident is highly condemnable. I urge the House to pass a resolution condemning this. The opposition's behaviour has been extremely unparliamentary, undisciplined, and disrespectful. The opposition has become issue-less in terms of discussion, and undignified behaviour has become their habit,\" J P Nadda said.\n\nHowever, deputy leader of opposition in Rajya Sabha Pramod Tiwari, madde light of the NDA move and said censure motion against the opposition is a badge of honour. \"The NDA has brought a censure motion against the opposition. It is a badge of honour for us. We will keep fighting for the poor and common people of this country. This censure motion is an award for the entire opposition. We (opposition) will fight this dictatorship and will struggle against the NDA,\" Pramod Tiwari said.\n\nTiwari alleged that Jagdeep Dhankhar has not taken any action against Gansham Tiwari even after the opposition had given a complaint in writing and added the opposition's voice is being muzzled inside the House.\n\n\"There are parliamentarians who have an experience of 50 years. However, they are not able to talk and raise the people's issues as the mic is switched off consistently by the chairman. Everyone has seen what is being done to Jaya Bachchan. The Chairman does not allow her to speak. She is a veteran and is in Rajya Sabha for the 4 or 5th time,\" Tiwari said.\n\nCongress MP Ajay Maken said \"Opposition parties feel the Chairman's approach is partisan. Rajya Sabha is a House that sets parameters for other legislatures. In that House, the Chairman should not be seen partisan. The Congress alone does not feel that way, all opposition parties feel his behaviour is partial towards one side.\"\n\n'We are not school children ... '\n\nJaya Bachchan, meanwhile, questioned why Kharge was not allowed to speak by the chairman.\n\n\"We are not school children, some of us are senior citizens. I was upset with the tone and specially when Leader of Opposition stood up to speak he had switched off the mic. How can you do this? This is against the tradition. You have to allow the leader,\" Jaya told reporters.\n\nShe also alleged that members sitting in the Treasury benches use unparliamentary words. \"'You are a nuisance', 'Budhiheen' (stupid), all these words are also spoken by Treasury benches,\" she alleged.\n\n'Opposition considering resolution to remove Dhankhar'\n\nThe opposition is considering submitting a notice for moving a resolution to remove the Vice-President from his office, news agency PTI said quoting sources. The timing of the notice is to be discussed and decided and though the resolution may not go through it would be a statement to highlight the Chair's \"blatantly and consistently partisan\" approach.\n\nAccording to Article 67(b) of the Constitution, \"Vice-President may be removed from his office by a resolution of the Council of States (Rajya Sabha) passed by a majority of all the then members of the Council and agreed to by the House of the People; but no resolution for the purpose of this clause shall be moved unless at least fourteen days' notice has been given of the intention to move the resolution.\"\n\nOpposition sources said 87 members have signed on the proposal to initiate action against Dhankhar.\n\nA source said around two days ago, Leader of House J P Nadda was informally informed that the opposition is considering submitting a motion for removing Dhankhar.\n\nDhankhar vs Kharge over Vinesh Phogat\n\nOn Wednesday, Dhankhar had accused opposition of \"challenging\" the authority of the chair. This was after Kharge was denied permission to speak on the issue of wrestler Vinesh Phogat, who was disqualified from the Paris Olympics after being found overweight ahead of her 50kg final match.\n\nDuring the discussion on Appropriation (No 2) Bill 2024 and Jammu and Kashmir Appropriation (No 3) Bill, 2024, the opposition members kept sloganeering demanding justice for Phogat but Dhankhar said nothing would go on record.\n\nKharge said he wants to speak with the chair's permission on an issue to which Dhankhar responded that he had declined the permission and the debate would continue.\n\nDhankhar said that LoP wanted the chair to interrupt the debate without taking recourse to any rule and shared his message seeking permission to take the floor without spelling out the issue.\n\nAfter the members walked out, Dhankhar said their act was \"indecorous, undignified, challenging the authority of chair\".\n\n\"An LoP, an important fulcrum in Parliamentary democracy ... so painful. I have no words to take exception to such kind of conduct,\" Dhankhar said.\n\nWar of words between Dhankhar and Kharge\n\nIn July, during the debate on motion of thanks on the President's address, a war of words erupted between Dhankhar and Kharge after the former sarcastically told Congress member Jairam Ramesh to take the latter's post of LoP. Kharge, who is a Dalit, said Dhankhar was bringing in the \"Varna\" (caste) system by calling Ramesh \"intelligent and gifted\", and by implication labelling him \"dull\". An agitated Dhankhar then rapped Kharge for \"twisting\" his remarks.\n\n(With inputs from agencies)\n\nThe TOI News Desk comprises a dedicated and tireless team of journalists who operate around the clock to deliver the most current and comprehensive news and updates to the readers of The Times of India worldwide.

The entire nation is feeling the pain, right from the President to the PM to myself and many more, everyone is sharing the situation. But to politicise it is the greatest disrespect to that girl,\" Dhankhar said.\n\nLeader of the House J P Nadda also condemned the behaviour of Opposition members towards the Chair and accused the Congress of politicising the Phogat issue. \"Opposition does not have a solid issue to discuss,\" he said and emphasised that the whole country is behind Phogat and even PM Narendra Modi has described her as \"champion of champions\".\n\nAfter the BJP chief ended his address, Dhankhar expressed his anguish on the conduct of Opposition members, left his chair and walked to his chamber, saying that he was not in a position to remain in the House for the time being.\n\n\"...

Phogat was disqualified on Wednesday for being 100 grams overweight, just hours before her historic 50-kg freestyle gold medal match against the USA's Sarah Ann Hildebrandt.\n\nThe issue arose when Leader of Opposition and Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge attempted to address the matter in the House. However, Rajya Sabha Chairman Jagdeep Dhankhar did not permit the discussion, prompting Kharge and other Opposition leaders to express their frustration.\n\nTrinamool Congress MP Derek O'Brien also tried to raise issues but was reprimanded by Chairman Dhankhar for his conduct. \"You are shouting at the Chair. Your conduct is ugliest in the House. I condemn your actions. Next time I will show you the door,\" Dhankhar warned.

The Congress alone does not feel that way, all opposition parties feel his behaviour is partial towards one side,\" Congress leader Ajay Maken said at a press conference.\n\nThe opposition is not getting the importance it deserves in the Upper House, he said.\n\n\"If the opposition's voice does not resonate in Rajya Sabha, where else will it resonate,\" he asked.\n\nCongress's deputy leader in Rajya Sabha Pramod Tiwari claimed that Leader of Opposition Mallikarjun Kharge is not allowed to speak, he is frequently interrupted and his microphones are often shut.\n\n\"It is not about one party. Two-three days ago Ghanshyam Tiwari used such words for the Leader of Opposition which were not right and were insulting and unacceptable. We had given notice for privilege motion. We wanted to know the ruling on it, the ruling has not come, it has to be in writing,\" he said.\n\nEarlier, the opposition walked out of the House, with Congress parliamentary party Sonia Gandhi and other senior leaders in tow.\n\nThe walkout came after Samajwadi Party MP Jaya Bachchan and Dhankhar were engaged in a heated exchange in the Upper House.\n\n\"Main kalakar hoon, body language samajhti hoon, expression samajhti hoon... par sir, mujhe maaf kariyega magar apka tone jo hai is not acceptable. We are colleagues sir, you may be sitting on the chair,\" she said.\n\nDhankhar hit back, saying, \"Jaya ji, you've earned a great reputation. You know, an actor is subject to director. You've not seen what I see from here. I don't want schooling. I am a person who has gone out of the way, and you say my tone... enough of it.\"\n\nNadda slammed the opposition and demanded they should apologise to Dhankhar.\n\nAfter the walkout, Bachchan told reporters that she objected to the tone used by the Chair.\n\n\"We are not school children. I was upset with the tone and especially when the LoP stood up to speak, his mic was switched off. How can you do this? If he is not going to be heard in the House, then what are we doing? On top of that, every time (they are) using words which are unparliamentary,\" she said.", "source": {"uri": "latestly.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "LatestLY"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice-President_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vice-President of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajya_Sabha", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rajya Sabha"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_party", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Political party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_National_Congress", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Indian National Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jagdeep_Dhankhar", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jagdeep Dhankhar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Constitution of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lok_Sabha", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lok Sabha"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_house", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Upper house"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leader_of_the_Opposition", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Leader of the Opposition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jammu_and_Kashmir_(union_territory)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jammu and Kashmir (union territory)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chairperson", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chairperson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliamentary_opposition", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Parliamentary opposition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_Election_Commissioner_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief Election Commissioner of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Member of parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghanshyam_Tiwari", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ghanshyam Tiwari"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaya_Bachchan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jaya Bachchan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pramod_Tiwari", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pramod Tiwari"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samajwadi_Party", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Samajwadi Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mallikarjun_Kharge", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mallikarjun Kharge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Press_Trust_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Press Trust of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonia_Gandhi", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sonia Gandhi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajay_Maken", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ajay Maken"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Holidays", "label": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Holidays", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://st1.latestly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/default-img-01.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9800357", "eventUri": "eng-9800357", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-09", "textStart": 11, "textEnd": 16}], "sentiment": 0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 169, "relevance": 1}

Uneasy relations between Rajya Sabha chairman Jagdeep Dhankhar and opposition parties on Friday erupted in a heated exchange between the chair and Samajwadi Party MP Jaya Bachchan, leading to a walkout by opposition parties and Dhankhar calling it \"disrespect to democracy and constitution\".\n\nNew Delhi, Aug 9 (PTI) Uneasy relations between Rajya Sabha chairman Jagdeep Dhankhar and opposition parties on Friday erupted in a heated exchange between the chair and Samajwadi Party MP Jaya Bachchan, leading to a walkout by opposition parties and Dhankhar calling it \"disrespect to democracy and constitution\".\n\nThe cine star objected to the \"tone\" in which Dhankhar addressed her as well as switching off the mike of Leader of the Opposition Mallikarjun Kharge, triggering a heated exchange. The Chairman, who is also the Vice President of India, said he can't be \"schooled\" and that Bachchan \"may be anybody... a celebrity\" but she has to observe decorum.\n\nAlso Read | Jansanman Yatra: NCP Leader Ajit Pawar Apologies to Onion Farmers, Says Ban on Exports Dealt a Big Blow.\n\nAs Dhankhar refused to allow her or any one from the opposition to speak, INDIA bloc parties staged a walkout, which was slammed both by the chair and the treasury benches.\n\nLeader of the House and Union Minister J P Nadda called the opposition behaviour \"highly indecent and irresponsible\".\n\nAlso Read | Parliament Monsoon Session 2024 Concludes: Second Session of 18th Lok Sabha Concludes; 12 Government Bills Introduced, 4 Passed, Check List Here.\n\nTrouble broke when the Congress MPs sought an apology from BJP member Ghanshyam Tiwari for comments he had made on Kharge last week.\n\nDhankhar insisted that the matter on an issue spoken in the House had been resolved in his chamber. He went on to state that Tiwari had instead praised the Leader of the Opposition to the position of god. But he did not accede to opposition MPs request for either Tiwari repeating his words or Kharge being allowed to speak on the issue.\n\nThis lead to protests from opposition benches with DMK's Tiruchi Siva, saying the tone of the statement makes all the difference.\n\nBachchan indicated that she too wanted to speak on the issue and Dhankhar called her by her full registered name, Jaya Amitabh Bachchan.\n\n\"Main kalakar hoon, body language samajhti hoon, expression samajhti hoon... par sir, mujhe maaf kariega magar apka tone jo hai is not acceptable. (I am an actor. I understand body language and expression. Please forgive me but your tone is unacceptable). We are colleagues sir, you may be sitting on the chair,\" said Bachchan.\n\nDhankhar shot back saying he does not want to be schooled, and said, \"Enough of it\".\n\n\"Jaya ji, you've earned a great reputation. You know, an actor is subject to the director. You've not seen what I see from here... I don't want schooling. I am a person who has gone out of the way, and you say my tone...,\" responded Dhankhar.\n\nAs opposition MPs objected, he said, \"enough of it... no.\"\n\n\"You may be anybody, you may be a celebrity, (but) you have to understand the decorum. Nothing doing,\" he told Bachchan.\n\nThe comments infuriated the opposition MPs who began shouting slogans.\n\nTo this Dhankar said, \"never carry this impression that only you build reputations. We come here to build reputations. We live up to reputations.\"\n\nAs TMC's Sushmita Dev objected to the remarks, saying Bachchan was a MP and not a celebrity in the house, Dhankhar shot back saying, \"a senior member of the Parliament has no licence to run down the reputation of the chair, to question tone and tenor.\"\n\n\"Yes I had to be in reaction mode to take care of the situation. I have the highest respect but to make it a habit... my tone, my language, my temper. I don't go by script of others. I have my own script. I am not operated by anyone else,\" he said, ordering nothing that opposition MPs speak will go on record.\n\n\"Nothing will happen Kharge ji,\" he said.\n\nAs opposition MPs said they are staging a walkout in protest, Dhankhar remarked, \"I know you are wanting to destabilise the entire nation. You are out to create chaos in the House.\"\n\n\"I shall not be party to this House being converted as epicentre of disturbance,\" he told Kharge. \"You are determined to have your way at the cost of Constitution. It is lack of decorum, disrespect to democracy, disrespect to constitution.\"\n\nStriking down the opposition's demand of apology by Tiwari, Dhankhar said that the BJP member had actually praised Kharge in Sanskrit and \"people don't apologise when they praise\" and claimed the matter had already been amicably sorted out between the two in his presence in his chamber.\n\nHowever, Kharge insisted Dhankhar to tell \"the same thing you have explained to me in the chamber\", saying, \"it is better that you do it in the House\".\n\nThe chairman defended Tiwari, saying,\"Even after that meeting, I myself read every word of that, and then I found that there was nothing objectionable. I had also pleaded with the Leader of the Opposition that if he finds something objectionable, he may indicate.\"\n\nThe Rajya Sabha chairman complimented Tiwari for \"using Parliamentary language, respecting Leader of the Opposition (Kharge) in the highest of traditions and expressing to me that he is prepared to apologise if he has transgressed in any manner\".\n\nDhankhar further said he has read Tiwari's speech carefully, and not only was there no transgression by the BJP MP, he embellished the well-deserved reputation of Kharge.\n\n\"If I praise Leader of the House, if I express gratitude to the senior leadership, Ghanshyam Tiwari has praised Kharge, would any member of this House including (Congress leader) Pramod Tiwari, point out a single word from the address of Ghanshyam Tiwari to which exception can be taken,\" Dhankhar asked.\n\nCongress' Pramod Tiwari had said the tone and the words used by BJP MP Ghanshyam Tiwari were \"undoubtedly\" against the decorum of a public office.\n\nYet, Dhankhar defended Tiwari, saying he was speaking in Sanskrit, which is a language that requires some kind of orientation.\n\nDMK's Tiruchi Siva said whenever the Leader of Opposition gets up to speak, the Chairman should give him the floor.\n\nSoon after, as Dhankhar allowed actor-politician \"Jaya Amitabh Bachchan\" an opportunity to speak as the \"last speaker\" on the issue, the two were involved in a face-off as Bachchan raised objection to his \"tone\"and the former asserting that even a celebrity like her needs to follow decorum.\n\nOpposition parties also staged a walkout following the exchanges between Dhankhar and Bachchan.\n\nReferring to the Opposition party members, Dhankhar said: \"... You are walking away from your obligations, you are walking away from your duty, they don't want to participate, they want to create only chaos, I am surprised, the nation is a priority, the nation is always first\".\n\nDhankhar said, \"you (Kharge) are determined to have your way at the cost of the Constitution, you are doing it, it is lack of decorum, disrespect to democracy, disrespect to Constitution, you are walking away from your obligations, you are walking away from your duty, they don't want to participate, they know only how to create chaos, I am surprised, absolutely, the nation is a priority, the nation is always first...\"\n\nAmid sloganeering in the House, Dhankhar said, \"...what a sad day, August 9, 1942, call of Mahatma Gandhi, Quit India, and this House paid tribute to the martyrs ... they are quitting Parliament, they are quitting their duty, they are quitting their oath to Constitution...\"\n\nDhankhar said at a time when the country is rapidly progressing, some people, taking note of happenings in the neighbouring country, are engaging in inflammatory, condemnable narratives and the ideology to which they subscribe.\n\n\"It has become a habit, Leader of the House, with some of them, that a segment will speak out against the nation,\" the Rajya Sabha chairman said, adding that it will set afloat a narrative which tarnishes institutions, demeans democratic culture, weakens progress.\n\nAgriculture Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan said the act of the opposition is condemnable and there is no such example also. He has been a member of parliament as well as MLA several times but has never seen such an incident.\n\nSupporting the Chairman, former prime minister H D Deve Gowda said: \"You tried to solve the problem between Ghanshayam Tiwadi and the leader of the opposition. You have called both of them to their chamber and resolved the matter.\"", "source": {"uri": "latestly.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "LatestLY"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jagdeep_Dhankhar", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jagdeep Dhankhar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Member of parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaya_Bachchan", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jaya Bachchan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pramod_Tiwari", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pramod Tiwari"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samajwadi_Party", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Samajwadi Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mallikarjun_Kharge", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mallikarjun Kharge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajya_Sabha", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rajya Sabha"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leader_of_the_Opposition", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Leader of the Opposition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Constitution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghanshyam_Tiwari", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ghanshyam Tiwari"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Constitution of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharatiya_Janata_Party", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bharatiya Janata Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._P._Nadda", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "J.

The Chairman, who is also the Vice President of India, said he can't be \"schooled\" and that Bachchan \"may be anybody... a celebrity\" but she has to observe decorum.\n\nAs Dhankhar refused to allow her or any one from the opposition to speak, INDIA bloc parties staged a walkout, which was slammed both by the chair and the treasury benches.\n\nLeader of the House and Union Minister J P Nadda called the opposition behaviour \"highly indecent and irresponsible\".\n\nTrouble broke when the Congress MPs sought an apology from BJP member Ghanshyam Tiwari for comments he had made on Kharge last week.\n\nDhankhar insisted that the matter on an issue spoken in the House had been resolved in his chamber. He went on to state that Tiwari had instead praised the Leader of the Opposition to the position of god. But he did not accede to opposition MPs request for either Tiwari repeating his words or Kharge being allowed to speak on the issue.\n\nThis lead to protests from opposition benches with DMK's Tiruchi Siva, saying the tone of the statement makes all the difference.\n\nBachchan indicated that she too wanted to speak on the issue and Dhankhar called her by her full registered name, Jaya Amitabh Bachchan.\n\n\"Main kalakar hoon, body language samajhti hoon, expression samajhti hoon... par sir, mujhe maaf kariega magar apka tone jo hai is not acceptable. (I am an actor. I understand body language and expression. Please forgive me but your tone is unacceptable). We are colleagues sir, you may be sitting on the chair,\" said Bachchan.\n\nDhankhar shot back saying he does not want to be schooled, and said, \"Enough of it\".\n\n\"Jaya ji, you've earned a great reputation. You know, an actor is subject to the director. You've not seen what I see from here... I don't want schooling. I am a person who has gone out of the way, and you say my tone...,\" responded Dhankhar.\n\nAs opposition MPs objected, he said, \"enough of it... no.\" \"You may be anybody, you may be a celebrity, (but) you have to understand the decorum. Nothing doing,\" he told Bachchan.\n\nThe comments infuriated the opposition MPs who began shouting slogans.\n\nTo this Dhankar said, \"never carry this impression that only you build reputations. We come here to build reputations. We live up to reputations.\" As TMC's Sushmita Dev objected to the remarks, saying Bachchan was a MP and not a celebrity in the house, Dhankhar shot back saying, \"a senior member of the Parliament has no licence to run down the reputation of the chair, to question tone and tenor.\" \"Yes I had to be in reaction mode to take care of the situation. I have the highest respect but to make it a habit... my tone, my language, my temper. I don't go by script of others. I have my own script. I am not operated by anyone else,\" he said, ordering nothing that opposition MPs speak will go on record.\n\n\"Nothing will happen Kharge ji,\" he said.\n\nAs opposition MPs said they are staging a walkout in protest, Dhankhar remarked, \"I know you are wanting to destabilise the entire nation. You are out to create chaos in the House.\" \"I shall not be party to this House being converted as epicentre of disturbance,\" he told Kharge. \"You are determined to have your way at the cost of Constitution. It is lack of decorum, disrespect to democracy, disrespect to constitution.\" Striking down the opposition's demand of apology by Tiwari, Dhankhar said that the BJP member had actually praised Kharge in Sanskrit and \"people don't apologise when they praise\" and claimed the matter had already been amicably sorted out between the two in his presence in his chamber.\n\nHowever, Kharge insisted Dhankhar to tell \"the same thing you have explained to me in the chamber\", saying, \"it is better that you do it in the House\".\n\nThe chairman defended Tiwari, saying,\"Even after that meeting, I myself read every word of that, and then I found that there was nothing objectionable. I had also pleaded with the Leader of the Opposition that if he finds something objectionable, he may indicate.\" The Rajya Sabha chairman complimented Tiwari for \"using Parliamentary language, respecting Leader of the Opposition (Kharge) in the highest of traditions and expressing to me that he is prepared to apologise if he has transgressed in any manner\".\n\nDhankhar further said he has read Tiwari's speech carefully, and not only was there no transgression by the BJP MP, he embellished the well-deserved reputation of Kharge.\n\n\"If I praise Leader of the House, if I express gratitude to the senior leadership, Ghanshyam Tiwari has praised Kharge, would any member of this House including (Congress leader) Pramod Tiwari, point out a single word from the address of Ghanshyam Tiwari to which exception can be taken,\" Dhankhar asked.\n\nCongress' Pramod Tiwari had said the tone and the words used by BJP MP Ghanshyam Tiwari were \"undoubtedly\" against the decorum of a public office.\n\nYet, Dhankhar defended Tiwari, saying he was speaking in Sanskrit, which is a language that requires some kind of orientation.\n\nDMK's Tiruchi Siva said whenever the Leader of Opposition gets up to speak, the Chairman should give him the floor.\n\nSoon after, as Dhankhar allowed actor-politician \"Jaya Amitabh Bachchan\" an opportunity to speak as the \"last speaker\" on the issue, the two were involved in a face-off as Bachchan raised objection to his \"tone\"and the former asserting that even a celebrity like her needs to follow decorum.\n\nOpposition parties also staged a walkout following the exchanges between Dhankhar and Bachchan.\n\nReferring to the Opposition party members, Dhankhar said: \"... You are walking away from your obligations, you are walking away from your duty, they don't want to participate, they want to create only chaos, I am surprised, the nation is a priority, the nation is always first\".\n\nDhankhar said, \"you (Kharge) are determined to have your way at the cost of the Constitution, you are doing it, it is lack of decorum, disrespect to democracy, disrespect to Constitution, you are walking away from your obligations, you are walking away from your duty, they don't want to participate, they know only how to create chaos, I am surprised, absolutely, the nation is a priority, the nation is always first...\" Amid sloganeering in the House, Dhankhar said, \"...what a sad day, August 9, 1942, call of Mahatma Gandhi, Quit India, and this House paid tribute to the martyrs ... they are quitting Parliament, they are quitting their duty, they are quitting their oath to Constitution...\" Dhankhar said at a time when the country is rapidly progressing, some people, taking note of happenings in the neighbouring country, are engaging in inflammatory, condemnable narratives and the ideology to which they subscribe.\n\n\"It has become a habit, Leader of the House, with some of them, that a segment will speak out against the nation,\" the Rajya Sabha chairman said, adding that it will set afloat a narrative which tarnishes institutions, demeans democratic culture, weakens progress.\n\nAgriculture Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan said the act of the opposition is condemnable and there is no such example also. He has been a member of parliament as well as MLA several times but has never seen such an incident.\n\nSupporting the Chairman, former prime minister H D Deve Gowda said: \"You tried to solve the problem between Ghanshayam Tiwadi and the leader of the opposition. You have called both of them to their chamber and resolved the matter.\" PTI RSN KRH RKL ANZ CS HVA", "source": {"uri": "newsdrum.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "NewsDrum"}, "authors": [{"uri": "newsdrum_desk@newsdrum.in", "name": "NewsDrum Desk", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Member of parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaya_Bachchan", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jaya Bachchan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pramod_Tiwari", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pramod Tiwari"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mallikarjun_Kharge", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mallikarjun Kharge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leader_of_the_Opposition", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Leader of the Opposition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghanshyam_Tiwari", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ghanshyam Tiwari"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_National_Congress", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Indian National Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharatiya_Janata_Party", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bharatiya Janata Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Constitution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._P._Nadda", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "J.

The resolution must be passed by 50 per cent of the present members, plus one member, of those present in the House on that day. If the resolution gets passed, it has to go to the Lok Sabha to be passed by a simple majority, for it to get accepted,\" explained a senior RS MP. This procedure follows from Articles 67 (b), 92 and 100 of the Constitution.\n\nGoing by this process, there is every possibility of the resolution to be defeated in the House, yet the opposition members are contemplating moving on it, \"to prove the point that the Chair has deviated from his role as a neutral umpire and hence disrespected the chair,\" a senior opposition party MP elaborated.\n\nThe issue of uneasy relations building up between Dhankhar and the opposition parties aggravated on Thursday, as the RS chairman left the House after heated clashes with TMC member Derek O'Brien and some of the other Opposition members who were not permitted to raise the issue of disqualification of Vinesh Phogat from the Paris Olympics.\n\nTrouble started in the morning session when Leader of the Opposition Mallikarjun Kharge sought to raise Phogat's disqualification, but Dhankhar did not allow it. This followed an angry exchange between the Chair and TMC leader of the House. Later the chairman called a meeting of floor leaders at in his chamber to discuss the matter. Before leaving the Rajya Sabha, Dhankhar said the behaviour of the Opposition members has crossed all limits by creating anarchy in the House and disrespecting the prestige of the Chair.", "source": {"uri": "timesofindia.indiatimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Times of India"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mohua_chatterjee@timesofindia.indiatimes.com", "name": "Mohua Chatterjee", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliamentary_opposition", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Parliamentary opposition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajya_Sabha", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rajya Sabha"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_house", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Upper house"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jagdeep_Dhankhar", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jagdeep Dhankhar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chairperson", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chairperson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice-President_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vice-President of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Member of parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majority", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Majority"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lok_Sabha", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lok Sabha"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_party", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Political party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinamool_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Trinamool Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vinesh_Phogat", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vinesh Phogat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derek_O'Brien_(politician)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Derek O'Brien (politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mallikarjun_Kharge", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mallikarjun Kharge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leader_of_the_Opposition", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Leader of the Opposition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Constitution"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Planning", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Planning", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Parties", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Parties", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Holidays", "label": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Holidays", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 63}], "image": "https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112382943,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-757697,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9800357", "eventUri": "eng-9800357", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2313725490196079, "wgt": 163, "relevance": 1}

On Thursday, the Chairman even left the House in a huff amid the Opposition's protests over the disqualification of wrestler Vinesh Phogat. Opposition sources said they had been discussing the idea of giving notice for the removal of the Chairman for some days and that all the INDIA parties were on board.\n\nOn Friday, there was a fresh face-off. The Opposition benches were up in arms over BJP MP Ghanshyam Tiwari's \"objectionable\" remarks about Leader of the Opposition Mallikarjun Kharge on July 31. Amid the commotion, Samajwadi Party MP Jaya Bachchan told the Chairman that his \"tone\" was unacceptable. Dhankhar hit back, saying \"Jaya ji you have earned a great reputation ... You are talking about my tone? Enough of it. You may be anybody. You have to understand the decorum. You can be a celebrity but accept decorum.\" An angry Opposition then walked out of the Upper House led by Sonia Gandhi.\n\nAt least one senior leader told The Indian Express that \"there is now no looking back on the plan\". Opposition leaders know that the INDIA parties do not have the numbers to force Dhankhar's ouster and that the notice will be a way of making a \"political statement\".\n\n\"We are discussing the technical aspects as the session has ended and the resolution can be moved only when at least 14 days' notice has been given of the intention of moving,\" said one leader. According to Article 67(b) of the Constitution, the \"Vice-President may be removed from his office by a resolution of the Council of States passed by a majority of all the then members of the Council and agreed to by the House of the People; but no resolution for the purpose of this clause shall be moved unless at least fourteen days' notice has been given of the intention to move the resolution\".\n\nAnother MP said, \"There are three main issues. We want to highlight the Chair's blatantly and consistently partisan approach. We believe the Leader of the Opposition must be allowed to intervene at any point and his microphone should not be switched off. The House should be run by Rules and conventions. And personal remarks against any member are unacceptable and the Chair must lead by example.\"\n\nAddressing a press conference soon after the face-off on Friday, Congress MPs Ajay Maken and Pramod Tiwari accused Dhankhar of being partisan. \"Opposition parties feel that the Chairman's approach is partisan. Rajya Sabha is a House that sets parameters for other legislatures. In that House, the Chairman should not be seen as partisan. The Congress alone does not feel that way, all Opposition parties feel his behaviour is partial towards one side,\" Maken said.\n\nTiwari said Kharge was not allowed to speak and that he is frequently interrupted and his microphones are often shut. \"It is not about one party. Two to three days ago, Ghanshyam Tiwari used such words for the Leader of the Opposition that were not right and were insulting and unacceptable. We had given notice for a privilege motion. We wanted to know the ruling on it, the ruling has not come, it has to be in writing,\" he said.\n\n\"It is not about Jaya Bachchan or any one MP. It is about the Opposition and our rights,\" one senior Opposition leader told The Indian Express.\n\nWhile there is no precedence of a no-confidence or impeachment resolution being moved against the Rajya Sabha Chairman, four years ago the Opposition submitted a no-confidence resolution against Rajya Sabha Deputy Chairman Harivansh. The parties that backed that resolution included the Congress, TMC, DMK, CPI(M), CPI, RJD, AAP, TRS, SP, and Kerala Congress (M). But then Chairman Venkaiah Naidu rejected the notice, saying it needed a 14-day notice and that the resolution was not in the \"proper format\".", "source": {"uri": "indianexpress.com", "dataType":

Ms. Bachchan addressed the media outside Parliament after the Opposition walked out of the Upper House following a heated exchange with Mr. Dhankhar.\n\nAlso Read: Parliament session LIVE updates\n\nEarlier in the day, Congress MP Jairam Ramesh demanded the Chair's statement on an incident that occurred on July 31, when BJP MP Ghanshyam Tiwari called Leader of the Opposition Mallikarjun Kharge a \"political dynast\".\n\n\"He made a comment regarding 'parivarvaad'. I request that this should be expunged [from the records],\" Mr. Kharge had said. The Leader of the Opposition further said he was a first-generation politician and provided details of his political journey, which began after he joined the Congress party. He mentioned that his father had died at the age of 85.\n\n'I don't wish to live for long in this environment,' Mallikarjun Kharge says after BJP MP labels him a 'political dynast'\n\nChairman Dhankhar defended Mr. Tiwari on Friday, saying that the issue was resolved in a private meeting with Mr. Tiwari and Mr. Kharge. \"Mr. Tiwari told me he is prepared to apologise if he transgressed any boundary. He, instead, embellished the reputation of Mr. Kharge,\" Mr. Dhankhar said in the Upper House.\n\nSpeaking to the media, Ms. Bachchan said that she objected to the tone used by Chairman Dhankhar. \"We are not schoolchildren. Some of us are senior citizens. I was upset with the tone, and especially when the Leader of Opposition stood up to speak, he switched off the microphone,\" she said.\n\n\"He said you may be a celebrity, I do not care. I am not asking him to care. I am saying I am a member of Parliament. This is my fifth term. I know what I am saying. Nobody has ever spoken the way [it] is being done nowadays in Parliament...I need an apology for saying \"I don't care.\" He has to care, he's on the Chair,\" she added.\n\nSituation in Bangladesh still evolving, India in touch with authorities: Jaishankar in Parliament\n\nThe issue snowballed as Opposition MPs protested against Chairman Dhankhar's unwillingness to address it in the House, with senior MPs Tiruchi Siva and Ms. Bachchan supporting the demand to expunge Mr. Tiwari's statement.\n\nChairman Dhankhar took strong exception to Ms. Bachchan's remark that his tone is \"not acceptable\". He added that he \"does not want schooling\", and that he does not go by anyone's script.\n\nYou want to destabilise the entire nation, Mr. Dhankhar told the Opposition as they protested in the House. \"I shall not be party to this House being converted, Mr. Kharge, as the epicentre of disturbance,\" he said.\n\nThe Opposition walked out soon after, as the Chairman allowed the Treasury benches to chime in on his stance against the Opposition's demands. \"India has leadership continually in its third term -- a history in the making after six decades. India has leadership in [the form of] Prime Minister who has global recognition -- the nation is proud of it,\" Mr. Dhankhar said.\n\nShiv Sena (UBT) MP Priyanka Chaturvedi and AITC MP Dola Sen also expressed their support for Ms. Bachchan.\n\nThis is not the first time when Chairman Dhankhar has sparred with MP Bachchan in the Upper House. The Samajwadi Party MP has previously expressed discomfort at being addressed as \"Jaya Amitabh Bachchan\", but Chairman Dhankhar has continued to add her husband's name while recognising her in the Upper House.\n\nRead Comments", "source": {"uri": "thehindu.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hindu"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Member of parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mallikarjun_Kharge", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mallikarjun Kharge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Parliament of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leader_of_the_Opposition", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Leader of the Opposition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_National_Congress", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Indian National Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharatiya_Janata_Party", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bharatiya Janata Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jagdeep_Dhankhar", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jagdeep Dhankhar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghanshyam_Tiwari", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ghanshyam Tiwari"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaya_Bachchan", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jaya Bachchan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jairam_Ramesh", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jairam Ramesh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajya_Sabha", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rajya Sabha"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_house", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Upper house"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politician", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiv_Sena_(Uddhav_Balasaheb_Thackeray)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shiv Sena (Uddhav Balasaheb Thackeray)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinamool_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Trinamool Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dola_Sen", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dola Sen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priyanka_Chaturvedi", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Priyanka Chaturvedi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiruchi_Siva", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tiruchi Siva"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samajwadi_Party", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Samajwadi Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amitabh_Bachchan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Amitabh Bachchan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 60}], "image": "https://th-i.thgim.com/public/incoming/k3vgd7/article68505168.ece/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1200/PTI08_09_2024_000186B.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9800357", "eventUri": "eng-9800357", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-31", "textStart": 460, "textEnd": 467}], "sentiment": -0.01960784313725494, "wgt": 156, "relevance": 1}

The Chairman said he can't be \"schooled\" and that Bachchan \"may be anybody... a celebrity\" but she has to observe decorum in the House.\n\nAs Dhankhar refused to allow her or any one from the opposition to speak, INDIA bloc parties staged a walkout, which was slammed both by the Chair and the treasury benches.\n\nDhankhar remarked that the opposition believed they were the \"only ones whose hearts are bleeding\" after Phogat's shocking exit from the Olympics.\n\n\"The entire nation is in pain... But to politicise it is the greatest disrespect to her (Phogat),\" he added.\n\nThe Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha had 15 sittings each from July 22 till August 9.

Dhankhar said the issue was resolved after the two leaders met in his chambers. He added Tiwari even \"praised\" Kharge for his speech.\n\nKharge and the Congress demanded a clarification in the House, which triggered a heated exchange between the chair and the opposition. Dhankhar took exception to Bachchan's statement about his tone. An upset Dhankhar then snapped at Bachchan and said her behaviour was \"unacceptable\".\n\nBachchan told Dhankhar she is an artist and understands body language and expressions. \"But your tone is not right. We are your colleagues, but your tone is....,\" she said. Dhankhar retorted that Bachchan should understand the importance of maintaining decorum even if she is a celebrity.\n\n\"Jayaji you have earned a great reputation. You know an actor is subject to the director. But every day, I do not want to repeat myself. Every day, I do not want to do schooling. You are talking about my tone? Enough of it. You may be anybody. You have to understand the decorum. You may be a celebrity but accept decorum,\" Dhankhar said as the Opposition staged a walkout.\n\nDhankhar reiterated the Opposition insulted the chair and tarnished democracy. He said an attempt was being made to set a narrative against the country, its democratic institutions, and functions.\n\nHouse leader JP Nadda moved a resolution condemning the Opposition's behaviour. Former Prime Minister HD Deve Gowda, whose Janata Dal (Secular) is an ally of the BJP, condemned the incident\n\nSpeaking outside Parliament, Bachchan said she objected to the chair's tone. \"We are not schoolchildren. Some of us are senior citizens. I was upset with the tone and especially when the Leader of Opposition [Kharge] stood up to speak, he switched off the mike.\"\n\nShe questioned how could he do that. \"You have to allow the Leader of the Opposition to speak...I mean using unparliamentary words every time which I do not want to say... He said 'you may be a celebrity, I do not care'. I am not asking him to care. I am saying I am a member of Parliament. This is my fifth term. I know what I am saying.

Nadda, who is the Leader of the House in the Rajya Sabha, took strong exception to Bachchan's comments. He also urged the Rajya Sabha to pass a resolution condemning the developments. \"Today's incident is highly condemnable and concerning; it is, in a way, a violation of democratic values... I urge the House to pass a resolution condemning this. The Opposition's behaviour has been extremely unparliamentary, undisciplined, and disrespectful. The Opposition has become issue-less in terms of discussion, and undignified behaviour has become their habit,\" said Nadda.\n\nSpeaking to the media after the walkout, Jaya Bachchan said, \"I objected to the tone used by the Chair. We are not schoolchildren and some of us are senior citizens. I was upset with the tone and especially when the LoP (Kharge) stood up to speak, he (Dhankhar) switched off the mic. How can you do this? This is against tradition.\"\n\n\"You have to allow the leader (LoP). Who is going to protect us? Leader of the Opposition. We are all together in the Opposition. If the LoP is not going to be heard in the House then what are we doing? And on top of that every time using unparliamentary language such as you are a nuisance, budhi-heen (foolish); he said you may be a celebrity but I don't care. I am not asking him to care. I am saying I am an MP and no one has ever spoken the way it is now. And so disrespectful to women,\" she added.\n\n\"I need an apology for saying I don't care. He has to care. He is on the Chair and he has to care,\" said the actor-turned-politician.\n\nAlso Read: Waqf Amendment Bill to be referred to joint parliamentary committee after Oppn calls it 'anti-Muslim'\n\nDhankhar also accused opposition MPs of disrespecting the Constitution and democracy before he asked Bachchan to speak who then questioned his \"tone\" in Parliament, triggering a rebuke from him.\n\nBachchan expressed her disapproval stating, \"I Jaya Amitabh Bachchan would like to say that I am an artist, I understand body language , expressions. I am sorry to say that your tone is not acceptable. We are colleagues, you may be sitting on the Chair....\"\n\nDhankhar then interrupted Bachchan and said he did not need any 'schooling'.\n\n\"I don't want schooling. I am a person who has gone out of the way and you say my tone? No, seat given to you. Enough of it. You can't have it. You may be anybody. You may be a celebrity. You have to understand the decorum. I will not bear it. Never carry an impression that only you build reputations. We come here with reputations. We live up to reputations. Nothing doing,\" he said.\n\nWhen a member took exception to Bachchan being called a 'celebrity' given that she is a 'senior Member of Parliament', Dhankhar responded by saying, \"A senior Member of the Parliament has a licence to run-down the reputation of the Chair? To question the tone and tenor? Yes. I have to be in reaction mode to take care of the situation.\n\n\"I have highest respect but to make it a habit? My tone? My language? My temper? I don't go by the script of others. I have my own script. I am not operated by anyone else... Thinking has to be from within... It is misconduct. I know you want to destabilise the entire nation. Yes. You are out to create chaos in the House.\"\n\nDhankhar went on to say that India is a peaceful and stable country with a \"most functional, vibrant democracy\".\n\n\"India has leadership continually in its third term, a history in making after six decades. India has leadership in Prime Minister, that has global recognition. The nation is proud of it, and some people taking note of happenings in the neighbouring country are engaging in inflammatory, condemnable narrative,\" he added.\n\n\"Things have started as a narrative. Oh, neighbouring country, we are next... The challenge I know is not to me at all. In the entire mechanism, the challenge is to the elected government. That they want to start here. And I share with anguish, anxiety, pain and concern. I avoided virtually fist fight in the House by adjournments,\" Dhankhar said.\n\nHe also criticised the Opposition for staging a walkout and said BJP MP Ghanshyam Tiwari had in fact praised Kharge. \"Such narratives have to be ambushed at the threshold. Can you see reason today... Today when they walked out, one of the most experienced members of this house, four decades of experience, Ghanshyam Tiwari ji, his only transgression was he praised Mallikarjun Kharge ji. The praise was in Sanskrit.\n\n\"Mallikarjun Kharge was invited to my chamber along with Ghanshyam Tiwari ji, said that the matter was discussed, it was understood.

The Chairman said he can't be \"schooled\" and that Bachchan \"may be anybody... a celebrity\" but she has to observe decorum in the House.\n\nAs Dhankhar refused to allow her or any one from the opposition to speak, INDIA bloc parties staged a walkout, which was slammed both by the Chair and the treasury benches.\n\nDhankhar remarked that the opposition believed they were the \"only ones whose hearts are bleeding\" after Phogat's shocking exit from the Olympics.\n\n\"The entire nation is in pain... But to politicise it is the greatest disrespect to her (Phogat),\" he added.\n\nThe Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha had 15 sittings each from July 22 till August 9. The session was originally scheduled to end on August 12.\n\n\"The productivity of Lok Sabha during the Budget Session was approximately 136 per cent and that of Rajya Sabha was approximately 118 per cent,\" Parliamentary Affairs Minister Kiren Rijiju told reporters here.\n\nDuring this session, the House passed several key pieces of legislation, including the Finance Bill, 2024, and the Appropriation Bill, 2024 -- both crucial for the Union budget.\n\nAdditionally, the Jammu and Kashmir Appropriation Bill, 2024, and the Indian Aircraft Bill, 2024, were among the four Bills passed.\n\nThe session also witnessed the introduction of a Bill to amend the Waqf Act, 1995, which was subsequently referred to a joint committee of Parliament amid protests from opposition members over its provisions.\n\nThe Lok Sabha passed The Bharatiya Vayuyan Vidheyak that seeks to replace the 90-year-old Aircraft Act. The election to the post of Deputy Speaker of the Lok Sabha is yet to take place. The post had remained vacant in the previous Lok Sabha.

The treasury benches moved a censure motion against the Opposition's conduct, with allies calling for punitive measures against Opposition leaders.\n\nThere was a sharp exchange of words between Mr. Dhankhar and Samajwadi Party MP Jaya Bachchan, who criticised the Chairman's \"tone\" and \"body-language\".\n\n'Sorted in the chamber'\n\nThe confrontation began at noon, the beginning of the Question Hour, when the Congress' Chief Whip Jairam Ramesh asked about the status of the Chairman's ruling on a written complaint from the Congress asking him to expunge Mr. Tiwari's remarks against Mr. Kharge, made on August 1.\n\nMr. Dhankhar said that the BJP member had actually praised Mr. Kharge in Sanskrit. Noting that \"people don't apologise when they praise\", he claimed that the matter had already been amicably sorted out between the two in his presence in his chamber.\n\nHowever, Mr. Kharge insisted on a clarification on the floor of the House. \"You should say the same thing you have explained to me in the chamber... It is better that you do it in the House,\" he said. The Opposition then clamoured for an apology from Mr. Tiwari, with DMK MP Tiruchi Siva and Congress MP Pramod Tiwari both explaining that the BJP MP's tone and tenor had been derogatory.\n\n'Unacceptable tone'\n\nAt this point, the Chairman allowed Ms. Bachchan to speak, calling her the last speaker on the issue. \"Main kalakar hoon, body language samajhti hoon, expression samajhti hoon... par sir, mujhe maaf kariyega magar apka tone jo hai (I am an artist, I understand body language and expression. Forgive me but your tone) is not acceptable. We are colleagues sir, [though] you may be sitting on the chair,\" she said.\n\nMr. Dhankhar hit back, saying he did not want to be schooled. \"You may be anybody. You may be a celebrity. You have to understand the decorum. I will not bear it. Never carry an impression that only you build reputations. We come here with reputations. We live up to reputations,\" he retorted.\n\n'MP, not celebrity'\n\nAs TMC MP Sushmita Dev objected to the remarks, saying that Ms. Bachchan was an MP and not a celebrity in the House, Mr. Dhankhar shot back saying, \"A senior member of the Parliament has no licence to run down the reputation of the chair, to question tone and tenor.\"\n\nMr. Dhankhar accused Mr. Kharge of trying to convert the House into \"an epicentre of disturbance\" and criticised the Opposition for \"disrespecting\" democracy and the Constitution.\n\nA seething Opposition, who were not allowed to respond, staged a joint walkout and did not return for the rest of the day.\n\nAfter the walkout, Ms. Bachchan told reporters that she had objected to the tone used by the Chair. \"We are not school children. I was upset with the tone and especially when the LoP stood up to speak, his mic was switched off. How can you do this? If he is not going to be heard in the House, then what are we doing? On top of that, every time [they are] using words which are unparliamentary,\" she said.\n\nPunitive action\n\nAfter the Opposition's walk out, the treasury benches spent the rest of the Question Hour in slamming their conduct. The Leader of the House and BJP president J.P. Nadda moved a \"censure motion\" against the Opposition. All members of the ruling National Democratic Alliance criticised the Opposition and called for punitive action against their behaviour.\n\nRashtriya Lok Dal leader Jayant Chaudhary called for the suspension of the errant members, while Janata Dal (United) leader Sanjay Jha accused Congress Parliamentary Party chairperson Sonia Gandhi (whom he did not name but referred to as the \"highest authority\" of the party) of instigating the confrontation. Praful Patel, who belongs to the Nationalist Congress Party led by Ajit Pawar, the Republican Party of India's Ramdas Athawale, and G.K. Vasan of the Tamil Maanila Congress were among the others who slammed the Opposition walkout, calling it an unprecedented act of misconduct.\n\nFormer Prime Minister Deve Gowda, the 92-year-old leader of the Janata Dal (Secular) told Mr. Dhankhar: \"You tried to solve the problem between Ghanshayam Tiwari and the Leader of the Opposition. You have called both of them to their chamber and resolved the matter.\"\n\n'Deeply hurt'\n\nIn his concluding remarks later in the day, the Chairman said he holds every member in high regard and has no personal issue with anyone, adding that he is deeply hurt at the use of intemperate language without any premise, and the decision to get traction by going to the media.\n\n\"My chamber, chamber of Chairmen of the Council of States, the House of Elders, the Upper House, has been labelled that something that happens there is closed door, a disinformation, that what I discussed with Mr. Tiwari was only with him.

The Opposition's resolution is based on three points. The MPs say there is a marked lack of space and time for the Opposition to express its views. The Opposition argues that parliamentary convention dictates that the Leader of Opposition is conceded the floor, if he gets up to speak. Their complaint is that Congress president and the Leader of the Opposition in the Rajya Sabha Mallikarjun Kharge's microphone is routinely turned off.\n\nThe second point that the Opposition has raised is that the House should be run by \"rules and convention\" and the floor of the House is \"supreme\" to any other area in Parliament. \"Every time we complain, we are told to see the Chairman in his chamber. The problems generated on the floor of the House should be sorted there,\" a senior Opposition leader said.\n\nThe third accusation that the Opposition has made against the Chairman is on \"personal remarks against members.\" \"Rule 238(2) of the Rajya Sabha clearly states that a member while speaking shall not make a personal charge against a member. This is a rule that the Chairman must also abide by,\" another Opposition member pointed out.\n\nIf the Opposition moves such a resolution, it will be the first such occasion in Indian parliamentary history.\n\nArticle 67(B) under which the Opposition is planning to move the resolution states, \"A Vice-President may be removed from his office by a resolution of the Council of States passed by a majority of all the then members of the Council and agreed to by the House of the People.\" It explicitly says that for moving this resolution \"at least fourteen days notice\" has to be given. Sources said that the move was being talked about for over a week but the confrontation in the House over the last few days was the last straw.\n\nWith both Houses of Parliament adjourned sine die, Opposition leaders said that they would keep the issue alive and would make the move in the next session. They conceded that they may not have the numbers to make the final push. In the Rajya Sabha, the Opposition, barring the YSR Congress, the Bharat Rashtra Samithi and the Biju Janata Dal, the INDIA bloc has 87 members. The resolution also has to pass in Lok Sabha. \"This is not about arithmetic. It is about relaying our sentiments and putting it on record,\" an Opposition leader said.\n\nRead Comments", "source": {"uri": "thehindu.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hindu"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice-President_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vice-President of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajya_Sabha", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rajya Sabha"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jagdeep_Dhankhar", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jagdeep Dhankhar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Constitution of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majority", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Majority"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lok_Sabha", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lok Sabha"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_of_no_confidence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Motion of no confidence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leader_of_the_Opposition", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Leader of the Opposition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leader_of_the_Opposition_(India)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Leader of the Opposition (India)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mallikarjun_Kharge", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mallikarjun Kharge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_National_Congress", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indian National Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Parliament of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharat_Rashtra_Samithi", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bharat Rashtra Samithi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palace_of_Westminster", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Palace of Westminster"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biju_Janata_Dal", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Biju Janata Dal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial_Disputes", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial Disputes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Conventions", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Conventions", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security/FAQs,_Help,_and_Tutorials", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security/FAQs, Help, and Tutorials", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Exploits", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Exploits", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 48}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 52}], "image": "https://th-i.thgim.com/public/news/national/r0bpk6/article68506907.ece/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1200/PTI08_09_2024_000443B.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9800357", "eventUri": "eng-9800357", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 146, "relevance": 1}

Congress MPs requested an apology from Tiwari, but Dhankhar stated that the matter had been settled personally with the leaders.\n\nWhile the opposition leaders were walking out, Chairman Jagdeep Dhankhar lashed out at Kharge and said, \"I know you want to destabilise the entire nation. You are out to create chaos in the House. Nothing else is going on record. I won't be a party to this House being converted as an epicentre of disturbance. You are determined to have your way at the cost of the Constitution. You are doing it. It is a lack of disrespect and decorum for democracy. Disrespect to the constitution,\" Dhankhar said.\n\nThe Vice President further slammed the Kharge and other opposition leaders for walking out of the House and said,\" You are walking away from your obligations. You are walking away from your duty. Honourable members, they don't want to participate. They know only how to create chaos...The nation is a priority...\"\n\nAfter the opposition MPs from the Rajya Sabha, Jagdeep Dhankhar called it a \"sad day\".\n\nNotably, BJP MP Ghanshyam Tiwari had recently attacked Kharge by saying that his \"entire family was involved in politics\", however, Kharge pointed out that he is a first-generation politician. He thus, demanded that Tiwari's comments be expunged. In response to this, VP Dhankhar had assured Kharge that the \"parivarwad\" remarks would be expunged from the record.\n\nHowever, today, the opposition leaders created a ruckus and demanded an apology from Tiwari. On Friday, Dhankhar informed the House that he privately spoke to Kharge and Tiwari to address the issue. He added that Tiwari assured him to apologise to Kharge if he crossed the boundary. \"Mr Tiwari told me he is prepared to apologise if he transgressed any boundary. He, instead, embellished the reputation of Mr. Kharge,\" Dhankhar said.", "source": {"uri": "opindia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "OpIndia"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jagdeep_Dhankhar", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jagdeep Dhankhar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mallikarjun_Kharge", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mallikarjun Kharge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajya_Sabha", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rajya Sabha"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Member of parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghanshyam_Tiwari", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ghanshyam Tiwari"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_National_Congress", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indian National Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharatiya_Janata_Party", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bharatiya Janata Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leader_of_the_Opposition", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Leader of the Opposition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Constitution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Honourable", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Honourable"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politician", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Politician"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://www.opindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/jagdeep-dhankar-kharge.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9800357", "eventUri": "eng-9800357", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-09", "textStart": 11, "textEnd": 19}], "sentiment": -0.192156862745098, "wgt": 146, "relevance": 1}

You've not seen what I see from here. I don't want schooling. I am a person who has gone out of the way, and you say my tone...,enough of it.\" After the walkout, Bachchan told reporters that she objected to the tone used by the Chair.\n\n\"We are not school children. I was upset with the tone and especially when the LoP stood up to speak, his mic was switched off. How can you do this? If he is not going to be heard in the House, then what are we doing? On top of that, every time (they are) using words which are unparliamentary,\" she said.\n\nCongress general secretary in-charge communications Jairam Ramesh told reporters that Ghanshyam Tiwari had insulted the Leader of Opposition in the House in front of everybody.\n\n\"Today it was said that Ghanshyam Tiwari came and in a closed door meeting praised Kharge ji. So what he said privately, we demanded that he should say it in the House. He insulted Kharge ji, he should say that what I said was wrong and I respect him and by mistake I said what I said,\" Ramesh said.\n\n\"He (Chairman) keeps interrupting me, I have no objection to that but LoP is not allowed to speak. LoP has been insulted. The dignity of a constitutional post has been lowered. We are against this. Jaya Bachchan had gotten up for this issue only that the Leader of Opposition is being repeatedly insulted and not being allowed to speak,\" he said.\n\n\"Issue was that Tiwari made serious allegations against Kharge which we wanted wanted should be erased from records,\" he said.\n\nAddressing the Rajya Sabha, Bachchan, a Samajwadi Party MP, expressed her disapproval of Dhankhar's tone in the House which led to an exchange of words between the two.

With these words of expectation, request, pleading and urging, I will take up the essential agenda,\" he said.\n\n\"If untruth, something which is far distanced from truth, gets traction, it is bothersome. Our resolve to ensure that the sacred precincts of Rajya Sabha be not allowed to be a ground for destabilising democracy,\" he added.\n\nEarlier, Congress MPs demanded an apology from Tiwari for his remarks made on August 1, but the Rajya Sabha chairman insisted that the issue was resolved privately with the leaders.The Opposition Rajya Sabha MPs also demanded to expunge the remarks of Ghanshyam Tiwari about LoP, while Samajwadi Party MP Jaya Bachchan made remarks about the tone of Chairman Dhankhar.The Chairman took strong exception to Jaya Bachchan's remarks, saying he does not want schooling and that he does not go by any script and has his script. On this, the Opposition members staged a walkout from Rajya Sabha.\n\nDuring the conclusion of the 265th Session of the Rajya Sabha, he said,\"I have therefore no doubt that my appeal to the Members who are not present today will persuade them to soul search, engage in introspection, think about their duty to the nation, take into consideration their oath under the constitution, and prepare for vigorous participation in a constructive manner in forthcoming sessions.\"\n\nDhankar urged members who walked out to \"deeply reflect and consider the House proceedings and the expectations of the public.\"\n\n\"I appeal to the members who are not present there out of the decision taken and reflected in the house by their walkout to deeply introspect and deliberate within themselves taking into consideration the upper house,\" Dhankar said.\n\n\"The three adjournments unfortunately didn't evoke the expected response. I will continue to work for the participation of the members to get an opportunity to perform their constitutional duty and use their energy and exposure to serve people at large,\" he said.\n\nHe further said that he observed the reaction of members on various TV channels during the adhjoument and that out of respect for the institution and for every member of the House and the people at large, he had taken due care that their behaviour and conduct that was not becoming a member of Parliament did not get traction beyond the temple of democracy.\"\n\n\"While the house was adjourned, I saw the reaction of the members outside the house on various TV channels. I wish to inform the people at large that out of respect for this institution and out of respect for the dignity of every member, I have taken due care and caution to ensure that our behaviour of not being members of the Parliament doesn't get traction beyond the temple of democracy,\" he said.(ANI)", "source": {"uri": "aninews.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "Asian News International (ANI)"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajya_Sabha", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rajya Sabha"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Member of parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghanshyam_Tiwari", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ghanshyam Tiwari"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jagdeep_Dhankhar", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jagdeep Dhankhar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaya_Bachchan", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jaya Bachchan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice-President_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vice-President of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mallikarjun_Kharge", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mallikarjun Kharge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharatiya_Janata_Party", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bharatiya Janata Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leader_of_the_Opposition", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Leader of the Opposition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Constitution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samajwadi_Party", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Samajwadi Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_National_Congress", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indian National Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Parliament of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_house", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Upper house"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://d3lzcn6mbbadaf.cloudfront.net/media/details/ANI-20240809150704.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9800357", "eventUri": "eng-9800357", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-09", "textStart": 19, "textEnd": 27}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-01", "textStart": 1696, "textEnd": 1704}], "sentiment": 0.2, "wgt": 116, "relevance": 1}

In such a situation how will democracy survive?\n\nPramod Tiwari said, \"It is a parliamentary tradition that the Leader of Opposition and Leader of the House get priority to express their views inside the house. But it has been happening for a long time that the Opposition leader is not allowed to speak. His mic is switched off. If we cannot raise the voice of the rights of the people of the country in the House, then it is violation of democracy\".\n\nHe said that stopping the leader of the opposition from speaking in the House is suppressing the voice of 140 crore people of the country.\n\nTiwari said that that the words used by BJP leader Ghanshyam Tiwari were not in good taste.\n\nCalling it as outrageous and unacceptable, Tiwari said that the party has given a notice of breach of privilege in the House and is waiting for the government's decision regarding it. The leader of the opposition is not getting the importance he deserves and it is unfair to stop him in this manner.\n\nAjay Maken said that whatever happened in the Rajya Sabha today was unexpected. All opposition parties felt that the attitude of the Chairman was biased. Rajya Sabha sets a standard as to how all the Houses should be run.

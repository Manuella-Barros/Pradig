bronze in the women's triathlon behind home favourite Cassandre Beaugrand.\n\nPotter, who won the test event around the streets of Paris last year, was one of the favourites for Olympic gold but ultimately she could not match the pace of winner Beaugrand, with Switzerland's Julie Derron in second.\n\nThe women's race was able to take place as scheduled after the water quality in the Seine was deemed safe for swimming, with the delayed men's race scheduled shortly after.\n\nTokyo silver medallist Georgia Taylor-Brown finished sixth, with the third British athlete Kate Waugh in 15th.\n\nFinally, the early morning organisers' meeting on Wednesday brought good news, with the river deemed swimmable for the first time since Friday's deluge caused elevated levels of bacteria.\n\nThere was more rain on Tuesday night but the skies cleared as the athletes dived into the water below Pont Alexandre III, the Eiffel Tower providing the spectacular backdrop that had convinced organisers to take such a big gamble.\n\nDefending champion Flora Duffy from Bermuda, who was made a Dame in the 2022 New York Honours following her Tokyo triumph, took the lead early in the swim but Potter and Taylor-Brown made sure they stayed in touch.\n\nPotter emerged from the water in fifth, with Taylor-Brown 10th, and a lead group of 10 formed on the bike after Duffy was reeled in on the second lap.\n\nThe wet roads around central Paris caused several athletes to slip and fall but the leading contenders all stayed upright through the 40 kilometres and headed off on the 10km run.\n\nThe pace from the start was fierce and Taylor-Brown was among those unable to cling on as a lead group of four formed.\n\nBeaugrand made her move early in the final lap and Potter could not go with her, the British athlete also losing touch with Derron and looking round often at France's Emma Lombardi just behind her.\n\nBut Potter hung on for a medal, Britain's third in a row in women's triathlon at the Olympics.", "source": {"uri": "aol.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "press_association@aol.co.uk", "name": "Press Association", "type":

I train with Alistair day in, day out, and he's such a big part of my journey, and Jonny as well.\n\n\"I moved in with Jonny when I first moved to Leeds. They're always the first to message me before and after races and they believe in me.\"\n\nThere was disappointment for Taylor-Brown, who had battled to overcome a calf injury in time to make the team but could not add another medal to her individual silver and relay gold from Tokyo.\n\n\"I'm disappointed to not walk away with a medal but I always say all I can do is give it my everything and that's exactly what I did,\" she said.\n\n\"I just had nothing today, I had nothing on the run, which is a shame, obviously.

I did it for me but I also did it for everyone who has helped me in eight years and believed in me from day one. It is for them back home as well.\"\n\nThe men's race was postponed by 24 hours on Tuesday after the water quality in the River Seine failed to meet required standards following heavy rainfall.\n\nBut both events were cleared to take place on Wednesday morning after water analyses, received at 02:20 BST (03:20 local time), were deemed compliant by World Triathlon.\n\nThe men's race, featuring Great Britain's Alex Yee and Sam Dickinson, is scheduled to begin at 09:45 BST.\n\nIt was one of the most remarkable moments in recent triathlon history which helped inspire Potter to make the switch to the multi-sport event.\n\nWhen she watched as Alistair Brownlee helped carry struggling younger brother Jonny over the finish line in a dramatic conclusion to the 2016 world series, she knew where her future lay.\n\nMoving to Leeds to train with the Brownlees, former physics teacher Potter has maintained an upward trajectory and won her first major medal with Commonwealth bronze in 2022 before securing a first world title in 2023.\n\nWith that success asserting her as one of the Olympic gold medal favourites in Paris, Potter lined up with the additional confidence gained by winning the Olympic test event here in Paris last August.\n\nIn the end, with her chances of victory gone, the Briton gauged her final effort to perfection to outlast French athlete Emma Lombardi and secure her first Olympic medal.\n\nDefending champion Flora Duffy, of Bermuda, dominated the opening 1500m swim which saw many athletes struggle against the river's current.\n\nBut she faded after a chaotic 40km bike leg, which saw several falls on roads greased by morning rain.\n\nDuffy ended fifth, behind an intense race for gold between a quartet of leaders on the 10km run, with the eventual medallists joined by Lombardi.\n\nAnd, as Beaugrand eventually broke the resistance of her gold medal rivals to delight the huge home crowds lining the streets, it was Derron and Potter who were able to find the strength at the conclusion of a gruelling race to make the podium.\n\nTokyo runner-up Taylor-Brown ended one minute 25secs off the medals, while Olympic debutant Kate Waugh was 15th.", "source":

She actually house-shared with Jonny for almost a year after uprooting to the training haven of the Yorkshire Dales and the two Brownlee brothers, who are both absent from the Olympic triathlon race for the first time in 20 years, are among her coaching team.\n\nThey were also riverside at the Seine to roar her on. \"I know she wanted to win that gold medal but I hope she is not disappointed - it was an amazing, super-tough race and you could see she was giving everything,\" said Alistair, the men's champion in 2012 and 2016. \"It's amazing how far she's come. She's a really inspirational story.\"\n\nOf the Brownlees' influence, Potter said: \"They're always the first to message me before and after races - they believe in me and have been a massive part of my journey.\"\n\nIn a dramatic race, which the athletes did not even know would be on until 4am after the River Seine was finally deemed safe to enter, Potter certainly delivered tactically but ultimately did not have the strength to challenge for the gold that she won in last year's World Championship.\n\nComing out of a brutally difficult 1500m swim leg in fifth amid fierce currents in the Seine, Potter soon established herself in a lead group of nine for the 40km cycle. Overnight rain had significantly dampened the roads and, with the course taking in numerous cobbles around some of the great Paris landmarks, there were a series of crashes.\n\nPotter later attributed her ability to stay upright to her regular training around the often wet roads of Leeds. Beaugrand, who herself trains just down the M1 in Loughborough, also attributed the way that she handled the damp weather to living in England. \"The English people helped me a lot, so thanks to them,\" said Beaugrand, \"I want someone to pinch me now.\"\n\nDefending champion Flora Duffy had earlier led out of the swim and the front group on the cycle also included Georgia Taylor-Brown, the Briton who took silver in Tokyo, but this thinned down to four almost immediately after the second transition and the start of the 10km run.\n\nRoared on by her home Paris crowd, Beaugrand largely shared the pace with the Swiss athlete Julie Derron while Potter and Emma Lombardi tucked in behind.\n\nIt duly stayed that way for around 8km, before Beaugrand launched her attack and immediately opened up a decisive gap. Derron remained strongest in pursuit while a clearly exhausted Potter held on to distance Lombardi and justify her career switch with an emotional Olympic bronze.\n\n\"I was going for the gold, but Cassandre and Julie were too good, and I'm super happy to get bronze,\" said Potter. \"I've come a long way in eight years. I dug really deep and found something else. My coaches told me to stay in the top five, stay near the front, try to stay out of trouble. I live and train in Leeds - I'm used to those conditions - and just tried to stay as safe as possible. It was a wall of noise.\"\n\nOn her return from injury, Taylor-Brown finished sixth ahead of Team GB's third athlete Kate Waugh in 15th. \"It was horrible on the way back in under the bridge - not fun, really hard,\" said Taylor-Brown. \"I was happy to make the front pack but we went on the run, and I had nothing in me.\"", "source": {"uri": "telegraph.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The

Everyone knew I was stressed. It's not what you want to do.\n\n\"I told myself 'Cass, you can't go through the same thing as Tokyo again, concentrate, you've been doing triathlon your whole life, it's just another race.'\n\n\"To do this in front of this audience, I can't believe it.\"\n\nAfter the postponement of the men's race on Tuesday due to poor water quality, the women's event got underway on time on the back of a rainstorm.\n\nDefending champion Flora Duffy, the winner of Bermuda's only Olympic gold and appearing in a remarkable fifth Olympics at the age of 36, led the 1,500 metres swim out.\n\nAll the main contenders were in a group of nine that picked Duffy up but the morning's heavy rain, combined with several cobblestone sections, made the bike leg treacherous and there were a series of crashes.\n\nThe leaders - with the exception of Germany's Laura Lindemann - negotiated the seven-lap 40km route safely and, without any hills to break them up, arrived en masse for the 10km run.\n\nAfter the first of four 2.5km laps, however, Potter, Derron, and local favourites Emma Lombardi and Beaugrand had forged clear.\n\nThe quartet ran together until halfway round the final lap when Beaugrand made her decisive move and the 27-year-old was able to enjoy the greatest moment of her career.\n\nGoing for Gold\n\nDerron, who was at the front of the breakaway foursome for most of the race, said it was \"a bit daunting\".\n\n\"Running at the front you have no idea what's going on behind you but I feel more comfortable like this,\" she said.\n\n\"I could run my own stride and my own rhythm, that was just perfect for me to be there. I'm so pleased it paid off.\"\n\nPotter, who raced the 10,000 metres on the track at Rio 2016, said: \"I'm so happy. I was going for the gold but Cassandre and Julie were just too good for me today.\n\n\"It said it was going to be dry but it was obviously very wet. I live and train in Leeds so I am used to those conditions. I didn't want to make any silly mistakes and tried to stay as safe as possible.\n\n\"I've come a long way in eight years... I dug deep and found something else.\"\n\nLombardi was a frustrated fourth while Duffy, despite being out for a year with a knee injury, took an impressive fifth. Britain's Tokyo silver medallist Georgia Taylor-Brown finished sixth.", "source": {"uri": "tribune.com.pk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Express Tribune"}, "authors": [{"uri": "reuters@tribune.com.pk", "name": "Reuters", "type": "author", "isAgency": true}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triathlon", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Triathlon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beth_Potter", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Beth Potter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassandre_Beaugrand", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cassandre Beaugrand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brigitte_McMahon", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brigitte McMahon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicola_Spirig", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nicola Spirig"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hammer_throw", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hammer throw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_(running)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sprint (running)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triathlon_at_the_2020_Summer_Olympics_\u2013_Women's", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Triathlon at the 2020 Summer Olympics \u2013 Women's"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flora_Duffy", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Flora Duffy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1500_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "1500 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bermuda", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bermuda"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bermuda"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_Taylor-Brown", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Georgia Taylor-Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laura_Lindemann", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Laura Lindemann"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/10,000_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "10,000 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Silver medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leeds", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Leeds"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Leeds"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports/Triathlon", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports/Triathlon", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports/Off-Road", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports/Off-Road", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/tri-reuters1722421878-0/tri-reuters1722421878-0.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9778243", "eventUri": "eng-9778243", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1607843137254903, "wgt": 182, "relevance": 1}

But where can the advantages be gained throughout the near two-hours of racing and who is going to best placed to exploit them?\n\nMuch has been made of the potential for the Seine current to slow the swim. But the opening 440m to the first turn buoy, while longer than regular Olympic-distance courses on the circuit, will be with the flow and could therefore be as fast as anything we have seen. There will be several big names looking to get clear over the swim-bike, others doing everything in their power to minimise any gap a breakaway group might carve out.\n\nThen there is the closing stages of the 10km run, where anything from the cobbled surface to the roar of a home crowd could be decisive.\n\nPotter takes aim\n\nAs the number one athlete in the Olympic Ranking, Beth Potter will have the honour of choosing her pontoon start number and position, but will want to take into account not just the straightest line to the buoy but also the strongest current.\n\nRegularly found carving through clear water at the top level are the likes of Vittoria Lopes (BRA), Maya Kingma (NED), Kate Waugh (GBR) and Bianca Seregni (ITA). But defending champion Flora Duffy and home favourite Cassandre Beaugrand could also spearhead the opening discipline and blow their chances of success wide open from the get go.\n\nAt the Test Event, the fastest athletes started on the centre-right of the pontoon, and sighting was made difficult into the sun on the return towards the pontoon. Add in the changing light conditions as they passed under the bridge and there are plenty of challenges. Flora Duffy and Georgia Taylor-Brown were both missing from the Test Event, Potter, Tertsch and Knibb all exited together some 25 seconds behind Beaugrand.\n\nThe mission into transition\n\nFlora Duffy also has a history of dialling in her transitions, keeping a cool head when it counts to switch from swim to bike. That will be crucial in Paris, where 36 steep stone steps need to be climbed before hitting the top of the bridge and the bike racks. Experience could play a major role here, though it is also something that another young French star, Emma Lombardi, often excels in. Potter and Tertsch were the fastest through T1 at the Test Event.\n\nWhere Taylor Knibb exits the water could also have a big impact on the second discipline, as the athletes mount their bikes and head out for the 40km ride. The harder she has to work to be among the leaders, the longer she may have to wait before feeling a breakaway is possible.\n\nWe have seen her ride solo, too, and there are few that can match her power, each dead turn a chance to drive out back to full tilt and potentially pull clear. We have also seen Duffy and Kingma form extremely efficient breakaways, Georgia Taylor-Brown too. It will be fascinating to see who - if anyone - is prepared to roll the dice and how early in a bid to nullify the run of a Beth Potter or Lisa Tertsch.\n\nTime to surge\n\nThe second transition is another opportunity to make or break a race. Taylor Knibb's T2 was a full 11 seconds slower than the quickest (Alberte Kjaer Pedersen), 10 seconds slower than Beaugrand's. The effort expelled in making up those kind of margins before it is too late could also end a medal challenge.\n\nSo it is to those incredible runners that attentions will turn over the final 33-34 minutes of all in racing. The Test Event saw Beaugrand and Potter locked in battle before the Brit stole a march and the gold over the final lap. More recently, Beaugrand soared in Cagliari and Hamburg, Lisa Tertsch showing she has the kick to outpace Potter, both over the 5km in Germany and 10km in Cagliari.\n\nTertsch has an almighty sprint, too, Jeanne Lehair has shown she can mix it over the 10km and if someone like Sweden's Tilda Mansson can be within touching distance of the leaders, there are few faster.\n\nThe Women's Individual Triathlon of the Paris 2024 Olympic Games: Wednesday 8am local time.\n\nCheck your local listings for how to watch live.", "source": {"uri": "triathlon.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "World Triathlon"}, "authors": [{"uri": "world_triathlon@triathlon.org", "name": "World Triathlon", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flora_Duffy", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Flora Duffy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triathlon", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Triathlon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Triathlon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World Triathlon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beth_Potter", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Beth Potter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_of_athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sport of athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maya_Kingma", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Maya Kingma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Knibb", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Knibb"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitt\u00f3ria_Lopes", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vitt\u00f3ria Lopes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_Taylor-Brown", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Georgia Taylor-Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassandre_Beaugrand", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cassandre Beaugrand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTC+1", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "UTC+1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Horse racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cagliari", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cagliari"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cagliari"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamburg", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hamburg"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hamburg"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports/Triathlon", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports/Triathlon", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Triathlon", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Triathlon", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 80}], "image": "https://triathlon-images.imgix.net/news_thumbs/AWAG93171.jpg?w=1200&h=630&auto=format&fit=crop&crop=edges", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9778243", "eventUri": "eng-9778243", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3019607843137255, "wgt": 178, "relevance": 1}

women's Olympic triathlon gold medal as the sport could finally set aside days of uncertainty due to water quality concerns.\n\nOn the last of four laps in the 10km run, Beaugrand broke clear of compatriot Emma Lombardi, Swiss Julie Derron and Great Britain's Beth Potter.\n\nBeaugrand, the top French hope, won the 1.5km swim, 40km cycle and 10km run event in one 54 minutes 55 seconds.\n\nDerron finished six seconds behind for silver and Potter was another nine seconds adrift for bronze, with Lombardi fourth.\n\nSophie Linn was the first Australian finisher in 21st and Natalie van Coevorden was 42nd out of 51 finishers.\n\nWhile the swim went ahead, a strong current in the River Seine made it tough for the women.\n\nTokyo Games winner Flora Duffy from Bermuda led the field out of the water, but she was soon caught by the chasers.\n\nAs with the road time trials on day one of the Games, rain made conditions treacherous on the bike and several triathletes crashed.\n\nmedal tallyGame On ParisLoading...Full Medal TallyOlympics Coverage\n\nThe four leaders cleared out at the start of the run, with Beaugrand making her gold-winning move with about 2km left.\n\nAfter days of delays and uncertainty over water quality in the River Seine, race day dawned with World Triathlon announcing \"we will swim\" on social media through its X channel.\n\nFinally, the Olympic triathlons are going ahead.\n\nParis Games organisers said early on Wednesday that latest tests of the water showed compliance with quality standards, allowing the swims to be held in the river.\n\nThat was despite overnight rain, which persisted until shortly before the women's start at 8am (4pm AEST).\n\nElevated levels of bacteria in the river had pushed the men's race from Tuesday to Wednesday at 10.45am, after the women.\n\nSwim familiarisation sessions on Sunday and Monday at the race site were cancelled\n\nAustralians Matt Hauser and Luke Willian should be at the pointy end of the men's race.\n\nAsked four days ago if he would swim in the Seine, regardless of the water quality, Hauser replied \"bloody oath\".\n\nChanging Wednesday's races to duathlons - run-bike-run - would have been a nightmare scenario for organisers, especially as more than one billions euros ($A1.7 billion) has been spent on improving water quality in the Seine as a major Olympics legacy project.\n\nThey have been steadfast in their insistence that the swimming portion of the triathlon and the marathon swimming events next week could safely be held in the river.\n\nThe water quality in the Seine is directly affected by rainfall that can lead to wastewater runoff flowing into the river.\n\nHeavy rains fell during Friday's Olympic opening ceremony, and rain continued for most of the day on Saturday.\n\nGet the latest news from thewest.com.au in your inbox.\n\nSign up for our emails", "source": {"uri": "thewest.com.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "The West Australian"},

I'm super happy to come away with a bronze.\n\n\"My coach told me to stay in the top five and try to stay towards the front, and I mainly stayed out of trouble. Got caught up behind a couple of crashes on the bike, but managed to stay upright and was just trying to be sensible and not doing anything mad.

It was on top of the \"Paris 2024\" logo, with a home crowd cheering her on. Her time of 1 hour, 54 minutes, 55 seconds edged Julie Derron of Switzerland by six seconds. Beth Potter of Britain captured bronze.\n\n\"It's magical,\" Beaugrand said. \"It's the best route we've had in a long time and I know all the other athletes feel the same. To do this in front of our crowd was something that had to be done, and I still can't believe it.\"\n\nIn the men's race that started less than an hour after the women finished, Alex Yee of Britain held off Hayden Wilde of New Zealand by six seconds to win gold. Leo Bergere earned another medal for France by taking bronze.\n\nThe men's race originally supposed to take place on Tuesday but was postponed because of elevated levels of bacteria in the water. The organizers said early Wednesday the latest tests of the water showed compliance with quality standards.\n\nHolding the race in Paris' famed waterway was all part of an ambitious plan to clean up the long-polluted Seine. Organizers have been steadfast in their insistence that the swimming portion of the triathlon and the marathon swimming events next week could safely be held in the river.\n\nA steady rain subsided just before the triathletes dove into the water. Derron said water quality wasn't on her mind -- only a medal.\n\n\"I knew it was race day, and I knew what I had to do,\" she said. \"So you don't have time to focus on anything around that.\n\n\"It felt normal. It felt a bit cold, especially because it was raining before the race. So I felt a bit chilly before the start, but the water is just normal water. Of course, the strong current on the way back, that made it harder, but other than that, it's just normal water.\"\n\nThe tricky part proved to be on the bike and racing through the wet streets. Romina Biagioli of Argentina fell off her bike on Lap 2, her water bottles rolling away.\n\n\"It was a nice course, but with the rain it was dangerous,\" she said. \"It was nice but dangerous.\"\n\nAs for swimming in the Seine, Biagioli said she would've preferred more practice time to prepare for its currents.\n\n\"I wasn't worried about the pollution,\" Biagioli said. \"I was worried about how it could affect me not to try it before the race.\"\n\nAP Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/2024-paris-olympic-games", "source": {"uri": "eagletribune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Eagle-Tribune"}, "authors": [{"uri": "pat_graham@eagletribune.com", "name": "Pat Graham", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassandre_Beaugrand", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cassandre Beaugrand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triathlon", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Triathlon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archery_at_the_2020_Summer_Olympics_\u2013_Women's_individual", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Archery at the 2020 Summer Olympics \u2013 Women's individual"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pont_Alexandre_III", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pont Alexandre III"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Summer Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bronze"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Britain", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Great Britain"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Seine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycling", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cycling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Yee", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alex Yee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hayden_Wilde", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hayden Wilde"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beth_Potter", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Beth Potter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterway", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Waterway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swimming_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Swimming (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marathon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marathon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports/Triathlon", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports/Triathlon", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports/Duathlon", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports/Duathlon", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Triathlon", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Triathlon", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports/Off-Road", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports/Off-Road", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 75}], "image": "https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/eagletribune.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/2/65/2654523d-5b3e-5640-a179-f3c85f7515d6/66a9fa2c8ed03.image.jpg?crop=1763%2C926%2C0%2C124&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9778243", "eventUri": "eng-9778243", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2862745098039217, "wgt": 168, "relevance": 1}

I'm so pleased it paid off.\"\n\nPotter, who raced the 10,000 metres on the track at Rio 2016, said: \"I'm so happy. I was going for the gold but Cassandre and Julie were just too good for me today.\n\n\"It said it was going to be dry but it was obviously very wet.

The four brushed off any semblance of pressure to become the first ever British relay team of the same individuals to defend an Olympic title, and make it a third medal in a row in this event, as GB, and in particular Matthew Richards, put a frustrating few days in the pool behind them.\n\nThis morning, though, Britain's medal hopes are high as Beth Potter, then Alex Yee, finally get their chance to compete in the triathlon after delays owing to pollution levels in the River Seine. Both races have been given the all clear in that regard - ticket logistics in the event not providing any obstacle - and take place back-to-back this morning.\n\nPotter is up first and, following an audacious transition from track running just seven years ago, is favourite as reigning world champion, whilst Alex Yee is a Tokyo silver medallist; he and Sam Dickinson out-qualified GB great Jonathan Brownlee to line up on the pontoon today.", "source": {"uri": "telegraph.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Telegraph"}, "authors": [{"uri": "thomas_jeffreys@telegraph.co.uk", "name": "Thomas Jeffreys", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beth_Potter", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Beth Potter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Britain", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Great Britain"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Seine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Yee", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alex Yee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flora_Duffy", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Flora Duffy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triathlon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Triathlon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bermuda", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bermuda"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bermuda"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Richards_(swimmer)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Matt Richards (swimmer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Dean_(swimmer)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tom Dean (swimmer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duncan_Scott_(swimmer)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Duncan Scott (swimmer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Guy_(swimmer)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "James Guy (swimmer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Dickinson_(triathlete)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sam Dickinson (triathlete)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonny_Brownlee", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jonny Brownlee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Silver medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_and_field", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Track and field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Precious_Metals", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Precious Metals", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 76}], "image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/olympics/2024/07/30/TELEMMGLPICT000387678973_17223767467270_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqJJEJgKLX0rrxNoIATWjBZbeHsZFrEmHQDi0eQN40zhg.jpeg?impolicy=logo-overlay", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9778243", "eventUri": "eng-9778243", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.5607843137254902, "wgt": 160, "relevance": 1}

Let's say clean enough, and leave it at that.\n\nAt 3:30 a.m., Olympic organizers, and representatives of a regional environmental agency, the City of Paris and the prefecture of the Ile-de-France region performed the test that the Seine has been failing since the weekend downpour that soaked the opening ceremony and sent untold gallons of fresh sewage into the urban waterway.\n\nUnlike the previous three days, when organizers canceled two training swims and postponed the men's race for 27 hours, this time the river passed, probably not with flying colors, but with the levels of E.Coli and enterococci under the threshold that health officials and the world governing bodies for triathlon and swimming have set for open-water competition.\n\nAnd so, with the sound of a high-pitched bleep, they set off, the thrashing through the murky gray-brown waters on a day when the real hazards turned out to be the slick roads that caused a series of spills as cyclists tried to navigate the tight turns of perhaps the most picturesque of urban courses. The roads were so slippy that the slightest nudge of a wheel sent racer after racer crashing to the pavement.\n\nThe Eiffel Tower and the Grand Palais loomed above the 1,500-meter swim. They cycled past the the Musee D'Orsay and the Assemblee National. The Arc de Triomphe flashed within sight as they zipped onto the Champs-Elys\u00e9es during the seven loops that comprised the 25-mile ride. And they hit many of the hot spots once more during the 6.2 mile run.\n\nThis was one of those moments organizers had dreamed of when they first designed the plan for these Games a decade ago - unmatched competition through the heart of Paris, a video postcard from one of the world's most breathtaking cities - and hopefully no one gets sick from ingesting too much of that river water.\n\nTo the racing: Flora Duffy of Bermuda, the defending Olympic champion led a tight lead pack by a hair after the swim, the segment that is more about survival and trying to put some hurt on competitors than establishing leads. The cycling leg brought some thinning, with Duffy sharing the work at the front with Maya Kingma of the Netherlands, Georgia Taylor-Brown of Britain and the hometown favorite, Cassandre Beaugrand of France.\n\nStill the way triathlon has evolved, with more and more standout runners migrating to the sport and learning to swim and cycle adequately enough to get to the final leg, this race was always going to come down to the run. After 82 minutes, Julie Derron of Switzerland slipped on her running shoes and led the race into its final segment.\n\nTaylor Spivey of the U.S. was the first of the contenders to slip off the back of the pack. Duffy, who needed to push the pack harder on the bike but wasn't able to, and Taylor-Brown, fell off by the end of the first loop, as a lead group of four separated from everyone else.\n\nAs it so often does, that made for some cruel Olympic math. Four contenders, three medals, with two frenchwomen, Beaugrand and Emma Lombardi hanging with Derron and Beth Potter of Britain, as legs all over the course began to turn to goo.\n\nDerron ran without fear, sticking to the front on a still, thick morning with no headwind to worry about, her stride smooth, her shoulders steady. Beaugrand edged onto her shoulder with two miles with Potter and Lombardi trailing stubbornly behind as the bell sounded, signifying the final loop.\n\nThen Beaugrand made her move. Coming in, one of the big questions other than the health of the river was whether the racing in front her home fans would inspire Beaugrand or whether the pressure would prove too heavy a burden.\n\nIn the final mile, with thousands of flags waving and the noise building in the hear to of the city, Beaugrand left no doubt, surging, three then seven then 10 and 20 meters ahead and grabbing the tape at the finish and pulling it to her face before collapsing onto the carpet. Derron took the silver. Potter nabbed the bronze.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "matthew_futterman@nytimes.com", "name": "Matthew Futterman",

Beaugrand of France has won the women's Olympic triathlon gold medal as the sport could finally set aside days of uncertainty due to water quality concerns.\n\nOn the last of four laps in the 10km run, Beaugrand broke clear of compatriot Emma Lombardi, Swiss Julie Derron and Great Britain's Beth Potter.\n\nBeaugrand, the top French hope, won the 1.5km swim, 40km cycle and 10km run event in one 54 minutes 55 seconds.\n\nDerron finished six seconds behind for silver and Potter was another nine seconds adrift for bronze, with Lombardi fourth.\n\nSophie Linn was the first Australian finisher in 21st and Natalie van Coevorden was 42nd out of 51 finishers.\n\nWhile the swim went ahead, a strong current in the River Seine made it tough for the women.\n\nTokyo Games winner Flora Duffy from Bermuda led the field out of the water, but she was soon caught by the chasers.\n\nAs with the road time trials on day one of the Games, rain made conditions treacherous on the bike and several triathletes crashed.\n\nThe four leaders cleared out at the start of the run, with Beaugrand making her gold-winning move with about 2km left.\n\nAfter days of delays and uncertainty over water quality in the River Seine, race day dawned with World Triathlon announcing \"we will swim\" on social media through its X channel.\n\nFinally, the Olympic triathlons are going ahead.\n\nParis Games organisers said early on Wednesday that latest tests of the water showed compliance with quality standards, allowing the swims to be held in the river.\n\nThat was despite overnight rain, which persisted until shortly before the women's start at 8am (4pm AEST).\n\nElevated levels of bacteria in the river had pushed the men's race from Tuesday to Wednesday at 10.45am, after the women.\n\nSwim familiarisation sessions on Sunday and Monday at the race site were cancelled\n\nAustralians Matt Hauser and Luke Willian should be at the pointy end of the men's race.\n\nAsked four days ago if he would swim in the Seine, regardless of the water quality, Hauser replied \"bloody oath\".\n\nChanging Wednesday's races to duathlons - run-bike-run - would have been a nightmare scenario for organisers, especially as more than one billions euros ($A1.7 billion) has been spent on improving water quality in the Seine as a major Olympics legacy project.\n\nThey have been steadfast in their insistence that the swimming portion of the triathlon and the marathon swimming events next week could safely be held in the river.\n\nThe water quality in the Seine is directly affected by rainfall that can lead to wastewater runoff flowing into the river.\n\nHeavy rains fell during Friday's Olympic opening ceremony, and rain continued for most of the day on Saturday.", "source": {"uri":

Organizers have been steadfast in their insistence that the swimming portion of the triathlon and the marathon swimming events next week could safely be held in the river.\n\nA steady rain subsided just before the triathletes dove into the water.\n\nAP Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/2024-paris-olympic-games", "source": {"uri": "register-herald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Beckley Register-Herald"}, "authors": [{"uri": "pat_graham@register-herald.com", "name": "Pat Graham", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triathlon", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Triathlon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Seine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassandre_Beaugrand", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cassandre Beaugrand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycling", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cycling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beth_Potter", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Beth Potter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pont_Alexandre_III", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pont Alexandre III"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bronze"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marathon_swimming", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marathon swimming"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterway", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Waterway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swimming_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Swimming (sport)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Water_Resources", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Water Resources", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports/Triathlon", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports/Triathlon", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Triathlon", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Triathlon", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 50}], "image": "https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/register-herald.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/5/90/5901f242-203a-533e-bfb4-37be629eb6ed/66a9f7eeb07c4.image.jpg?crop=1763%2C926%2C0%2C124&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9778243", "eventUri": "eng-9778243", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 154, "relevance": 1}

cancelled and the men's event was postponed due to water pollution in the river Seine.\n\nBut as organisers controversially gave the go-ahead for the race to take place, the British contingent hoped to add more medals following a strong Monday and Tuesday showing from Team GB.\n\nThe world champion emerged from the 1.5km swimming leg of the event 20 seconds off the lead of Bermuda's Flora Duffy and down in fifth place.\n\nTricky conditions in the 40km bike ride saw a number of riders fall off their bikes as they tried to navigate the Paris cobbles.\n\nA fall for Brazil's Lopes Vittoria Lopes saw Potter forced to quickly weave out of the way to avoid crashing while going round one corner.\n\nThe 32-year-old showed great skill to power on and get herself to the front of the pack as a number of other riders also fell victim to the weather - with Luxembourg's Jeanne Lehair left in tears at the road side as she retired from the race.\n\nShe then vied for the lead with Duffy in the leading pack, which fellow Brit Georgia Taylor-Brown had also managed to bring herself into.\n\nPotter kept herself in the medal mix in the leading pack for the remainder of the bike leg alongside Taylor-Brown.\n\nThe changeover from the bike to 10km run then saw them manage to keep pace with the leading pack, with Potter close on the heels while Taylor-Brown dropped off.\n\nBEST FREE BET SIGN

The previous winners were Brigitte McMahon (gold in 2000), Nicola Spirig (gold in 2012 and silver in 2016) and Magali Messmer (bronze in 2000).", "source": {"uri": "swissinfo.ch", "dataType": "news", "title": "SWI swissinfo.ch"}, "authors": [{"uri": "swi_swissinfo_ch@swissinfo.ch", "name": "Swi Swissinfo.Ch", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triathlon", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Triathlon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Championships_(multi-sport_event)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "European Championships (multi-sport event)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z\u00fcrich", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Z\u00fcrich"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Z\u00fcrich"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beth_Potter", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Beth Potter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassandre_Beaugrand", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cassandre Beaugrand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valencia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Valencia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Valencia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Britain", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Great Britain"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magali_Messmer", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Magali Messmer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_of_athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sport of athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brigitte_McMahon", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brigitte McMahon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycle_sport", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cycle sport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicola_Spirig", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nicola Spirig"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Silver medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports/Triathlon", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports/Triathlon", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports/Duathlon", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports/Duathlon", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Triathlon", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Triathlon", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports/Off-Road", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports/Off-Road", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://www.swissinfo.ch/content/wp-content/uploads/sites/13/2024/07/621878804_highres.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9778243", "eventUri": "eng-9778243", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3960784313725489, "wgt": 148, "relevance": 1}

This day has been in the calendar for a long time, so to come away with a medal - I'm just over the moon.\n\n\"Gold was on my mind but I got a medal, so there are no complaints. It was a wall of noise out there, there was not one part of that course that was quiet.\n\n\"I've come a long way in eight years and I really feel like I did this for me and for those who believed in what I was doing switching sports.\n\n\"The Brownlees have been a massive part of my journey. They're the reason I moved to the triathlon. I train with Alistair day in, day out, and he's such a big part of my story.\n\n\"I moved in with Jonny when I first moved to Leeds too. They're always the first to message me before and after races and it means so much to know that I have the support of them.\"\n\nThe water quality in the Seine has been the talking point of recent days, despite the high-profile efforts of French authorities to clean it up at a reported cost of \u00a31bn.\n\nThe men's race was already delayed 24 hours and Potter and team-mates Georgia Taylor-Brown, who finished sixth, and Kate Waugh went to bed last night not knowing whether they'd race in the morning.\n\nOrganisers got their wish, the race a two-hour television showcase for Paris' postcard landmarks, a grand stage for a French leading lady, who crossed the line on the Pont Alexander III to cheers that rumbled across the city.\n\nBut the question remains at what cost?\n\nThe staging of the Games has forced politicians to finally act on the embarrassing water quality of the Seine, where swimming has been banned since 1923 due to pollution levels.\n\nBut many of these athletes are due to race again in next week's team event - if they can stay healthy.\n\nTaylor-Brown took a cocktail of pre and probiotics and lined her stomach with peptobismol, she'd barely caught her breath before she was gurgling mouthwash.\n\nFrance and Great Britain look the ones to beat in the team event, with Taylor-Brown and Yee likely to be the only returning members of the gold medal winning quartet from Tokyo.\n\n\"Let's see what the coaches decide but hopefully I'm picked, and we can go again,\" added Potter, who is one of over 1,000 elite athletes on UK Sport's National Lottery-funded World Class Programme, allowing them to train full time, have access to the world's best coaches and benefit from pioneering medical support - which has been vital on their pathway to the Paris 2024 Games. .\n\n\"I'm going to give myself a couple of days to enjoy this and then it's about resetting and going again for the relay.\n\n\"We feel like we've got a really strong team, two in the top six of the women's race proves that. It's nice to have a medal but obviously nicer to have two.\"\n\nWith more than \u00a330M a week raised for Good Causes, including vital funding into elite and grassroots sport, National Lottery players support our Olympic and Paralympic athletes to live their dreams and make the nation proud, as well as providing more opportunities for people to take part in sport.

Get after it with local recommendations just for you. Discover nearby events, routes out your door, and hidden gems when you sign up for the Local Running Drop.\n\nThe prolonged thud of the heartbeat before the starting pistol fires is the typical way elite short-course triathlon races start these days. But on a rainy Wednesday morning in Paris, it could just have easily been the heartbeat of the athletes, officials and organizers - right the way up to Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo. The anxiety and uncertainty around this most unprecendented Olympic triathlon had reached new levels.\n\nAfter four days of trying (two non-starting familiarization swims over the weekend and a postponed men's race on Monday), the now-familiar 3:30 a.m. ritual of waiting for water quality test results finally arrived - this time, with good news.\n\nThe current was also behaving itself enough, having come down below the legal limit of one meter per second. In the end, after months of hand-wringing over the triathlon swim venue, the only change to the 1,500 meter swim course was to allow the triathletes to swim closer to the right bank on each of the two laps.\n\nBut finally athletes were on the pontoon and about to get the show on the road - or, to be more precise, into the much-maligned River Seine. The women's individual triathlon at the Paris Olympics was officially confirmed with an Instagram post from World Triathlon - a welcome bit of news after a stressful few days for athletes.\n\nThe start was messy. At least eight triathletes looked rooted to the pontoon, and it seemed inevitable penalties would be forthcoming; indeed, five athletes - Petra Kurikova (CZE, Djenyfer Arnold (BRA), Vicky van der Mewe (RSA), Melanie Santos (POR), and Xinyuowere Lin (CHN) - were issued fifteen-second penalties.\n\nBut once in the water, things sped up, and quickly. Thanks to the current from the burgeoning River Seine, many are unlikely to have ever moved faster - at least until the first turn buoy. After that, it was a noticeable slog back into the current that had lifted them on the first stretch, with the athletes lining out behind Flora Duffy (BER).\n\nIf ever there was a statement of intent from the reigning Olympic champion, this was it. The Bermudian even had the sense to take a longer arc closer to the moored boats where the current was weakest to gain an additional advantage. At the end of the first 950-meter lap, Duffy had built a three-second lead over Bianca Seregni (ITA), with home favorite Cassandre Beaugrand (FRA) and current triathlon world champion Beth Potter (GBR) just a few meters back. Behind them, the gaps were already huge.\n\nIf the flat bike course wasn't going to split the race up, the swim was certainly going to have a good crack at it.\n\nDuffy completed the second 550-meter lap and arrived into transition with a swim split of 22:05. She zipped through transition and was away on her own with a lead of more than nine seconds over Seregni and 13 seconds over a pack of 14, led by Vittoria Lopes (BRA), Maya Kingma (NED), Potter, and Beaugrand. The pack also contained Americans Kirsten Kasper and Taylor Spivey, Georgia Taylor-Brown (GBR), and Lisa Tertsch (DEU). Further back, almost 90 seconds behind Duffy, was the next pack, containing Rachel Klamer (NED), Jeanne Lehair (LUX), Nina Eim (DEU), among others. Two minutes down were Leonie Periault (FRA) and Taylor Knibb (USA).\n\nHaving been beset by so much injury in recent years, this was a throwback to Duffy's pre-Tokyo days of dominance. Was this a brief glimpse of her glory days, or foreshadowing of what was to come? The next 40 kilometers would decide.\n\nA stellar swim gave Duffy space on the French streets that had been slickened by the early morning rain that eased just in time for race start. Others were not so lucky. Among the early fallers were Lotte Miller (NOR) and Maria Carolina Velazquez Soto (COL). Kirsten Kasper was next to hit the deck, and the crashes continued to mount. At the Tokyo Games, 34 of the 54 women who started didn't finish the individual race. At this stage, the wet cobbles of the Champs-Elyees looked as it might claim even more.\n\nThe beleaguered Miller would go down again a few laps later, and this time call it quits. Soon, she was joined on the DNF list by Manami Iijima (GUM), Lehair, and Ekaterina Shabilina (KAZ), all who withdrew from the race on the bike leg.\n\nIt's likely the wet roads were very much on Knibb's mind, having fallen three times on wet roads in the cycling time trial on Saturday. But if she were to have any hope of a redemption race in Paris, she would need to focus on getting back into the race. The American drove a chasing pack two minutes down on the lead through the first of seven laps.\n\nKnibb wasn't the only one working to bridge a gap. Duffy's daring move out front was done by the end of lap two, and a group of 10 were away and clear. Taylor Spivey was among them, along with the usual suspects of Beaugrand, Potter, Emma Lombardi (FRA) and Tokyo silver medalist Taylor-Brown.\n\nKnibb was putting all her energies into desperately trying to close the gap to the front, but the deficit stubbornly refused to budge, and only Kate Waugh (GBR) and Periault seemed to be able to offer any help in a large chasing pack.\n\nGermany had high hopes heading into the race, particularly with the in-form Tertsch and former junior and Under-23 world champion Laura Lindemann. But with Tertsch stranded in the chase group, Lindemann then crashed upfront, reducing the front group to nine from whom the medals would surely be decided.\n\nDerron was the first to enter T2, with Beaugrand, Lombardi, Potter, and Taylor-Brown close behind. Duffy, Kingma, Spivey, and Kuttor-Bragmeyer rounded out the lead pack, with Lindemann, Knibb, Waugh, Eim, and Tertsch struggling to get within striking distance.\n\nThe gap was 64 seconds by the time the front group reached transition with the luxury of space to whip through a clean transition area. All looked controlled as they headed out for the first of four laps, but Spivey was quickly in trouble and along with Hungary's Zsanett Kuttor-Bragmayer was losing touch with the leaders.\n\nAt the Paris test event last summer, Potter ran a race-best 32:57 to win. As the run began to shape up, it looked like something even better would be needed for anyone to triumph here.\n\nDuffy and Taylor-Brown were the next to fall away from the lead, and by the end of the first lap, only four remained in contention for the title: Beaugrand, Potter, Lombardi, and Derron. Having the Swiss athlete in the mix was a surprise: The former European champion and had won a World Cup in China in April, but had never featured on a World Series podium.\n\nNot that the packed crowd needed any encouragement, but having two French women competing for the podium was certainly keeping the volume up around the course with scenes that were reminiscent of London 2012.\n\nAs the athletes moved into the final 5km, the front four were still shoulder-to-shoulder and that wasn't going to change through the penultimate lap as it looked destined for a sprint finish.\n\nHaving won the previous two World Series races in Cagliari and Hamburg, Beaugrand looked to have prepared perfectly to take France's first individual Olympic medal, and as the race entered the final mile, so it proved. Beaugrand eased away to a rapturous reception, finishing in 1:54:55 ahead of Derron, six seconds behind, and Potter, 15 seconds down.\n\nLombardi would just miss out in fourth, followed by Duffy and Taylor-Brown. Spivey held tough for the best American finish in 10th.", "source": {"uri": "triathlete.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Triathlete"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tim_heming@triathlete.com", "name": "Tim

This day has been in the calendar for a long time, so to come away with a medal - I'm just over the moon.\n\n\"Gold was on my mind but I got a medal, so there are no complaints. It was a wall of noise out there, there was not one part of that course that was quiet.\n\n\"I've come a long way in eight years and I really feel like I did this for me and for those who believed in what I was doing switching sports.\n\n\"The Brownlees have been a massive part of my journey. They're the reason I moved to the triathlon. I train with Alistair day in, day out, and he's such a big part of my story.\n\n\"I moved in with Jonny when I first moved to Leeds too. They're always the first to message me before and after races and it means so much to know that I have the support of them.\"\n\nThe water quality in the Seine has been the talking point of recent days, despite the high-profile efforts of French authorities to clean it up at a reported cost of \u00a31bn.\n\nThe men's race was already delayed 24 hours and Potter and team-mates Georgia Taylor-Brown, who finished sixth, and Kate Waugh went to bed last night not knowing whether they'd race in the morning.\n\nOrganisers got their wish, the race a two-hour television showcase for Paris' postcard landmarks, a grand stage for a French leading lady, who crossed the line on the Pont Alexander III to cheers that rumbled across the city.\n\nBut the question remains at what cost?\n\nThe staging of the Games has forced politicians to finally act on the embarrassing water quality of the Seine, where swimming has been banned since 1923 due to pollution levels. But many of these athletes are due to race again in next week's team event - if they can stay healthy.\n\nTaylor-Brown took a cocktail of pre and probiotics and lined her stomach with peptobismol, she'd barely caught her breath before she was gurgling mouthwash.\n\nFrance and Great Britain look the ones to beat in the team event, with Taylor-Brown and Yee likely to be the only returning members of the gold medal-winning quartet from Tokyo.\n\n\"Let's see what the coaches decide but hopefully I'm picked, and we can go again,\" added Potter, who is one of over 1,000 elite athletes on UK Sport's National Lottery-funded World Class Programme, allowing them to train full-time, have access to the world's best coaches and benefit from pioneering medical support - which has been vital on their pathway to the Paris 2024 Games.\n\n\"I'm going to give myself a couple of days to enjoy this and then it's about resetting and going again for the relay.

More info\n\nBeth Potter has come a long way from the athlete who morosely sipped cocktails from a coconut on the Copacabana eight years ago.\n\nHer career was at an inflection point after a distant 38th place finish in the 10,000m in Rio but a chance meeting in McDonalds and switch of sports was rewarded in Paris with women's triathlon bronze.\n\nPotter won the test event her last year and the world title but this season has failed to make the top step of the podium at global level, claiming she was arriving in Paris flying under the radar.\n\nHer tactics were clear, stay in contention through the swim and stay out of trouble on bike, where greasy cobbled sections were treacherous after heavy overnight rain.\n\nThen she could strike on the run, where, on her day, she's the strongest athlete in the field.\n\nBut she didn't count on France's Cassandre Beaugrand who, roared on by a sea of French tricolours along this made for Instagram course, proved just too strong.\n\nWhen she kicked for home Potter and silver medallist, Switzerland's Julie Derron, simply had no response as she streaked into the distance.\n\n\"They were both too good for me but I'm super happy to come away with bronze,\" said Potter, who is coached by Olympic champion brothers Alistair and Jonny Brownlee, moving to their Leeds training group when she quit track and field.\n\n\"I just relief to be honest. This day has been in the calendar for a long time, so to come away with a medal - I'm just over the moon.\n\n\"Gold was on my mind but I got a medal, so there are no complaints. It was a wall of noise out there, there was not one part of that course that was quiet.\n\n\"I've come a long way in eight years and I really feel like I did this for me and for those who believed in what I was doing switching sports.\n\n\"The Brownlees have been a massive part of my journey. They're the reason I moved to the triathlon. I train with Alistair day in, day out, and he's such a big part of my story.\n\n\"I moved in with Jonny when I first moved to Leeds too. They're always the first to message me before and after races and it means so much to know that I have the support of them.\"\n\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will auto-play soon8Cancel Play now\n\nThe water quality in the Seine has been the talking point of recent days, despite the high-profile efforts of French authorities to clean it up at a reported cost of \u00a31bn.\n\nThe men's race was already delayed 24 hours and Potter and team-mates Georgia Taylor-Brown, who finished sixth, and Kate Waugh went to bed last night not knowing whether they'd race in the morning.\n\nOrganisers got their wish, the race a two-hour television showcase for Paris' postcard landmarks, a grand stage for a French leading lady, who crossed the line on the Pont Alexander III to cheers that rumbled across the city.\n\nBut the question remains at what cost?\n\nThe staging of the Games has forced politicians to finally act on the embarrassing water quality of the Seine, where swimming has been banned since 1923 due to pollution levels.\n\nBut many of these athletes are due to race again in next week's team event - if they can stay healthy.\n\nTaylor-Brown took a cocktail of pre and probiotics and lined her stomach with peptobismol, she'd barely caught her breath before she was gurgling mouthwash.\n\nFrance and Great Britain look the ones to beat in the team event, with Taylor-Brown and Yee likely to be the only returning members of the gold medal winning quartet from Tokyo.\n\n\"Let's see what the coaches decide but hopefully I'm picked, and we can go again,\" added Potter, who is one of over 1,000 elite athletes on UK Sport's National Lottery-funded World Class Programme, allowing them to train full time, have access to the world's best coaches and benefit from pioneering medical support - which has been vital on their pathway to the Paris 2024 Games. .\n\n\"I'm going to give myself a couple of days to enjoy this and then it's about resetting and going again for the relay.\n\n\"We feel like we've got a really strong team, two in the top six of the women's race proves that. It's nice to have a medal but obviously nicer to have two.\"\n\nWith more than \u00a330M a week raised for Good Causes, including vital funding into elite and grassroots sport, National Lottery players support our Olympic and Paralympic athletes to live their dreams and make the nation proud, as well as providing more opportunities for people to take part in sport.

Derron chased her home for silver with Potter taking bronze, leaving Lombardi in the worst position of all.\n\n\"I can't find the words, it's crazy what's happening to me. This morning, I would never have believed it,\" Beaugrand said. \"This morning, I was in total panic. I vomited before the start... It was nerves. It's never happened to me before, and in front of the other athletes. Everyone knew I was stressed.\n\n\"I didn't want to do the same as Tokyo where I was so nervous and where I lost all my faculties.\"\n\nBeaugrand failed to finish in the last Olympics, suffering a puncture on the bike leg, and had the added stress on July 31 of finding out only at 4am that the race would go ahead after the men's event was postponed the previous day due to poor water quality.\n\n\"I told myself 'Cass, you can't go through the same thing as Tokyo again, concentrate, you've been doing triathlon your whole life, it's just another race', she added.\n\n\"Mentality has been my weakness so many times and today it was my strength. After Tokyo, it was not an easy path but I never stopped believing. To do it in front of our crowd was something that had to be done, and I still can't believe it. It was the dream of my life and I fulfilled it.\"\n\nBoth the women's and men's triathlon went ahead after days of suspense over whether the Seine would be clean enough for athletes.\n\nThat the race took place at all was a triumph and relief for organisers who have been sweating on the state of the famed river since last week when the French capital was deluged by rain during the opening ceremony.\n\nThe storm overwhelmed the city's sewerage system despite a recent \u20ac1.4 billion (S$2 billion) upgrade, leading to discharges of untreated faecal matter that sent E.Coli bacteria levels spiking above permitted limits.\n\nBeaugrand also said she \"never doubted\" that the swimming would go ahead despite warnings that it might be cancelled, which would have turned the race into a duathlon of only cycling and running.\n\nAfter the triathlon was given the go-ahead, thousands turned out to witness the competition through Paris' historic streets which were slippery and hazardous after overnight showers.\n\nMany finishers said they had put pollution problems out of their minds as they dived into the Seine from a pontoon in front of the Alexandre III bridge.\n\nThe men began shortly after the finish of the women's race, with the three medallists from Tokyo 2020 - Norwegian Kristian Blummenfelt, Britain's Alex Yee and New Zealander Hayden Wilde - all in contention.\n\nYee won gold this time, passing Wilde in the final stretch of the 10km fun in a dramatic finish, while France's Leo Bergere settled for bronze.\n\nIt looked to be Wilde's victory but the hard pace and heat sapped his energy and Yee, widely regarded as the fastest runner in the field, flew past with 400 metres to go and finished clear.\n\n\"I just have so much respect for Hayden and how much he made me dig for that,\" said Yee, as the two athletes sat down together at the finish line and Wilde congratulated him with an arm around his shoulder.\n\n\"I thought silver was on the cards. And with about 2k to go I thought I'd give it everything I had.

But I left my bag inside the restaurant, and it had my passport and everything in it, I can't leave it, and I went [inside] to get it back.\n\n\"I told the restaurant, 'my daughter [is] dying outside'. He said to me, to pay the bill before you're leaving'.\"\n\nAicha said after spending precious minutes settling the bill she went outside the restaurant to help her daughter who had now used her second Epi-Pen, to no avail.\n\nTearfully she said: \"I'm screaming, there are security guards outside the door, but no one is helping me, nothing.\"\n\nWith the ambulance nowhere to be seen Aicha felt she had no choice but to drive her daughter to the hospital.\n\nBut, tragically, in the 30 minutes it took to get there, Lily had already suffered a heart attack.\n\nShe then suffered from a catatonic fit, which rendered her brain dead, and died on her mother's shoulder.\n\n\"She told me \"I love you, goodbye\" and then passed away,\" her heartbroken mother added.\n\nDoctors kept Lily on life support for three days, but with no brain activity they were forced to pull the plug and let Lily die.\n\nMedical staff spend little time with the King's throughout the horror ordeal.\n\nWhen asked what could have caused her death, they explained the situation in the restaurant.\n\nYet despite this, her cause of death was simply listed as \"heart attack\" on the death certificate and now the Kings fear they will \"never know\" how or why Lily's allergies were flouted by the restaurant.\n\n\"There's no other cause I can imagine that could have caused her to stop breathing,\" Lily's dad said.\n\nLily passed away on June 23 and had two autopsies, one in Morocco and another in England.\n\nHer body was then released to her parents and she was buried in Beaconsfield on July 10.\n\nPaying tribute to their beloved daughter, Mr King said: \"Lily was loved by many, many friends.\n\n\"We had 60 or 70 of her friends and colleagues at the funeral, and they all signed a book of condolences, and they said the most marvellous things about her; how she was a shining light and made everybody laugh, and how she helped them with their problems.\n\n\"She was a very caring girl and very intelligent.\n\n\"With all her problems, she still managed to get to grammar school and get three A-Levels with grades for Exeter University to study Economics.\n\n\"She just got her results for her first-year exams, and she got a first - that was the day before she had this anaphylactic shock.\"\n\nMichael said police in Morocco launched an investigation into the restaurant, but the family haven't been updated on the progress of the case.\n\nHe added: \"It was taken out of the police's hands and it got given to the prosecutor.\n\n\"We were told we would be notified about the next steps.\n\n\"We want to know what's going on, we want to know whether it's going to be brushed under the carpet or whether they're going to do something about it.\"\n\nThe King's have set up a Just Giving page in memory of Lily and to raise money for other allergy sufferers.\n\nThe description section of the page reads: \"Allergies dominated Lily's life, and impeded on her ability to live life

But when Lily came back, she claimed to be unable to breathe.\n\nMrs King told the Mail: 'I started calling the ambulance and we went outside, so she can try to breathe.\n\n'We [used] the Epi Pen. But I left my bag inside the restaurant, and it had my passport and everything in it, I can't leave it, and I went [inside] to get it back.\n\n'I told the restaurant, 'my daughter [is] dying outside'. He said to me, to pay the bill before you're leaving.'\n\nMrs King said after spending vital minutes settling the bill she went outside the restaurant to help her daughter, who by this point had used her second Epi-Pen, to no avail.\n\n'I'm screaming, there are security guards outside the door, but no one is helping me, nothing,' she said through tears.\n\nWith the ambulance nowhere in sight, Mrs King was forced to drive her own daughter to the hospital- but in the 30 minutes it took to get there, Lily had already suffered a heart attack.\n\nShe then suffered from a catatonic fit, which rendered her brain dead, and died on her mother's shoulder.\n\n'She told me \"I love you, goodbye\" and then passed away,' her heartbroken mother added.\n\nDoctors kept her on life support for three days, but with no brain activity they were forced to pull the plug and let Lily slip away.\n\nThey spend little time with the Kings throughout the ordeal, and when asked what could have caused her death, they explained the situation in the restaurant.\n\nYet despite this, her cause of death was simply listed as 'heart attack' on the death certificate, and now the Kings fear they will 'never know' how or why Lily's allergies were ignored by the restaurant.\n\n'There's no other cause I can imagine that could have caused her to stop breathing,' Mr King insisted.\n\nLily died on June 23 and had two autopsies, one in Morocco and another in England, before her body was released to her parents and she was buried in Beaconsfield on July 10.\n\nPaying tribute to their daughter, Mr King said: 'Lily was loved by many, many friends.\n\n'We had 60 or 70 of her friends and colleagues at the funeral, and they all signed a book of condolences, and they said the most marvellous things about her; how she was a shining light and made everybody laugh, and how she helped them with their problems.\n\n'She was a very caring girl and very intelligent.\n\n'With all her problems, she still managed to get to grammar school and get three A-Levels with grades for Exeter University to study Economics.\n\n'She just got her results for her first-year exams, and she got a first - that was the day before she had this anaphylactic shock.'\n\nMr King said police in Morocco launched an investigation into the restaurant, but the family remain in the dark as to the progress of the case.\n\nHe added: 'It was taken out of the police's hands and it got given to the prosecutor.\n\n'We were told we would be notified about the next steps.\n\n'We want to know what's going on, we want to know whether it's going to be brushed under the carpet or whether they're going to do something about it.'", "source": {"uri": "metro.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Metro"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tom_sanders@metro.co.uk", "name": "Tom Sanders", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicken", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chicken"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Arabic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vegetable", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Vegetable"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergy", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Allergy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Exeter", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "University of Exeter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sesame", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sesame"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prawn", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prawn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaphylaxis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anaphylaxis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrot", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Carrot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambulance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ambulance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shellfish", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shellfish"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nut_(fruit)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nut (fruit)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dairy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Economics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fish"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabat", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rabat"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rabat"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Morocco"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morocco", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Morocco"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Morocco"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicken_as_food", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chicken as food"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epinephrine_autoinjector", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Epinephrine autoinjector"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Itch", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Itch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myocardial_infarction", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Myocardial infarction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nausea", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nausea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passport", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Passport"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beaconsfield", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Beaconsfield"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beaconsfield"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 87}], "image": "https://metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/SEC_216084592-8b12.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9798361", "eventUri": "eng-9798361", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-23", "textStart": 3838, "textEnd": 3845}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-10", "textStart": 3990, "textEnd": 3997}], "sentiment": -0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 235, "relevance": 1}

anaphylactic shot, it's like Russian roulette.\n\n'Every time you eat out, especially abroad, you're playing Russian roulette with your life.'\n\nMrs King is adamant that people like Lily with allergies should not be 'locked in the house' but should be able to go out and enjoy a meal in a restaurant and be treated with 'respect'.\n\nThe Kings are in touch with Tanya and Nadim, the parents

Eighteen-year-old Lily King suffered a severe allergic reaction after consuming a \"chicken and chips\" dish. The student was on a week-long trip to Morocco with her mother, Aicha, to celebrate getting top marks in her first year of university, according to reports from the Daily Mail.\n\nOn June 19, the final day of their holiday, Aicha and Lily visited a restaurant and lounge in Rabat they had previously dined at. Aicha, who is Moroccan and speaks Arabic, explicitly informed the waitstaff about her daughter's allergies to dairy, fish, shellfish, sesame, and nuts, and detailed \"what she could and could not eat\", as her husband Michael, 73, told MailOnline.\n\nLily ordered a simple chicken and chips. After taking a bite, she \"developed a severe reaction which saw her vomit and run outside as she battled to breathe\", according to the same source. Her father recounted, \"She got an itchy throat, which developed into sickness, stomach cramps and breathing problems\". He added, \"She used her Epi-pen, which she carried with her at all times\".\n\nTo catch her breath, Lily went outside, but restaurant staff allegedly told the mother that \"she couldn't leave without paying the bill\". Michael King said, \"They delayed her from leaving the restaurant by a few minutes that could have actually saved Lily's life\".\n\nAicha recalled, \"I explained to him [the waiter] in Arabic three times 'Please be careful, she is very, very allergic.' He says 'Yeah no worry, we careful'\". When Lily started getting sick, the mother \"told the restaurant, 'my daughter [is] dying outside.' He said to me, 'to pay the bill before you're leaving'\". Aicha desperately tried to call an ambulance, but with vital minutes slipping away, she was forced to take Lily to the hospital in their car.\n\nMr. King noted it took 30 minutes for Lily to reach the hospital, by which time she had already suffered a heart attack. He stated, \"After the heart attack, she had a catatonic fit which destroyed her brain, and she was basically diagnosed as being brain dead\".\n\nThe parents decided to let Lily go after being told there was no brain function detectable. \"We told them exactly what happened in the restaurant. But on the death certificate that was issued subsequently, they said her cause of death was a heart attack\", they said.\n\nThe father believes that \"her meal must have contained an allergen or suffered some cross-contamination\". He added, \"There's no other cause I can imagine that could have caused her to stop breathing\".\n\nLily had managed her allergies carefully since birth, though they worsened at university, leading to an anaphylactic shock from a burger at a music festival and subsequent kidney infections, though she recovered before her trip to Morocco.\n\nLily died on June 23 and had two autopsies, one in Morocco and another in England, before her body was released to her parents and she was buried in Beaconsfield on July 10. Her father said that Moroccan police launched an investigation into the restaurant, which has since been handed over to the prosecutor. \"We were told we would be notified about the next steps\", he said.", "source": {"uri": "en.yabiladi.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "en.yabiladi.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "latifa_babas@en.yabiladi.com", "name": "Latifa Babas", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabat", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rabat"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rabat"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Morocco"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morocco", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Morocco"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Morocco"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Arabic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicken", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chicken"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sesame", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sesame"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaphylaxis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anaphylaxis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Mail", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Daily Mail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shellfish", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shellfish"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nut_(fruit)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nut (fruit)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dairy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Allergy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fish"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epinephrine_autoinjector", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Epinephrine autoinjector"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Itch", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Itch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cramp", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cramp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myocardial_infarction", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Myocardial infarction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vomiting", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vomiting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambulance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ambulance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catatonia", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Catatonia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain_death", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brain death"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://static.yabiladi.com/files/articles/f768631f2da20473cbce42d9de6e67b020240806173852.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9798361", "eventUri": "eng-9798361", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-19", "textStart": 399, "textEnd": 406}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-23", "textStart": 2867, "textEnd": 2874}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-10", "textStart": 3019, "textEnd": 3026}], "sentiment": -0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 217, "relevance": 1}

After she came back, she said, 'I can't breathe'.\n\n\"I started calling the ambulance and we went outside, so she can try to breathe.\n\n\"We [used] the Epi Pen. But I left my bag inside the restaurant, and it had my passport and everything in it, I can't leave it, and I went [inside] to get it back,\" Aicha claimed.\n\nThe mom allegedly told the restaurant her daughter was 'dying', but was ordered to pay her bill before leaving again.\n\n\"They delayed her from leaving the restaurant by a few minutes that could have actually saved Lily's life,\" Lily's dad said.\n\nLily attempted a second time to use an Epi Pen, but the treatment wasn't enough to stop her reaction.\n\nAicha recalled: \"I'm screaming, there are security guards outside the door, but no one is helping me, nothing.\"\n\nNot able to wait for an ambulance, Aicha took Lily on the 30-minute journey to the hospital. By the time they got there, however, the teenager had already suffered a heart attack.\n\nAicha said her only child 'died on [her] shoulder'.\n\n\"She told me 'I love you, goodbye' and then passed away,\" she said. Lily was 'basically diagnosed as being brain dead', Michael said, but she was kept alive for three days to try and revive her.\n\nEventually, the parents 'had to let her go'.\n\nLily's cause of death was listed by doctors as a heart attack, but the Kings believe some allergen or cross-contamination on Lily's meal must have caused her to stop breathing.\n\nPolice in Morocco have now launched an investigation into the restaurant, though the family are still waiting to hear about next steps.\n\nHoping to warn parents about being cautious on vacation, Michael said: \"People have just got to be very careful and to educate their children about it.\n\n\"We tried our best and we did educate Lily, but she wanted to live.\"\n\nAicha and Michael are now raising money in Lily's memory for the Natasha Allergy Research Foundation, which you can donate to here.\n\nUNILAD has contacted the restaurant for comment.", "source": {"uri": "unilad.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "UNILAD"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lily_King", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lily King"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Allergy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_fries", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "French fries"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morocco", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Morocco"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Morocco"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MailOnline", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "MailOnline"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Exeter", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "University of Exeter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sesame", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sesame"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrot", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Carrot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shellfish", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shellfish"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicken", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicken"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dairy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fish"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabat", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rabat"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rabat"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Morocco"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medication", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Medication"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicken_as_food", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chicken as food"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Itch", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Itch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oil", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olive_oil", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Olive oil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nut_(fruit)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nut (fruit)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauce", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sauce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vegetable", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vegetable"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergen", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Allergen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contamination", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Contamination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Security guard"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 81}], "image": "https://images.ladbible.com/resize?type=webp&quality=70&width=1200&fit=contain&gravity=auto&url=https://images.ladbiblegroup.com/v3/assets/blt949ea8e16e463049/blt67e71d6897913a26/66b4e64a43a50b30dc88cb86/lily-king.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9798361", "eventUri": "eng-9798361", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.09019607843137256, "wgt": 204, "relevance": 1}

difficulties.\n\nA young UK woman has died following an allergic reaction at a restaurant in Rabat, Morocco, during her last night on holiday with her family.\n\nLily King, 18, suffered from a number of severe allergies, and died in her mother's arms during a frantic rush to the hospital in June.\n\nThe university student was nearing the end of a weeks-long trip to the North African nation where her mother is from, after a stressful semester studying.\n\nKnow the news with the 7NEWS app: Download today\n\nThe anaphylactic reaction was the second severe shock she had suffered in less than six months.\n\nLily's parents Michael and Aicha King discovered their daughter \"had a plethora of severe allergies\", not limited to fish, seafood, nuts, sesame and dairy, when she was born, they revealed in a JustGiving fundraiser for the Natasha Allergy Research Foundation.\n\nBut stress had also recently been playing a factor in the severity of Lily's allergic reactions.\n\n\"Life stresses started to impact on her body's ability to cope when there was an allergic reaction,\" her parents said.\n\nHigh levels of stress experienced during year 13, and subsequent stressors during her first year studying economics at Exeter University, impacted her recovery from a serious anaphylactic shock experienced at the beginning of 2024.\n\n\"It brought on a snowball effect of health issues,\" her parents said. \"Lily's body was in severe recovery mode before her fatal shock.\"\n\nLily and her family were holidaying in Morocco to celebrate her achievements and unwind, when they sat down to eat what would be her final meal.\n\nAisha explicitly outlined her daughter's allergies \"three times\" to the restaurant staff in Arabic as she ordered Lily grilled chicken and chips, she told The Sun.\n\nThe dish that came out additionally had vegetables and a sauce on the plate, and Aisha told the outlet she was immediately suspicious of some \"carrots\" which looked like prawns.\n\nBut, after asking the waiter to take it away, the staff assured them that the dish contained none of the substances to which Lily was allergic.\n\nLily began to eat, and shortly after experienced itchiness, nausea and breathing difficulties.\n\nAn antihistamine used to control allergy symptoms, and the two EpiPens the family had on them at the time, were not enough to ease the escalation of her severe reaction.\n\nBefore they rushed to the hospital, the restaurant staff demanded they first pay the bill, The Sun reports.\n\nAn ambulance had been called, but after it failed to appear after some time, they began the 30-minute drive to the hospital themselves, during which Lily, with her head on Aisha's shoulder, suffered a heart attack and a catatonic fit.\n\n\"She told me 'I love you, goodbye' and then passed away,\" Aisha told The Sun.\n\nLily was kept on life support for several days before she was formally declared deceased on June 23 -- a heart attack was named as the official cause of her death, it reports.\n\nPolice in Morocco have reportedly launched an investigation into the restaurant, but Lily's family are unaware of its progress, according to The Sun.", "source":

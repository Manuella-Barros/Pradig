Besides Singapore, she has worked in major financial centres such as Hong Kong, Tokyo and London.\n\nTan joined DBS in 2010 and spent the first three years building the foundations of the wealth management business. She subsequently spent almost equal lengths of time managing the consumer banking/wealth management and the institutional banking businesses, which account for 90% of DBS' income. Tan led the day-to-day efforts to operationalise the bank's digitalisation strategy across the businesses she ran. She has been president commissioner of DBS Indonesia since 2014.\n\nOutside DBS, Tan has served on several boards in government, education and women's leadership and was a nominated member of Parliament in 2012-14. A graduate of Oxford University, she has attended leadership programmes at Harvard and Stanford.\n\nHer appointment is the culmination of a decade-long succession process. A strong field of internal candidates was put through an extended development programme to develop their experience, exposure and skills for the role. They were also benchmarked against potential external candidates. Following the evaluation, Tan was deemed the strongest of all the candidates.\n\nPeter Seah, chairman of DBS said: \"Under Piyush's leadership, DBS has been transformed into a high-performing, high-returns institution recognised simultaneously for stability and innovation. Su Shan's strategic orientation, track record in building businesses, familiarity with technology, leadership ability as well as strong stakeholder management and communication skills make her the ideal successor. Importantly for us, she also embodies the DBS culture. I am pleased that a Singaporean with global experience has emerged as the best candidate to lead an iconic Singapore institution and build on the legacy that Piyush will leave us.\"\n\nGupta said: \"Su Shan has worked closely with me for more than a decade to bring the bank to where it is today. She was instrumental in building the wealth management, consumer banking and institutional banking businesses since she joined, and took personal ownership to operationalise our digitalisation strategy. With her appointment, we can be assured that the trajectory of DBS' transformation will continue well into the future.\"\n\nTan said: \"I am deeply honoured to have been selected to succeed Piyush. Leading the continued transformation of DBS is a tremendous privilege and responsibility. Some months after Piyush joined as CEO, he called to persuade me to join DBS. I responded to that call and quit the foreign bank I was working at the next day. Joining DBS felt like a homecoming - it is the bank I grew up with, and also the company where I first interned. The last 14 years have been a tremendous ride.

In 2021, the Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) became the first department to partner with GOV.UK One Login.\n\nIt's been over a year since we integrated the 'Request a Basic DBS Check' with DBS, so to mark the occasion we sat down with the Basic Digital Service Team in DBS to learn how the programme has changed their service. We discussed how they found partnering with GDS, onboarding to One Login, and what they learnt along the way.\n\nWorking with GOV.UK One Login\n\nDBS helps employers make safer recruitment decisions. One of their key services, 'Request a Basic DBS Check', allows an individual to get a copy of their criminal record check. This check will only show convictions that are not 'spent' - for example, some types of caution will disappear after 3 months.\n\nThis helps employers decide whether applicants are suitable for a role, so a service which is accessible, secure and easy to use is a necessity.\n\nAfter the sunsetting of GOV.UK Verify, GOV.UK One Login approached DBS to be a co-designer of a new identity checking solution. The DBS Product Manager reflected on that initial decision to partner with GOV.UK One Login:\n\nIt was important to understand what the 'Request a Basic DBS check' service would need from GOV.UK One Login, and GDS need to design a product that would be flexible enough to work for multiple services. It was useful to set this context early on as it helped both of us design the respective parts of the user journey.\n\nAllan Robinson - Product Manager, Basic Digital Service Team, DBS\n\nAs a private beta partner, DBS provided invaluable insights into their specific service requirements. This approach not only allowed DBS to tailor their service but also offered One Login a unique perspective. By understanding DBS's objectives, we restructured our onboarding process for departments, assigning dedicated engagement managers to ensure streamlined communication and a personalised experience for each team.\n\nLaying the foundations\n\nFrom the initial co-design process through to private beta, and public beta delivery to ongoing developments, there was a constant exchange of ideas and feedback between DBS and the GOV.UK One Login programme. This level of openness laid the foundation for our success, as it allowed us to continually iterate and improve the service together.\n\nI think being able to understand the roadmap, to be able to prepare for that - there is transparency if things don't go as planned. We continue to keep in touch on Slack etc - it's exactly what you would want in terms of the relationship. It's a big programme, but you still get that direct communication.\n\nAllan Robinson - Product Manager, Basic Digital Service Team, DBS\n\nKey to the GDS and DBS success was building strong relationships. DBS and GDS had regular communication through monthly meetings, facilitated by engagement leads. DBS and GDS also attended user-centred design (UCD) meetings/sessions to catch up whenever there were new designs to share. There were also playbacks and UR sessions to gain insight to design and iterate the service.\n\nThis combination of engagement also ensured that any concerns were addressed promptly and that our shared objectives stayed clear.\n\nCelebrating success\n\nThe integration of GOV.UK One Login into the 'Request a Basic DBS Check' service has significantly improved user experience and efficiency. One of the most notable benefits is the increase in successful online verifications, which has led to a surge in user satisfaction. By leveraging the robust capabilities of One Login, users are now able to complete their DBS checks quickly and with greater ease.\n\nThe efficiency gains from reusing data through One Login have been remarkable. The average time to submit a basic DBS check has been reduced by six minutes. This translates to an astounding total user time saving of 1,814 days in 2023. The higher verification rates facilitated by One Login have also led to an increase in application volumes.\n\nWe're proud that the implementation of GOV.UK One Login into the 'Request a Basic DBS Check' service has driven substantial improvements in user satisfaction, from 81% to 88%, and increased operational efficiency. By reducing the time required for submissions, increasing successful verifications, and ensuring reliable communication through verified contact details, GOV.UK One Login has proven to be a pivotal enhancement in the DBS basic check process.\n\nLooking to future work\n\nGOV.UK One Login has been of great benefit to DBS users and the DBS after only 18 months of live service operation. We are looking forward to the new identity proving journeys and features that One Login has on its roadmap for 2024 and the positive impacts that they will have on our users.\n\nWe intend to take full advantage of the opportunities that they will provide for users with, for example, inclusivity challenges. We will continue to work very closely with One Login colleagues and build on our great relationship to ensure that the end-to-end service journey is as simple, easy and accessible as possible.\n\nAllan Robinson - Product Manager, Basic Digital Service Team, DBS", "source": {"uri": "wired-gov.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "WiredGov"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disclosure_and_Barring_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Disclosure and Barring Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_distribution_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Global distribution system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gov.uk", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gov.uk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GOV.UK_Verify", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "GOV.UK Verify"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_testing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Software testing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortgage_loan", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mortgage loan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slack_(software)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Slack (software)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iteration", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Iteration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streamliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Streamliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transparency_(behavior)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Transparency (behavior)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Software release life cycle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_College_Dublin", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "University College Dublin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_satisfaction", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Customer satisfaction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_experience", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "User experience"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business", "label": "dmoz/Business", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers", "label": "dmoz/Computers", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Customer_Management", "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Customer Management", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Merchant_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Merchant Services", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 75}], "image": "https://www.wired-gov.net/wg/news.nsf/channel-social/DNWA-CPBDWB/$file/dst_social.gif", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9797434", "eventUri": "eng-9797434", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1529411764705881, "wgt": 212, "relevance": 1}

We are looking forward to the new identity proving journeys and features that One Login has on its roadmap for 2024 and the positive impacts that they will have on our users.\n\nWe intend to take full advantage of the opportunities that they will provide for users with, for example, inclusivity challenges. We will continue to work very closely with One Login colleagues and build on our great relationship to ensure that the end-to-end service journey is as simple, easy and accessible as possible.\n\nAllan Robinson - Product Manager, Basic Digital Service Team, DBS\n\nIf you're interested in learning more about GOV.UK One Login, and the way we implement our service with government services, visit our service page.", "source": {"uri": "wired-gov.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "WiredGov"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_distribution_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Global distribution system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gov.uk", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gov.uk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite_television", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Satellite television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GOV.UK_Verify", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "GOV.UK Verify"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disclosure_and_Barring_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Disclosure and Barring Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_testing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Software testing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortgage_loan", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mortgage loan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slack_(software)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Slack (software)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iteration", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Iteration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streamliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Streamliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transparency_(behavior)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Transparency (behavior)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Software release life cycle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Games_as_a_service", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Games as a service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_College_Dublin", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "University College Dublin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_satisfaction", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Customer satisfaction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_experience", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "User experience"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/E-mail", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/E-mail", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Abuse", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Abuse", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 80}], "image": "https://www.wired-gov.net/wg/news.nsf/channel-social/DNWA-CPBDWB/$file/dst_social.gif", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9797434", "eventUri": "eng-9797434", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 209, "relevance": 1}

The board has also appointed Ms Tan as deputy CEO.\n\nBefore joining DBS in 2010, Ms Tan, 56, was managing director at investment banking giant Morgan Stanley. She was also a former Nominated Member of Parliament from 2012 to 2014.\n\nMr Gupta joined DBS in November 2009 after a 27-year stint at Citigroup, where he served as its CEO for Southeast Asia, Australia and New Zealand.\n\nUnder Mr Gupta's leadership, DBS had earned numerous accolades from various industry bodies, including the title of \"World's Best Digital Bank\" in 2016 -- awarded by Euromoney magazine for the bank's efforts in digital innovation.\n\nIt marked the first time an Asian bank won a global accolade from the leading financial publication.\n\nDBS has also consistently provided strong returns to its investors throughout Mr Gupta's tenure.\n\nThe bank currently ranks seventh among the world's 100 largest banks in terms of its return on equity, a key measure of profitability, and ninth in total shareholder returns.\n\nDBS was also the first Singapore Exchange-listed company to cross the S$100 billion mark in market value, which is the number of outstanding shares a company has multiplied by the share's market price.\n\nDespite these achievements, the bank faced some difficulties under Mr Gupta's watch.\n\nDBS suffered a spate of digital disruptions between March and October last year, prompting the Monetary Authority of Singapore to bar the bank from any acquisitions of new business ventures for six months in November 2023.\n\nIn a move to hold management accountable for these disruptions, DBS announced in February this year that Mr Gupta had his variable pay cut by 30 per cent in 2023.\n\nThere was also a problem with DBS' access control servers in 2021, during which customers were unable to access the bank's app and website for two days.\n\nThe servers handle both log-in and payment verification using means like biometrics, authentication tokens and one-time passwords.\n\nIt was the bank's worst disruption since 2010, where a major IT outage took down its computer systems for seven hours, leaving its customers unable to withdraw cash from ATM machines.\n\nAway from DBS, Mr Gupta is also chairman of the board of trustees at Singapore Management University, vice-chairman of the Institute of International Finance, and vice-chairman of the World Business Council for Sustainable Development's executive committee.", "source": {"uri": "todayonline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TODAY"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

In a statement at the time, DBS said his \"broad-based banking experience\" positions him well to grow the franchise, and added that he is known for being a \"well-rounded leader\".\n\n\"Gupta has successfully managed businesses in good and challenging times, and is a seasoned Asia hand,\" the statement said.\n\nMr Gupta was born in India in 1960 and became a Singapore citizen shortly after taking on the role of DBS CEO.\n\nThe top job at DBS was vacant for a few months before Mr Gupta was appointed.\n\nHis immediate predecessor, Mr Richard Stanley, died in April the same year from leukaemia.\n\nThis also happened while the world was trying to recover from the global financial crisis of 2007 to 2008.\n\nBecause of the crisis, banks were distracted and too focused on \"the battles of yesterday\", he said in an interview with the National University of Singapore's Business School in 2015.\n\n\"As a consequence, banks have not thought enough about the battleground of tomorrow. But it is changing - in the last two years, digitisation has now become the number one agenda for most banking CEOs,\" he said.\n\nThings like digital payments, online banking and blockchain technology emerged and became popular during his tenure.\n\nFor example, digital wallet PayLah! was launched in 2014 and now has more than 2 million users.\n\nBoth DBS and Mr Gupta received awards over the years, as a testament to his leadership.\n\nIn 2022, DBS received its fifth \"World's Best Bank\" title from US-based publication Global Finance. It was also named \"World's Best Digital Bank\" by Euromoney in 2018.\n\nMr Gupta was one of the world's top 100 best-performing chief executives in 2019, according to the Harvard Business Review. In 2021, he was named Global Indian of the Year by the Economic Times.\n\nBut his time at DBS was not always smooth sailing.\n\nAs early as 2010, the year after he became CEO, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) criticised the bank for a seven-hour system-wide outage, according to Finextra, a fintech news website based in London.\n\nAll consumer and business banking services and ATM and point of sale transactions went down on Jul 5 that year, and MAS said the bank failed to put in place a robust technology risk management framework.\n\nAfter another day-long outage in March 2023, MAS said the disruption was \"unacceptable\" and that the bank had fallen short of expectations.\n\nIn October that same year, DBS was hit by yet another disruption that affected ATMs and digital services. Citibank services also went down.\n\nThe outage prevented 2.5 million payment and ATM transactions from being completed.\n\nIn November, MAS barred DBS from acquiring new business ventures for six months and instructed the lender to pause all non-essential IT changes for six months.\n\nThis April, MAS said it would not extend the six-month pause, but that DBS must still set aside additional regulatory capital by applying a multiplier of 1.8 times to its risk-weighted assets.", "source": {"uri": "channelnewsasia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CNA"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

As a result of a 30 percent reduction in his variable pay, amounting to SGD 4.14 million (USD 3.12 million), his total compensation decreased from SGD 15.4 million in 2022 to SGD 11.2 million last year.\n\nIn February, Gupta stated that the bank's senior management team was taking responsibility for service disruptions by accepting pay cuts, as DBS had experienced several service disruptions, including a significant one in October 2023.\n\nTan Su Shan, aged 56, brings more than 35 years of experience in various banking sectors, including consumer banking, wealth management, and institutional banking.

Studies referenced within included review articles were additionally screened for relevance.\n\nThis review focused upon qualitative research studies and their use of dental behaviour support (DBS) tools to support dental care. Included studies were restricted to those in English and published since 1997. Screening of studies involved several authors according to pre-agreed inclusion and exclusion criteria. In the event of disagreement, a third author mediated the collaborative discussion.\n\nIncluded studies first provided baseline study information including the type of qualitative research, the population studied and details of the type(s) of DBS under investigation. Then the qualitative data generated by each study, together with any interpretation provided by the authors, was entered onto bespoke data collection forms. A thematic synthesis approach was adopted. The authors generated new themes supported by selected quotations. The methodological quality of each included study was explored through a recognised tool and the level of confidence provided by each study was informed by the GRADE-CERQual assessment process.\n\nTwenty-three studies were included. Most studies used semi-structured interviews, followed by focus groups and a small number of video diaries. For most studies, the focus was upon the dental care of children with a good proportion of these exploring dental general anaesthesia (DGA). Indeed, DGA was the most studied DBS technique. Whilst some studies explored adults' experiences of DBS, none of the included studies centred upon medically compromised or older adults. The review authors identified five themes following data synthesis. These themes included the following areas (abridged and modified from the review paper): trust; information sharing; control and autonomy; perceived treatment success and failure of DBS techniques; and the longer-term impact of DBS techniques upon patients.\n\nQualitative research has more to offer our understanding of DBS techniques and the impact they have upon patient care experience. There is a need for research to explore a wider range of DBS techniques used in isolation or in combination. Patient reported experiences of care should be considered in the development of outcome measures and any related DBS Core Outcome Set.", "source": {"uri": "nature.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Nature"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualitative_research", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Qualitative research"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentistry", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dentistry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EBSCO_Information_Services", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "EBSCO Information Services"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Review_article", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Review article"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embase", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Embase"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PsycINFO", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "PsycINFO"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MEDLINE", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "MEDLINE"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "English language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_collection", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Data collection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methodology", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Methodology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Focus_group", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Focus group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Autonomy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_anaesthesia", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "General anaesthesia"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Medicine/Evidence_Based_Medicine", "label": "dmoz/Health/Medicine/Evidence Based Medicine", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Senses", "label": "dmoz/Health/Senses", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Medicine/Imaging", "label": "dmoz/Health/Medicine/Imaging", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Biofeedback", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Biofeedback", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 56}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9797434", "eventUri": "eng-9797434", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.01960784313725483, "wgt": 167, "relevance": 1}

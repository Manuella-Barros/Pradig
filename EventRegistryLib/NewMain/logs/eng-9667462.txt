The best bit of advice I got to ask you was to eat twice as much as you normally eat.\"\n\nRevealing it was Louis who came up with the advice, William jokingly added: \"I don't have visions of all of you running around with massive red tummies and getting stitches on the pitch. So I think maybe take my youngest's kind of advice with a pinch of salt.\"\n\nEngland's captain Harry Kane quipped: \"I don't think our nutritionist will be happy with that advice.\"", "source":

That has pushed demand for match tickets sky-high with some re-sale websites advertising them for sale for as much as \u00a320,000.\n\nThe ground holds 47,000 people who may have to watch the game beneath its retractable roof as heavy rain is predicted for the city.\n\nThe weather could also force the closure of fan parks in the city and Gelsenkirchen where England played their opener, leaving thousands having to watch the action in bars and caf\u00e9s.\n\nEngland supporters have travelled in huge numbers to Germany for the tournament which kicked off last Friday and ends with the final on Sunday, July 14.\n\nMeanwhile, at home, more than 10 million tuned in to watch the game against Serbia, with TV bosses hoping for even bigger audiences if the team progresses through the tournament.\n\nThe Euro 2020 final, played at Wembley, saw England lose out to Italy on penalties and the audience across both the BBC and ITV hit a peak of 30.95 million, making it the country's highest television audience since the funeral of Diana, Princess of Wales in 1997.\n\nEngland's match winner on Sunday -- Real Madrid's Jude Bellingham -- has been hailed as a champion of England's multi-ethnic society by campaigners against racism in sport.\n\nA joint letter signed by footballers including England's first black player, Viv Anderson, said that Bellingham and his teammates including Arsenal's Bukayo Saka showed the positive legacy of migration and multiculturalism ahead of the 76th anniversary on Saturday of the arrival of the Empire Windrush bringing arrivals from the Caribbean to Britain as part of post-war reconstruction.", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

And the prince may have two things to celebrate this week, as he prepares to mark his birthday on Friday.\n\nWilliam will turn 42 this week, with the occasion expected to be marked with tributes from other members of The Firm.", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri": "susie_beever@mirror.co.uk", "name": "Susie Beever", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William,_Prince_of_Wales", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "William, Prince of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarchy_of_Denmark", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Monarchy of Denmark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankfurt", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Frankfurt"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Frankfurt"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catherine,_Princess_of_Wales", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Catherine, Princess of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princess_Josephine_of_Denmark", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Princess Josephine of Denmark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aston_Villa_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aston Villa F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princess_Beatrice", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Princess Beatrice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princess_Eugenie", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Princess Eugenie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edoardo_Mapelli_Mozzi", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Brooksbank", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jack Brooksbank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_royal_family", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "British royal family"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Tindall", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mike Tindall"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Summer_Time", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "British Summer Time"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ascot,_Berkshire", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ascot, Berkshire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ascot, Berkshire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Jokes", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Jokes", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Monarchy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Monarchy", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Theme_Parks/Legoland", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Theme Parks/Legoland", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 49}], "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article33074680.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_FBL-EURO-2024-MATCH17-DEN-ENG.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9667462", "eventUri": "eng-9667462", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 144, "relevance": 1}

Well fought Denmark \ud83c\udde9\ud83c\uddf0.\"\n\nPrince William, who is an avid soccer fan, is president of the Football Association. His Royal Highness' trip to Frankfurt came a day after his appearance at Royal Ascot. While William did not have his wife by his side at the royal event on June 19, the Prince spent time with his parents-in-law, Carole and Michael Middleton, at Ascot Racecourse.\n\nDays before Royal Ascot, Catherine made her long-awaited return to the spotlight at Trooping the Colour. The Princess of Wales joined her husband and children, Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis, at the King's birthday parade on June 15, marking her first official public appearance of the year.\n\nIn a written message released on June 14, Her Royal Highness -- who began a course of preventative chemotherapy in late February -- shared: \"My treatment is ongoing and will be for a few more months. On the days I feel well enough, it is a joy to engage with school life, spend personal time on the things that give me energy and positivity, as well as starting to do a little work from home.\"\n\nCatherine also expressed her \"hope to join a few public engagements over the summer,\" but noted that she is \"not out of the woods yet.\" The Princess added, \"I am learning how to be patient, especially with uncertainty.

donned patriotic colours as she joined her father King Frederik and Prince William to watch England take on Denmark in the Euros this evening in Frankfurt.\n\nThe Princess, 13, the youngest daughter of Frederik X and Queen Mary of Denmark, wore a red and white striped T-shirt and navy blazer to watch the group stage game, with England disappointing fans in a 1-1 draw.\n\nJosephine, who is fourth in line to the throne behind her twin brother Prince Vincent, accessorised her outfit with necklaces and wore her long brown hair loose.\n\nKeeping a smart casual look, she opted for pale blue jeans and a pin with the Danish flag.\n\nKeeping it cordial despite going head to head, Josephine shook hands with William -who is a distant cousin.\n\nShe later stood between William and her father as the three royals posed for a photograph that was posted on The Prince and Princess of Wales' X (formerly Twitter) account just before the match began.\n\nThe photograph was captioned: 'May the best team win' and illustrated with the flag of Denmark, the flag of England and a football.\n\nSmiling and with her arm around her father, the youngest of the Danish royals looked relaxed in the image.\n\nOn Sunday, Princess Josephine, Prince Vincent and their father posed in Denmark's national team's shirts ahead of the country's first Euro 2024 match.\n\nTaking to Instagram, the monarch, 56, wished the team 'great luck' in their match against Slovenia from the Fredensborg Palace gardens.\n\nThe father-of-four smiled proudly next to his two youngest children and wrote: 'In a little while it starts, and at our place we are just about ready for Denmark's match start.\n\n'My family and I wish @herrerlandsholdet a great luck for the European Championships.'\n\nJosephine was glowing as she smiled for the picture and accessorised her football jersey with an elegant pearl necklace.\n\nMeanwhile, her twin brother Prince Vincent appeared cheerful as he beamed for the group shot.\n\nFrederik looked every inch the proud father as he held his arms around his two youngest children.\n\nQueen Mary of Denmark was absent from the family photograph, along with the couple's elder children, Crown Prince Christian, 18, and Princess Isabella, 17.\n\nQueen Mary's absence comes amid rumours of martial struggles, which date back to last year when King Frederik was pictured enjoying an evening out in Madrid with Mexican socialite Genoveva Casanova.\n\nThe publication of the photos resulted in Genoveva, 47, issuing a statement denying a romantic relationship between herself and the royal and slamming the 'malicious' rumours.\n\nEarlier this month, King Frederik X and Queen Mary of Denmark put on a united front as they marked the 175th anniversary of the Constitution in Copenhagen.",

While she did make an appearance at Trooping The Colour over the weekend, the Palace has clarified that this should not be seen as a return to her royal duties.\n\nAs president of the Football Association, William faced criticism last year for not attending the Women's World Cup final in Australia, where the Lionesses lost to Spain.\n\nIt was the first time the Lionesses had reached the final of a World Cup, and the first time an England football team had competed in a World Cup final since the men's side beat West Germany in 1966.\n\nWilliam reportedly had concerns about the length of the journey, as the game was being played in Sydney, Australia. At the time, he was compelled to issue an apology to the Lionesses following public outrage.\n\nSpeaking alongside Princess Charlotte in adorable footage, the Prince of Wales said: \"We're sorry we couldn't be there in person. We're so proud of everything you've achieved and the millions you've inspired here and around the world.\"\n\nPrince William missed out on attending the third day of Royal Ascot to fly to Germany.\n\nHe attended yesterday alongside his mother-in-law Carole Middleton and Queen Camilla.", "source": {"uri": "thenews.com.pk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The News International"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_anthem", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National anthem"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God_Save_the_King", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "God Save the King"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William,_Prince_of_Wales", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "William, Prince of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_of_Wales", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prince of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "England national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catherine,_Princess_of_Wales", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Catherine, Princess of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_VIII", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Edward VIII"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_Women's_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FIFA Women's World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ascot_Racecourse", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ascot Racecourse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Football_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Football Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princess_Charlotte_of_Wales_(born_2015)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Princess Charlotte of Wales (born 2015)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_Camilla", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Queen Camilla"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carole_Middleton", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Carole Middleton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "West Germany"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sydney"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sydney"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Supplies_and_Equipment", "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Supplies and Equipment", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Competitions", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Fun", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Fun", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Genealogy/Royalty", "label": "dmoz/Society/Genealogy/Royalty", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONMEBOL", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONMEBOL", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 72}], "image": "https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2024-06-20/l_1201872_113626_updates.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9667462", "eventUri": "eng-9667462", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 141, "relevance": 1}

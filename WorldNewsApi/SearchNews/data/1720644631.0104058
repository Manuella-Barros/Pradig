Obi who described the outcome of the country\u2019s recent poll as a \u201cshining example\u201d worthy of emulation, berated the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) for the manner it conducted the 2023 general elections. He noted that it\u2019s in stark contrast to the \u201cshow of shame\u201d that the giant of Africa, Nigeria, presented to the world, when its electoral body couldn\u2019t deliver fair and credible election in 2023. The former Anambra State Governor went on to say the outcome of the South African election demonstrated the robustness and transparency in their system. He also pointed out that the seamless online dissemination of results highlighted their commitment to democratic principles and technological advancement. According to him about 60% of South African voter turnout in their last election, while over 90% of the country\u2019s polling stations opened on time While speaking via a series of posts he shared on his X page on Saturday, Obi wrote: \u201cThe outcome of the recent South African election results remains a shining example of what a transparent and efficient democratic electoral process should look like. \u201cWith about 60% voter turnout, over 90% of polling stations opening on time, and allowing diaspora voting, the results and updates were provided in real-time without any technical glitches during the election. \u201cThis demonstrated the robustness and transparency of their system. The seamless online dissemination of results further highlights their commitment to democratic principles and technological advancement. \u201cThis is in stark contrast to the \u2018show of shame\u2019 that the giant of Africa, Nigeria, presented to the world in 2023. Nigeria\u2019s 2023 election, with less than 30% voter turnout and over 60% of polling stations starting late, no diaspora voting, and plagued by allegations of fraud and widespread irregularities, experienced all forms of glitches despite enormous expenditure to the tune of about a billion dollars (direct allocation of \u20a6313 billion and donor agencies\u2019 support). \u201cThe process has been widely discredited. The differences between the two countries\u2019 electoral processes are both stark and lamentable. South Africa\u2019s Election Results Center, with its state-of-the-art electronic board, showcased results with unparalleled precision and speed. \u201cMeanwhile, Nigeria\u2019s electoral process is mired in controversy and lacks transparency. This glaring juxtaposition is a painful reminder of our country\u2019s ongoing struggles with democratic governance. \u201cIt underscores the urgent need for comprehensive electoral reforms to ensure that our elections are free, fair, and credible. We must learn from South Africa\u2019s example and strive to build a system that restores the people\u2019s faith in our democracy. \u201cThe time for action is now, and we cannot afford to delay any longer in addressing these critical issues for a new Nigeria is possible,\u201d Obi added.", "summary": "<div style=\"margin-bottom:20px;\"><img width=\"521\" height=\"355\" src=\"https://independent.ng/wp-content/uploads/Peter-Obi-CREDIT-X-@Official_Isaaco.jpg\" class=\"attachment-post-thumbnail size-post-thumbnail wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" decoding=\"async\" fetchpriority=\"high\" srcset=\"https://independent.ng/wp-content/uploads/Peter-Obi-CREDIT-X-@Official_Isaaco.jpg 521w, https://independent.ng/wp-content/uploads/Peter-Obi-CREDIT-X-@Official_Isaaco-300x204.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 521px) 100vw, 521px\" /></div>LAGOS &#8211; Mr. Peter Obi, the Labour Party (LP) presidential candidate in the 2023 general elections has commended South Africa for its commitment to credible election.

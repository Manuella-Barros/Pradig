OTHERWISE A LOT OF SUNSHINE OVERHEAD. SO GORGEOUS START OF THE DAY TO THE DAY THERE AS WE SEE THE FIRST LINE OF THE SUNRISE. THIS MORNING. TEMPERATURES RIGHT NOW ARE AT 65 DEGREES. WE HAVE CALM WINDS GOING TO BE THE CASE ALL DAY TODAY, AND VISIBILITY IS GOOD AT CVG. TEN MILES HIGH PRESSURE RIGHT OVERHEAD. SO AGAIN THAT'S GOING TO BE KEEPING THE SKIES CLEAR FOR US AS WE GO THROUGH THIS AFTERNOON. AS IT MOVES EAST. WE'RE GOING TO START TO GET INTO THAT SOUTHERLY AIRFLOW AGAIN. AND THAT'S GOING TO RAMP UP OUR HUMIDITY A BIT AS WE GO THROUGH THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS. I THINK FEELING HUMID TOMORROW, BUT STICKY AND STEAMY INTO TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY AS WE START TO MIX IN MORE STORM CHANCES ACROSS GREATER CINCINNATI TODAY, WE GET A HIGH OF 86. AGAIN. THE HUMIDITY STAYS TOLERABLE, SO IT'S NOT GOING TO BE A BIG FACTOR. THAT HEAT INDEX WON'T BE AS WE GO INTO THE AFTERNOON AND EVENING HOURS TONIGHT, 67 FOR THE OVERNIGHT LOWS. A LITTLE WARMER THAN WHERE WE'RE AT RIGHT NOW. COUPLE OF CLOUDS OVERHEAD AND AGAIN HUMIDITY IS GOING TO START TO BE A LOT MORE NOTICEABLE. AND THAT'S GOING TO BE THE CASE TOMORROW. HOT SUNSHINE. HIGHS IN THE LOWER 90S. SO IT'S GOING TO FEEL LIKE THE MID 90S WHEN YOU FACTOR IN THAT HUMIDITY LIGHT AND VARIABLE WINDS THROUGH THE DAY. SO THAT HEAT'S REALLY I THINK GOING TO BE MORE PRESENT FOR YOU. YOU'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE A BREEZE TO KEEP THE AIR MOVING. SO PLAN ON A LOT OF HOT WEATHER FOR TOMORROW. GOOD DAY FOR THE POOL. FUTURECAST TODAY WILL SHOW A LITTLE BIT OF HIGH CLOUD COVER, MAYBE A COUPLE OF SCATTERED CLOUDS INTO THE AFTERNOON AND EVENING, BUT NONE BRINGING RAINFALL HERE IN CINCINNATI, WE'RE LOOKING AT CLEAR CONDITIONS AS WE HEAD THROUGH TOMORROW MORNING, SO A SUNNY START TO THE EARLY PART OF THE WEEK, AND THEN AS YOU GO TOWARDS TOMORROW AFTERNOON, A LITTLE BIT MORE CLOUD COVER STARTING TO BUILD IN. SO LOOK FOR A PARTLY CLOUDY SKY AS YOU HEAD THROUGH MONDAY AFTERNOON. AND EVENING. WE'RE ALSO CONTINUING TO WATCH BARREL, CURRENTLY A TROPICAL STORM OVER THE WESTERN GULF WITH 60 MILE AN HOUR WINDS. WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN WITH THIS ONE HERE? THIS IS THE LATEST FORECAST AS OF 5 A.M. LOOKS LIKE IT'S GOING TO LANDFALL JUST SOUTH OF HOUSTON AS A CATEGORY ONE HURRICANE WEAKENED A TROPICAL STORM STRENGTH AND THEN EVENTUALLY BECOME A REMNANT LOW AS IT MOVES UP INTO THE OHIO VALLEY. SO WE'RE WATCHING THAT TRACK OF THE STORM. FACT LATEST FORECAST BRING THIS A LITTLE BIT FURTHER NORTH HERE, BUT THE FURTHER OUT YOU GO IN THIS FORECAST, THE LESS CERTAIN IT IS. SO AGAIN, THIS COULD STILL TRACK A LITTLE BIT FURTHER SOUTH INTO THE REGION. OR IT COULD CONTINUE ON ITS TRACK CLOSER TOWARDS CHICAGO. EITHER WAY WE'RE LOOKING AT SOME RAIN OPPORTUNITIES OUT OF THIS STORM AS WE HEAD TOWARDS THE MIDDLE PART OF THE WEEK. SO WE WENT AHEAD AND MADE WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY WEATHER IMPACT DAY FOR RAIN AND STORM CHANCES, AS SOME OF THAT TROPICAL MOISTURE FEEDS INTO THE AREA. ANYTHING THAT WE'RE SEEING UP UNTIL THEN IS GOING TO BE PRETTY MINIMAL. WE'VE GOT A REDS GAME TODAY TOO, SO IF YOU'RE HEADING TO THAT, IT LOOKS REALLY GOOD. FIRST PITCH IS AT 140. 84 DEGREES AT THAT POINT. LAST INNING AT 86. WE'RE GOING TO BE AGAIN WATCHING CHANCES FOR STORMS ON TUESDAY. BUT OUR BIGGER DAYS ARE GOING TO BE WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY. IT'S GOING TO BE HOT, TOO, WITH TEMPERATURES IN THE UPPER 80S. JUST THE CHANCE FOR SOME SHOWERS, MAYBE A RUMBLE OF THUNDER ON FRIDAY.

SO THERE ARE BOTH POSITIVES AND NEGATIVES TO THE FORECAST YESTERDAY. MAYBE IF YOU'RE OUT AT A BASEBALL GAME, IT WAS GOOD NEWS BECAUSE WE DIDN'T GET AS MUCH RAIN AS MAYBE WE WOULD HAVE LIKED. BUT IF YOUR GARDENS BROWN AND CRUNCHY AND YOU NEED TO MOW YOUR LAWN, YOU WISH WE WOULD HAVE GOT THE RAIN, A LACK OF RAIN HELPED US WARM UP BIG TIME YESTERDAY TO 95 DEGREES AT PTI AIRPORT THIS MORNING. WE HAVE SOME EXTRA CLOUDS OUTSIDE, BUT STILL SOME PEEKS OF BLUE SKY. IT'S A REALLY PRETTY MORNING. THIS IS UP IN ENNICE AND ALLEGHANY COUNTY. YOU SEE SATELLITE AND RADAR. WE'RE MAINLY DRY ACROSS THE AREA. MAYBE A LITTLE BIT OF DRIZZLE HERE AND THERE, BUT REALLY FOR THE MOST PART, THINGS LOOKING PRETTY CALM. TEMPERATURES ARE IN THE 70S. ALL THE RAIN IN SOUTHEASTERN VIRGINIA. WE WILL WATCH FOR SOME MORE STORMS TO DEVELOP LATER ON THIS AFTERNOON. THEY'LL BE SCATTERED, MAINLY POPPING UP AFTER LUNCH TIME. THAT'S WHY IT'S A WEATHER IMPACT DAY FOR THOSE HIGHER RAIN AND STORM CHANCES HERE IN THE TRIAD 88 TODAY DOESN'T NOT NOT AS BAD AS 95, RIGHT? SO CERTAINLY FEELING A BIT MORE COMFORTABLE OUTSIDE. STILL WARM AND HUMID, BUT TEMPERATURES ARE CLOSER TO AVERAGE. THE FOOTHILLS MAY BE THE WARMEST SPOT OF OUR THREE FORECAST ZONES TODAY. NEAR 90 DEGREES WITH A SLIGHTLY LOWER CHANCE OF A SHOWER OR STORM, BUT ONE STILL POSSIBLE MOUNTAINS. ANOTHER DECENT CHANCE FOR STORMS OVER THERE IN WESTERN NORTH CAROLINA WITH HIGHS IN THE LOW 80S RIGHT AROUND AVERAGE. SO ACROSS THE BOARD IT'S A PRETTY TYPICAL SUMMERTIME DAY. ASIDE FROM THE GREATER COVERAGE OF SHOWERS AND STORMS IN THE TRIAD LATER ON, THIS IS WHAT THE RADAR MIGHT LOOK LIKE 1:00 WE'VE ALREAD GOT SOME STORMS POPPING UP, ESPECIALLY SOUTH OF I-40, MOCKSVILLE TO LEXINGTON AND ASHEBORO SEEMS TO BE THE FAVORED ZONE WITH OUR FORECAST MODELS FOR THE BEST CHANCE OF STORMS, BUT STILL, WE ALL HAVE JUST ABOUT AN EQUAL CHANCE OF GETTING A DOWNPOUR. HEARING SOME THUNDER AND LIGHTNING LATER ON TODAY. AND THESE STORMS ARE LIKELY TO BE PRETTY SLOW MOVERS, AND THEY COULD DUMP A LOT OF RAINFALL OVER THE SAME AREA, SO WE DO HAVE A LOW END FLASH FLOOD RISK ALONG AND SOUTH OF I-40 TODAY. I KNOW IT'S KIND OF WEIRD TO THINK ABOUT BECAUSE WE'VE BEEN IN A DROUGHT RECENTLY, BUT OUR DRY SOIL CAN ONLY HANDLE SO MUCH WATER AND SO MUCH RAIN SO QUICKLY, RIGHT? SO ALL THAT OTHER ALL THE REST OF THE RAIN HAS TO RUN OFF SOMEWHERE. LOCALIZED FLOODING POSSIBLE WITH SOME OF THESE HEAVIER THUNDERSTORMS THAT TYPICAL SUMMERTIME WEATHER PATTERN CONTINUES FOR THE NEXT, OH, FOUR DAYS OR SO THROUGH THE MIDDLE AND LATTER HALF OF THE WEEK. HIGHS WILL BE IN THE UPPER 80S TO NEAR 90, MAYBE TUESDAY'S RAIN CHANCE A LITTLE BIT LOWER. JUST SOME ISOLATED STORMS POPPING UP, BUT THE REST OF THE TIME PRETTY SIMILAR. JUST COPY AND PASTE FORECASTS FOR THE NEXT FEW DAYS. TAKE A LOOK AT THE TROPICS HERE. THIS IS TROPICAL STORM BERYL JUST NOW FINALLY STARTING TO GET ITS ACT TOGETHER. AS OF THE LATEST ADVISORY, IT'S STILL A TROPICAL STORM WITH 60 MILE PER HOUR WINDS, BUT IT CERTAINLY BEGINNING TO LOOK A LITTLE BIT MORE IMPRESSIVE ON SATELLITE. THE WARM GULF WATERS STARTING TO HELP THINGS OUT A LITTLE BIT, BUT IT'S RUNNING OUT OF TIME. IT'LL LIKELY MAKE LANDFALL EARLY TOMORROW MORNING BEFORE MOST OF US ARE AWAKE. BETWEEN GALVESTON AND CORPUS CHRISTI, TEXAS, AS A CATEGORY ONE HURRICANE. SO SOME BRIEF, BRIEF STRENGTHENING POSSIBLE WITH BERYL BEFORE MAKING LANDFALL AND THEN FROM THERE, AFTER DUMPING SOME RAIN AND GIVING TEXAS A GOOD THUMPING TOMORROW MORNING, IT'LL KIND OF GET INGESTED INTO OUR WEATHER PATTERN AND LOSE ITS TROPICAL CHARACTERISTICS. BUT THAT STORM SURGE POSSIBLE FROM CORPUS CHRISTI UP TO BAY CITY, JAMAICA BEACH, TEXAS, AND GALVESTON, MAYBE EVEN 4 TO 6FT OF STORM SURGE. SO NOT NOT A HUGE RECORD SETTING SYSTEM AT LANDFALL, BUT STILL A BIG TIME POTENTIAL IMPACTS THERE FOR TEXAS. AND THEY'LL GET A LOT OF RAIN FROM BERYL TWO, MAYBE EVEN 4 OR 5IN FROM BRYAN TO HOUSTON AND IN GALVESTON AS WELL. SO A BIG SYSTEM FOR TEXAS. THEY'LL LIKELY BE IMPACTED BY BERYL TOMORROW MORNING. SCATTERED STORMS HERE AT HOME, UPPER 80S, LOW 90S FOR THE NEXT SEVEN DAYS, DAILY CHANCE OF STORMS.

I WILL SAY TODAY WE'LL SEE SOMEWHAT OF A RELIEF IN THE TEMPERATURES. IT'S STILL GOING TO BE VERY HUMID AND STILL GOING TO FEEL MORE LIKE THE UPPER 90S TODAY. FOR US. BUT WE'LL SEE A LITTLE BIT OF A RELIEF IN THE FORECAST FOR US AS WE LOOK AT OUR LIVE SUPER DOPPLER FOUR. WE ARE DRY FOR THE TIME BEING. WE'VE GOT A LITTLE BIT MORE CLOUD COVER, SO YOU CAN EXPECT A MIX OF SUN AND CLOUDS. THE FIRST HALF OF THE DAY. BUT ONCE WE MOVE ON INTO THIS AFTERNOON, SOME VERY BENEFICIAL RAINFALL IS GOING TO BE MOVING OUR WAY. NOW AS FAR AS OUR TEMPERATURES GO. FOR MOST OF US, WE'RE GOING TO BE TOPPING OUT IN THE 80S. THIS IS A BIG DIFFERENCE COMPARED TO WHERE WE WERE JUST A COUPLE OF DAYS AGO. FRIDAY, GSP TOPPED OUT AT 101 DEGREES. WARMEST DAY OF THE YEAR, ALSO BREAKING THE DAILY RECORD FOR THE TEMPERATURE ON FRIDAY. SO VERY BIG DIFFERENCE FROM OUR TEMPERATURES FROM 101 TO THE 80S. HOWEVER, IT IS GOING TO COME WITH HUMID CONDITIONS AND AN OPPORTUNITY FOR SOME SCATTERED SHOWERS AND STORMS. WE NEED THIS RAIN THOUGH, SO THIS IS GOING TO BE BENEFICIAL FOR US, BUT IT MIGHT IMPACT SOME OF YOUR SUNDAY PLANS AS WE TIME THINGS OUT. THOUGH NICE AND DRY THROUGH THE FIRST HALF OF THE DAY. ONCE WE MOVE ON INTO ABOUT TWO, THREE, 4:00 OR SO, WE START TO SEE SOME OF THE SCATTERED ACTIVITY BEGINNING TO DEVELOP ACROSS WESTERN NORTH CAROLINA. NOW, SINCE IT IS A SUMMERTIME, THERE'S ALWAYS THAT POSSIBILITY THAT ANY STORM THAT DOES DEVELOP COULD BECOME STRONG TO SEVERE. SO THAT'S GOING TO BE SOMETHING WE'LL WATCH VERY CLOSELY AS WE MOVE ON INTO THIS AFTERNOON. BUT ONCE WE GET CLOSER TOWARDS SIX, SEVEN, EIGHT, EVEN 9:00, WE ARE LOOKING AT THE POTENTIAL FOR A LITTLE BIT MORE NUMEROUS ACTIVITY DEVELOPING ELSEWHERE. SO AGAIN, THIS COULD POTENTIALLY IMPACT MAYBE YOUR DINNER PLANS OR IF YOU'RE GOING TO BE OUT AND ABOUT A LITTLE BIT LATER IN THE EVENING, NOT GOING TO BE A WASHOUT ALL DAY. WE WILL SEE SOME DRY TIME, BUT IT'S GOING TO BE ONE OF THOSE DAYS WHERE IT'S VERY HIT OR MISS TYPE OF ACTIVITY. AGAIN, ANY BIT OF RAIN IS GOING TO BE VERY BENEFICIAL ONCE WE GET CLOSER TOWARDS MIDNIGHT AND THEREAFTER A LOT OF THIS ACTIVITY WILL DIMINISH. AND THEN WE ARE LOOKING AT VERY, VERY SIMILAR SET UP. MOVING ON INTO NEXT WEEK. QUIET START. AND THEN THAT ACTIVITY BUILDS ON IN TOWARDS THE AFTERNOON AND THE EVENING. VERY TYPICAL SUMMERTIME PATTERN FOR US NOW. ALSO SOMETHING WE ARE TRACKING IS THE TROPICS. WE HAVE TROPICAL STORM BERYL. THIS HAS BEEN QUITE THE SYSTEM OVER THE LAST WEEK. WHAT WAS A CATEGORY FIVE HURRICANE HAS SINCE WEAKENED TO A TROPICAL STORM ONCE IT MOVED OVER THE YUCATAN PENINSULA. IT'S ABOUT TO MAKE A SECONDARY LANDFALL RIGHT TOWARDS CORPUS CHRISTI IN THE NEXT 24 HOURS. RIGHT NOW, SUSTAINED WINDS OF 60MPH PUSHING TOWARDS THE NORTHWEST AT ABOUT 12MPH. AGAIN EXPECTING TO MAKE LANDFALL IN THE NEXT 24 HOURS AS A CATEGORY ONE. SO IT WOULD ACTUALLY STRENGTHEN IN THE NEXT DAY OR SO. AND THEN GRADUALLY LIFT ITS WAY TOWARDS THE NORTH AND EVENTUALLY TOWARDS THE NORTHEAST. EVENTUALLY FIZZLING ON OUT. SO NO DIRECT IMPACTS FOR US HERE LOCALLY, BUT WE ARE GOING TO CONTINUE TO KEEP YOU POSTED ON THE TROPICS NOW HERE LOCALLY THOUGH, WE ARE TRACKING THE POTENTIAL FOR SOME SCATTERED SHOWERS AND STORMS THIS AFTERNOON AND YET AGAIN TOMORROW, AND MUCH OF NEXT WEEK. IN FACT, ALMOST DAILY CHANCES FOR SHOWERS AND STORMS. WE NEED THIS RAIN, SO THIS IS GOING TO BE VERY BENEFICIAL.

YEAH. BIG STORM. BRIAN AND I WERE HERE TRACKING IT ALL MORNING. IT MADE LANDFALL RIGHT ABOUT 5:00 EARLY THIS MORNING, EASTERN TIME. AND WHEN I TELL YOU THIS WAS ONE OF THE MOST IMPRESSIVE CATEGORY ONE HURRICANE I'VE SEEN IN A LONG TIME. YES, THIS THING WAS INTENSIFYING, LIKE, RIGHT UP UNTIL IT MADE LANDFALL. SO WE'RE WE'RE LUCKY THAT IT DIDN'T HAVE MORE TIME TO STRENGTHEN OVER THE WARM WATER. NOW IT'S BEGINNING TO WEAKEN, BUT IT'S STILL AN IMPRESSIVE STORM, AND ONE YOU MAY REMEMBER WAY BACK WHEN A FEW DAYS AGO, WHEN IT WAS OVER THE CARIBBEAN SET A BUNCH OF RECORDS FOR ONE OF THE STRONGEST AND EARLIEST STORMS ON RECORD IN THE ATLANTIC. SO NOW TROPICAL OR NOW BERYL HAS BEEN DOWNGRADED TO A TROPICAL STORM. BUT THIS WINDS ARE STILL AT ABOUT 70MPH AS IT MOVES NORTH OF HOUSTON NOW AND UP THROUGH EASTERN TEXAS. THIS IS WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE ON RADAR. JUST A FASCINATING RADAR LOOP HERE. THESE YELLOW BOXES, THOSE ARE TORNADO WATCHES BECAUSE AS THE REMNANTS OF BERYL MOVES UP THROUGH PARTS OF EASTERN TEXAS AND WESTERN LOUISIANA, THAT EXTRA SPIN IN THE ATMOSPHERE, THERE COULD BE SOME ISOLATED TORNADOES IN THE DEEP SOUTH TODAY. AND THOSE GREEN BOXES OVER THERE ARE FLOOD WATCHES BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY THERE'S GOING TO BE A LOT OF HEAVY RAIN AS THE REMNANTS OF BERYL CONTINUE MOVING UP THROUGH EASTERN TEXAS AND INTO ARKANSAS, MISSOURI, AND EVEN PARTS OF THE OHIO VALLEY, AS WELL. LOTS OF RAINFALL WITH THIS SYSTEM, THIS ONE'S A BIG DEAL. NOT NECESSARILY RECORD BREAKING FOR TEXAS. THEY'VE HAD WORSE, BUT JUST TO BE A CATEGORY ONE STORM, THIS THING WAS PRETTY IMPRESSIVE. LOTS OF 80 AND 90 MILE PER HOUR WIND GUSTS RECORDED IN THE HOUSTON AREA, AND MILLIONS OF FOLKS WITHOUT POWER IN THAT PART OF THE COUNTRY. SO BERYL WILL CONTINUE TO MOVE OFF TO THE NORTH AND EAST AS WE GO THROUGH THE DAY TODAY. AND TOMORROW AS WELL, BRINGING THE RISK OF SEVERE WEATHER TO THE OHIO VALLEY. WE WON'T HAVE ANY DIRECT IMPACTS FROM BERYL HERE IN THE CAROLINAS, ASIDE FROM EXTRA MOISTURE IN OUR AIR, AND ALSO THAT WILL HELP TO INCREASE OUR RAIN AND STORM CHANCES. THE NEXT FEW AFTERNOONS. BUT ASIDE FROM THAT, BERYL, FOR THE MOST PART LEAVING US ALONE. SPEAKING OF RAIN, WE GOT A GOOD CHUNK YESTERDAY, RIGHT? THE BEST RAIN WE'VE HAD IN QUITE SOME TIME. DAVIDSON AND RANDOLPH COUNTIES GOT THE BEST OF IT. THEY'RE THE BIG WINNERS AT PTI AIRPORT. WE ALMOST GOT AN INCH AND THAT BRINGS OUR RAINFALL TOTAL FOR THE MONTH OF JULY TO JUST OVER THREE INCHES, WHICH IS RUNNING ABOVE NORMAL. YOU KNOW, OUR MONTHS HAVE KIND OF FLIP FLOPPED. JUNE WAS VERY DRY, MAY WAS REALLY WET AND IT LOOKS LIKE JULY IS SHAPING UP TO BE ANOTHER WET MONTH AS WELL. SO THIS SHOULD HELP WITH THE DROUGHT. NOT COMPLETELY WIPE IT AWAY, BUT IT'LL HELP THINGS OUT. WE HAVE THE CHANCE TO GET SOME MORE RAIN OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF AFTERNOONS. THE CLOUDS THIS MORNING HAVE, FOR THE MOST PART, KEPT TEMPERATURES IN CHECK. WE'RE IN THE LOW TO MID 80S OUTSIDE HERE AT LUNCHTIME. 86 IN REIDSVILLE FOR THE REST OF THE DAY I EXPECT US TO WARM UP PERHAPS A BIT MORE, MAYBE A FEW MORE DEGREES, BUT WE SHOULD STILL BE A DEGREE OR TWO BELOW AVERAGE FOR THIS TIME OF YEAR. MID TO UPPER 80S IN THE PIEDMONT TRIAD WILL WATCH FOR A COUPLE MORE ISOLATED STORMS TO DEVELOP LATER ON THIS AFTERNOON, AS WELL. RAINFALL CHANCES NOT AS HIGH AS THEY WERE YESTERDAY, BUT STILL THERE IS THE CHANCE FOR A COUPLE ISOLATED STORMS POPPING UP. AND AGAIN NEAR 87 IN THE FOOTHILLS AS WELL. THE MOUNTAINS TODAY LIKELY ANOTHER ONE IN THE LOW TO MID 80S FOR US THERE WITH A CHANCE FOR A FEW SCATTERED STORMS POPPING UP LATER ON ACROSS THE BOARD. TEMPERATURES ARE PRETTY CLOSE TO AVERAGE FOR TODAY. IT'S NOT THAT BAD OF A JULY AFTERNOON. YOU SEE COVERAGE OF STORMS LATER TODAY FAIRLY ISOLATED. WE'LL WAKE UP AND DO IT ALL OVER AGAIN ON TUESDAY AFTERNOON. RIGHT ABOUT THAT 40, 30 OR 40% CHANCE. WEDNESDAY RAIN CHANCES BEGIN TO INCREASE JUST A BIT WITH A WITH A STALLED BOUNDARY IN THE AREA MOVING IN AND THE REMNANTS OF BERYL PASSING TO OUR NORTH AND WEST, THAT SHOULD ADD A BIT MORE MOISTURE TO THE ATMOSPHERE. SO HERE'S OUR SEVEN DAY FORECAST. THAT SUMMERTIME WEATHER PATTERN CONTINUES WARM AND HUMID EACH DAY, WITH A CHANCE FOR STORMS WEDNESDAY, THURSDAY, AND FRIDAY LOOKS TO BE OUR BEST CHANCE, AND THAT WILL GIVE US A BREAK FROM THE HEAT AS WELL.", "source": {"uri": "wxii12.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WXII"}, "authors": [{"uri": "dylan_hudler@wxii12.com", "name": "Dylan Hudler", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts":

NOW IT'S TIME FOR ANOTHER CHECK ON OUR FIRST WARNING WEATHER. BECAUSE TODAY IS AN IMPACT DAY. BUT DEREK AND I WERE JUST SITTING HERE TALKING ABOUT ESSENCE FEST AND ALL THE YOU KNOW, WONDERFUL THINGS THAT PEOPLE CAN GET INTO THIS WEEKEND. TODAY IS THE LAST DAY. YOU KNOW, IT'S JUST GOING TO BE HOT OUT THERE. SO WE GOT TO MAKE SURE TO STAY HYDRATED FOR SURE. AND YOU KNOW, WE'RE ALSO TALKING ABOUT THE POTENTIAL OF SEEING SOME THUNDERSTORMS AS WE HEAD INTO NEXT WEEK HERE TO LIVE. LOOK AT THE SATELLITE AND RADAR. OVER THE LAST SIX HOURS, THINGS HAVE DEFINITELY STAYED ON THE DRY SIDE. BUT LOOKING AT SOME CLOUDS MOVING IN FROM SOUTH TO NORTH, THAT'S ACTUALLY ASSOCIATED WITH TROPICAL STORM BERYL JUST OFF TO THE SOUTHWEST OF US, YOU CAN SEE THE RAIN BANDS ORGANIZING HERE AND MOVING CLOSER TOWARDS THE COAST AND ALSO THE STORM IS BEGINNING TO SHOW SIGNS OF STRENGTHENING BECAUSE WE'RE SEEING SOME COLDER CLOUD TOPS HERE AS WELL WITH SOME OF THOSE SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS, WHICH INDICATES A THAT THERE COULD BE SOME INTENSIFICATION GOING ON. RIGHT NOW WE HAVE HURRICANE AND TROPICAL STORM WARNINGS IN EFFECT FOR THE COAST OF TEXAS. THE HURRICANE WARNINGS ARE MAINLY IN EFFECT NEAR THE COAST AND THE IMMEDIATE COAST, AND ALSO A LITTLE BIT FURTHER INLAND. WE HAVE THOSE TROPICAL STORM WARNINGS ALSO IN EFFECT HERE AS WELL. THE 4 A.M. UPDATE FROM THE HURRICANE CENTER MOVING NORTHWEST AT 12. THE THE WINDS ARE AT 60 MILES AN HOUR, INCREASING TO 70 MILES AN HOUR AS WE HEAD INTO THIS AFTERNOON. AND YOU CAN SEE IT MAKING ITS WAY INLAND TOWARDS THE TEXAS COAST AS A CATEGORY ONE HURRICANE, HEADING INTO OVERNIGHT TONIGHT INTO EARLY TOMORROW MORNING. AND THEN AFTER THAT COULD WEAKEN DOWN TO A TROPICAL STORM AS WE HEAD INTO TOMORROW AFTERNOON. AND THEN AFTER THAT, IT'S JUST GOING TO BE A RAINMAKER AS IT CONTINUES TO MAKE ITS WAY NORTHEAST. AND THEN EVENTUALLY DISSIPATING. THEN WE COULD SAY GOODBYE TO BERYL PRETTY MUCH AS WE HEAD IN TOWARDS THE MID PART OF THE WEEK. HERE TEMPERATURES IN THE MID 70S, NORTH SHORE, LOWER 80S CLOSER TOWARDS THE METRO AND THE SOUTH SHORE IN GENERAL, AND OUR HIGH NUMBERS TODAY ARE GOING TO BE INTO THOSE LOW TO MID 90S. AND KEEP IN MIND, IT'S GOING TO FEEL EVEN HOTTER THAN THAT WHEN YOU FACTOR IN RELATIVE HUMIDITY. THAT'S WHY WE DO HAVE THOSE HEAT ADVISORIES IN EFFECT FOR PARTS OF SOUTHEASTERN LOUISIANA, MAINLY FOR THE NORTH SHORE. ALSO INCLUDING PARTS OF THE SOUTH SHORE, INCLUDING THE METRO HERE UNTIL 7:00. THIS EVENING. AND YOU CAN SEE THE HEAT INDEX VALUES WELL INTO THE TRIPLE DIGITS TODAY. IN FACT, 107 IN MANY SPOTS HERE TODAY AND TOMORROW AFTERNOON, VERY, VERY SIMILAR LIKE NUMBERS AS HIGHS OR HEAT INDEX VALUES WILL CLIMB TO AROUND 105 TO 106. IN SOME SPOTS. ALL RIGHT. LET'S TAKE YOU THROUGH THE DAY. JUST OVERALL, BESIDES THE HEAT THINGS STAYING PRETTY DRY HERE THIS AFTERNOON. I WANT TO TAKE YOU INTO TOMORROW THOUGH AND WIDEN OUT THE PICTURE BECAUSE AS BERYL CONTINUES TO MAKE ITS WAY INLAND OVER TEXAS AND THEN STARTS TO TURN NORTHEAST A LITTLE BIT, WE WILL BE LOOKING AT SOME OF THE EXTREME OUTER FRINGES OF THE RAIN BANDS MOVING INTO SOUTHEASTERN LOUISIANA. THERE, AS WE HEAD INTO TOMORROW AFTERNOON AND THROUGH MONDAY HERE ALSO INTO TUESDAY, AS WE'LL SEE THAT RETURN FLOW OFF THE GULF, HELPING TO PUMP IN THE MOISTURE CONNECTING BARREL HERE TOO. SO WE COULD BE LOOKING AT SOME RAIN CHANCES MONDAY AND TUESDAY IN ASSOCIATION WITH THAT SYSTEM AS IT BEGINS TO PULL AWAY. WDSU FIRST WARNING SEVEN DAY FORECAST SHOWING THAT WE GOT HIGH TEMPERATURES INTO THE LOW TO MID 90S WITH LOW TEMPERATURES INTO THE 70S TO LOW 80S AND OVERALL, THE RAIN CHANCES LOOKING PRETTY SLIM EXCEPT FOR TUESDAY, PROBABLY SEEING THE BEST BET OF RAIN CHANCES.

WE ARE WATCHING SOME SHOWERS AND STORMS FOR TOMORROW. IT'S GOING TO BE KIND OF ISOLATED, SO I DON'T THINK IT'LL BE A COMPLETE WASHOUT. BUT SUNDAY, MONDAY AND TUESDAY WE'RE GOING TO BE SEEING THAT ON AND OFF CHANCE OF SOME SCATTERED SHOWERS OR ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS. SOME DAYS MIGHT HAVE A LITTLE BIT MORE COVERAGE THAN OTHERS. AND THEN AS WE HEAD INTO OUR WEDNESDAY, IT DOES APPEAR RIGHT NOW WE'LL HAVE SOME DRY WEATHER TO MOVE IN FOR THE SECOND HALF OF THE WORKWEEK. TEMPERATURES GOT UP INTO THE MID 70S BY THE LAKESHORE TO NEAR 80 DEGREES. A LITTLE BIT FURTHER INLAND. NOT A TERRIBLE HOT START TO THE WEEKEND. PRETTY COMFORTABLE TO BE OUTSIDE, BUT ALSO TODAY DOES MARK THE BEGINNING OF THE, ON AVERAGE, THE WARMEST STRETCH OF WEATHER WE SEE IN SOUTHEASTERN WISCONSIN FOR THE SUMMER FROM JULY SIXTH THROUGH AUGUST 4TH. THE WARMEST PART OF SUMMER, WHICH OUR AVERAGE HIGH IS 82 DEGREES. AND THEN WE'RE GOING TO START TO COOL OFF A LITTLE BIT AFTERWARDS AT THE MOMENT, IT FEELS LIKE SUMMER, NOT TERRIBLY HOT, BUT CERTAINLY A LITTLE MUGGY. AND JUST TO OUR WEST, WE'VE GOT THESE SCATTERED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS THAT ARE ADVANCING EASTWARD. WE'LL SEE SOME OF THAT ENERGY AS WE HEAD INTO THE DAY FOR TOMORROW. SO THAT'S WHY WE DO HAVE THAT STORM CHANCE IN THE FORECAST TEMPERATURES IN THE LOWER 80S. SO WE'LL STAY AROUND NEAR OR SLIGHTLY IN THE LOWER 80S FOR THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS MONDAY, TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY. A LITTLE COOL DOWN INTO THE UPPER 70S ON THURSDAY, BACK INTO THE MID AND UPPER 80S AS WE HEAD INTO OUR SATURDAY, IT LOOKS LIKE A LITTLE WARM UP HEADING IN HERE AS A RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE AND A HEAT DOME BUILDS IN ACROSS PARTS OF THE COUNTRY. LATER, NEXT WEEK. FUTURECAST DOES SHOW TONIGHT BEING A QUIET EVENING, BUT AS WE HEAD INTO TOMORROW MORNING, IT REALLY DEPENDS IF WE STILL HAVE THIS DECAYING LINE OF SOME SCATTERED SHOWERS OR ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS. THEY MAKE THEIR WAY INTO PARTS OF SOUTHEAST WISCONSIN TOMORROW MORNING. COULD HAVE SOME LIGHT RAIN SHOWERS. MOLLY, HAVE AN UPDATE ON OUR MORNING NEWSCAST TOMORROW MORNING. THEN AS WE HEAD INTO THE AFTERNOON, YOU SEE OUR FUTURECAST SHOWING ALL OF THESE LITTLE POP UPS. WITH THAT DAYTIME HEATING THAT'S GOING TO CAUSE THAT INSTABILITY IN THE ATMOSPHERE TO SPARK SOME OF THAT RAINFALL. AND THAT'S PROBABLY WHEN I THINK WE'LL HAVE THE BEST OPPORTUNITY TO SEE A LITTLE BIT OF RAINFALL, SOME LINGERING SHOWERS ARE ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS EARLY DURING THE OVERNIGHT INTO EARLY MONDAY MORNING. AND THEN ONCE AGAIN AFTERNOON. A LITTLE BIT OF INSTABILITY FROM THAT DAYTIME SUN. WE COULD HAVE MORE SCATTERED SHOWERS AND ISOLATED STORMS. NOW WITH THAT ROUND AFTER ROUND, WE'VE GOT TOMORROW, WE'VE GOT MONDAY. WE'VE GOT TUESDAY. AND THIS IS JUST ONE COMPUTER MODEL, BUT IT SHOWS THAT THERE'S A LITTLE BIT OF MOISTURE IN THE ATMOSPHERE AND THERE COULD BE SOME AREA POCKETS THAT COULD GET A LITTLE BIT OF RAINFALL OUT OF THIS. CARRYING OVER FROM WHAT IT'S ALREADY A VERY WET START TO THE YEAR. WE'RE OVER CLOSE TO GETTING NEAR 26IN THE THIRD WETTEST START ON RECORD, AND THEN ON TOP OF THAT, WE'RE THE SECOND WARMEST START AND WE ARE GOING TO SEE MORE WARM AIR MOVE IN HERE. THIS IS THE 6 TO 10 DAY OUTLOOK FROM THE CLIMATE PREDICTION CENTER. LOOKING LIKE A BIG HEAT DOME TO OUR WEST. BUT WE'LL BE TAPPING INTO THAT ACROSS PARTS OF THE BADGER STATE. JUST TO ADD TO THAT SECOND WARMEST START SO FAR FOR THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR. SO TOMORROW WE DO HAVE THAT ISOLATED CHANCE OF SOME STORMS. WE'LL BE WARM AND MUGGY, LOWER 80S CONTINUING ON MONDAY AND TUESDAY. A LITTLE COOL DOWN AS WE HEAD INTO THE THURSDAY FORECAST. THAT'S THE ONLY 70 THAT I HAVE HERE.

IT'S STILL OVER TEXAS, BUT IT'S GOING TO BE STARTING TO GET TAPPED INTO THAT JET STREAM AND TRANSPORT UP TO THE NORTHEAST. YOU CAN SEE THAT ROTATION AND YOU SEE PERHAPS EVEN A LITTLE RED BOXES. THOSE ARE ACTIVE TORNADO WARNINGS. A LOT OF TIMES WITH THESE REMNANTS OF THESE HURRICANES, TROPICAL SYSTEMS, YOU COULD GET SOME ROTATION ON THESE BANDS. THIS IS THE LATEST TRACK FROM THE NATIONAL HURRICANE CENTER. AND YOU CAN SEE HOW IT KIND OF PIVOTS UP TOWARDS ILLINOIS AND INDIANA. NOW THAT'S THE CENTER OF THE ROTATION. BUT SOME OF THAT BANDING OF RAINFALL COULD MAKE ITS WAY UP INTO FAR NORTHERN ILLINOIS, MAYBE EVEN INTO PARTS OF FAR SOUTHERN WISCONSIN. AND THIS WOULD BE OVERNIGHT TUESDAY INTO WEDNESDAY MORNING FOR THAT POTENTIAL TO HAPPEN. IF THAT ENDS UP BEING THE CASE, IT WILL BE A SHORT LIVED ROUND OF RAINFALL RADAR AT THE MOMENT. FOR THE MOST PART, IT'S BEEN PRETTY QUIET. THERE WAS A LITTLE STRAY SHOWER THAT DEVELOPED AND MOVED ACROSS KENOSHA COUNTY, BUT NOW IT'S PRETTY MUCH FIZZLED OUT INTO A SPRINKLE. MORE OF THE STEADIER ACTIVITY HAS BEEN UP TO THE NORTH, WHERE IN RHINELANDER, THE NORTHWOODS UP INTO NORTHWEST WISCONSIN. HAYWARD. THEY'RE DEALING WITH SOME SCATTERED SHOWERS AND STORMS THIS AFTERNOON. THANKFULLY, NOTHING SEVERE, BUT SOME DOWNPOURS. MAYBE EVEN SOME PEA SIZED HAIL WITH SOME OF THE STRONGER CELLS. WEATHER DEPICTION DOES SHOW THAT CLOUD COVER FROM BARREL THAT'S LIFTING NORTH ALREADY. SOME SCATTERED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS IN SAINT LOUIS. AND THEN THERE'S THAT ACTIVITY UP TO THE NORTH. WE'RE KIND OF SANDWICHED IN BETWEEN BOTH OF THESE SYSTEMS AS WE HEAD INTO THE DAY TOMORROW SHOULD BE PRETTY QUIET FOR MOST OF THE DAY. PROBABLY BE A BUILDING CLOUD COVER, ESPECIALLY IN THE EVENING HOURS AHEAD OF BARRELS. INFLUENCE HIGH TEMPERATURE ABOUT 80 DEGREES 77 ON WEDNESDAY, BACK INTO 80 DEGREES ON THURSDAY. AND TAKE A LOOK WHAT HAPPENS TOWARDS THE END OF THE WEEKEND. GETTING TO ABOUT 90 DEGREES BOTH SUNDAY AND MONDAY. HOPEFULLY THE AIR CONDITIONER IS WORKING. FUTURECAST DOES SHOW THAT CHANCE OF SCATTERED SHOWERS OR STORMS CONTINUING FOR THE NEXT COUPLE OF HOURS. BUT AS WE HEAD INTO THE OVERNIGHT, IT REALLY CUTS OFF. BUT THEN AS WE HEAD INTO THE DAY FOR TOMORROW, BARRELS INFLUENCE STAYING DOWN TO THE SOUTH, WE'LL STAY PARTLY TO MOSTLY CLOUDY SKIES, BUT AS WE HEAD INTO TUESDAY NIGHT INTO EARLY WEDNESDAY MORNING, WE MIGHT GET A LITTLE SLIVER OF RAIN SHOWERS ACROSS. MAYBE KENOSHA RACINE OR WALWORTH COUNTIES BY THE AFTERNOON AS THAT SYSTEM DEPARTS SOME DAYTIME INSTABILITY ONCE AGAIN, SAME THING. LIKE WHAT WE'RE SEEING TODAY. WE COULD HAVE A FEW ISOLATED SHOWERS, MAYBE A POP-UP THUNDERSTORM, BUT THE RAINFALL, THE HEAVY RAIN FORECAST DOES REMAIN JUST TO THE SOUTH. AND THAT'S OKAY WITH US. WE HAVE HAD A VERY WET START TO THE YEAR. WE DON'T NEED ANY SUBSTANTIAL RAINFALL TO ADD ON TOP OF WHAT WE HAVE ALREADY SEEN. STILL, SOME OF THE ROCK RIVER DEALING WITH SOME FLOOD ISSUES ACROSS PARTS OF JEFFERSON COUNTY. HERE'S A CLOSER LOOK SHOWING FUTURECAST FOR THE REST OF THE EVENING HOURS. THE CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND STORMS WRAP UP AS WE HEAD INTO THE DAY TOMORROW. STARTING OFF WITH MOSTLY SUNNY SKIES, PARTLY CLOUDY SKIES AS WE HEAD INTO THE AFTERNOON, AND THEN MAYBE A STRAY RAIN SHOWER FROM BARREL ACROSS FAR SOUTHERN PART OF THE AREA. SO 77 ON WEDNESDAY FOR THAT CHANCE OF SOME MORNING SHOWERS. AND AS WE GET INTO THE REST OF THE WEEK, WE'LL DRY OUT GETTING INTO THE LOWER 80S, MID 80S ON FRIDAY AS SOME HEAT AND HUMIDITY BUILDS IN HERE. ISOLATED STORM CHANCE ON SATURDAY, HOT AND HUMID ON SUNDAY. ANOTHER SLIGHT CHANCE OF MAYBE SOME STORMS ON MONDAY WITH HIGHS RIGHT AROUND 90 DEGREES. I MEAN, WE'RE COOL FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS, SO I MEAN, WE KNEW THE 90S WOULD COME EVENTUALLY. YEAH, WE JUST WANTED TO DRY OUT LIKE CONSISTENTLY. SO SOGGY OUT THERE IT IS. I HAVE NOT DEALT WITH ANY.

WE'VE GOT THAT LINE MOVING INTO MILWAUKEE COUNTY AND LOTS OF LIGHTNING ASSOCIATED WITH IT. WE'LL TAKE A CLOSER LOOK SHOWING THIS CLUSTER OF STORMS THAT ARE ADVANCING INTO EASTERN WAUKESHA AND MILWAUKEE COUNTY. A LITTLE BIT OF SOME, PERHAPS VERY SMALL HAIL ASSOCIATED WITH THIS, SOME GUSTY WINDS. BUT THERE IS NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM WARNING WITH THIS. AND THAT'S LINE IS MOVING UP TO THE NORTHEAST AT ABOUT 20MPH. SO IF YOU'RE IN WHITEFISH BAY, FOX POINT, YOU'RE GOING TO GET UNDER THIS RIGHT NOW. BUTLER BROOKFIELD SEEING SOME HEAVY DOWNPOURS AS WE SPEAK. WAUKESHA STARTING TO SEE THE BACK END OF THIS UP TO THE NORTH. WE'VE HAD A FEW TRY TO POP UP, BUT THEY'VE REALLY FIZZLED OUT JUST TO THE NORTH OF WEST BEND, MOVING INTO SOUTHERN SHEBOYGAN COUNTY AND THEN DOWN INTO OUR SOUTHERN COUNTIES NEAR RACINE AND KENOSHA. THERE WAS A LITTLE BIT OF ACTIVITY, BUT THIS HAS REALLY FIZZLED OUT AS IT'S MOVING UP TOWARDS THE LAKE. OUTSIDE OF THIS, WE'LL BE WATCHING ANY ADDITIONAL DEVELOPMENT THAT'S DOWN IN ILLINOIS. BUT SINCE THIS MORNING AND THIS AFTERNOON, MUCH OF US HAVE SEEN A LITTLE BIT OF RAINFALL OUT OF THESE SCATTERED SHOWERS AND SOME ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS FURTHER DOWN TO THE SOUTH, THERE WAS A BROKEN LINE OF THUNDERSTORMS. THERE'S ACTUALLY A LITTLE A FRONTAL BOUNDARY, A GUST FRONT THAT'S BEEN MOVING DOWN TO THE OUTFLOW BOUNDARY DOWN TO THE SOUTH OF INTERSTATE I 80. THAT'S KIND OF HELPED REJUVENATE AND SPARK MORE OF THESE SHOWERS AND STORMS, BUT IT SEEMS TO BE WEAKENING A LITTLE BIT. THERE'S MORE ACTIVITY JUST TO THE NORTHEAST OF KANSAS CITY. WE'VE GOT LOTS OF INSTABILITY IN THE ATMOSPHERE ACROSS MUCH OF THE UPPER MIDWEST. PROBABLY GOING TO BE SEEING ADDITIONAL SHOWERS AND STORMS AS WE HEAD INTO THE OVERNIGHT. AS FOR HOW INTENSE THEY'RE GOING TO BE, HOW MUCH COVERAGE THAT REMAINS A QUESTION, BUT I STILL DO EXPECT US TO PROBABLY HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF SOME RAIN AS WE HEAD INTO THE OVERNIGHT AND EARLY TOMORROW MORNING. THIS IS MIDNIGHT. WE'LL PAUSE IT, SHOWING THE POTENTIAL FOR SOME SCATTERED SHOWERS AND STORMS ONCE AGAIN, FUTURECAST MIGHT BE EVEN OVERDOING THE COVERAGE, BUT AS WE HEAD INTO OUR MONDAY MORNING, THAT COVERAGE DOES DECREASE AND WE SHOULD ACTUALLY HAVE A LITTLE BREAK IN THE ACTION BEFORE ANOTHER INSTABILITY KIND OF SPARKS OFF THOSE SHOWERS AND STORMS DURING THE AFTERNOON. YOU CAN SEE THAT RIGHT HERE AS THAT LOW PRESSURE TRACKS RIGHT ACROSS NORTHERN ILLINOIS WITH ADDITIONAL MOISTURE DOWN TO THE SOUTH. AND THIS IS NOT ACTUALLY FROM THAT LOW PRESSURE. THAT'S THE REMNANTS OF BERYL. THAT'S RIGHT. NOW IN TEXAS, ALMOST ABOUT TO MAKE LANDFALL IN TEXAS. IT'S GOING TO BE MAKING ITS WAY UP TO THE NORTH AND NORTHEAST. AND WHERE THAT RAINFALL BAND SETS UP REMAINS A QUESTION. SOME OF THE MODELS SAYING IT A LITTLE BIT FURTHER DOWN TO THE SOUTH, BUT YOU CAN SEE THAT TRACK MOVING INTO ILLINOIS AND INDIANA AND THAT'S THE CENTER OF THE PRESSURE. THAT RAINFALL COULD EASILY BE UP TO THE NORTH AS WE HEAD INTO THE AMOUNT OF RAINFALL, WHAT WE COULD SEE OVER THE NEXT, I'D SAY THE 42 HOURS FUTURECAST IS SHOWING THAT HEAVY RAIN POTENTIAL STAYING DOWN TO OUR SOUTH. SO FOR TOMORROW WE DO HAVE AN IMPACT DAY BECAUSE OF THOSE SHOWERS AND STORMS. FIRST THAT LITTLE MORNING ROUND, THEN INTO THE AFTERNOON 80 DEGREES ON TUESDAY BACK INTO THE UPPER 70S ON WEDNESDAY, 80 DEGREES ON THURSDAY AND WE'LL GET INTO THE UPPER 80S AND 90 DEGREES AS WE HEAD

DON'T GET ME WRONG, BUT IT'S BETTER THAN FEELING LIKE 105 DEGREES BACK UP TOWARDS MARION COUNTY FOR YOU RIGHT NOW. HAD A LITTLE PEEKABOO SUNSHINE THERE. JUST A LITTLE BIT. IT'S KIND OF OVERCAST TEMPERATURES HOLDING STEADY. LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT LIVE RADAR FOR YOU RIGHT NOW. AND YOU CAN SEE WE HAD SOME GUSTY WINDS WITH THIS BIG PUSH OF ENERGY THAT CAME THROUGH BETWEEN TWO AND ABOUT 4:00 THIS AFTERNOON. CAM WAS COVERING THAT DURING THE 4:00 SHOW. THERE'S PALM COAST SHELL BLUFF DOWN TOWARDS ASTOR. SOME SPOTTY SHOWERS OFF TOWARDS SORRENTO, BACK TOWARDS ALTOONA, A FEW LIGHT POCKETS OF SOME DRIZZLE PICKS UP A LITTLE BIT HERE OUT TOWARDS EASTERN ORANGE COUNTY ALONG THE BEACH LINE THERE BACK TOWARDS PORT SAINT JOHN AND STILL COMING DOWN YELLOW. SOME MORE OF THE MODERATE RAINFALL. CAPE CANAVERAL WE HAD SOME DECENT WIND GUSTS THERE, A LITTLE BIT OF WIND DAMAGE, A COUPLE FENCES BLOWN DOWN IN AND AROUND THE TITUSVILLE AREA. CONNERSVILLE YEEHAW JUNCTION STILL WET HERE, BUT BREAKING UP NOW FROM PALM BAY UP TOWARDS THE CITY OF MELBOURNE. A COUPLE MORE OF THE UPDATED RAINFALL TALLIES HERE FOR YOU. WEST ORMOND BEACH 3.22IN OF RAIN. HOW ABOUT THAT? FLAGLER BEACH BUNNELL 2.31IN RESPECTIVELY. AND DAYTONA TOWER 1.21IN OF RAIN. SO HERE'S WHAT'S GOING ON. FEELS LIKE TEMPERATURES JUMP BACK UP INTO THE LOW 90S AS WE HAD A LITTLE BIT OF SUNSHINE THERE IN OCALA, THE MAJORITY OF US ARE UNDER THAT VEIL OF CLOUDS, AND AT THIS HOUR, EVEN SOME RAIN ONGOING. SO WE'RE IN PRETTY GOOD SHAPE COMPARED TO WHERE WE WERE JUST A FEW HOURS AGO. OVERNIGHT TONIGHT THROUGH DAYBREAK TOMORROW MORNING, TEMPERATURES DROPPING BACK INTO THE MIDDLE 70S, 75 OCALA 75 DELAND, SAINT CLOUD BACK TOWARDS MELBOURNE AND PALM BAY. YOU'LL BE RUNNING IN THE MIDDLE TO THE UPPER 70S. AND AS WE TAKE A LOOK NOW AT THE SETUP OVERNIGHT TONIGHT, A LOT OF CLOUDS AROUND. THEY'LL BEGIN TO BREAK UP AFTER MIDNIGHT. FRONT'S UP TO THE NORTH. ANY MOISTURE THAT WE GET WILL MOVE FROM THE WEST TO THE EAST. DURING THE COURSE OF THE AFTERNOON TOMORROW. GREATEST RAINFALL CHANCES ARE GOING TO BE ALONG THE EASTERN SIDE OF THE PENINSULA. WE'LL PUT THEM IN A MEDIUM TO MAYBE A SLIGHTLY HIGHER CHANCE EAST OF I 95 COVERAGE TOMORROW. FAR LOWER THAN WHAT WE WERE SEEING THIS AFTERNOON. TEMPS TOMORROW WITH A WEST WIND 92 TO 95 AREA WIDE. LET'S TAKE A LOOK DOWN A COUPLE OF THESE 12 HOUR FORECAST. PALM COAST JUMPING UP INTO THE LOWER 90S. A FEW OF THOSE LATE DAY COOLING SHOWERS AND STORMS WILL BE MOVING ON IN. AND IF YOU'RE LOOKING TO MAKE IT A BEACH DAY TOMORROW, JUST KEEP AN EYE TO THE SKY LATER ON IN THE AFTERNOON, AS THOSE SOUTHWEST WINDS MAY BREW UP. A COUPLE OF THOSE LATE DAY SHOWERS AND STORMS. POOP FORECAST. ALSO LOOKING PRETTY GOOD FOR THE MOST PART. JUST WATCH THE STORMS MID AFTERNOON ON AND THEN AS WE HEAD INTO THURSDAY AND FRIDAY. STILL A FEW SHOWERS AND STORMS AROUND THURSDAY AND FRIDAY, BUT THE SUMMERTIME PATTERN HAS OUR TEMPERATURES BACK UP INTO THE LOWER 90S RAINFALL. WE NEED IT ESPECIALLY ON THE EASTERN SIDE OF THE PENINSULA. AND IF THESE COMPUTER MODELS ARE CORRECT, I THINK WE'RE GOING TO GET A LITTLE BIT OF HELP FROM I-4 BACK TOWARDS I-95 EARLIER TODAY, COLORADO STATE CAME OUT WITH ITS JULY UPDATE, UPPING THE NUMBER OF NAMED STORMS FROM 23 TO 25. HURRICANES FROM 11 TO 12, AND MAJOR HURRICANES FROM 5 TO 6. NOW, HERE'S WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW. HERE'S THE TAKEAWAY ON AVERAGE, WE HAVE AN 86% CHANCE IN THE STATE OF FLORIDA TO HAVE A LANDFALLING TROPICAL STORM. THIS YEAR, THOUGH, EVERYTHING'S ABOVE THE NORM, WHETHER IT'S THE HURRICANE OR THE CAT THREE, CHANCES ARE HIGHER THIS YEAR BECAUSE OF ALL OF THAT DYNAMICS THAT ARE IN PLAY. LA NINA, A BIG AREA OF VERY WARM SEA SURFACE TEMPERATURES AND THE SAHARAN DUST REALLY HASN'T DONE A WHOLE LOT THUS FAR THIS SEASON. BUT WHAT HAS DONE SOMETHING IS BARREL. BARREL HAS REALLY PUT A LITTLE DENT IN THE WATER TEMPERATURES HERE IN THE NORTHWESTERN CARIBBEAN ON INTO THE GULF OF MEXICO, AND THAT WILL ONLY LAST ABOUT 7 TO 10 DAYS. THEN WE'LL HEAT THINGS BACK UP. SO DON'T GET YOUR HOPES UP FOR THE COOLER WATERS TO STICK AROUND. SO LOWERING RAIN CHANCES. TOMORROW WE HEAD INTO THURSDAY, FRIDAY, SATURDAY AND SUNDAY.

THIS IS ALL STEMMING FROM THE REMNANTS OF WHAT WAS ONCE HURRICANE BERYL. THAT'S MUCH WEAKER, BUT STILL THEY ADD SOME ENERGY, SOME WIND ENERGY INTO THE ATMOSPHERE THAT ANY STORMS THAT GET GOING IN THIS HEAT AND HUMIDITY OF THE DAY WILL PRODUCE SOME STRONG WIND GUSTS, EVEN SOME ISOLATED SPIN UP TORNADOES THAT CAN'T BE RULED OUT.

NOTICE A LOT OF DRY TIME THROUGH EARLY AFTERNOON. BUT AS WE GET LATER IN THE DAY, WE START TO PICK UP THESE SHOWER AND THUNDERSTORM CHANCES. AND THOSE WILL BE RUMBLING THROUGH DURING THE EVENING HOURS TONIGHT AGAIN TILL ABOUT MIDNIGHT. SEVERE STORMS WILL BE POSSIBLE ONCE WE GET PAST THE MIDNIGHT HOUR. WE COULD STILL LINGER. A FEW SHOWERS, BUT THE SEVERE WEATHER THREAT WILL BE OVER AND BY TOMORROW MORNING. LOWS NEAR 70 DEGREES. IT'LL BE A LITTLE BREEZY TOO. REMEMBER THIS A LEFTOVERS OF A SYSTEM THAT HAD 80 TO 90 MILE PER HOUR WINDS YESTERDAY. IT WILL BE BLOWING AROUND 10 TO 20 FOR US NOW. FORECAST RADAR IN MOTION SHOWS THAT GAP OF DRIER TIME THROUGH THE EARLY AFTERNOON. THEN AS WE START TO GET LATE AFTERNOON AND EVENING, WE BEGIN TO PICK UP THOSE SCATTERED CHANCES FOR SHOWERS AND STORMS. I THINK THE BEST OPPORTUNITIES COME A LITTLE CLOSER TO AND IMMEDIATELY AFTER SUNSET, WITH LINES OF THUNDERSTORMS THAT START ORGANIZING AND MOVING INTO OUR REGION. HERE WE ARE BY 9:00, SOME OF OUR WESTERN COMMUNITIES GETTING INTO THAT, AND THEN THAT STARTS TO PUSH ON OFF TO THE EAST. I THINK THE I-65 CORRIDOR IN THE METRO, WE'RE GOING TO HIGHLIGHT THE 10 TO 11:00 TIME FRAME FOR THE BEST OPPORTUNITY OF ANY STRONGER STORMS. AND THEN ONCE WE GET PAST MIDNIGHT, THAT MOVES ON OFF TO THE EAST, A FEW LINGERING LIGHTER SHOWERS OVERNIGHT INTO EARLY TOMORROW MORNING, BUT THE BULK OF OUR WEDNESDAY WE'RE GOING TO TREND DRIER NORTHERLY BREEZES ON THE BACK EDGE OF THIS SYSTEM WILL LOWER OUR HUMIDITY. WE'LL SEE SOME SUNSHINE INTO THE AFTERNOON AND TOMORROW IS AN IMPROVING DAY WITH HIGHS ONLY NEAR 84. THAT'S ABOUT FIVE BELOW NORMAL FOR THE TIME OF YEAR 88. ON THURSDAY WE WATCH FOR A COUPLE OF SPOTTY SHOWERS INTO THE AFTERNOON. DOESN'T LOOK LIKE MUCH, BUT A LITTLE BIT OF WET WEATHER. A POSSIBILITY BEFORE FRIDAY AND SATURDAY TURN DRIER. BUT LOOK AT THOSE HIGHS BACK INTO AND CLIMBING THROUGH THE 90S 93 BOTH WEEKEND DAYS. WE'LL WATCH FOR AN ISOLATED POP UP SUMMERTIME STORM ON OUR SUNDAY.

AS WE TAKE A LOOK OUTSIDE OUR AREA, WE'VE GOT QUITE A BIT OF RAINFALL YESTERDAY. AT LEAST SEVERAL OF US DID. THAT'S GREAT NEWS THAT SYSTEM IS NOW MOVING AWAY FROM US AND WHAT'S LEFT BEHIND MAINLY ARE JUST SOME EXTRA CLOUDS EARLY THIS MORNING WE'LL CLEAR OUT. WE'LL GET TO SOME SUNSHINE.

MOST OF THE DAY WAS DRY AND THEN YOU HAD A LITTLE A LITTLE DOWNPOUR THAT MIGHT HAVE RUINED YOUR CHANCES AT MOWING THE LAWN. I KNOW IT'S BEEN TOUGH. I'VE HAD PEOPLE ASK ME, WHEN CAN I JUST MOW MY LAWN AND NOT WORRY, I HEAR YOU. IT'S BEEN A VERY INTERESTING SUMMER SO FAR, BUT I DO ANTICIPATE RATHER TODAY. VERY SIMILAR TO YOUR SUNDAY. WE HAVE HIGHS NEAR 80 DEGREES. WE ARE STAYING MUGGY AND HOT AND THOSE STORM CHANCES WILL LIKELY PICK UP MORE. SO AS WE HEAD INTO THE AFTERNOON. IT'S A VERY TYPICAL SUMMERTIME PATTERN WHERE YOU HAVE THAT HEAT AND HUMIDITY RISING INTO THE ATMOSPHERE, GIVING YOU A LITTLE ISOLATED SHOWER. WE SAW THAT YESTERDAY IN WAUKESHA. WE SAW THAT IN MUKWONAGO. WE SAW IT ALSO IN SOME AREAS IN NORTHERN MILWAUKEE COUNTY, GETTING ONE OF THOSE POP UP THUNDERSTORMS, AND THEY WERE BELOW SEVERE LIMITS. BUT STILL A LOT OF DOWNPOURS. EVEN SOME SMALL HAIL. AND NOW THIS BRINGS OUR RAIN. SO FAR THIS YEAR TO 25, ALMOST 26IN, WHICH IS ALMOST EIGHT INCHES ABOVE AVERAGE, WHICH MAKES IT THE THIRD WETTEST YEAR. SO FAR ON RECORD FOR MILWAUKEE. I KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF AREAS THAT GOT A LOT MORE RAIN, BUT WE'RE USING DATA COMING IN FROM THE MILWAUKEE AIRPORT. YOU CAN SEE THERE'S A COUPLE OF LITTLE CLUSTERS OF SHOWERS JUST TO THE WEST OF US. MOST OF US ARE STAYING DRY HERE THROUGHOUT THE MORNING, BUT JUST DON'T, YOU KNOW, DON'T BE SURPRISED IF YOU GET A LITTLE SPRINKLE. 82 FOR THE HIGH TODAY. IMPACT DAY BECAUSE OF THESE AFTERNOON POP UPS, I DON'T EXPECT A LOT. THERE'LL BE A LOT OF DRY TIME AND THERE'S A LOT OF US THAT WILL STAY DRY ALL DAY TOMORROW. ALL DAY IS DRY. I DON'T EXPECT ANYTHING TO BE A BIG ISSUE, BUT WE COULD SEE SOME POP UPS LATE IN THE EVENING AND OVERNIGHT RAIN CHANCES THAT WILL LINGER INTO EARLY WEDNESDAY. THIS IS ALL DEPENDENT ON THE TRACK OF WHAT IS NOW HURRICANE BERYL, BECAUSE WE DO HAVE SOME CHANCES OF RAIN FROM IT, AND THEN YOU CAN SEE BIG OLD WARM UP ON THE WAY WITH TEMPERATURES GOING INTO SATURDAY AND SUNDAY, UPPER 80S, LOW 90S. SO GET READY FOR SOME MORE OF THAT SUMMERTIME HEAT. WARM FRONT IS GOING TO BE THE CATALYST THAT ALLOWS FOR US TO SEE THESE POP UP THUNDERSTORMS THROUGHOUT THE DAY. TODAY, I WOULD SAY DEFINITELY MID TO LATE AFTERNOON. THE WEATHER MODELS DON'T PICK UP ON A TON HERE, BUT I KNOW FROM EXPERIENCE THAT THAT IS A LIKELY POSSIBILITY. IT PICKS UP ON A LITTLE BIT MORE TO THE NORTH. JUST PRETEND THAT'S DOWN HERE. THAT'S WHAT I WOULD EXPECT. AND RIGHT THERE YOU SAW ONE JUST POP UP FOR THE AFTERNOON. THAT LOW IS GOING TO SCOOT ON OVER AND THEN AS WE HEAD INTO THE OVERNIGHT HOURS ON TUESDAY, LINGERING INTO WEDNESDAY, WE HAVE THE TRACK OF HURRICANE BERYL. WATCH THIS TRACK AS WE GO THROUGH TIME. IT'S A CATEGORY ONE TURNS INTO A TROPICAL STORM, AND THEN THAT LOW IS BASICALLY REMNANTS OF BERYL, AND THAT STILL CAN BRING A LOT OF HEAVY RAIN TO MANY AREAS IN THE CENTRAL PLAINS. AND MIDWEST. FOR US, WE STAY OUT OF THE MAIN LINE OF FIRE ON ANYTHING STRONG OR SEVERE, BUT WE DEFINITELY RIGHT HERE YOU'RE GOING TO NOTICE THAT RAIN SHIELD KIND OF POPPING UP UP HERE TUESDAY NIGHT, KIND OF PUSHING ITS WAY INTO WEDNESDAY MORNING. SOME WEATHER MODELS KEEP THIS TOTALLY EAST, OTHERS KEEP IT RIGHT AROUND THE EXTREME SOUTHEASTERN PART OF THE STATE. I WILL KEEP A VERY CLOSE EYE ON THAT TRACK, BUT FOR NOW, I'M GOING TO CALL FOR RAIN THAT COULD LINGER INTO EARLY WEDNESDAY. DEW POINTS THOUGH THE WHOLE WEEK IS STICKY. THAT'S WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW AND SOME HEAT IS ON THE WAY. I'M TALKING SOME 90S, SO WE'RE HITTING THAT PEAK OF SUMMER. THE WARMEST PART OF THE YEAR BETWEEN NOW AND AUGUST FOURTH. THE AVERAGE HIGH IS ABOUT 82, AND WE'RE GOING TO HIT THAT TODAY. WE'RE DEFINITELY HITTING THAT THE REST OF THE WEEK. LOOK AT THE SEVEN DAY FORECAST. WE GO DOWN TO 70 BRIEFLY AFTER WE GET RID OF BERYL AND THEN RIGHT BACK UP. I ACTUALLY BUMPED THE HIGH ON SUNDAY TO 92. AS OF RIGHT NOW, I ACTUALLY HAVE A FORECAST OF MONDAY OF 94.

LET'S GO AHEAD AND TAKE A LOOK. WE HAVE A HEAT ADVISORY IN EFFECT ALL THROUGHOUT CENTRAL FLORIDA UNTIL 7:00. AND THAT'S BECAUSE WE COULD SEE THAT HEAT INDEX CLIMB TO 112. THIS AFTERNOON. WE'RE ALREADY GETTING PRETTY CLOSE IN SOME SPOTS. THERE. LOOK AT THOSE VILLAGES AT 113 110 RIGHT NOW. LEESBURG 103 RIGHT NOW IN ORLANDO, IT FEELS LIKE 107. RIGHT NOW IN PALM COAST. SO DANGEROUS HEAT HERE ALL ACROSS THE BOARD HERE IN CENTRAL FLORIDA. AND UNFORTUNATELY RIGHT NOW WE'RE NOT TRACKING ANY RAIN TO HELP COOL US OFF. FIRST WARNING RADAR, JUST A FEW TINY, TINY SHOWERS RIGHT NOW OVER IN FAR SOUTHERN BREVARD AND OSCEOLA COUNTY. YOU HAVE A LIGHT RAIN SHOWER OVER BY SATELLITE BEACH MELBOURNE. ALSO A POP UP SHOWER THERE NEAR MICCO AND A TEENY TINY SHOWER THAT JUST ROLLED UP OVER IN KEENAN'S VILLE. AS WE GO THROUGH THE AFTERNOON, I DO THINK WE'LL SEE A FEW MORE SHOWERS POPPING UP. I THINK THIS PARTICULAR FUTURECAST MODEL IS A LITTLE OVERDOING THE COVERAGE, BUT AGAIN, WE ARE GOING TO SEE SOME INCREASING COVERAGE THOUGH, THOUGH MAYBE NOT AS MUCH AS THAT IS INDICATING. HOWEVER, AS WE GO INTO FIVE, SIX, 7:00, THAT'S WHEN WE'LL SEE A LATE AFTERNOON OR EARLY EVENING SEA BREEZE COLLISION THAT'S GOING TO HELP FIRE UP MORE SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS AND A COUPLE OF THESE COULD BE ON THE STRONGER SIDE. SO JUST KEEP THAT IN MIND AS YOU HEAD HOME FOR THAT EVENING DRIVE. THEN AS WE GO IN AROUND 7 TO 8:00, A FEW LINGERING SHOWERS AROUND. BUT THE THREAT FOR ANYTHING STRONG DOES MOVE ON OUT. SO THROUGH 3:00 WE ARE GOING TO CONTINUE THAT DANGEROUS HEAT. AND THEN AS WE GO INTO FIVE, SIX, 7:00, THAT'S WHEN WE'LL BE TRACKING SCATTERED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS AROUND. AND THEN THOSE SHOWERS WILL CLEAR OUT IN THE OVERNIGHT HOURS. AND WE'RE GOING TO START OFF PRETTY WARM AND MUGGY TOMORROW MORNING WITH TEMPERATURES IN THE UPPER 70S THERE. AND THEN AS WE GO INTO TOMORROW AFTERNOON, HIGHS IN THE LOW 90S INTO THE UPPER SECONDS, WHICH IS OUR QUOTE UNQUOTE COOL DOWN TEMPERATURES WON'T BE NEARLY AS HOT TOMORROW. TAKE A LOOK AT FUTURECAST TOMORROW MORNING. WE'RE GOING TO START OFF PRETTY QUIET, BUT WE ARE GOING TO SEE AN EARLIER START TO THE RAIN TOMORROW. YOU CAN NOTICE BY LUNCHTIME THAT WEST COAST BREEZE ALREADY STARTS TO GET GOING. AND THAT WILL CONTINUE TO PUSH EASTWARD. SO BY TWO 3:00 WE COULD SEE A LATE AFTERNOON SEA BREEZE COLLISION FAVORING THE EASTERN PART OF THE PENINSULA. AND THAT IS ACTUALLY GOING TO HELP COOL US DOWN, KEEPING US FROM GOING INTO THE MID TO UPPER 90S BECAUSE WE'RE SEEING EARLIER ONSET OF THE RAIN. SO THAT'S THE GOOD NEWS BEHIND THAT. BUT WE'LL STILL BE TRACKING STORMS THOUGH, ESPECIALLY BY LATE TOMORROW AFTERNOON. SPEAKING OF STORMS, LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT BERYL THAT IS NOW A TROPICAL STORM. IT IS WEAKENED TO WINDS OF 70MPH, BUT IT IS STILL MAINTAINING ITS EYEWALL EVEN THOUGH IT'S BEEN OVER LAND FOR OVER SIX HOURS. MOVING OFF TO THE NORTH NORTHEAST AT 13MPH. AGAIN, WINDS OF 70. IT'S ABOUT 30 MILES NORTHWEST OF HOUSTON, TEXAS, AND AGAIN, IT IS STILL MAINTAINING ITS STRUCTURE AND SLOWLY WEAKENING AS IT MOVES INTO EAST TEXAS LATE TONIGHT. AND THEN FINALLY, THE REMNANTS OF THE SYSTEM HEADS INTO THE MIDWEST BY MID TO LATE WEEK. I CAN TELL YOU, JUST AS OF RECENT THE LAST HOUR OR SO, THE HOUSTON INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT THERE IS REGISTERED A WIND GUST OVER 80MPH. SO YES, IT'S A TROPICAL STORM, BUT FOLKS IN SOUTHEAST TEXAS, PARTICULARLY HOUSTON, DID FEEL SOME HURRICANE FORCE WIND GUSTS, THOUGH. AND AS YOU MAY KNOW, LOTS OF PEOPLE WITHOUT POWER THERE IN SOUTHEAST TEXAS. HERE'S A LOOK AHEAD AT YOUR EXTENDED WEATHER FORECAST. HIGH RAIN CHANCES THROUGH THE MID WEEK TIME FRAME. THEN THURSDAY AND FRIDAY SLIGHTLY DRIER WITH THE 40% RAIN COVERAGE AND WE'", "source": {"uri": "wesh.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WESH"}, "authors": [{"uri": "cam_tran@wesh.com", "name": "Cam Tran", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-explosive_anti-tank", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "High-explosive anti-tank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Organization_for_Women", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Organization for Women"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Press_International", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Press International"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Central Florida"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shutout", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Shutout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgium", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Belgium"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Belgium"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M\u00e9rida_International_Airport", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "M\u00e9rida International Airport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_breeze", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sea breeze"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_index", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Heat index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_convection", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atmospheric convection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_technology", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Information technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radar", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Radar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leesburg,_Virginia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Leesburg, Virginia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Leesburg, Virginia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite_Beach,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Satellite Beach, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Satellite Beach, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palm_Coast,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Palm Coast, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Palm Coast, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osceola_County,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Osceola County, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Osceola County, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orlando,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Orlando, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Orlando, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brevard_County,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brevard County, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brevard County, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomorrow_Morning_(musical)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tomorrow Morning (musical)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oregon"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oregon"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_Hour_(Indian_TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Last Hour (Indian TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_P._Hobby_Airport", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "William P.

WE COULD HAVE SOME BETTER WEATHER THIS MORNING, BUT THAT'S GOING TO COME LATER THIS AFTERNOON, SO GET READY FOR SOME NICER SKIES. BUT FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE MORNING, IN THE WAKE OF SOME OF THE THUNDERSTORMS, WE HAD TO DODGE YESTERDAY, NOW WE JUST HAVE SOME LIGHT RAIN.

I THINK IT'S SUPER IMPORTANT. YEAH, AND YOU'LL HEAR FROM A LOT OF SWIMMERS TONIGHT TALKING ABOUT, YOU KNOW, THIS HELPED ME GET OVER THIS HUMP OR I WAS STRUGGLING HERE OR THERE. SO A LOT OF GOOD CONVERSATIONS BEING HAD FROM SPORTS PSYCHOLOGISTS TO THERAPISTS. THEY'RE ALL GETTING GETTING HELP NEEDED. THAT IS AMAZING. WE HAVE A METEOROLOGIST HERE WHO IS HELPING US GET THROUGH THE NEXT FEW DAYS BECAUSE THE REMNANTS AND IT'S NOT GOING TO BARREL US LIKE IT DID. I DIDN'T HEARD THAT ONE THE LAST WEEK. I'M SORRY YOU'RE OFF WORK, SO I'LL LET YOU HAVE ONE. I'VE ALSO USED IT IN HEADLINES. IT'S OKAY. UM, SO HERE'S THE DEAL. I ALREADY GOT A SORRY, A QUESTION ON TWITTER SAYING, IS THIS GOING TO BE LIKE THE REMNANTS OF IKE THAT CAUSED THAT MASSIVE WINDSTORM POWER OUTAGE? NOT THE SAME SETUP AT ALL. SO THIS IS MORE TYPICAL. WHAT WE WOULD GET OUT OF THE REMNANTS OF A TROPICAL SYSTEM. SO TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT'S COMING OUR WAY OVER THE NEXT TWO DAYS. YOUR STORM TIMELINE LOOKS LIKE THIS. BETWEEN TUESDAY AFTERNOON AND WEDNESDAY, EARLY EVENING. THAT IS THE TIME FRAME THAT THE SYSTEM ROLLS THROUGH OUR AREA. AS FAR AS THE IMPACTS GO, WE WILL HAVE ROUNDS OF RAIN AND THUNDERSTORMS AND THE POTENTIAL FOR SOME STRONGER STORMS ON TUESDAY, INCLUDING AT LEAST A LOW END THREAT FOR A TORNADO IN OUR REGION. THAT HAS TO DO WITH WHERE THE TRACK OF THE CENTER OF THAT SYSTEM GOES. AS FAR AS THE RAINFALL TOTALS OVER THE COURSE OF THAT KIND OF 24 HOUR TIME FRAME, ON AVERAGE, MOST OF US WILL PICK UP SOMEWHERE BETWEEN ABOUT A HALF AND AN INCH AND A HALF OF TOTAL RAINFALL. SO RIGHT NOW, HURRICANE BERYL IS A CATEGORY ONE STORM WITH 80 MILE AN HOUR WINDS AS IT MADE LANDFALL SOUTH OF HOUSTON. YOU CAN SEE BRINGING SOME OF THOSE HEAVIER RAIN BANDS RIGHT NOW THROUGH HOUSTON. THE TRACK THIS STORM IS GOING TO TAKE WILL GO UP IN THROUGH ARKANSAS KIND OF CROSS OVER THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER RIVER, AND THEN EVENTUALLY MAKE ITS WAY TOWARDS CINCINNATI. NOTICE THE CENTER OF THAT LOW KIND OF CLOSER TO INDY. SINCE WE ARE ON THE EASTERN SIDE OF THAT TRACK, THERE'LL BE SOME SPIN IN THE ATMOSPHERE, WHICH IS WHY WE CAN'T RULE OUT A TORNADO FOR OUR AREA. TOMORROW, THOUGH, THE BIG STORY OUT OF THIS THING WILL END UP BEING THE FACT THAT WE GET SOME RAIN. SO AS WE TAKE A LOOK AT THE FUTURECAST, I FAST FORWARDED IT TO TOMORROW. WE ACTUALLY SHOULD HAVE A PRETTY SUNSET TONIGHT WITH THOSE CLOUDS COMING IN FROM BERYL, BUT TOMORROW MORNING WAKING UP TO CLOUDY SKIES, MUGGY AIR AND WE'RE DRY THROUGH THE MORNING INTO THE AFTERNOON. THOSE FIRST OUTLYING SHOWERS START TO MAKE THEIR WAY IN. I THINK WE START TO SEE SOME THUNDERSTORMS BY ABOUT 3 OR 4 P.M. ON TUESDAY. GETTING INTO THE EVENING AGAIN ALL OF THESE ARE GOING TO BE KIND OF SCATTERED AT FIRST AND THEN PICKING UP TUESDAY NIGHT. I THINK AFTER TUESDAY SUNSET IS WHEN WE SEE SOME OF THE HEAVIER BANDS COME THROUGH. SO WHILE YOU'RE TRYING TO SLEEP TUESDAY NIGHT INTO WEDNESDAY MORNING, SOME OF THE MORE INTENSE RAINFALL AND WE'LL HAVE SOME THUNDERSTORMS TO START OUT WEDNESDAY, AND THEN WE TRANSITION BACK OVER TO GRAY SKIES, OCCASIONAL RAIN THROUGH WEDNESDAY, EARLY EVENING. AND AGAIN, MOST OF US ARE GOING TO SEE SOMEWHERE BETWEEN ONE HALF AND 1.5IN OF RAIN TODAY. SUNSHINE EARLY, AND THEN THOSE CLOUDS 91 DEGREES. THE EXPECTED HIGH TODAY, TOMORROW.

YEAH, IT'S ACTUALLY SAHARAN DUST. IT'S TRAVELED THOUSANDS OF MILES ACROSS THE ATLANTIC, AND NOW WE HAVE SOME IN OUR NEIGHBORHOODS. AND THAT'S CREATING MORE OF THOSE MILKY AND HAZY SKIES THAT WE'RE SEEING THIS AFTERNOON. IS IT HOT DUST? IT. YES. AND IT'S ALSO DRY DUST. AND SO THAT'S GOING TO HELP LIMIT UNFORTUNATELY IT'S GOING TO HELP LIMIT OUR CHANCES FOR STORMS TODAY, WHICH ALSO IS THE REASON WHY WE'RE GOING TO BE SCORCHING HOT THIS AFTERNOON. SO DEFINITELY A LIVE LOOK AT MCO. YOU CAN SEE HOW HAZY IT IS OUT THERE. TEMPERATURES RIGHT NOW 87 IN LEESBURG 89 RIGHT NOW IN THE CITY. BEAUTIFUL AND 91 IN DELAND. SO THIS DOES CREATES DRIER AIR. SO IT'S GOING TO LIMIT OUR CHANCES OF RAIN. BUT IT'S GOING TO ALLOW THE HEAT TO REALLY BUILD. TODAY YOU CAN SEE THAT LAYER OF DUST RIGHT OVER US HERE IN CENTRAL FLORIDA. ALSO KEEP IN MIND WITH THESE DUST PARTICLES IN THE AIR, IT CREATES A MODERATE AIR QUALITY CONCERN. SO THOSE WITH SENSITIVE RESPIRATORY ISSUES MAY WANT TO LIMIT THEIR TIME OUTDOORS. TODAY, TAKE A LOOK AT OUR FIRST WARNING RADAR. JUST A FEW SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS POPPING UP THIS AFTERNOON. WE HAVE THIS CELL HERE RIGHT OVER IN PALM COAST. IT'S PRODUCING SOME PRETTY MODERATE TO HEAVY RAIN, ALSO DOWN TOWARDS ORMOND AND DAYTONA BEACH. WE HAVE SOME MODERATE HEAVY RAIN THERE. SHOWERS AND STORMS FLARING UP HERE IN MARION COUNTY OUT TOWARDS OCALA, AS WELL AS SALT SPRINGS. THIS AFTERNOON. OTHERWISE, RAIN CHANCES ARE GOING TO BE PRETTY LOW TODAY, ONLY ABOUT A 30 TO 40% RAIN COVERAGE THIS AFTERNOON, WHICH IS VERY LOW FOR THIS TIME OF YEAR. SO TODAY IS A GOOD DAY TO HEAD OUT TO THE POOL BECAUSE OF THE HEAT AND HUMIDITY. AND THEN WE WILL BE TRACKING A BETTER CHANCE FOR SCATTERED RAIN SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS AROUND 4 OR 5:00 THIS AFTERNOON. RAIN WILL CLEAR OUT IN THE OVERNIGHT HOURS. IT'S GOING TO BE WARM AND MUGGY NIGHT WITH TEMPERATURES IN THE UPPER 70S. HIGHS TOMORROW ONLY IN THE UPPER 80S TO LOW 90S THANKS TO A COMBINATION OF COUPLE FACTORS. RAIN CHANCES GO BACK UP TOMORROW, AND THE SECOND FACTOR WE WILL SEE HIGHER CLOUD COVER TOMORROW AND THAT WILL ALSO HELP LIMIT THOSE CHANCES FOR HIGHER TEMPERATURES. FOR YOUR THURSDAY. SO WHAT'S HAPPENING IS WE HAVE THIS LITTLE DISTURBANCE OFFSHORE HERE. THIS IS GOING TO HELP ENHANCE THE CLOUD COVER TOMORROW, AS WELL AS OUR CHANCES FOR SHOWERS AND STORMS. SO EXPECT HIGHER RAIN CHANCES FOR THURSDAY EVEN INTO FRIDAY. BUT AS WE GO INTO LATE WEEK, THAT DISTURBANCE DOES GRADUALLY MAKE ITS WAY NORTH, LIFTING AWAY FROM US AND THAT LITTLE DISTURBANCE I'M REFERENCING TO IS ALSO THE SAME ONE. THE NATIONAL HURRICANE CENTER IS TAGGING, WITH A 10% CHANCE OF DEVELOPMENT OVER THE NEXT SEVEN DAYS, SO VERY LOW CHANCE. REALLY NOT EXPECTING THIS TO DEVELOP MAINLY FOR US HERE AT HOME. THE INDIRECT IMPACTS AS IT WILL ENHANCE OUR CHANCES FOR RAIN THURSDAY AND FRIDAY. SO HERE'S THAT PLUME OF MOISTURE ASSOCIATED WITH THAT DISTURBANCE. IT'S OFFSHORE BUT AGAIN IT WILL HELP BRING IN A FEW MORE SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS TOMORROW AND INTO FRIDAY LATE WEEK. BUT NOTICE AS WE GO INTO LATE FRIDAY THAT LIFTS OFF TO THE NORTH TOWARDS THE CAROLINAS AND BRINGS HEAVIER RAINFALL FOR FOLKS THERE. SO NOT REALLY HUGE IMPACTS HERE AT HOME FOR US OTHER THAN ENHANCING OUR RAIN FOR LATE WEEK. BUT THEN ALSO AS WE HEAD INTO LATE WEEK, IT BRINGS IN A BIT MORE TROPICAL AIR TOWARDS US. SO THAT INCREASES OUR MOISTURE AND THAT HIGHER MOISTURE, ALONG WITH THE HIGHER TEMPERATURES COULD BRING US NEAR HEAT ADVISORY. THIS UPCOMING WEEKEND. SO WE'LL TRACK THAT OUT FOR YOU. A VERY HOT, STEAMY CONDITIONS FOR THE UPCOMING WEEKEND.

SOME PRETTY HEAVY ONES YOU GOT GOING ON BEHIND YOU. YEAH, YOU PICKED IT UP BEFORE I WAS GOING THROUGH THE CAMERA. SHE SAID, OH, THAT ONE YOU GOT THE RAIN. I GOT RAIN ON MY GARDEN. THAT'S ALL WE NEED. AND THERE'S MORE RAIN AHEAD FOR THIS AFTERNOON. OUR WEATHER IS GOING TO BE VERY UNSETTLED TILL ABOUT DINNERTIME. I THINK, TODAY, BUT WE GOT SOME NEW INFORMATION FROM COLORADO STATE UNIVERSITY, FROM DOCTOR PHIL. NOT THAT DOCTOR PHIL, THE WEATHER DOCTOR PHIL. DOCTOR PHIL KLOTZBACH. HE'S THE GUY THAT'S TAKING OVER FOR DOCTOR WILLIAM GRAY. HE'S THE LEADING HURRICANE FORECASTER IN THE UNITED STATES. AND HE'S SAYING THAT YES, IT'S GOING TO BE AN ACTIVE SEASON. WE ALREADY KNEW THAT. BUT HE'S KIND OF BUMPED THE NUMBERS UP JUST A LITTLE BIT. NOW. 25 NAMED STORMS FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE SEASON 12 HURRICANES, SIX OF A MAJOR HURRICANES. THESE ARE JUST NUMBERS WE KNOW IT'S GOING TO BE AN ACTIVE SEASON AND WE'RE ALL PRETTY MUCH PREPARED. LISTEN, WE'RE ALL READY FOR BURIAL IN CASE IT STARTED TO TURN TOWARD US. OBVIOUSLY THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN, BUT STILL GOT ANOTHER FIVE MONTHS TO GO IN THE SEASON. ALL RIGHT, HERE'S THE RAIN THAT WE'RE TRACKING RIGHT NOW ON WDSU. FIRST WARNING RADAR A COUPLE OF THUNDERSTORMS. IT'S REALLY MORE RAIN THAN ANYTHING. SHOWERS THAT ARE MOVING VERY QUICKLY TO THE EAST AND NORTHEAST AT ABOUT 35MPH. RANDI SAID IT RIGHT. HAVE THE UMBRELLA IF YOU'RE GOING OUT ANYWHERE OVER THE NEXT THREE FOUR HOURS OR SO. NOW, THE GOOD THING WITH THESE SHOWERS MOVING SO QUICKLY, THEY ONLY BRING YOU RAIN FOR ABOUT 10 OR 15 MINUTES. BUT OBVIOUSLY THAT'S SOME PRETTY GOOD RAIN, SOME PRETTY HEAVY RAIN. THAT'S WHAT WE'RE SEEING RIGHT NOW. THE AIRPORT OFFICIALLY AT LOUIS ARMSTRONG INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT, 80 DEGREES TO THE TEMPERATURE DEW POINT AT 77. A LOT OF MOISTURE IN THE ATMOSPHERE RIGHT NOW. BUT WE'RE GOING TO START TO SEE A LITTLE BIT OF A CHANGE IN THE NEXT 24 HOURS. FOR SOME OF US, AS WE GO TO THE TROPICS, THERE'S NOTHING OUT THERE THAT THE HURRICANE CENTER IS WATCHING. AND THIS IS THE LAST ADVISORY THAT THEY'VE ISSUED ON WHAT USED TO BE BARREL. NOW IT'S JUST AN AREA OF LOW PRESSURE. STILL GOING TO BRING A LOT OF RAIN AND STILL DRAWING MOISTURE INTO SOUTHERN LOUISIANA RIGHT NOW. BUT HERE'S THE WATER VAPOR IMAGERY, THE DARKNESS THAT'S DRIER AIR. SOME OF THAT DRIER AIR GETTING CLOSER TO US AND MAY ACTUALLY WORK INTO THE NORTH SHORE TOMORROW, KEEPING THE CHANCE FOR RAIN THERE A LITTLE BIT LOWER. LET'S GO. HOUR BY HOUR. SHOW YOU HOW IT PLAYS OUT TODAY. OBVIOUSLY WE HAVE THE RAIN IN PLACE RIGHT NOW AND ALL THE AFTERNOON. THREE 330 STILL HAVE SOME RAIN IN PLACE, SOME MORE SHOWERS PROBABLY DEVELOPING IN THE GULF AND COMING ON SHORE. SO OFF AND ON RAIN FOR A GOOD PORTION OF THE AFTERNOON BY 8:00, 830 OR SO. THAT RAIN SHOULD BE WRAPPING UP. BUT TOMORROW LOOK WHAT HAPPENS. WE MAY HAVE SOME RAIN IN THE MORNING, BUT REMEMBER I TOLD YOU THAT DRIER AIR MIGHT MOVE INTO THE NORTH SHORE TOMORROW? NORTH SHORE, YOUR CHANCE FOR RAIN ABOUT 20 TO 30%. 60% EVERYWHERE ELSE IS MORE MOISTURE IS GOING TO BE MOVING IN FROM THE GULF OF MEXICO. SO ANOTHER UNSETTLED DAY FOR US, ESPECIALLY FOR THE SOUTH SHORE WITH THAT CHANCE FOR RAIN THERE. ABOUT 60% NUMEROUS SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS FOR THE REST OF THIS AFTERNOON. BREEZY WITH SOME WIND GUSTS UP OVER 20MPH. THEN TONIGHT THOSE SHOWERS SHOULD BE ENDING BY ABOUT SEVEN 730 8:00, AND TEMPERATURE IS GOING TO BE IN THE MID TO UPPER 70S TO START YOUR DAY TOMORROW AND ANOTHER DAY TOMORROW. WE'RE GOING TO HAVE SCATTERED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS, BUT AGAIN THE RAIN CHANCE A LITTLE BIT LOWER ON THE NORTH SHORE THANKS TO SOME SLIGHTLY DRIER AIR. STILL KIND OF WET FOR US ON THURSDAY. CHANCE FOR RAIN THERE AT 50%, BUT THEN WE'RE GETTING A LITTLE BIT DRIER BY FRIDAY AND SATURDAY AFTERNOON. HIGHS. GETTING BACK INTO THE LOW AND MAYBE MID 90S BY THE WEEKEND.

STRONG STORMS EXPECTED OVER PARTS OF NEW MEXICO. HERE'S JOE. THAT'S RIGHT. YOU SAW ABOUT THE BIG ACTION WE HAD EARLIER. THEY'RE GETTING SOME MORE RAIN PUSHING ON INTO THE SILVER CITY AREA. THE BIGGEST STORMS SEEM TO BE ACROSS SOUTHERN PARTS OF NEW MEXICO, AND THIS IS GOING TO BE DROPPING DOWN TO THAT I-10 CORRIDOR THERE. YOU SEE THE THUNDERSTORMS AROUND SILVER CITY'S RADAR ESTIMATES THERE ARE ABOUT 4/10 OF AN INCH OF RAIN. THESE AREAS AND THE GREEN MORE THAN AN INCH OF RAIN, A NEW SEVERE THUNDERSTORM WARNING TO TELL YOU ABOUT, BUT THIS IS IN A RATHER RURAL AREA OF DONA ANA COUNTY. BUT IT DOES HAVE SOME LARGE HAIL ASSOCIATED WITH IT HERE IN ALBUQUERQUE, 90 DEGREES. BUT I TELL YOU WHAT, IT IS A STEAMY ONE OUT THERE. WE'VE BEEN AS HOT AS 93. NOW WE'RE GOING TO HAVE POCKETS OF HEAVY RAIN TOMORROW OVER SOUTHERN AND EASTERN PARTS OF NEW MEXICO. WE'LL STILL HAVE A SEVERE STORM THREAT IN THAT AREA. AND THEN WORKING DRIER AS WE GET TOWARD THE WEEKEND. SO HERE'S THE DEAL. WE HAVE THIS SHOWER AND THUNDERSTORM ACTIVITY WITH THE HEAT OF THE DAY FORMING ACROSS THE CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN PARTS OF NEW MEXICO, THAT IS WHERE IT IS MOST ACTIVE. WE SEE THIS FLASH FLOOD WATCH CONTINUING TODAY THROUGH TOMORROW, ACROSS THE HIGHER TERRAIN, THROUGHOUT CENTRAL PARTS OF NEW MEXICO. NOW THE MOISTURE CONTENT AREA IN THE GREEN THERE COULD BE GOOD DOWNPOURS, BUT EVEN A BETTER PROBABILITY IN THE AREAS IN THE YELLOW. AND THAT'S WHERE WE HAVE THE RUIDOSO BURN SCARS. SO THAT'S NOT GOOD FOR TOMORROW. AS THE ATMOSPHERIC MOISTURE CONTINUES TO INCREASE AND ALONG WITH IT, THERE COULD BE SOME STRONG TO SEVERE STORMS WITH HAIL AND DAMAGING WINDS IN THIS REGION AS WELL. LET'S CHECK OUT WHAT'S HAPPENING TOMORROW MORNING IN ALBUQUERQUE 7:00 IN THE MORNING. GREAT TO GET OUTSIDE 67 DEGREES. WE GET INTO THE LOW 90S, AND THAT'S WHEN THOSE SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS COULD POP UP. NOW DRYING QUIET 7:00 IN THE MORNING. STATEWIDE, WE GET TO THE NOON HOUR. WE DON'T SEE A WHOLE LOT GOING ON, BUT ALL YOU NEED IS THE HEAT OF THE DAY. THESE DISTURBANCES RIDING ACROSS DURING THE HEAT OF THE DAY, AND THE STRONG THUNDERSTORMS OVER SOUTHERN AND EASTERN PARTS OF THE STATE FOR TOMORROW. AND THEN AS WE ROLL ON INTO THURSDAY, THEY'RE GOING TO START FROM THE NORTH AND DRIFT FROM THE SOUTH SOUTHWEST. SO A FEW MORE STORMS WHILE QUIETER CONDITIONS WORKING INTO EASTERN PARTS OF NEW MEXICO AND THE POTENTIAL FOR RAINFALL ACCUMULATIONS OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS JUST REALIZE IT'S GOING TO BE SCATTERED. SO TAKE ALL THESE READINGS WITH A GRAIN OF SALT, BUT YOU GET UNDER THE RIGHT STORM. THERE COULD BE SOME DRENCHING RAINS ALONG WITH IT. DRY SKIES THROUGHOUT THE FOUR CORNERS REGION, DAYTIME HIGHS WARMING INTO THE 80S AND 90S. SO DRY AND HOT FOR A FEW DAYS. THEN WHEN THE MONSOON MOISTURE SHIFTS, WE'LL SEE THE SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS STARTING TO INCREASE JUST A BIT. WE'LL HAVE MORE DROPPING DOWN IN THAT AREA AROUND SILVER CITY, ON INTO THAT I-10 CORRIDOR FOR TOMORROW. SO ACTIVE FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS BEFORE IT DRIES OUT A LITTLE BIT AS WE GET INTO SATURDAY, ONLY TO RAMP UP AGAIN AS WE GET INTO NEXT WEEK. BIG CONCERN AGAIN TOMORROW ABOUT FLASH FLOODING IN THOSE BURN SCAR AREAS AROUND RUIDOSO. SCATTERED DOWNPOURS, SOUTHEASTERN PARTS OF THE STATE. SOME OF THESE STORMS COULD BE STRONG TO SEVERE. DRIER SKIES START TO KICK IN TOWARD FRIDAY, AND IT LOOKS LIKE IT WILL BE DRY IN SOME OF THOSE BURN SCAR AREAS FOR A WHILE MORE. THESE BURN SCARS COULD BE A CONCERN AROUND THE LAS VEGAS AREA. BEFORE WE GET A LITTLE BIT OF A DRYING TREND, FRIDAY, SATURDAY AND TO SUNDAY, THE NORTHERN MOUNTAINS, WE'LL SEE ANYWHERE TEMPERATURES FROM 89 ESPANOLAS 83. IN TAOS, AND THEN SCATTERED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS. GOING INTO FRIDAY BEFORE A LITTLE BIT LESS ACTION WORKS IN FOR SATURDAY AND SUNDAY, AND THE METRO AREA. A GREAT START ON THE DAY, BUT STEAMY IN THE AFTERNOON WITH TEMPERATURES RIGHT AROUND AVERAGE. SO 92 DEGREES FOR TOMORROW, 93 THE FOLLOWING DAY WITH SOME ISOLATED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS TO WORK AROUND. LITTLE LESS ACTION, A LITTLE MORE HEAT FOR FRIDAY, SATURDAY AND SUNDAY. AND IN THE SHIFT TO THE MONSOON PATTERN, THOSE ISOLATED TO SCATTERED STORMS WILL WORK BACK IN FOR MONDAY ON INTO TUESDAY, BUT BIG STORMS CONTINUING TONIGHT IN SOUTHERN PARTS OF THE STATE AND AGAIN, THAT'S GOING TO BE KIND OF A CARBON COPY AGAIN FOR TOMORROW.

OUR TEMPERATURES ARE ALSO IN THE MID 90S RIGHT NOW, SO WE'VE GOT 95 IN REIDSVILLE, 94 IN GREENSBORO, 96 IN ASHEBORO AND THE FEELS LIKE TEMPERATURES ARE OVER 100 DEGREES LEXINGTON RIGHT NOW WITH A HEAT INDEX OF 101 AND 102. IN BURLINGTON. NOW WE HAVE STILL A LOT OF WATER IN THE AIR, BUT WE'RE GOING TO BE SORT OF DRYING THINGS OUT. YOU'LL SEE THE DEW POINTS GO FROM KIND OF THAT UNCOMFORTABLE, MISERABLE RANGE INTO A MORE COMFORTABLE SITUATION TOMORROW WITH A LIGHT NORTH WIND. IT'S BRIEF BECAUSE THE MUGGY SUMMER AIR COMES BACK FRIDAY, SATURDAY AND SUNDAY. WE ARE SQUEEZING OUT SOME OF THAT MOISTURE HERE WITH THAT FRONT. HEAVY RAINS COMING DOWN JUST EAST OF DANBURY, ALSO FROM KING ALONG HIGHWAY 52. HEAVY DOWNPOURS THERE AROUND BETHANIA JUST NORTH AND WEST OF WINSTON-SALEM. YOU CAN SEE THE FRONT THERE ON THE MAP ACROSS THE WESTERN HALF OF NORTH CAROLINA. ONCE THAT GETS JUST EAST OF US, A BIG CHANGE ON THE OTHER SIDE. OF COURSE, THAT MEANS SCATTERED SHOWERS AND STORMS GET PUSHED TO THE EAST. IF YOU HAVE SOME TRAVEL PLANS TOMORROW ALONG THE COASTLINE, STORMY WEATHER. BUT IF YOU STAY ACROSS THE MOUNTAINS, FOOTHILLS AND TRIAD, IT IS MUCH NICER. HIGHS WILL BE IN THE UPPER 80S AND AS I MENTIONED, IT'S GOING TO FEEL A WHOLE LOT NICER. THOSE DEW POINTS GET DOWN EVEN INTO THE 50S AND LOW 60S ACROSS OUR AREA. SO PLAN SOME OUTDOOR TIME TOMORROW. NOW, ONE THING WHEN WE START TALKING ABOUT DRYING OUT THE AIR AND WE'VE GOT THAT DRY GROUND AND WE'VE GOT A BREEZE TOMORROW, WE ARE MORE CONCERNED ABOUT HIGH FIRE DANGER, THREAT AND WE DO HAVE THAT TOMORROW IN THE TRIAD AS WELL AS THE FOOTHILLS. THAT LESS HUMID AIR IS WITH US WITH HIGHS IN THE UPPER 80S TOMORROW AFTERNOON. THAT NORTH WIND 5 TO 10 MILES AN HOUR. GREAT EVENING FOR BASEBALL TOMORROW. FIRST PITCH FOR THE HIGH POINT ROCKERS IS AT 635. WE'LL START IN THE UPPER 80S AND THEN DROP DOWN TO ABOUT 80 DEGREES AS THE SUN GOES DOWN YOUR FOOTHILLS. FORECAST FOR TOMORROW HAS A LIGHT NORTH BREEZE, A HIGH OF 88 DEGREES. COMFORTABLE. GOT A NICE START IN THE MOUNTAINS WHERE AROUND 62 IN THE MORNING AND THEN A HIGH OF 84 TOMORROW AFTERNOON. WE ARE KEEPING A CLOSE EYE ALONG WITH THE NATIONAL HURRICANE CENTER ON A LITTLE AREA OF DISTURBED WEATHER. IT'S A BROAD AREA OF LOW PRESSURE THAT'S JUST OFF OF OUR COAST. REAL DISORGANIZED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS. IT'S LIKELY GOING TO MOVE INLAND BEFORE IT HAS A CHANCE TO BECOME TROPICAL, SO TO SPEAK. BUT AS IT DOES MOVE INLAND, IT'S GOING TO HELP PUSH THAT FRONT OUR WAY SO THAT BY FRIDAY MORNING WE HAVE SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS IN THE FORECAST FOR A LARGE PART OF FRIDAY, RIGHT ALONG THAT FRONT. AND AS I SAID, THE HUMID AIR COMES BACK TO FOR FRIDAY AND EVEN INTO SATURDAY. SO THIS IS SATURDAY MORNING. MOST OF THE RAIN IS ALONG THE COASTLINE ON SATURDAY, BUT WE DO HAVE A SMALL CHANCE FOR SHOWER OR THUNDERSTORM HERE AS WELL. SHOULD BE DRY THOUGH EARLY IN THE DAY FOR RELAY FOR LIFE, WHICH IS AT CREEKSIDE PARK IN ARCHDALE. HERE IS YOUR SEVEN DAY FORECAST. YOU'RE GOING TO SEE THE HEAT REALLY COMING BACK NEXT WEEK.

ALL RIGHT, GANG, WE HAVE SOME ACTIVE WEATHER ON THE WAY THE NEXT. 24 TO 36 HOURS OR SO, BECAUSE THE REMNANTS OF BERYL ARE GOING TO BE LIFTING UP INTO THE LOWER OHIO VALLEY. THIS STORM CAME ASHORE JUST SOUTHWEST OF HOUSTON EARLIER THIS MORNING AROUND 4 A.M. LOCAL TIME, AS A CAT ONE STORM. IT HAS SINCE WEAKENED TO A TROPICAL STORM. THE WEAKENING TREND WILL CONTINUE, BUT STILL SOME OF THE WIND ENERGY, A LOT OF THE MOISTURE IS GOING TO BE LIFTING OFF TOWARDS THE NORTH AND THEN TURN NORTHEAST TOWARDS THE LOWER OHIO VALLEY. AS WE MOVE INTO TOMORROW, ESPECIALLY TOMORROW EVENING FOR OUR AREA. BECAUSE OF THAT TRACK WITH THE CENTER OF CIRCULATION MOVING JUST WEST AND NORTHWEST OF OUR VIEWING AREA, THAT PUTS US IN A RISK FOR A FEW STRONG TO SEVERE CELLS. WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO WATCH THIS. THAT'S WHY I'VE TAGGED TOMORROW EVENING A SEVERE ALERT PERIOD FROM 6 P.M. RIGHT AROUND DINNERTIME TOMORROW EVENING TO ABOUT MIDNIGHT TOMORROW NIGHT. THAT'S WHEN A SCATTERING OF SHOWERS AND STORMS WILL WORK ON THROUGH SOME OF THOSE COULD BE STRONG TO SEVERE. UH, SOME OF THE STRONGER WIND GUSTS COULD ACCOMPANY ANY OF THE HEAVIER CORES. AND THERE COULD BE SOME ISOLATED, BRIEF SPIN UP, UH, SPIN UPS AS WELL AS THIS THING WORKS ON THROUGH THE COVERAGE, IT'S GOING TO BE SCATTERED IN NATURE. I DON'T THINK EVERYBODY IS GOING TO SEE SEVERE WEATHER, BUT NONETHELESS, WE'LL WATCH IT CLOSE. WE'LL KEEP YOU POSTED. AND AGAIN, THAT TARGET WINDOW TOMORROW EVENING OUTSIDE RIGHT NOW IN TOWN WE HAVE PARTLY TO MOSTLY CLOUDY SKIES. IT'S WARM, IT'S SOUPY OUT THERE ISN'T IT? 91 DEGREES. THE DEW POINT NOW UP TO 66. A WEST NORTHWEST WIND AT SIX MILES AN HOUR. SO THEY FEEL LIKE 93. AND BY THE WAY, THAT HUMIDITY CONTINUES TO CLIMB. NOTHING ON THE RADAR SCAN AROUND LOUISVILLE OR SURROUNDING REGIONS, BUT WE DO HAVE A FEW SHOWERS APPROACHING FROM THE WEST AND SOUTHWEST. SOME LIGHT RAIN OVERSPREADING WESTERN KENTUCKY. FAR, FAR SOUTHWESTERN INDIANA. SO YES, A COUPLE OF SHOWERS WILL BE POSSIBLE ON A SCATTERED BASIS AS WE ROLL THROUGH THIS MONDAY EVENING. I THINK A LITTLE BIT LATER ON, CERTAINLY BY MIDNIGHT, EVERYBODY WILL DRY OUT. BUT BOY, IT'S GOING TO BE WARM AND HUMID OVERNIGHT TONIGHT WITH TEMPERATURES A MIX OF MIDDLE AND UPPER 70S. BY DAYBREAK TOMORROW. SPEAKING OF TOMORROW, HERE'S TOMORROW MORNING. OKAY, WE WAKE UP MOSTLY CLOUDY WITH YES, A CHANCE FOR SOME, SOME SCATTERED SHOWERS AND SCATTERED SHOWER, EVEN THUNDERSTORM CHANCES WILL CONTINUE THROUGH THE MORNING. I THINK WE'LL SEE A BREAK IN THE AFTERNOON AS WE HEAT IT UP. AND THEN AGAIN, IT'S TOMORROW EVENING AS SOME OF THE WIND ENERGY FROM BARREL MOVES UP FROM THE SOUTHWEST AND WE HAVE ADDITIONAL SCATTERED STORMS DEVELOPING. IT'S AT THAT TIME SOME OF THOSE STORMS COULD BE STRONG TO SEVERE FOR SEVERAL HOURS ON A SCATTERED BASIS. TOMORROW EVENING. AND THEN EVERYTHING WILL MOVE OFF TOWARDS THE NORTHEAST AND WILL QUIET IT DOWN THROUGH THE OVERNIGHT PERIOD. BUT YEAH, THERE'S THAT. THE SLIGHT RISK FOR SEVERE WEATHER REALLY, FOR MUCH OF THE VIEWING AREA LATE, LATE TOMORROW, TOMORROW EVENING, ON A SCALE OF 1 TO 5, THIS IS A TWO. BUT WE STILL HAVE TO WATCH FOR A SCATTERED STRONG WIND GUSTS. AND AGAIN, THAT POSSIBILITY OF AN ISOLATED SPIN UP. THE GOOD NEWS BY WEDNESDAY MORNING, BERYL'S REMNANTS ARE MOVING OFF TO THE NORTHEAST. WE'LL WAKE UP CLOUDY, BUT SEE SOME SUNSHINE PEEKING IN THROUGHOUT THE AFTERNOON ON WEDNESDAY. AS IT TURNS LESS HUMID, AS COMFORTABLE WEATHER MOVES BACK IN THE SECOND HALF OF YOUR WEDNESDAY. HERE'S THE FORECAST. WARM, MUGGY, A FEW SHOWERS. CERTAINLY POSSIBLE THIS EVENING WILL BE IN THE 80S. LOOKING THROUGH TOMORROW A LITTLE UNSETTLED. CERTAINLY A SCATTERING OF SHOWERS. WE'RE GOING TO CLIMB TO NEAR 90, BUT IT'S VERY LATE IN THE DAY. MORE LIKE TOMORROW EVENING. WE HAVE THAT THREAT, VICKY AND RICK, FOR A FEW STRONG TO SEVERE STORMS, SO WE'LL KEEP YOU POSTED. WE DRY IT OUT, IT CALMS DOWN. WEDNESDAY A LOT OF QUIET SKIES LOOKING AHEAD TO THE REST OF THE WORKWEEK THROUGH THE WEEKEND, BUT BOY, IT'S GOING TO HEAT UP. GUYS, WE'RE BACK IN THE LOW AND MIDDLE 90S WITH HUMIDITY. TYPICAL JULY WEATHER. YEAH, AS WE MOVE THROUGH THE UPCOMING WEEKEND, ALL RIGHT.

HEY, IF YOU'RE HEADING TO THE COAST HERE ANYTIME IN THE NEXT FEW HOURS, COUPLE DAYS YOU'RE GOING TO BE DEALING WITH SOME SPOTTY SHOWERS THERE.

WELL, AN EARLY HEADS UP TO STRETCH A DANGEROUS HEAT THAT WILL BE ON THE WAY THIS WEEKEND INTO EARLY NEXT WEEK, SATURDAY THROUGH MONDAY. EXPECTING HIGH TEMPERATURES. UPPER 90S NEAR 100 DEGREES WITH HEAT INDEX VALUES IN THE AFTERNOON. EARLY EVENING WELL INTO THE TRIPLE DIGITS, ESPECIALLY SUNDAY AND MONDAY. COULD SEE THAT HEAT INDEX CLOSER TO 110 DEGREES. BEFORE WE GET TO THE EXTREME HEAT, THOUGH, TODAY IS AN IMPACT WEATHER DAY WATCHING FOR SPOTTY SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS TO POP UP HERE AS WE GO THROUGH THIS AFTERNOON AND EVENING. REALLY BETWEEN 2 AND 9 P.M. IT LOOKS LIKE NOW THERE'S A LITTLE BETTER CHANCE THERE MAY BE A COUPLE STRONGER STORMS THAT COULD PULSE UP AND PRODUCE SOME LARGE HAIL. SO THE STORM PREDICTION CENTER HAS PUT THE SLIGHT RISK REALLY THROUGH SOUTHWEST IOWA AND NORTHWEST MISSOURI, AROUND THE OMAHA METRO, NOT EXPECTING ANY WIDESPREAD SEVERE WEATHER, BUT THERE MAY JUST BE A COUPLE STORMS THAT COULD PRODUCE SOME LARGE HAIL, BUT STILL POSSIBILITY THAT A LOT OF US GET THROUGH THE AFTERNOON DRY. RIGHT NOW, IT'S BEEN A GREAT DAY AT THE HENRY DOORLY ZOO, A GREAT DAY FOR THE SPLASH PAD AS TEMPERATURES WARMING UP 84 RIGHT NOW AT EPPLEY AIRFIELD 85. LINCOLN 82, IN RED OAK. WE'VE BEEN FAIRLY QUIET AROUND THE METRO, BUT A COUPLE LITTLE SHOWER STORMS STARTING TO POP UP HERE ON THE I-29 CORRIDOR SOUTH OF OTTAWA, HEADING TOWARD THE WOODBINE AREA. WE'VE HAD ONGOING THUNDER SHOWERS BETWEEN DENNIS AND CARROLL DOWN TOWARD AUDUBON. NOTHING SEVERE HERE, BUT JUST HEAVIER RAINFALL. SOME RUMBLES OF THUNDER. THOSE ARE DRIFTING TO THE SOUTHEAST, SO ZOOMING OUT A LITTLE BIT MORE, YOU CAN SEE MORE OF THE ACTIVITY HAS BEEN ON THE IOWA SIDE SO FAR THIS MORNING, BUT EXPECTING TO SEE MORE STORMS TO START TO POP UP AS THE AFTERNOON PROGRESSES. YOU SEE THE LITTLE SWIRL HERE. A LITTLE UPPER LITTLE BOY IS GOING TO DIVE SOUTH. COULD PICK UP A FEW MORE OF THOSE STORMS AS THE REST OF THE DAY GOES ON. SO LET'S WALK THROUGH STORM PREDICTOR WARM DRY HERE AT THE NOON HOUR AFTER 2:00 THREE 4:00, HINTING AT AGAIN, JUST SOME SPOTTY STORM ACTIVITY. NOT EVERYONE IS GOING TO SEE HIM, BUT A COUPLE OF THEM COULD BE A LITTLE MORE POTENT AS WE HEAD INTO THE EVENING AGAIN, ESPECIALLY MORE IN SOUTHWEST IOWA AND NORTHWEST MISSOURI. SOME OF THESE COULD BE THE HAIL MAKERS, AND THEN AS WE GET TOWARD AND AFTER SUNSET, THE STORM THREAT MOVES OUT, WE CLEAR OUT TOMORROW MORNING, STARTING OFF FAIRLY MILD, LOW TO MID 60S AGAIN. COULD HAVE MORE OF THAT HAZY SUNSHINE WITH SOME OF THAT CANADIAN WILDFIRE SMOKE LINGERING AGAIN. MINIMAL IMPACTS AIR QUALITY, BUT WE'LL SEE THOSE TEMPERATURES BACK UP IN THE MID AND UPPER 80S. AND THEN THE HEAT IS ON AS WE HEAD INTO THE WEEKEND. YOU SEE THE SEVERE DAYS WITH THOSE TEMPERATURES APPROACHING 100 DEGREES. AND THOSE FEELS LIKE TEMPERATURES. WELL INTO THE TRIPLE DIGITS.

TURNING TO WEATHER NOW, AND MOST OF OUR DAY WAS DRY, BUT STILL HOT AND STICKY. METEOROLOGIST LINDSEY SLATER IS HERE! SO GREAT TO SEE YOU TONIGHT. THANKS FOR COMING. YOU'RE WATCHING THE REMNANTS OF HURRICANE BERYL. SO HOW DOES THIS IMPACT US OVERNIGHT? SO IT'S JUST TRYING TO, LIKE, SKIRT US A LITTLE BIT. AND IT COULD NICK SOME OF OUR SOUTHERN COUNTIES. SO I JUST WANT YOU TO BE READY FOR THAT. BUT YOU CAN SEE ON THE, ON THE LATEST RADAR IMAGERY, A LOT OF LIGHTNING ASSOCIATED WITH BERYL. YOU CAN ACTUALLY SEE THAT WE DO HAVE A QUITE A BIT OF THAT HEAVY RAINFALL THAT IS KIND OF PUSHING ITS WAY THROUGH MUCH OF ILLINOIS. BUT YOU CAN SEE IT'S JUST A TINY LITTLE BIT RIGHT HERE THAT COULD WORK. ITS WAY UP TO IMPACT AREAS. I WOULD SAY KENOSHA RACINE POTENTIALLY EVEN INTO WALWORTH COUNTY. THIS IS LIKE THE RAIN SWATH. AND YOU CAN SEE WE ARE WAY OUT OF THE AXIS OF ANYTHING HEAVY. AND THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE'VE BEEN FORECASTING A WHILE. WE KNEW THIS WAS NOT GOING TO IMPACT US IN A BIG WAY, BUT YOU CAN SEE SOME OF THOSE NUMBERS BETWEEN ABOUT THREE, 4 OR 5IN. WE JUST GET NICKED RIGHT THERE WITH JUST A LITTLE BIT, MAYBE A HALF AN INCH. YOU GET OUT OF THIS. HERE'S THE LATEST ON THE LEFTOVER BITS OF BERYL THERE. KIND OF GOES UP THROUGH MICHIGAN AND THEN UP INTO CANADA. AS FAR AS HOW IT COULD IMPACT US. IT JUST BRINGS US RIGHT THERE. YOU SEE THAT LITTLE BIT? THAT'S ALL I'M TALKING ABOUT. AND THIS IS HAPPENING OVERNIGHT TONIGHT. GOING INTO TOMORROW MORNING. YOU CAN SEE THAT MOVING UP RIGHT HERE. IT KIND OF SKIRTS ALONG. AND THE MAIN BULK OF THIS REALLY STAYS OUT OF HERE. I DO NOT EXPECT THIS TO IMPACT YOU IN A BIG WAY TOMORROW MORNING. AND MUCH OF THE DAY TOMORROW IS NICE AND DRY. YEAH. YOU COULD GET LIKE A LAKE BREEZE. POP UP. KIND OF LIKE WHAT WE HAD TODAY. BUT THOSE ARE VERY FEW AND FAR BETWEEN. AND JUST LIKE TODAY, MOST OF THE AREA IS GOING TO STAY NICE AND DRY. SO WE ARE ACTUALLY STILL IN WHAT WE KIND OF CALL A DRY STRETCH, THE BEST THAT WE CAN GET, BECAUSE WE HAVE HAD SUCH A RAINY STRETCH. IN FACT, WE'VE HAD OVER A FOOT OF RAIN OVER THE LAST THREE MONTHS, AND THAT'S WAY ABOVE AVERAGE. HERE'S THE BEST THING YOU WANT TO SEE HIGH PRESSURE RETURNING TO THE FORECAST. AND THAT IS WHAT CAN HELP KEEP YOU DRY. SO THIS IS REALLY THE ONLY CHANCE I WOULD SAY, FOR ANY RAIN CHANCES. AND THEY WOULD BE EXTREMELY LIGHT. NO DOWNPOURS. YOU MIGHT GET A LITTLE LIGHTNING. THIS WOULD BE OVERNIGHT TONIGHT LINGERING INTO VERY EARLY TOMORROW MORNING. LIKELY GONE BEFORE YOUR MORNING RUSH. BUT I MEAN CHECK THIS OUT 25.88IN OF RAIN. SO FAR. AND THAT IS 7.5IN ABOVE AVERAGE FOR WHERE WE SHOULD BE THIS TIME OF THE YEAR. LAST YEAR WE WERE IN DROUGHT CONDITIONS AND THAT BROUGHT US AGAIN AT THIS POINT THAT BROUGHT US ABOUT, YOU KNOW, FIVE INCHES BELOW AVERAGE. WE'RE THE THIRD RAINIEST SO FAR FROM THE BEGINNING OF THE MONTH TO ALL THE WAY UNTIL NOW. AND 55% OF THE DAYS THAT WE'VE HAD HAS HAD MEASURABLE RAINFALL. HERE'S THE BEST PART ABOUT SUMMERTIME. AND YOU CAN SEE THE NEXT CHANCES THERE. SUPER HIT AND MISS. KIND OF LIKE WHAT WE HAD TODAY. LITTLE POP UPS KIND OF HERE AND THERE WITH A LOT OF FOLKS NOT SEEING A LOT OF ISSUES. SO THE NEXT SEVEN DAYS GET READY FOR IT, GUYS. NOT A LOT OF RAIN, NOT A LOT OF DOWNPOURS, WHICH IS GOOD. BUT WE ARE HEATING UP. IF YOU ARE A FAN OF 90S, GET READY FOR IT BECAUSE IT IS ON THE WAY. WHETHER YOU LIKE IT OR NOT. LOOK AT SOME OF THESE HIGH TEMPERATURES, EVEN KIND OF GOING OFF MY MAP A LITTLE BIT THERE. WE HAVE 76, 80, 84. AND THEN BY THE WEEKEND WE'RE TALKING HEAT. HERE'S THE PART THAT'S A LITTLE BIT OF A BUMMER, IS THAT IT ALSO IS HUMID. SO THAT HUMIDITY IS GOING TO MAKE THOSE 90S FEEL LIKELY MORE LIKE THE MID AND UPPER 90S, MAYBE EVEN SOME SOME TRIPLE DIGITS.

RIGHT. WE'RE DEFINITELY GETTING RAIN. HEAVY RAIN AT TIMES. AND WE'LL HAVE THE POSSIBILITY OF SOME STRONGER STORMS, ESPECIALLY AFTER ABOUT 7 OR 8:00 TONIGHT. AND WHILE WE HAVE HEAVY RAIN, AREAS OF HIGH WATER ARE POSSIBLE. ALSO, THE POSSIBILITY OF TORNADOES. NOW, THESE ARE NOT GOING TO BE THE SUPER VIOLENT, INTENSE ONES, BUT A TORNADO IS A TORNADO AND IT CAN CAUSE DAMAGE. THESE WOULD BE KIND OF BRIEF WEEK, NOT VERY LONG LASTING ONES. OKAY, NOT THAT THAT MATTERS IF YOUR HOME GETS HIT BY IT. CORRECT. SO LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THE RADAR BECAUSE RIGHT NOW WE'RE JUST LOOKING AT DOWNPOURS IN PORTIONS OF KENTUCKY. AND REALLY KIND OF RIDING RIGHT UP. I 71 YOU CAN SEE THE FIRST INTENSE RAIN OF THIS NOON HOUR. WE HAVE SOME HEAVY RAIN FALLING FROM JUST OUTSIDE OF MADISON INTO PLEASANT TO VIVI. AND RIGHT NOW, THE CORE OF THE MOST INTENSE DOWNPOURS RIGHT ALONG AND JUST OFF OF I 71 CROSSING FROM CARROLL INTO GALLATIN COUNTY. SO REALLY SEEING THAT RAINFALL PICKUP NEAR WARSAW AND GLENCOE. SO WANT TO KIND OF DIVE DEEPER INTO THIS, AND YOU CAN SEE THIS PINK BLOB HERE IS A HEAVIER RAINFALL RATE. WHERE THIS TO SIT OVER TOP OF ANY PARTICULAR TOWN FOR AN HOUR, YOU'D PICK ALMOST UP ALMOST FOUR INCHES OF RAIN. LUCKILY THIS IS MOVING AND IT'S MOVING IN AN OKAY CLIP ABOUT 2930 MILES AN HOUR OFF TO THE NORTH AND EAST. SO MAKING ITS WAY TOWARD THOMAS MOORE STADIUM. BY THE TIME WE GET TO LUNCHTIME AND THEN FLORENCE BY ABOUT 1:00. SO STILL GOT SOME ROOM BEFORE THAT HEAVIER RAIN MAKES IT TO THE 7175 SPLIT. WE DO HAVE SOME LIGHT RAIN SHOWERS FALLING ON THE 275 LOOP IN SOUTHEASTERN INDIANA, LAWRENCEBURG AND THEN CROSSING OVER INTO THE WEST SIDE. CLEAVES UP TO ROSS, SEEING A COUPLE OF LIGHT RAIN SHOWERS. SAME THING IN HARRISON AND THEN INTO BUTLER COUNTY. YOU CAN SEE LIGHT RAIN FALLING. ROSS TO HAMILTON RIGHT NOW IN THROUGH NEW MIAMI. LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THIS THING AS A WHOLE THOUGH, BECAUSE ALL OF THIS HAS TO DRIFT TO THE NORTH AND EAST AND COME THROUGH OUR AREA. SO EARLIER THIS MORNING IT WAS A LITTLE EASIER TO FIND WHAT WAS THE CENTER OF BARREL. NOW, MUCH MORE DISORGANIZED AS ALL OF THIS MAKES ITS WAY UP THE MISSISSIPPI AND INTO THE OHIO VALLEY. WITH THIS, IT'S A LANDFALLING TROPICAL SYSTEM. THERE IS THE POTENTIAL FOR SOME ROTATION OR SOME SPIN IN OUR ATMOSPHERE. AND RIGHT NOW IT LOOKS LIKE THE BEST CHANCES FOR THAT WOULD BE ALONG THE OHIO RIVER. YOU CAN SEE THIS AREA HIGHLIGHTED NOW IN AN ENHANCED RISK FROM EVANSVILLE TO JUST ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF OUR VIEWING AREA. IN FACT, IF WE ZOOM ON IN HERE, YOU'LL BE ABLE TO SEE CINCINNATI NOW UNDER A SLIGHT RISK, YOU HEAD OVER INTO SOUTHERN RIPLEY COUNTY, PARTS OF SWITZERLAND COUNTY, NOW INTO A MORE ENHANCED RISK, REALLY. LET'S CALL IT 75. AND WEST HAS A BETTER CHANCE OF MAYBE SEEING SOME OF THOSE STORMS THAT COULD PRODUCE TORNADOES. SO IT'S A WEATHER IMPACT DAY BETWEEN NOW AND 6 P.M., YOU'RE GOING TO SEE SCATTERED RAIN A THUNDERSTORM IN THERE, INTENSE DOWNPOURS ARE PROBABLY YOUR BIGGEST THREAT HERE THROUGH THE FIRST PART. STRONGER STORMS POSSIBLE 7 P.M. THROUGH 1 A.M. AND THE IMPACT WOULD BE BRIEF. TORNADOES AND HEAVY RAIN. RAINFALL AVERAGES ABOUT HALF AN INCH TO AN INCH AND A HALF, SO TORNADIC ACTIVITY POTENTIAL FOR INTENSE DOWNPOURS THAT WOULD CAUSE BRIEFLY, SOME LOCALIZED AREAS OF FLOODING THAT WOULD BE THE MAIN CONCERN. THESE ONES PROBABLY AREN'T GOING TO PRODUCE MUCH IN THE WAY OF GUSTY WINDS. SO AS WE GO THROUGH THE NEXT HOUR, YOU CAN SEE IT'S BRINGING THAT ONE BATCH THAT'S COMING THROUGH RIGHT NOW TO THE NORTH. QUIET THINGS DOWN, KEEP THOSE GRAY SKIES IN PLACE. HOPEFULLY THAT WILL HELP US OUT A LITTLE BIT HEADING INTO THE EVENING HOURS BETWEEN ABOUT FIVE AND 7 P.M., YOU'LL START TO SEE A FEW MORE OF THESE FLARING UP. AND THEN AS WE GO, SEVEN, EIGHT, 9:00 STARTING TO SEE MORE WIDESPREAD THUNDERSTORMS. I THINK OUR MOST ACTIVE TIME FRAME IS PROBABLY BETWEEN 9 P.M. AND ABOUT 1 A.M. YOU CAN SEE SOME OF THOSE HEAVY AREAS OF RAIN MOVING THROUGH GREATER CINCINNATI AND GETTING OUT OF HERE AS WE HEAD INTO TOMORROW MORNING, WE SHOULD SEE TEMPERATURES IN THE 70S AND BREEZY CONDITIONS TOMORROW WITH A COUPLE OF LINGERING RAIN SHOWERS. WE'LL PICK UP A DECENT AMOUNT OF RAIN, THOUGH. AREAS TO THE EAST QUARTER TO A HALF INCH FOR THE 275 LOOP IN THE 71 CORRIDOR, ABOUT A HALF INCH TO ONE INCH. AND THEN OUR HEAVIEST RAINFALL TOTALS CLOSER TO THE CENTER OF THOSE LEFTOVERS OF BARREL FOR ABOUT THREE QUARTERS OF AN INCH TO AN INCH AND A HALF OF TOTAL RAINFALL. SO TODAY, OBVIOUSLY A WEATHER IMPACT DAY WITH BENGALS RAIN TOMORROW, EXPECT TEMPERATURES IN THE 70S, WINDY THROUGH THE DAY, MUCH COOLER, MORE COMFORTABLE AS WELL. HUMIDITY STAYS DOWN FOR THURSDAY, BUT IT STARTS TO CREEP UP AGAIN BY FRIDAY EVENING. THANK YOU RANDY.

IT IS AN UNPLEASANT AFTERNOON IN PROGRESS HERE IN MARYLAND TO SAY THE LEAST. NOW, THE TEMPERATURES AREN'T ALL THAT UNUSUAL FOR THIS TIME OF THE YEAR. IT'S 92 AT BWI. YOU MIGHT SAY, WELL, THAT'S JUST JULY IN BALTIMORE, AND YOU WOULD BE CORRECT ON THAT PART. SO 92 IS NOT ALL THAT UNUSUAL. BUT LOOK AT THE DEW POINT 77 WHEN THE DEW POINTS ARE IN THE UPPER 70S. THAT IS UNUSUAL. THAT'S LIKE SOMETHING YOU'D SEE IN MIAMI IN THE SUMMER. SO THIS IS A TROPICAL AIR MASS HERE. AND IT'S THAT COMBINATION OF THE TEMPERATURES IN THE 90S AND THE DEW POINTS IN THE UPPER 70S THAT'S PRODUCING THE DANGEROUS HEAT.

AND WHEN YOU PUT THAT TOGETHER WITH DEW POINTS IN THE UPPER 70S, THIS IS WHAT IT FEELS LIKE AT THE NOON HOUR 106 AT THE AIRPORT, 104 DOWNTOWN BALTIMORE, 107 IN WESTMINSTER AND THOSE HEAT INDICES WILL CONTINUE TO CLIMB OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF HOURS, PROBABLY TOPPING OUT NEAR 110 IN SOME PLACES. SO YOU REALLY HAVE TO TAKE IT EASY IF YOU'RE GOING TO BE OUTSIDE FOR A LONG PERIOD OF TIME. THIS AFTERNOON.

SO LET'S TRACK THOSE USING OUR FUTURECAST. WE'LL SET THE TIME FRAME. YOU CAN WATCH IT HERE AT THE TOP OF THE SCREEN. THIS IS 2:00. SHOULD STILL BE MOSTLY DRY, BUT THERE'LL BE A LINE OF THUNDERSTORMS DEVELOPING TO OUR WEST IN THE LATE AFTERNOON AND EVENING. THIS IS 5:00, AND THAT LINE OF STORMS WILL CONTINUE TO PROGRESS TOWARDS BALTIMORE. SO BY 8:00, STORMS WILL BE STRETCHING UP AND DOWN THE I 95 CORRIDOR. AND SOME OF THOSE COULD PRODUCE DANGEROUS WIND GUSTS. AND THE POSSIBILITY A SMALL CHANCE, AT LEAST FOR SOME TORNADOES. SO WE'VE GOT TO KEEP AN EYE ON THAT. AND THEN THIS LINE OF STORMS WILL CONTINUE TO PROGRESS OVER ONTO THE EASTERN SHORE BY 11 OR 1130. THE GOOD NEWS IS, BEHIND THAT LINE OF STORMS, THE HUMIDITY IS GOING TO DROP DRAMATICALLY. IT'LL FEEL A LOT BETTER TOMORROW AS FAR AS THE HUMIDITY GOES, BUT HOT AND HUMID THIS AFTERNOON. THE HEAT INDEX BETWEEN 105 AND 115. JUST A SMALL CHANCE FOR A THUNDERSTORM DURING THE DAY. THE ACTUAL AIR TEMPERATURES WILL BE IN THE MID 90S. A GOOD CHANCE FOR THUNDERSTORMS TONIGHT, AND SOME OF THOSE COULD BE STRONG. THE TEMPERATURES WILL DROP BACK INTO THE LOW 70S, BUT YOU'LL NOTICE THE HUMIDITY DROPPING LATE TONIGHT AND TOMORROW IS ACTUALLY GOING TO BE A PRETTY NICE DAY. THE HIGH TEMPERATURES, UPPER 80S AND LOW 90S. THE DEW POINTS WILL DROP ALL THE WAY INTO THE LOW 60S. SO THURSDAY GOING TO BE A GOOD ONE. ON FRIDAY. SOME BENEFICIAL RAIN IS POSSIBLE NOW. SOME OF THAT COULD BE HEAVY, ESPECIALLY OVER IN THE EASTERN SHORE COUNTIES, BUT WE COULD GET A GOOD SOAKING RAIN ON FRIDAY AND THAT'S NOT BAD NEWS. SHOWERS LINGERING INTO SATURDAY MORNING.

OUR WEATHER HEADLINES HERE DAILY STORM CHANCES IN PLAY, FAVORING THE MOUNTAINS IN THE HIGH TERRAIN. PLACES LIKE ANGEL FIRE. UH, WE DO HAVE HEAVY RAIN AND FLOODING CONCERNS. ALSO, PERHAPS AN ISOLATED SEVERE WEATHER THREAT. BY FRIDAY, THE PATTERN CHANGES AND WE'LL START TO SETTLE SKIES. BUT THE NEXT FEW GOING TO BE ACTIVE AGAIN ON THE MOUNTAINS. THE BIG HIGH AND HEAT DOME IS OFF TO OUR WEST, ALMOST DIRECTLY ON TOP OF LAS VEGAS. SO THEY'RE THREATENING RECORD HIGH TEMPERATURES EVERY DAY. UH, PLACES LIKE LAS VEGAS AND THE GRAND CANYON AREA. UH, THE CLOCKWISE FLOW AROUND THE HIGH IS GOING TO STEER. STORMS GENERALLY FROM NORTH TO SOUTH. UNSTABLE FIRST ON THE MOUNTAINS. AND YOU CAN SEE THAT DOESN'T REALLY OCCUR UNTIL PROBABLY ONE TO AS LATE AS 3:00. AND THEN AFTER 3:00, STORMS WILL TRY TO ROLL OFF THE MOUNTAINS TO THE SOUTH AND EAST. HIGHS 80S LOW AND MID 90S RIGHT AT ABOUT AVERAGE. YOU KNOW, FEELING LIKE SUMMER BUT NOT OVERLY HOT. EVERYBODY SHADED GREEN HAS THE POTENTIAL FOR HEAVY RAINFALL. WE ARE ESPECIALLY CONCERNED ABOUT THE CENTRAL MOUNTAIN CHAIN, THE ESTANCIA VALLEY, AND DOWN THROUGH THE SACRAMENTOS. THESE ARE TWO DAY FLOOD WATCHES FOR SOME OF YOU. NOTE THE STORMS WILL TEND TO WIND DOWN DURING THE OVERNIGHT. IT'S GOING TO BE ANOTHER DIP BACK DOWN INTO THE 50S AND 60S. COMFORTABLE START ON OUR WEDNESDAY AND WE'RE NOT EXACTLY PLAYING A WEATHER RERUN. I THINK TOMORROW MAY EVEN BE MORE ACTIVE THAN TODAY, BUT YOU CAN SEE IT'S GOING TO BE THAT NORTH TO SOUTH FLOW WITH THE CENTRAL MOUNTAIN CHAIN IN THE SOUTHERN NEW MEXICO MOUNTAINS, PROBABLY THE MOST FAVORED AREAS. I THINK THE HEAVY RAIN THREAT IS A SMALL STEP HIGHER TOMORROW, ESPECIALLY THROUGH THE ESTANCIA VALLEY DOWN INTO THE SACRAMENTO MOUNTAINS AND THIS IS A SEVERE WEATHER OUTLOOK FOR TOMORROW. UH, BROAD AREA OF CENTRAL, EASTERN AND SOUTHERN NEW MEXICO INCLUDED ON THE HAIL AND GUSTY WIND THREAT THURSDAY. STILL POPPING THESE STORMS GENERALLY ON THE CENTRAL MOUNTAIN CHAIN AND THE SOUTHERN NEW MEXICO MOUNTAINS. ALBUQUERQUE KIND OF ON THE EDGE OF THE ACTION FOR THE NEXT FEW DAYS. UH, THURSDAY WILL BE YET ANOTHER DAY WHERE WE'VE GOT THE HEAVY RAIN CONCERNS. REMEMBER, FRIDAY IS WHEN THE PATTERN IS GOING TO CHANGE FOR US. NOW, THAT SAID, IN NORTHWEST NEW MEXICO, YOU MISS OUT ON TODAY, TOMORROW AND THURSDAY. STORM CHANCES AND WE'VE GOT THE HEAT SWITCHED ON. PROBABLY THE HOTTEST CORNER OF THE STATE ONCE THE PATTERN CHANGES STARTING FRIDAY AND CONTINUING FOR THE WEEKEND, WE ACTUALLY DO GET IN ON SOME, WELL, SMALL STORM CHANCES. LOOK AT FRIDAY AND SATURDAY UP THERE AT 97 SOUTHWESTERN NEW MEXICO SKIES RIPE FOR STORMS FOR THE NEXT FEW, WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT HEAVY RAINFALL. HIGHS EITHER UPPER 80S TO THE MID 90S, LESS ACTIVE FRIDAY SATURDAY, MAYBE NOT ALL THE WAY DRY, AND THEN A LITTLE BIT HIGHER ON THE STORM CHANCES. SUNDAY MONDAY. HERE'S SOUTHEAST NEW MEXICO IN ON A GOOD STORM CHANCE. THE SACRAMENTO MOUNTAINS AND AREAS AROUND RUIDOSO NOW OFF OF THE MOUNTAINS. IT'S ONLY GOING TO BE A SLIGHT CHANCE AT STORMS. PROBABLY A LITTLE BETTER CHANCE TOMORROW WITH THAT ASSOCIATED SEVERE WEATHER THREAT THAN TODAY. AND THEN THURSDAY WE'LL STEP DOWN THE STORM CHANCES WHEN THE PATTERN CHANGES. FRIDAY, SATURDAY WE DRY ALL THE WAY OUT, BUT WE DON'T HAVE ANY HUNDREDS IN OUR FORECAST. NORTHEAST NEW MEXICO STORMS WILL TRY TO SLIDE OFF THE SANGRE DE CRISTOS FROM THE NORTH AND WEST, AND LIKELY WILL CROSS THE I-25 CORRIDOR. PRETTY ACTIVE TODAY AND TOMORROW, A LITTLE LESS SO ON THURSDAY, FRIDAY, SATURDAY, SUNDAY, MAYBE NOT TALKING ABOUT ALL THE WAY DRY SKIES, BUT RAIN CHANCES WILL BE QUITE LOW. NORTH CENTRAL NEW MEXICO WE DO EXPECT SCATTERED STORMS, ESPECIALLY UP ON THE MOUNTAINS. REALLY CONCERNED ABOUT THOSE WILDFIRE BURN SCARS. LOW IN MID 80S FOR SANTA FE FOR THE NEXT FEW DAYS, STORM CHANCES WILL BE LOWER FRIDAY SATURDAY. THEY MAY NOT COMPLETELY GO AWAY THOUGH. HERE IN THE ALBUQUERQUE METRO, WE'RE ON THE EDGE OF THE STORM CHANCES WITH HIGHS IN THE LOWER HALF OF THE 90S. OUR AVERAGE HIGH FOR THIS TIME OF YEAR IS 92 DEGREES. THAT'S THE EXPECTATION FOR THE NEXT FEW DAYS. WE'LL CALL THEM 20% STORM CHANCES HOTTER WITH THOSE LOWER 10% STORM CHANCES.

UM, IT'S FUNNY THEY MENTIONED THE UMBRELLA OF COURSE, A VERY NICE TIME OF YEAR TO HAVE THAT ON HAND. SURE CAN SHADE FROM THE SUN TOO. A LOT OF PEOPLE DO THAT TOO. I'M GOING TO NEED SOME SHADE AT SOME POINT TODAY. YEAH, WE ARE AVID BLOOD DONORS. THE TWO OF US. AND ONE THING THEY TELL YOU TO DO IS MAKE SURE YOU HYDRATE FOR FULL 24 HOURS IN ADVANCE THAT COULDN'T BE MORE CLEAR ON A DAY LIKE TODAY, NOT ONLY ARE YOU GIVING, DONATING OR NOT, YEAH, YOU JUST REALLY NEED TO HYDRATE IN SITUATIONS LIKE THIS. IT IS REALLY HUMID OUTSIDE, AND ONE OF THE REASONS WHY IS BECAUSE WE HAD A TROPICAL SYSTEM. COME ON SHORE. YOU CAN ACTUALLY TRACE THE MOISTURE, TRACE THE SHOWERS COMING OUT OF THE GULF OF MEXICO. IT'S NOT JUST THE FACT THAT THIS MADE LANDFALL IN TEXAS. THE REMNANTS OF BERYL ARE UP THIS WAY. BUT LOOK AT THIS. THE HUGE AREA THAT'S BEING IMPACTED BY THIS, THESE DRAWING. I'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THIS FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS. A HUGE AMOUNT OF MOISTURE OUT OF THE GULF OF MEXICO IS RIDING UP THIS. AND THAT'S WHY OUR HUMIDITY LEVELS ARE HIGHER THAN THEY NORMALLY ARE DURING A TYPICAL JULY DAY. I MEAN, IT'S ALREADY HOT. WE DON'T NEED ANY HELP FROM HIGH HUMIDITY, BUT IT'S CERTAINLY HIGH ENOUGH TO DRIVE THAT HEAT INDEX QUITE HIGH. WE ARE UNDER A HEAT ADVISORY FROM REALLY ALABAMA ALL THE WAY UP TOWARD PARTS OF NEW ENGLAND, AND AN EXCESSIVE HEAT WARNING IN PORTIONS OF WEST VIRGINIA. LOCALLY, THAT DOES INCLUDE THE PIEDMONT TRIAD AREAS AS FAR WEST AS DAVIE AND ROWAN COUNTY. BUT AS WE'RE SEEING ALREADY, EVEN PLACES LIKE SURRY, YADKIN, WILKES COUNTIES ARE SEEING THAT HEAT INDEX REACH THE MID TO UPPER 90S WITH SOME ROOM TO TAKE THOSE INTO THE TRIPLE DIGITS LATER ON. TODAY. IF YOU LOOK ACROSS THAT AREA, I JUST SHOWED YOU THAT'S WHERE THE HIGHEST HUMIDITY RESIDES. AND ALREADY THE HEAT INDEX. NOW AT LUNCHTIME OR EVEN AREAS FARTHER WEST ARE NOT EVEN AT LUNCHTIME YET. WE HAVE THE HEAT INDEX IN THE MID TO UPPER 90S, CLOSER TO HOME IT FEELS LIKE 95. IN ASHEBORO, 97 IN LEXINGTON, AND ALREADY 100 DEGREES IS THE HEAT INDEX IN REIDSVILLE. AND WE'RE ALSO SEEING SOME TOWERING CLOUDS BEGIN TO DEVELOP PATCHY CLOUDS AND SUNSHINE TODAY THAT HIGH HUMIDITY REALLY THE FUEL TO HELP BUILD THESE SHOWERS. THERE'S NOT A LOT TO THEM. WE'RE NOT EXPECTING ANYTHING SEVERE TODAY. THERE ISN'T A LOT OF WIND TO PUSH THEM ALONG OR TO HELP GET THEM ORGANIZED, BUT THEY WILL POP UP. THEY WILL BRING A BRIEF RAIN. THEY SHOULD COLLAPSE AS TEMPERATURES HEAT UP. THEY MIGHT BE BEGIN TO GET MORE INTENSE AND PRODUCE SOME TROPICAL DOWNPOURS. OUR HIGH TODAY AROUND 93 DEGREES. THAT MAKES THE LIST TO ONE OF THE HOTTEST DAYS WE'VE SEEN SO FAR IN 2024. WE STAY WARM THIS EVENING WITH THE HIGH HUMIDITY. I THINK OUR RAIN CHANCES IN THE TRIAD SHOULD PEAK LATER THIS AFTERNOON. ABOUT 30% TODAY, BUT IT WILL BE A HIGHER CHANCE IN PLACES FARTHER WEST, INCLUDING SOME OF THE FOOTHILLS COMMUNITIES WHERE TEMPERATURES ARE ALSO EXPECTED TO REACH THE LOWER 90S THIS AFTERNOON. AND MANY OF OUR MOUNTAIN LOCATIONS THAT SHOULD GET UP TO AROUND 84 DEGREES TODAY, 40% CHANCE OF WET WEATHER WEST OF THE YADKIN RIVER EXPECTED TODAY, AND IT'S GOING TO BE A CALLING THE BOYS OF SUMMER FOR A REASON. BASEBALL GAMES TONIGHT ARE GOING TO FEEL AWFULLY SULTRY OUTSIDE GAME ONE OF THE BATTLE OF I-40 BETWEEN THE GRASSHOPPERS AND THE DASH. SIX 31ST PITCH STILL CLOSE TO 90 DEGREES, FEELING EVEN HOTTER THAN THAT. THE ROCKERS SHOULD BE MAYBE A LITTLE BIT MILDER WITH A HALF AN HOUR DELAY AT THE START. LEXINGTON LEGENDS ARE THERE. OPPONENTS WILL BE A HOT NIGHT AT ANY BALLPARK. YOU MIGHT GO TO LATER TONIGHT. STILL VERY HUMID TOMORROW. WE START OFF VERY WARM IN THE MORNING. SHOULD GET A BREAK IN THE HUMIDITY FOR THURSDAY.

Is oil drilling to blame?", "body": "Alexis Simmerman, Elizabeth Weise and Ronald W. Erdrich, USA TODAY\n\nScurry County officials have declared a state of emergency after over 100 earthquakes shook West Texas over the past eight days.\n\nLast Friday, Scurry County Judge Dan Hicks issued a disaster declaration and asked the state of Texas for aid amid a staggering number of earthquakes in the area. At the time, 61 earthquakes had hit the county in the previous week. Hicks wrote that since the first earthquake, registering magnitude 4.9, was felt the night of July 22, \"damage has been found throughout Scurry County in businesses and residences.\"\n\nThe county's buildings can weather a few quakes here and there, but the cumulative effects of so many small ones, punctuated by larger shaking, have become a cause for concern.\n\nFrom his second-floor office in the Scurry County Courthouse, Hicks told the Abilene Reporter-News, part of the USA TODAY Network, workers in the building became alarmed during a5.0 quake Friday, which hit at 9:28 a.m. local time. Trophies rattled inside display cabinets, and pictures bounced against the walls.\n\n\"The building was shaking pretty good,\" Hicks said.\n\nFrom the first large quake of magnitude 4.9, Scurry County has experienced a total of 103 earthquakes, including 12 of magnitude three or more, said Justin Rubinstein, a geophysicist with the U.S. Geological Survey in Menlo Park, California.\n\nUnlike California, Texas doesn't typically experience a lot of seismic activity. The cluster of earthquakes in its western region is not believed to be naturally occurring. Instead, it is \"almost 99% likely\" to be linked to local oil fields, Rubinstein said.\n\n\"We can say with confidence that these are related to oil and gas extractions,\" he said.\n\nThe temblors are very likely linked to new forms of oil and natural gas drilling technology that allow companies to drill first down into the earth and then horizontally along an oil formation. They are reaching deeply buried oil and natural gas deposits that are the decomposed remnants of plants and animals in ancient oceans. When the oil comes up, the salt water, which can be millions of years old, also comes up.\n\nThis is called \"produced water,\" and there's a lot of it.\n\n\"The ratio of oil to saltwater is low. It can be five or 10 or even 20 barrels of saltwater for every barrel of oil,\" said Rubinstein.\n\nEven saltier than ocean water, this prehistoric water can't be disposed of in rivers or even the ocean, in part, because it can contain contaminants such as hydrocarbons. Instead, it must be pumped back deep underground where it cannot leech into groundwater, a process called saltwater disposal.\n\nThe large amounts of water being pumped underground can then cause earthquakes.\n\n\"We've found evidence that saltwater disposal is the most likely cause of the earthquakes in Scurry County. This specific area has seen seismic activity going back to 2020,\" Rubinstein said.\n\nOfficially called the moment magnitude scale, magnitude is a measurement of the strength of an earthquake. It's a logarithmic scale, so each number is 10 times as strong as the one before it. For example, a 5.2 earthquake is moderate, while a 6.2 is strong.\n\nOn Friday, the Railroad Commission of Texas -- which regulates the state's oil and natural gas industry -- announced it was looking into any connections between the tremors and the injection of fluids into the ground for the extraction of petroleum products.\n\n\"In efforts to reduce seismicity possibly caused by underground injection of produced water, several operators in the area have converted deep saltwater disposal wells to shallow saltwater disposal wells within the last year,\" the Commission said in an emailed statement.\n\nCommission inspectors are now inspecting saltwater disposal wells within 2.5 miles of the cluster of earthquakes.\n\n\"The RRC has shut-in two deep disposal wells in the area following inspections; and staff will continue to monitor wells and seismicity data to mitigate earthquakes and protect the environment and residents in the region,\" the statement said.\n\nMore on the RRC: As nerves fray, Railroad Commission to investigate Snyder quakes for fracking connection\n\nThe entirety of the Railroad Commission of Texas' statement on the recent earthquakes is as follows:\n\n\"The RRC has been investigating the earthquakes that have occurred this week in the Camp Springs area along the Fisher/Scurry county line in West Texas. In efforts to reduce seismicity possibly caused by underground injection of produced water, several operators in the area have converted deep saltwater disposal wells to shallow saltwater disposal wells within the last year. (Disposal wells are used to dispose produced water, which is water that comes out from wells during oil and gas production.) RRC inspectors are out inspecting saltwater disposal wells within two and a half miles of the cluster of earthquakes this week and the RRC will evaluate next steps that can be taken to mitigate earthquakes. We'll continue to take measures necessary to protect the environment and residents in the area.\"", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

This unusual seismic activity has raised concerns and prompted officials to take immediate action to ensure public safety and assess infrastructural damage. Scurry County Judge Dan Hicks wrote in his Friday declaration of disaster that since the first earthquake, registering magnitude 4.9, was felt the night of July 22, \"damage has been found throughout Scurry County in businesses and residences.\"\n\nThe sequence of tremors began with a significant 4.9 magnitude quake and has since included a dozen earthquakes of magnitude three or more. The largest of these, a 5.0 magnitude quake, caused noticeable disturbances, rattling trophies in display cabinets and causing pictures to bounce against walls in the Scurry County Courthouse.\n\nThe cause of these earthquakes has been a topic of much discussion and analysis. Geophysicist Justin Rubinstein from the U.S. Geological Survey has stated, \"We can say with confidence that these are related to oil and gas extractions,\" he said.\n\nThe process involves drilling not only vertically but also horizontally, reaching deep into the earth to access oil and natural gas deposits. The resulting 'produced water', a byproduct of this extraction, is much saltier than ocean water and must be disposed of by pumping it back underground, a practice known as saltwater disposal. The large amounts of water being pumped underground in turn can cause earthquakes. \"We've found evidence that saltwater disposal is the most likely cause of the earthquakes in Scurry County. This specific area has seen seismic activity going back to 2020,\" Rubinstein said.\n\nThis has been identified as the most likely cause of the earthquakes in Scurry County, an area that has experienced seismic activity related to oil and gas operations since 2020.\n\nThe implications of this disaster declaration are significant. It highlights the potential risks associated with oil and gas extraction techniques, particularly in regions not naturally prone to seismic activity. The situation in West Texas serves as a reminder of the delicate balance between resource extraction and environmental stability.\n\nAs the community grapples with the aftermath of these tremors, questions arise about the future of oil and gas operations in the area and the measures that can be taken to mitigate such risks. The events in West Texas may well become a case study for industry practices and regulatory frameworks aimed at preventing man-made seismic activities.\n\nFor now, the focus remains on recovery and ensuring the safety of the residents of Scurry County. The declaration of emergency allows for the mobilization of resources and support from state and federal agencies, providing much-needed relief to the affected community.\n\nThe situation is still developing, and further updates are expected as assessments continue and plans for remediation are put into place.", "source": {"uri": "lavocedinewyork.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "La Voce di New York"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fossil_fuel", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fossil fuel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richter_magnitude_scale", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Richter magnitude scale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earthquake", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Earthquake"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scurry_County,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Scurry County, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scurry County, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Texas", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "West Texas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_emergency", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "State of emergency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Produced_water", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Produced water"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Geological_Survey", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Geological Survey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geophysics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Geophysics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seawater", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Seawater"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Petroleum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_gas", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Natural gas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraction_of_petroleum", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Extraction of petroleum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_resource", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Natural resource"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal government of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seismology", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Seismology"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Water_Resources", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Water Resources", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Environment", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Environment", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Energy", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Energy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Carbon_Cycle", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Carbon Cycle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Natural_Disasters_and_Hazards", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Natural Disasters and Hazards", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://lavocedinewyork.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/fort-irwin-reacts-to-strongest-ca-earthquakes-in-two-decades-2aedbc-1024.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9778391", "eventUri": "eng-9778391", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-22", "textStart": 571, "textEnd": 578}], "sentiment": 0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 205, "relevance": 1}

According to Scurry County Judge Dan Hicks' proclamation of disaster on Friday, \"damage has been found throughout Scurry County in businesses and residences.\"\n\nThe structures in the county are resilient enough to withstand the occasional little earthquake, but the combined impact of frequent smaller ones interspersed with bigger ones is becoming a reason for worry.\n\nHicks told the Abilene Reporter-News, a division of USA TODAY Network, that employees at the Scurry County Courthouse grew worried after a 5.0 earthquake that struck at 9:28 a.m. local time on Friday from his second-floor office. Pictures rocked against the walls, while trophies thumped within display cases.\n\nAccording to Hicks, \"the building was shaking pretty good.\"\n\nIn all, the county has seen 103 earthquakes since the first significant one of magnitude 4.9, with 12 of them being three or higher, according to Justin Rubinstein, a geophysicist with the U.S. Geological Survey in Menlo Park, California.\n\nSince Texas is not a very seismically active region of the nation, the recent wave of earthquakes is not a naturally occurring occurrence. Rather, Rubinstein said that it is \"almost 99% likely\" connected to nearby oil fields.\n\n\"We have no doubts that these are connected to the extraction of oil and gas,\" he said.\n\nThe earthquakes are most likely related to recent developments in natural gas and oil drilling technologies that enable businesses to drill horizontally along an oil formation in addition to deeply into the ground.\n\nDeeply buried reserves of natural gas and oil are being reached; these are the skeletal remains of extinct marine life. The saline water, which might be millions of years old, rises with the oil.\n\nIt is referred to as \"produced water\" and is abundant.\n\n\"Oil to seawater ratio is low. For every barrel of oil, there may be five, ten, or even twenty barrels of seawater,\" Rubinstein said.\n\nBecause it may include pollutants like hydrocarbons, this ancient water cannot be dumped in rivers or the ocean as it is much saltier than ocean water.\n\nRather, saltwater disposal -- a procedure that involves pumping the material back down below where it cannot seep into groundwater -- must be carried out.\n\nIn turn, the massive volumes of water injected underground may trigger seismic activity. \"We have data that suggests the most probable cause of the earthquakes in Scurry County is the discharge of seawater. Since 2020, there has been seismic activity in this particular location, according to Rubinstein.\n\nInterpretation: You cannot feel earthquakes, although they occur often. A reference for their measurement\n\nAn earthquake's intensity is determined by its magnitude. The moment magnitude scale is the official name for it. Because the scale is logarithmic, each number is ten times more powerful than the one before it. Thus, an earthquake with a magnitude of 5.2 is considered moderate, whereas one with a magnitude of 6.2 is considered intense.\n\nThe Texas Railroad Commission, which oversees the oil and natural gas sector in the state, said on Friday that it was investigating potential links between the seismic activity and the injection of fluids underground to extract petroleum products.\n\n\"In efforts to reduce seismicity possibly caused by underground injection of produced water, several operators in the area have converted deep saltwater disposal wells to shallow saltwater disposal wells within the last year,\" the Commission said in a statement.\n\nRight now, saltwater disposal wells within two and a half miles of the earthquake cluster are being inspected by commission inspectors. \"The RRC has shut in two deep disposal wells in the area following inspections, and staff will continue to monitor wells and seismicity data to mitigate earthquakes and protect the environment and residents in the region,\" stated the press release.", "source": {"uri": "chiangraitimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CTN News l Chiang Rai Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The source of the quakes is near Snyder, the capital of Scurry County, which has a population of just over 11,000.\n\nA seismologist with the U.S. Geological Survey told the Dallas Morning News that the tremors were likely linked to human activity, as some oil and gas operations in the area have been linked to quakes in the past. The Texas Railroad Commission, which regulates the oil and gas industry, sent inspectors to the area on Monday.\n\nJay Calloway, emergency management coordinator for the city of Snyder and Scurry County, spoke to the Texas Standard about the series of earthquakes.\n\nThis version has been slightly edited for clarity:\n\nTexas Standard: As of last Friday, Scurry County had experienced 61 earthquakes in one week. What's life like there now?\n\nJay Calloway: Things are going pretty much as normal for most people. People are a little bit worried about what's going to happen next. As of this morning, there have been 91 earthquakes in the past seven days, the largest of which was a 5.1 magnitude quake on Friday, I was told. That's the fifth-strongest earthquake to hit Texas so far.\n\nWell, can you give us some examples of property damage as a result of these earthquakes?\n\nThis phenomenon varies from place to place. The most common thing we see is cracks in walls and ceilings. We had a water line break in Snyder as a result, it happened on Monday night the 22nd, as a result of the first earthquake. Fortunately, our city utility crews were able to fix that water and get people back on water.\n\nBrick separation around windows and door frames. There are a few cracks in the foundation, and multiple areas. Their significance varies.\n\nYou mentioned that the county has issued a disaster declaration due to these earthquakes. What does that mean for any potential future repairs?\n\nWe have issued a disaster declaration to take the necessary steps to ensure the safety and well-being of all members of our community, and to be able to mobilize resources, if necessary, from the state to assist in the event that events continue to escalate.\n\nAs with any natural disaster, you can't predict the future. But issuing this declaration doesn't mean we're on the cusp of another major disaster. We've made the declaration to be more proactive.

Justin Rubinstein, a geophysicist with the U.S. Geological Survey in Menlo Park, California, has said Texas has experienced a total of 103 earthquakes, including 12 of magnitude three or more, reports 'USA Today'. He also said that the state is not a seismically active part of the country and these earthquakes are not occurring naturally. Explaining the phenomenon, Rubinstein said it is \"almost 99% likely\" to be linked to local oil fields.\n\nScurry County Judge Dan Hicks said that the first earthquake was felt the night of July 22, it registered a magnitude of 4.9 on the Richter scale. He also said that \"damage has been found throughout Scurry County in businesses and residences.\" He also said that the workers in the building were alarmed as the earthquake measuring 5.0 rattled them.\n\nTalking to 'USA Today', Rubenstein said that these earthquakes were related to oil and gas extractions. Elaborating on the cause of the unusual number of earthquakes, he said the temblors are very likely linked to new forms of oil and natural gas drilling technology. They allow companies to drill not just down into the earth but horizontally along an oil formation.\n\nRubenstein said further that temblors reach deeply buried oil and natural gas deposits that are the decomposed remnants of plants and animals in ancient oceans. The saltwater, which can be millions of years old, also comes up with the oil. He said further that the large amounts of water when pumped underground can cause earthquakes.\n\nHow many earthquakes have been registered in Texas recently?\n\nJustin Rubinstein, a geophysicist with the U.S. Geological Survey in Menlo Park, California, has said Texas has experienced a total of 103 earthquakes, including 12 of magnitude three or more.\n\nWhy is Texas experiencing an unusual number of earthquakes?\n\nJustin Rubinstein, a geophysicist with the U.S. Geological Survey said that these earthquakes were related to oil and gas extractions.", "source": {"uri": "economictimes.indiatimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Economic Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richter_magnitude_scale", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Richter magnitude scale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earthquake", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Earthquake"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Geological_Survey", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Geological Survey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geophysics", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Geophysics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menlo_Park,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Menlo Park, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Menlo Park, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Petroleum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Today", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "USA Today"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum_reservoir", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Petroleum reservoir"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_gas", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Natural gas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ocean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fossil_fuel", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fossil fuel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seawater", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Seawater"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Energy", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Energy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Natural_Disasters_and_Hazards", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Natural Disasters and Hazards", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 57}], "image": "https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-112147731,width-1200,height-630,imgsize-37516,overlay-economictimes/photo.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9778391", "eventUri": "eng-9778391", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-22", "textStart": 845, "textEnd": 852}], "sentiment": -0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 191, "relevance": 1}

The recent quakes damaged homes, infrastructure, utility lines, and other property, weakening foundations and cracking walls and ceilings, officials said.\n\nNo injuries have been reported, the city of Snyder Office of Emergency Management said on Facebook. Officials declared a disaster in Scurry County.\n\n\"Safety is our top priority for all of our residents, and so we wanted to make sure we had all the available resources at our hands if we needed them,\" said Jay Callaway, emergency management coordinator for the city of Snyder and Scurry County, of the disaster declaration. He added that despite resident concerns, a disaster declaration doesn't mean they were anticipating a \"big one.\" He said they continued to have small tremors on Monday.\n\nThere have been more than 50 earthquakes with a magnitude of 3 or larger -- the smallest quakes generally felt by people are magnitude 2.5 to 3 -- in the yearslong sequence, said Robert Skoumal, a research geophysicist with the USGS, in an email. A sequence is generally a swarm of earthquakes in a particular region motivated by the same activities, he said.\n\nWhile Friday's was the largest in the sequence, officials have also recorded a recent 4.5, a 4.9 on July 23 and a 4.7 last year. A water line broke in the city of Snyder due to a quake last week, said Callaway, but it has been fixed.\n\n\"This particular portion of the Permian Basin has a long history of earthquakes induced by oil and gas operations, going back to at least the 1970s,\" said Skoumal.\n\nThe Permian Basin, which stretches from southeastern New Mexico and covers most of West Texas, is a large basin known for its rich deposits of petroleum, natural gas and potassium and is composed of more than 7,000 fields in West Texas. It is the most active area of induced earthquakes in the country and likely the world, according to the USGS. The are many ways people can cause, or induce, earthquakes, but the vast majority of induced earthquakes in the Central United States are caused by oil and gas operations, Skoumal said.\n\nEarthquakes were first introduced to the area via water flooding, a process in which water is injected into the ground to increase production from oil reservoirs.\n\nFour other tremors larger than a magnitude 5 have rattled western Texas in the past few years. The biggest was a 5.4. \"All four of these earthquakes were induced by wastewater disposal,\" said Skoumal.\n\nFurther analysis is needed to confirm the specific cause of the region's earthquakes, but because the area isn't naturally seismic and has a long history of induced earthquakes, \"these recent earthquakes are likely to also have been induced by oil and gas operations,\" said Skoumal.\n\nOklahoma experienced a dramatic spike in the number of earthquakes in the early 2010s that researchers linked to wastewater from oil and gas extraction that was being injected deep into the ground, activating ancient faults deep within the earth's crust. The wastewater is left over from oil and natural gas production and includes saltwater, drilling fluids and other mineralized water.\n\nThe large increase in Oklahoma quakes more than a decade ago led state regulators to place restrictions on the disposal of wastewater, particularly in areas around the epicenter of quakes.

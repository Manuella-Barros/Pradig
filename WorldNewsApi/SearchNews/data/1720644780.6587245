During the press conference on Thursday, Miller was asked about a bomb strike carried out by Israel on an UNRWA school in a designated 'safe zone' in Gaza, in which at least 40 Palestinians were killed. Miller said it may be true that Hamas was 'hiding inside a school' and so it may be a legitimate target.", "summary": "<div style=\"float:left; width:30%\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/thumbnail_website2.jpg\" class=\"attachment-featured-img size-featured-img wp-post-image\" alt=\"US Spokesperson: &#039;Israel has a right to target civilians&#039;\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" 0=\"float:left\" decoding=\"async\" fetchpriority=\"high\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.middleeastmonitor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/thumbnail_website2.jpg?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/www.middleeastmonitor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/thumbnail_website2.jpg?resize=500%2C333&amp;ssl=1 500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" data-attachment-id=\"736307\" data-permalink=\"https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20240608-us-spokesperson-israel-has-a-right-to-target-civilians/thumbnail_website2-9/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.middleeastmonitor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/thumbnail_website2.jpg?fit=1200%2C800&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1200,800\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" d", "url": "https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20240608-us-spokesperson-israel-has-a-right-to-target-civilians/", "image": "https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/thumbnail_website2.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 14:13:47", "author": "Middle East Monitor", "authors": ["Middle East Monitor"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": 0.017}

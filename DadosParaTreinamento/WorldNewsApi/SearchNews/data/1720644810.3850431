The Blues coach has been brought in by Wayne Rooney\u2019s former assistant John O\u2019Shea who is now Ireland\u2019s interim head coach. The pair worked together at Blues during Rooney\u2019s ill-fated 15-game tenure. Shuttleworth is in his second spell at Blues having worked under Gary Rowett during his first spell at the club. He followed Rowett to Derby, where he worked under Rooney and would then go to DC United with the former Manchester United striker. Rooney brought Shuttleworth back to Blues last October and although he took a step back from first team duties when Rowett returned, also as interim, he remains at the club following Chris Davies\u2019 appointment as head coach.

The overwhelming share of imagery out of North Korea feels staged -- because so much of it is. Awkward and deferential people typically surround Kim, as they did his father and grandfather.

They gazed upon a sea of balloon-toting children. They reviewed a military parade and eyed a crowd waving pompoms. They saw - but were not shown interacting with - groups of North Korean citizens, who if the past is any indication were meticulously vetted before getting anywhere near the scene.\n\nThose images were vivid and plentiful, but they represented the predictable output of an experienced propaganda apparatus.\n\nFar more striking were the in-between moments that managed to peek through - also calibrated carefully, but revealing a smidgen more about the North and its leader than most imagery does. From stills and videos made by both Russian and North Korean state media operations (independent journalists were not given access to cover Putin's visit), the images were many and varied.\n\nHere was Kim showing Putin a bust he\u00b4d had made of the Russian leader as a gift. Here were the two leaders hugging, looking at horses and Korean Pungsan dogs, leaning in for informal conversations, laughing at a \"gala concert.\" And here were cutaways to the background of a state dinner - complete with camera dollies, rooms before the leaders entered and other outtake-style shots that surface less often in North Korea's home-grown imagery.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin, right, and North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un drive a Russian Aurus limousine during their meeting in Pyongyang, North Korea, on Wednesday, June 19, 2024. (Gavriil Grigorov, Sputnik, Kremlin Photo via AP)\n\nOne of the most impactful sequences came from Kremlin pool video, filmed just before Putin's arrival in Pyongyang. It showed Kim on the tarmac with his hands behind his back, silhouetted against the airport gate and a scarlet welcome sign behind him, pacing and awaiting his counterpart's presence. It was easy to imagine that Kim Jong Un was, for a moment, not the packaged leader of an authoritarian government but a weary man waiting for a plane after dark.\n\nPerhaps most noteworthy was the sense that all this was coming at the world in almost real time - mostly through Russian pool imagery. The North Korean government's own images usually present its leader and nation as stilted, rigid and slightly out of sync - and photos usually emerge well after an event takes place.\n\nAlso at play: Imagery from the North\u00b4s main propaganda organ, the Korean Central News Agency, has occasionally been digitally manipulated before being transmitted; stringent vetting is required before it can be used.\n\nPart of what made this week's images so compelling was the occasional appearance of spontaneity. The overwhelming share of imagery out of North Korea feels staged - because so much of it is. Awkward and deferential people typically surround Kim, as they did his father and grandfather. And often Kim appears awkward himself.\n\nBut in these frames and footage, amid the fast-moving nature of the week's events, that set-piece feel sometimes seemed absent. And it made North Korea appear more like other places, rather than reinforcing the \"hermit kingdom\" image.\n\nPhotos and video can distance us. They can draw us nearer. They can humanize. They can show, to the many, places that only the few see. And sometimes, collectively, they can offer some small epiphanies about a place, its people, even its leader.\n\nTo look at this week's photos and video from Pyongyang is to know just a bit more about what makes North Korea tick - even if that wasn't the primary intent of the propagandists who created them.\n\nTed Anthony, director of new storytelling and newsroom innovation for The Associated Press, was the AP\u00b4s Asia-Pacific news director from 2014 to 2018 and visited North Korea multiple times in that role.

They gazed upon a sea of balloon-toting children. They reviewed a military parade and eyed a crowd waving pompoms. They saw -- but were not shown interacting with -- groups of North Korean citizens, who if the past is any indication were meticulously vetted before getting anywhere near the scene.\n\nThose images were vivid and plentiful, but they represented the predictable output of an experienced propaganda apparatus.\n\nFar more striking were the in-between moments that managed to peek through -- also calibrated carefully, but revealing a smidgen more about the North and its leader than most imagery does. From stills and videos made by both Russian and North Korean state media operations (independent journalists were not given access to cover Putin's visit), the images were many and varied.\n\nHere was Kim showing Putin a bust he'd had made of the Russian leader as a gift. Here were the two leaders hugging, looking at horses and Korean Pungsan dogs, leaning in for informal conversations, laughing at a \"gala concert.\" And here were cutaways to the background of a state dinner -- complete with camera dollies, rooms before the leaders entered and other outtake-style shots that surface less often in North Korea's home-grown imagery.", "source": {"uri": "nationalpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "National Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Il_Sung_Square", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kim Il Sung Square"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_parade", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Military parade"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Korean_nationality_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "North Korean nationality law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Russian language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propaganda", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Propaganda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_banquet", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "State banquet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pungsan_dog", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pungsan dog"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camera_dolly", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Camera dolly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "State media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Independent film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Korean language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Horse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Putin", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vladimir Putin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Korea", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "North Korea"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "North Korea"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Cable_Television", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Cable Television", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Disabled/Travel", "label": "dmoz/Society/Disabled/Travel", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Korean", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Korean", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Disabled/Universal_Design", "label": "dmoz/Society/Disabled/Universal Design", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Video/Community_Video", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Video/Community Video", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 48}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9669167", "eventUri": "eng-9669167", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 179, "relevance": 1}

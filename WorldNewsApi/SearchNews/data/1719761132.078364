Ethan Page Reportedly Officially Signed with WWE Ethan Page made his shocking WWE debut on Tuesday night's episode of NXT, and it reportedly marked the start of a full-time run with the company. According to Fightful Select (h/t Nikunj Walia of Ringside News), Page has officially signed a. contract with WWE and did so over the past week after making a secretive visit to the WWE Performance Center in Orlando, Florida. Page appeared in the final segment of Tuesday's NXT show, attacking NXT champion Trick Williams from behind. Page also said he was the one who attacked Meta-Four members Noam Dar and Oro Mensah. Nicknamed \"All Ego,\" the 34-year-old Page was most recently with AEW. He joined the company in 2021 and remained there until this year. Page's most recent matches with AEW were a pair of Ring of Honor matches that were taped in February against Aaron Solo and Anthony Henry. Earlier this month, Fightful Select (h/t Joey G. of Wrestling Headlines) reported that Page was done with AEW after the company removed him from its roster page. The Canadian star had some success in AEW, including challenging MJF once for the AEW World Championship, but he was never quite able to maintain momentum as a major player in the company. His greatest success in wrestling came prior to AEW when he was with Impact Wrestling. Page twice held the Impact World Tag Team Championships with Josh Alexander, and they were known collectively as The North. Page appears poised to work as a singles competitor in NXT, and he has instantly been thrust into the NXT title scene. WWE sources were reportedly \"pleased\" with Page's debut, and while it is difficult to envision him beating Williams for the NXT Championship right out of the gates, the fact that he is already involved with Trick suggests that WWE thinks highly of Page. Jordynne Grace NXT Appearance Reportedly Leading to More WWE-TNA Crossover The first of two major surprises on Tuesday's episode of NXT saw TNA Knockouts world champion Jordynne Grace appear and challenge Roxanne Perez to an NXT Women's Championship match at Battleground. According to PWInsider.com (h/t Walia), Grace's appearance on NXT is reportedly only the start of a collaborative effort between WWE and TNA. There is reportedly expected to be \"some sort of NXT representation on future TNA events and programming as well.\" Grace made her WWE debut back in January as a surprise entrant in the women's Royal Rumble match. WWE acknowledged her status as TNA Knockouts world champion, and she had a hugely impressive performance. Now, Grace is set for multiple NXT appearances, as it was announced Tuesday that she will face Stevie Turner on next week's NXT before challenging Perez at Battleground. While no specific names were mentioned with regard to NXT stars appearing on TNA, Perez doing so would make sense in an effort to elevate her rivalry with Grace. TNA was the obvious No. 2 wrestling promotion in the United States behind WWE for quite some time, but with the emergence of AEW, TNA has fallen to No. 3 in the pecking order. However, TNA continues to exist and even thrive thanks to the presence of some great talent with Grace being at the top of the list. Any kind of working relationship with WWE is a major coup for a smaller company like TNA, and potentially having some WWE stars on its shows should ensure that more eyes are on the product moving forward. Timing Issues Reportedly Marred Morgan-Mysterio Kiss on Raw In a shocking storyline twist, Liv Morgan kissed Judgment Day member Dominik Mysterio following her successful Women's World Championship defense over Becky Lynch in a steel cage match on Monday night's episode of Raw. However, viewers who were watching Raw on USA Network in the United States did not initially see the kiss, as Raw went off the air just before it happened. According to Fightful Select (h/t Subhojeet Mukherjee of Ringside News), WWE missed getting the kiss between Liv and Dominik on the live airing of Raw \"by mere seconds,\" and the miscue was a result of \"miscommunication in timing and positioning.\" International viewers saw the kiss as it happened, while those watching on USA Network in the U.S. ended up seeing it on social media just minutes after Raw went off the air. It was a massive development in the storyline since Morgan is the mortal enemy of Rhea Ripley, who had essentially been the on-screen love interest of Mysterio for the past couple of years. At King and Queen of the Ring, Mysterio showed up during the women's world title match between Morgan and Lynch. He slid a steel chair in the ring in an apparent effort to help Lynch, but Morgan hit Becky with a DDT onto the chair and went on to win the title. Mysterio also got involved in Monday's steel cage match, opening the door and urging Lynch to crawl out. Braun Strowman was chasing JD McDonagh around he ring, though, and he bumped into Dominik, causing Dom to slam the cage door in Lynch's face. Morgan retained the title by escaping the cage and then kissed Mysterio in an apparent show of gratitude. Ripley is currently on the shelf and off WWE programming due to an injury, but she figures to be furious with both Liv and Dominik when she returns.

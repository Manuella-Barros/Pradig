The latest special, titled The End of Obesity, was released this weekend and parodies the use of weight loss drugs such as Ozempic by celebrities. In one scene, Eric Cartman is in his doctor\u2019s office, trying to get Ozempic in order to lose weight, however he can\u2019t afford it and his health insurance won\u2019t cover it. Instead, his doctor writes him a prescription for \u2018Lizzo\u2019. \u2018She\u2019s a really good singer who talks about body positivity, and just being happy with the way you look,\u2019 he explains. \u2018I want you to listen to Lizzo five times a day and watch her videos just before bedtime. https://www.instagram.com/p/C7aVrTeP94d/?hl=en \u2018I\u2019m afraid you\u2019ll have to be on Lizzo for the rest of your life.\u2019 An angry Cartman later noted: \u2018Rich people get Ozempic, poor people get body positivity!\u2019 Soon after the episode aired, the 36-year-old singer posted a video reacting to the episode, specifically a scene advertising the product. \u2018Guys my worst fear has been actualised. I\u2019ve been referenced in a South Park episode. I\u2019m so scared. I\u2019m going to blind react to it now,\u2019 she began. Her face dropped when discovering a drug was named after her (Picture: Lizzo/ Instagram) The fake ad pushing the Lizzo drug explained how it \u2018makes you feel good about your weight and costs 90% less than Ozempic\u2019, with one customer claiming they had \u2018lowered my standards and my expectations\u2019. As the ad played out, the singers face dropped and she looked shell-shocked as other testimonials were shared. The ad then said that 70% of Lizzo users \u2018no longer cared about their weight\u2019 and were able to \u2018eat what they want with minimal physical activity\u2019, but did face constipation as a side effect. The End of Obesity episode saw a drug called Lizzo pushed as an alternative to Ozempic (Picture: Paramount Plus) Instead of helping the characters to lose weight, it was a way for them to embrace body positivity (Picture: Paramount Plus) After it wrapped up, Lizzo weighed in. \u2018That\u2019s crazy. I just feel like damn, I am really that b****. I really showed the world how to love yourself and not give a f***, to the point where these men in Colorado know who the f*** I am and put it on their cartoon that has been around for 25 years,\u2019 she said. \u2018I\u2019m really that b**** and I show y\u2019all how to really not give a f*** and I will keep showing you [how to do the same].\u2019 Lizzo had an expletive filled response to the episode (Picture: Harry Durrant/Getty Images) Despite the intended use of injectable weight loss drugs like Ozempic being for managing blood glucose levels for people with type 2 diabetes, in recent years they\u2019ve been used by people trying to lose weight. Many celebrities, including Sharon Osbourne, Rebel Wilson, Amy Schumer, and Oprah Winfrey have admitted to using semaglutide GLP-1s to aid in their body transformations. Last month, Barbra Stresiand was slammed for publicly asking Melissa McCarthy if she had also taken Ozempic. After immense backlash from people who deemed her comment inappropriate, she posted: \u2018\u2018She looked fantastic! I just wanted to pay her a compliment. I forgot the world is reading!\u2019 South Park is streaming on Paramount Plus. Got a story?

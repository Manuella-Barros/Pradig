In an ITV Tonight programme interview this week, Sir Ed dodged questions about whether he would want to rejoin the European Union and said: \u201cWhat I\u2019m focusing on is what can be done in the next parliament.\u201d During Friday\u2019s seven-way General Election debate on BBC One, his deputy Daisy Cooper took a question about the party\u2019s pledge not to raise tuition fees in the coalition years. Ms Cooper described the broken promise as a \u201csore subject\u201d and \u201ca very difficult decision\u201d. After a round of adventure golf on a dinosaur-themed course in Berkshire on Saturday, Sir Ed said: \u201cIf the Conservatives stay in government, that\u2019s a bad result for the country. \u201cI said when I became leader of the Liberal Democrats, my top priority was defeating as many Conservative MPs as we possibly can (and) some SNP MPs in Scotland, because the Conservatives have got to get out of government and the SNP don\u2019t deserve any representation in Westminster \u2013 they\u2019ve governed in Scotland so badly, so that\u2019s the top priority. \u201cIncreasingly, people are seeing that in many parts of the country \u2013 here in Berkshire, but the Home Counties whether it\u2019s Hertfordshire, Hampshire, Surrey, Sussex, Oxfordshire, Cambridgeshire, so many parts of traditional Tory heartlands \u2013 that it\u2019s the Liberal Democrats who people should vote for if they want to get rid of this Conservative government.\u201d The party leader said there are \u201cmany reasons why\u201d he would not put a figure on the number of seats he would consider a \u201cbad result\u201d. He said: \u201cI don\u2019t like putting a ceiling on our ambitions, to be honest. \u201cThe way things are going, we\u2019re finding more and more lifelong Conservatives switching to us. It\u2019s been quite exciting for us, if I\u2019m honest with you. \u201cRishi Sunak \u2013 his track record and the Conservatives\u2019 track record is really poor. Their campaign has been shocking and frankly their betrayal of veterans by Rishi Sunak leaving the D-Day commemorations early has really, really cut through. \u201cThe veterans and their families are very upset and I think people who traditionally have thought the Conservatives are the party of patriotism no longer think that.\u201d The Liberal Democrat leader earlier said voters are \u201cjust flabbergasted by what the Prime Minister did\u201d \u2013 travelling back to the UK from Normandy before D-Day commemorations had ended for a TV interview. Mr Sunak has already apologised for his decision and wrote on X, formerly Twitter: \u201cThe 80th anniversary of D-Day has been a profound moment to honour the brave men and women who put their lives on the line to protect our values, our freedom and our democracy. \u201cThis anniversary should be about those who made the ultimate sacrifice for our country. The last thing I want is for the commemorations to be overshadowed by politics.\u201d Addressing Europe, Sir Ed said: \u201cI\u2019m very practical. \u201cAt the moment, the relationship between our country and our European friends and neighbours has been so damaged by the Conservatives, so poisoned by the Conservatives and people like Mr (Nigel) Farage, the chances of us having a quick rapprochement and improving the relationship is unfortunately not going to be likely.\u201d He added a stronger relationship with EU neighbours could help to tackle crime and human trafficking, and cutting prices through trade deals. Sir Ed visited two Conservative seats. In Wokingham, where the Liberal Democrat leader scored two over par on his first go at adventure golf, flanked by a triceratops and a Tyrannosaurus rex, Sir John Redwood has been the MP since 1987. The leader also visited Newbury, where Laura Farris enjoyed a majority of more than 16,000 in 2019. He played tennis with local candidate Lee Dillon in a bid to highlight the importance of outdoor activities. The party is trailing its pledge to create three new national parks, backed up by an extra \u00a350 million for these protected landscapes \u2013 which currently include the Brecon Beacons in Wales, the South Downs and the Lake District. Sir Ed Davey denied the Liberal Democrats are \u201cnimbys\u201d for focusing on national parks amid a housing crisis and low economic growth. \u201cYou\u2019ll see when we publish our manifesto we\u2019ve got ambitious plans on housing as well, but the right houses in the right places,\u201d he said. \u201cBut people don\u2019t just want houses, they want to know that there\u2019s the environment there to enjoy. And investing in the environment is right to deal with the nature crisis.\u201d", "summary": "\u2018I\u2019ve been determined in my leadership that we didn\u2019t mislead people about what is possible,\u2019 Sir Ed Davey told the PA news agency.", "url": "https://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/conservatives-newbury-daisy-cooper-berkshire-lib-dems-b1163069.html", "image": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2024/06/08/15/9134678c457718f5c29fe8dc97510173Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNzE3OTQzODQz-2.76452376.jpg?width=1200", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 14:43:10", "author": "Will Durrant", "authors": ["Will Durrant"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": -0.121}

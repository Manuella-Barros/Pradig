Many plaintiffs said they were threatened or rewarded to keep quiet.\n\n\"The State of Illinois has allowed a culture of abuse at Illinois Youth Centers to flourish unabated,\" the 186-page complaint said.\n\nThe lawsuit, filed in the Illinois Court of Claims, follows similar harrowing allegations of child sex abuse at juvenile detention centers in Maryland, New Jersey, New Hampshire, California and New York City. Some cases have gone to trial or resulted in settlements; arrests have been infrequent.\n\nThe Illinois lawsuit contends the state failed to supervise, discipline, remove or investigate alleged abusers, enabling the abuse to continue. The complaint alleges the abuse happened at youth centers in locations all over the state including Chicago, Joliet, Harrisburg, Murphysboro and Warrenville. Several locations have since closed.\n\nThe lawsuit names the state of Illinois, the state's Department of Corrections and Department of Juvenile Justice as defendants. It seeks damages of roughly $2 million per plaintiff, the most allowed under law.\n\nMessages left Monday with the governor's office and both corrections agencies were not immediately returned.\n\nThe 95 plaintiffs are among hundreds of victims of sexual abuse at Illinois detention centers, said Jerome H. Block, an attorney who brought the case and who expects to file more lawsuits. His firm has helped bring lawsuits in Maryland, New Jersey and New York City.\n\n\"The very people that were entrusted with keeping our clients safe when they were children were the ones perpetrating the sexual abuse,\" Block said. \"This is long-term institutionalized sexual abuse.\"\n\nThe Associated Press does not typically name people who say they were sexually assaulted unless they consent to being identified or decide to tell their stories publicly.\n\nThree of the 95 plaintiffs are named in the lawsuit, including Jeffery Christian of Maywood, who said it was important to come forward publicly because he thought it could help others who may be suffering in silence.\n\nThe 36-year-old suburban Chicago man said he was sexually abused at two different detention centers beginning when he was about 13, including by a counselor who groped and fondled him during counseling sessions.\n\nLike many of the plaintiffs, Christian said the abuse was reported at the time, but facility administrators did nothing to address it. He said reporting the abuse made him more of a target. After the incidents, he became withdrawn and anti-social.\n\n\"It prepared me to start looking at the world different,\" he said. \"It took some light out of me.\"\n\nAt least six detention center workers -- including a current mayor of a small southern Illinois community -- were identified in the lawsuit as alleged repeat offenders with separate accusations from different plaintiffs. Some alleged offenders are named in the lawsuit, while others are identified only as the plaintiffs remembered them by physical attributes, initials or nicknames. Most plaintiffs are identified by initials in the complaint.\n\nAmong other things, the complaint blames the state's use of unconstitutional and systemic strip searches as perpetrating sexual abuse.\n\n\"The State of Illinois has had notice of such abuse for decades and nonetheless neglected to protect its confined youth from sexual abuse and failed to implement policies necessary to ensure such protection,\" the complaint said.\n\nThe lawsuit cites a 2013 U.S. Department of Justice survey of incarcerated youth that found Illinois was among the four worst states nationwide for sexual abuse in detention facilities. It also notes about half a dozen criminal cases from 2000 to 2021 where youth center employees were convicted of sexually abusing children and alleges that abuse continues to this day.\n\nThe alleged repeat offenders include Rocky James, a longtime supervisor at the Harrisburg center who currently serves as the mayor of nearby Eldorado in southern Illinois, according to the lawsuit. Six plaintiffs separately allege that James abused them in the 2000s, including one teenager who was \"regularly and physically coerced\" to have sexual intercourse inside his cell and the bathroom, it said.\n\nJames, a former Eldorado city council member and Saline County board member, has served as mayor of the town of about 3,500 people since 2007. He has not been charged with wrongdoing.\n\nWhen reached Monday by telephone, James, 59, said it was the first he was hearing of the allegations.\n\n\"There's absolutely no truth to it,\" he said, declining further comment.\n\nCriminal charges are not beyond the realm of possibility in some of the more recent cases. Although there's no longer a statute of limitations on crimes related to the sexual abuse of minors occurring after Jan. 1, 2020, a 20-year limit remains on alleged offenses committed prior to that, allowing for the possibility of criminal charges in cases allegedly occurring as long ago as 2004.\n\nMany plaintiffs said their abusers threatened them with violence, solitary confinement, transfers to harsher facilities and longer sentences if they reported the abuse. Others were given extra food, money in their commissary accounts, the chance to play videos games and other rewards if they kept silent.\n\nThe plaintiffs ranged in age from 12 to 17 at the time they said they were abused, often while they were isolated in a bathroom, kitchens or in their cells. When detainees reported abuse, the lawsuit said it was laughed off, with one lieutenant saying, \"He's just playing around,\" or a chaplain who told a 17-year-old boy he allegedly fondled and was upset, \"This is what goes on\" in the church.\n\nThey are now adults, with the oldest in their early 40s. Most are men, but one of the detention centers was co-ed. They are from small communities and big cities, mostly in Illinois. Several are from Indiana, Wisconsin, Ohio, Iowa and Texas.\n\n\"Children, that are detained in juvenile detention centers, are especially vulnerable to sexual abuse. That's because the staff working at these juvenile detention centers have complete and total control over these children,\" Block said. \"There is no way for these children to escape the abuse.\"\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer John O'Connor contributed to this report from Springfield.", "source": {"uri": "kion546.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KION546"}, "authors": [{"uri":

His firm has helped bring lawsuits in Maryland, New Jersey and New York City.\n\n\"The very people that were entrusted with keeping our clients safe when they were children were the ones perpetrating the sexual abuse,\" Block said. \"This is long-term institutionalized sexual abuse.\"\n\nThe Associated Press does not typically name people who say they were sexually assaulted unless they consent to being identified or decide to tell their stories publicly.\n\nThree of the 95 plaintiffs are named in the lawsuit, including Jeffery Christian of Maywood, who said it was important to come forward publicly because he thought it could help others who may be suffering in silence.\n\nThe 36-year-old suburban Chicago man said he was sexually abused at two different detention centers beginning when he was about 13, including by a counselor who groped and fondled him during counseling sessions.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nLike many of the plaintiffs, Christian said the abuse was reported at the time, but facility administrators did nothing to address it. He said reporting the abuse made him more of a target. After the incidents, he became withdrawn and anti-social.\n\n\"It prepared me to start looking at the world different,\" he said. \"It took some light out of me.\"\n\nAt least six detention center workers were identified as alleged repeat offenders with separate accusations from different plaintiffs. Some alleged offenders are named in the lawsuit, while others are identified only as the plaintiffs remembered them by physical attributes, initials or nicknames. Most plaintiffs are identified by initials in the complaint.\n\nAmong other things, the complaint blames the state's use of unconstitutional and systemic strip searches as perpetrating sexual abuse.\n\n\"The State of Illinois has had notice of such abuse for decades and nonetheless neglected to protect its confined youth from sexual abuse and failed to implement policies necessary to ensure such protection,\" the complaint said.\n\nIt cites a 2013 U.S. Department of Justice survey of incarcerated youth that found Illinois was among the four worst states nationwide for sexual abuse in detention facilities. It also notes about half a dozen criminal cases from 2000 to 2021 where youth center employees were convicted of sexually abusing children and alleges that abuse continues to this day.\n\nCriminal charges are not beyond the realm of possibility in some of the more recent cases. Although there's no longer a statute of limitations on crimes related to the sexual abuse of minors occurring after Jan. 1, 2020, a 20-year limit remains on alleged offenses committed prior to that, allowing for the possibility of criminal charges in cases allegedly occurring as long ago as 2004.\n\nMany plaintiffs said their abusers threatened them with violence, solitary confinement, transfers to harsher facilities and longer sentences if they reported the abuse. Others were given extra food, money in their commissary accounts, the chance to play videos games and other rewards if they kept silent.\n\nThe plaintiffs ranged in age from 12 to 17 at the time they said they were abused, often while they were isolated in a bathroom, kitchens or in their cells. When detainees reported abuse, the lawsuit said it was laughed off, with one lieutenant saying, \"He's just playing around,\" or a chaplain who told a 17-year-old boy he allegedly fondled and was upset, \"This is what goes on\" in the church.\n\nThey are now adults, with the oldest in their early 40s. Most are men, but one of the detention centers was co-ed. They are from small communities and big cities, mostly in Illinois. Several are from Indiana, Wisconsin, Ohio, Iowa and Texas.\n\n\"Children, that are detained in juvenile detention centers, are especially vulnerable to sexual abuse. That's because the staff working at these juvenile detention centers have complete and total control over these children,\" Block said. \"There is no way for these children to escape the abuse.\"\n\nAssociated Press writer John O'Connor contributed to this report from Springfield.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Many plaintiffs said they were threatened or rewarded to keep quiet.\n\n\"The State of Illinois has allowed a culture of abuse at Illinois Youth Centers to flourish unabated,\" the 186-page complaint said.\n\nThe lawsuit, filed in the Illinois Court of Claims, follows similar harrowing allegations of child sex abuse at juvenile detention centers in Maryland, New Jersey, New Hampshire, California and New York City. Some cases have gone to trial or resulted in settlements; arrests have been infrequent.\n\nThe Illinois lawsuit contends the state failed to supervise, discipline, remove or investigate alleged abusers, enabling the abuse to continue. The complaint alleges the abuse happened at youth centers in locations all over the state including Chicago, Joliet, Harrisburg, Murphysboro and Warrenville. Several locations have since closed.\n\nThe lawsuit names the state of Illinois, the state's Department of Corrections and Department of Juvenile Justice as defendants. It seeks damages of roughly $2 million per plaintiff, the most allowed under law.\n\nMessages left Monday with the governor's office and both corrections agencies were not immediately returned.\n\nThe 95 plaintiffs are among hundreds of victims of sexual abuse at Illinois detention centers, said Jerome H. Block, an attorney who brought the case and who expects to file more lawsuits. His firm has helped bring lawsuits in Maryland, New Jersey and New York City.\n\n\"The very people that were entrusted with keeping our clients safe when they were children were the ones perpetrating the sexual abuse,\" Block said. \"This is long-term institutionalized sexual abuse.\"\n\nThe Associated Press does not typically name people who say they were sexually assaulted unless they consent to being identified or decide to tell their stories publicly.\n\nThree of the 95 plaintiffs are named in the lawsuit, including Jeffery Christian of Maywood, who said it was important to come forward publicly because he thought it could help others who may be suffering in silence.\n\nThe 36-year-old suburban Chicago man said he was sexually abused at two different detention centers beginning when he was about 13, including by a counselor who groped and fondled him during counseling sessions.\n\nLike many of the plaintiffs, Christian said the abuse was reported at the time, but facility administrators did nothing to address it.

Many plaintiffs said they were threatened or rewarded to keep quiet.\n\n\"The State of Illinois has allowed a culture of abuse at Illinois Youth Centers to flourish unabated,\" the 186-page complaint said.\n\nThe lawsuit, filed in the Illinois Court of Claims, follows similar harrowing allegations of child sex abuse at juvenile detention centers in Maryland, New Jersey, New Hampshire, California and New York City. Some cases have gone to trial or resulted in settlements; arrests have been infrequent.\n\nThe Illinois lawsuit contends the state failed to supervise, discipline, remove or investigate alleged abusers, enabling the abuse to continue. The complaint alleges the abuse happened at youth centers in locations all over the state including Chicago, Joliet, Harrisburg, Murphysboro and Warrenville. Several locations have since closed.\n\nThe lawsuit names the state of Illinois, the state's Department of Corrections and Department of Juvenile Justice as defendants. It seeks damages of roughly $2 million per plaintiff, the most allowed under law.\n\nThe office building at 100 North Western Avenue shown Monday, May 6, 2024, in Chicago, where an office of the Illinois Department of Juvenile Justice is located. Child sexual abuse at Illinois juvenile detention centers was pervasive and systemic for decades, according to disturbing accounts in a lawsuit filed Monday by 95 men and women housed at youth centers as children. (AP Photo/Charles Rex Arbogast)\n\nMessages left Monday with the governor\u00b4s office and both corrections agencies were not immediately returned.\n\nThe 95 plaintiffs are among hundreds of victims of sexual abuse at Illinois detention centers, said Jerome H. Block, an attorney who brought the case and who expects to file more lawsuits. His firm has helped bring lawsuits in Maryland, New Jersey and New York City.\n\n\"The very people that were entrusted with keeping our clients safe when they were children were the ones perpetrating the sexual abuse,\" Block said. \"This is long-term institutionalized sexual abuse.\"\n\nThe Associated Press does not typically name people who say they were sexually assaulted unless they consent to being identified or decide to tell their stories publicly.\n\nThree of the 95 plaintiffs are named in the lawsuit, including Jeffery Christian of Maywood, who said it was important to come forward publicly because he thought it could help others who may be suffering in silence.\n\nThe 36-year-old suburban Chicago man said he was sexually abused at two different detention centers beginning when he was about 13, including by a counselor who groped and fondled him during counseling sessions.\n\nLike many of the plaintiffs, Christian said the abuse was reported at the time, but facility administrators did nothing to address it. He said reporting the abuse made him more of a target. After the incidents, he became withdrawn and anti-social.\n\n\"It prepared me to start looking at the world different,\" he said. \"It took some light out of me.\"\n\nAt least six detention center workers were identified as alleged repeat offenders with separate accusations from different plaintiffs. Some alleged offenders are named in the lawsuit, while others are identified only as the plaintiffs remembered them by physical attributes, initials or nicknames. Most plaintiffs are identified by initials in the complaint.\n\nAmong other things, the complaint blames the state\u00b4s use of unconstitutional and systemic strip searches as perpetrating sexual abuse.\n\n\"The State of Illinois has had notice of such abuse for decades and nonetheless neglected to protect its confined youth from sexual abuse and failed to implement policies necessary to ensure such protection,\" the complaint said.\n\nIt cites a 2013 U.S. Department of Justice survey of incarcerated youth that found Illinois was among the four worst states nationwide for sexual abuse in detention facilities. It also notes about half a dozen criminal cases from 2000 to 2021 where youth center employees were convicted of sexually abusing children and alleges that abuse continues to this day.\n\nCriminal charges are not beyond the realm of possibility in some of the more recent cases. Although there\u00b4s no longer a statute of limitations on crimes related to the sexual abuse of minors occurring after Jan. 1, 2020, a 20-year limit remains on alleged offenses committed prior to that, allowing for the possibility of criminal charges in cases allegedly occurring as long ago as 2004.\n\nMany plaintiffs said their abusers threatened them with violence, solitary confinement, transfers to harsher facilities and longer sentences if they reported the abuse. Others were given extra food, money in their commissary accounts, the chance to play videos games and other rewards if they kept silent.\n\nThe plaintiffs ranged in age from 12 to 17 at the time they said they were abused, often while they were isolated in a bathroom, kitchens or in their cells. When detainees reported abuse, the lawsuit said it was laughed off, with one lieutenant saying, \"He's just playing around,\" or a chaplain who told a 17-year-old boy he allegedly fondled and was upset, \"This is what goes on\" in the church.\n\nThey are now adults, with the oldest in their early 40s. Most are men, but one of the detention centers was co-ed. They are from small communities and big cities, mostly in Illinois. Several are from Indiana, Wisconsin, Ohio, Iowa and Texas.\n\n\"Children, that are detained in juvenile detention centers, are especially vulnerable to sexual abuse. That\u00b4s because the staff working at these juvenile detention centers have complete and total control over these children,\" Block said. \"There is no way for these children to escape the abuse.\"\n\nAssociated Press writer John O'Connor contributed to this report from Springfield.\n\nThe office building at 100 North Western Avenue in Chicago, on Monday, May 6, 2024, where an office of the Illinois Department of Juvenile Justice is located.

Many plaintiffs said they were threatened or rewarded to keep quiet.\n\n\"The State of Illinois has allowed a culture of abuse at Illinois Youth Centers to flourish unabated,\" the 186-page complaint said.\n\nThe lawsuit, filed in the Illinois Court of Claims, follows similar harrowing allegations of child sex abuse at juvenile detention centers in Maryland, New Jersey, New Hampshire, California and New York City.

The complaint alleges the abuse happened at youth centers in locations all over the state including Chicago, Joliet, Harrisburg, Murphysboro and Warrenville. Several locations have since closed.\n\nThe lawsuit names the state of Illinois, the state's Department of Corrections and Department of Juvenile Justice as defendants. It seeks damages of roughly $2 million per plaintiff, the most allowed under law.\n\nMessages left Monday with the governor's office and both corrections agencies were not immediately returned.\n\nThe 95 plaintiffs are among hundreds of victims of sexual abuse at Illinois detention centers, said Jerome H. Block, an attorney who brought the case and who expects to file more lawsuits. His firm has helped bring lawsuits in Maryland, New Jersey and New York City.\n\n\"The very people that were entrusted with keeping our clients safe when they were children were the ones perpetrating the sexual abuse,\" Block said. \"This is long-term institutionalized sexual abuse.\"\n\nThe Associated Press does not typically name people who say they were sexually assaulted unless they consent to being identified or decide to tell their stories publicly.\n\nThree of the 95 plaintiffs are named in the lawsuit, including Jeffery Christian of Maywood, who said it was important to come forward publicly because he thought it could help others who may be suffering in silence.\n\nThe 36-year-old suburban Chicago man said he was sexually abused at two different detention centers beginning when he was about 13, including by a counselor who groped and fondled him during counseling sessions.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nLike many of the plaintiffs, Christian said the abuse was reported at the time, but facility administrators did nothing to address it. He said reporting the abuse made him more of a target. After the incidents, he became withdrawn and anti-social.\n\n\"It prepared me to start looking at the world different,\" he said. \"It took some light out of me.\"\n\nAt least six detention center workers were identified as alleged repeat offenders with separate accusations from different plaintiffs. Some alleged offenders are named in the lawsuit, while others are identified only as the plaintiffs remembered them by physical attributes, initials or nicknames. Most plaintiffs are identified by initials in the complaint.\n\nAmong other things, the complaint blames the state's use of unconstitutional and systemic strip searches as perpetrating sexual abuse.\n\n\"The State of Illinois has had notice of such abuse for decades and nonetheless neglected to protect its confined youth from sexual abuse and failed to implement policies necessary to ensure such protection,\" the complaint said.\n\nIt cites a 2013 U.S. Department of Justice survey of incarcerated youth that found Illinois was among the four worst states nationwide for sexual abuse in detention facilities. It also notes about half a dozen criminal cases from 2000 to 2021 where youth center employees were convicted of sexually abusing children and alleges that abuse continues to this day.\n\nCriminal charges are not beyond the realm of possibility in some of the more recent cases. Although there's no longer a statute of limitations on crimes related to the sexual abuse of minors occurring after Jan. 1, 2020, a 20-year limit remains on alleged offenses committed prior to that, allowing for the possibility of criminal charges in cases allegedly occurring as long ago as 2004.\n\nMany plaintiffs said their abusers threatened them with violence, solitary confinement, transfers to harsher facilities and longer sentences if they reported the abuse. Others were given extra food, money in their commissary accounts, the chance to play videos games and other rewards if they kept silent.\n\nThe plaintiffs ranged in age from 12 to 17 at the time they said they were abused, often while they were isolated in a bathroom, kitchens or in their cells. When detainees reported abuse, the lawsuit said it was laughed off, with one lieutenant saying, \"He's just playing around,\" or a chaplain who told a 17-year-old boy he allegedly fondled and was upset, \"This is what goes on\" in the church.\n\nThey are now adults, with the oldest in their early 40s. Most are men, but one of the detention centers was co-ed. They are from small communities and big cities, mostly in Illinois. Several are from Indiana, Wisconsin, Ohio, Iowa and Texas.\n\n\"Children, that are detained in juvenile detention centers, are especially vulnerable to sexual abuse. That's because the staff working at these juvenile detention centers have complete and total control over these children,\" Block said. \"There is no way for these children to escape the abuse.\"\n\nAssociated Press writer John O'Connor contributed to this report from Springfield.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Many plaintiffs said they were threatened or rewarded to keep quiet.\n\n\"The State of Illinois has allowed a culture of abuse at Illinois Youth Centers to flourish unabated,\" the 186-page complaint said.\n\nThe lawsuit, filed in the Illinois Court of Claims, follows similar harrowing allegations of child sex abuse at juvenile detention centers in Maryland, New Jersey, New Hampshire, California and New York City. Some cases have gone to trial or resulted in settlements; arrests have been infrequent.\n\nPeople are also reading...

The complaint alleges the abuse happened at youth centers in locations all over the state including Chicago, Joliet, Harrisburg, Murphysboro and Warrenville. Several locations have since closed.\n\nThe lawsuit names the state of Illinois, the state's Department of Corrections and Department of Juvenile Justice as defendants. It seeks damages of roughly $2 million per plaintiff, the most allowed under law.\n\nMessages left Monday with the governor's office and both corrections agencies were not immediately returned.\n\nThe 95 plaintiffs are among hundreds of victims of sexual abuse at Illinois detention centers, said Jerome H. Block, an attorney who brought the case and who expects to file more lawsuits. His firm has helped bring lawsuits in Maryland, New Jersey and New York City.\n\n\"The very people that were entrusted with keeping our clients safe when they were children were the ones perpetrating the sexual abuse,\" Block said. \"This is long-term institutionalized sexual abuse.\"\n\nThe Associated Press does not typically name people who say they were sexually assaulted unless they consent to being identified or decide to tell their stories publicly.\n\nThree of the 95 plaintiffs are named in the lawsuit, including Jeffery Christian of Maywood, who said it was important to come forward publicly because he thought it could help others who may be suffering in silence.\n\nThe 36-year-old suburban Chicago man said he was sexually abused at two different detention centers beginning when he was about 13, including by a counselor who groped and fondled him during counseling sessions.\n\nLike many of the plaintiffs, Christian said the abuse was reported at the time, but facility administrators did nothing to address it. He said reporting the abuse made him more of a target. After the incidents, he became withdrawn and anti-social.\n\n\"It prepared me to start looking at the world different,\" he said. \"It took some light out of me.\"\n\nAt least six detention center workers -- including a current mayor of a small southern Illinois community -- were identified in the lawsuit as alleged repeat offenders with separate accusations from different plaintiffs. Some alleged offenders are named in the lawsuit, while others are identified only as the plaintiffs remembered them by physical attributes, initials or nicknames. Most plaintiffs are identified by initials in the complaint.\n\nAmong other things, the complaint blames the state's use of unconstitutional and systemic strip searches as perpetrating sexual abuse.\n\n\"The State of Illinois has had notice of such abuse for decades and nonetheless neglected to protect its confined youth from sexual abuse and failed to implement policies necessary to ensure such protection,\" the complaint said.\n\nThe lawsuit cites a 2013 U.S. Department of Justice survey of incarcerated youth that found Illinois was among the four worst states nationwide for sexual abuse in detention facilities. It also notes about half a dozen criminal cases from 2000 to 2021 where youth center employees were convicted of sexually abusing children and alleges that abuse continues to this day.\n\nThe alleged repeat offenders include Rocky James, a longtime supervisor at the Harrisburg center who currently serves as the mayor of nearby Eldorado in southern Illinois, according to the lawsuit. Six plaintiffs separately allege that James abused them in the 2000s, including one teenager who was \"regularly and physically coerced\" to have sexual intercourse inside his cell and the bathroom, it said.\n\nJames, a former Eldorado city council member and Saline County board member, has served as mayor of the town of about 3,500 people since 2007. He has not been charged with wrongdoing.\n\nWhen reached Monday by telephone, James, 59, said it was the first he was hearing of the allegations.\n\n\"There's absolutely no truth to it,\" he said, declining further comment.\n\nCriminal charges are not beyond the realm of possibility in some of the more recent cases. Although there's no longer a statute of limitations on crimes related to the sexual abuse of minors occurring after Jan. 1, 2020, a 20-year limit remains on alleged offenses committed prior to that, allowing for the possibility of criminal charges in cases allegedly occurring as long ago as 2004.\n\nMany plaintiffs said their abusers threatened them with violence, solitary confinement, transfers to harsher facilities and longer sentences if they reported the abuse. Others were given extra food, money in their commissary accounts, the chance to play videos games and other rewards if they kept silent.\n\nThe plaintiffs ranged in age from 12 to 17 at the time they said they were abused, often while they were isolated in a bathroom, kitchens or in their cells. When detainees reported abuse, the lawsuit said it was laughed off, with one lieutenant saying, \"He's just playing around,\" or a chaplain who told a 17-year-old boy he allegedly fondled and was upset, \"This is what goes on\" in the church.\n\nThey are now adults, with the oldest in their early 40s. Most are men, but one of the detention centers was co-ed. They are from small communities and big cities, mostly in Illinois. Several are from Indiana, Wisconsin, Ohio, Iowa and Texas.\n\n\"Children, that are detained in juvenile detention centers, are especially vulnerable to sexual abuse. That's because the staff working at these juvenile detention centers have complete and total control over these children,\" Block said. \"There is no way for these children to escape the abuse.\"\n\nAssociated Press writer John O'Connor contributed to this report from Springfield.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

We will look at the relevant laws regarding sex abuse and the average settlement value of these cases.\n\nRELATED CONTENT:\n\nNorth Carolina Personal Injury Settlement Amounts\n\nNorth Carolina Birth Injury Malpractice Lawsuits\n\nNews & Updates:\n\nMay 6, 2024: Plaintiffs suing the Roman Catholic Diocese of Charlotte are defending the SAFE Child Act at the North Carolina Supreme Court.\n\nThis act, that we discuss in detail below, created a two-year window during 2020 and 2021 allowing alleged victims of child sexual abuse to file lawsuits previously barred by the statute of limitations. Despite lower court rulings against the plaintiffs, the state Supreme Court agreed in March to review this provision. The plaintiffs, identified only as John Doe and John Doe 1K, both claim to have been repeatedly abused by priests from the Diocese as children. They had initially filed lawsuits which were dismissed due to being time-barred, but refilled under the new legislation. Their brief emphasizes the lasting impacts of child sexual abuse and argues for the necessity of the SAFE Child Act, citing it as a crucial legislative measure allowing victims access to justice delayed by the psychological effects of abuse, which often cause delayed disclosures.\n\nMay 1, 2024: A lawsuit filed in Charlotte, North Carolina, involves a former Rocky Mount High School student, identified as John Doe, who alleges he was sexually assaulted by his teacher. The lawsuit accuses Johnson of grooming Doe through inappropriate text and social media interactions before committing the assault. It also claims that after the abuse was reported, school officials, including the principal and superintendent, delayed appropriate action, allowing Johnson to continue teaching.\n\nThis obviously caused this poor child severe psychological distress and forced him to transfer schools. The lawsuit further alleges that the Nash Board of Education had prior knowledge of the teacher's misconduct with other students but failed to step up and do the right thing.\n\nApril 29, 2024: North Carolina's highest court has not yet decided whether to hear the Gaston County School Board's appeal against a ruling that upheld the SAFE Child Act as constitutional. The state Supreme Court dismissed three of the four appeals by the Gaston School Board in this case but did not address the fourth, which remains active.\n\nThe Gaston County School Board is challenging the constitutionality of the SAFE Child Act, arguing that it unfairly imposes retrospective legal liability for actions that occurred many years ago, thus violating settled law and due process rights under the North Carolina Constitution. Our lawyers are seeing similar arguments in other jurisdictions. They contend that this act allows for the revival of time-barred claims, potentially leading to endless litigation against public and private entities on issues long considered legally resolved. The School Boards Association, of course, has supported this stance, suggesting that the act places an undue burden on current school administrations and could lead to a flood of lawsuits based on allegations from decades ago. Not mentioned: the burden on victims who otherwise have not opportunity for justice.\n\nIn contrast, the majority opinion from the state Court of Appeals, authored by then-Judge Allison Riggs, rejected these arguments. It emphasized that statutes of limitation are procedural, not absolute rights, and that upholding such defenses as constitutional rights would undermine the legislature's intent to protect vulnerable children from sexual abuse. The decision to revive the plaintiffs' claims was seen as a necessary step to address serious abuses that had been covered up for years.\n\nMarch 20, 2024: In a new sex abuse lawsuit alleges with horrific facts that a 12 year-old girl in a wilderness therapy program run by Trails Carolina, LLC was raped and forced to perform oral sex by a female counselor while Trails Carolina ignored the allegations.\n\nHer sexual assault lawsuit alleges Trails Carolina suppressed credible and repeated reports of assault, neglected to implement protective measures against recognized dangers, and upheld policies that violated obligatory reporting regulations, thus creating an environment susceptible to abuse. Because they were working with troubled teens, they just chalked up all abuse claims as lying kids, the lawsuit claims.\n\nThe plaintiff is asking for a jury trial. You cannot assess the credibility of a lawsuit just reading a legal complaint. But the allegations sound credible. It they can be shown to be true, a jury will punish this defendant.\n\nDefinition of Sexual Abuse or Sexual Assault in North Carolina\n\nSexual assault or abuse is defined as intentional sexual touching or contact without the other person's consent and for the purpose of sexual gratification, arousal, or humiliation. In the context of a civil lawsuit, sexual abuse or assault is often referred to as sexual battery, and it can range from groping a breast to rape.\n\nThere are two key components that must be present to meet the definition of sexual abuse in North Carolina. First, the sexual touching must be done intentionally. If one inadvertently grabs a student's breast vagina in a crowded elevator or to catch them from falling, there is no intent, and it does not qualify as sexual abuse.\n\nThe second element is the lack of consent. For intentional sexual touching to qualify as abuse or assault, it must be done without mutual consent. Under North Carolina law, minors under the age of 18 cannot give consent to sexual touching. Any sexual contact with a minor by an adult is automatically considered sexual battery.\n\nSo if a teacher has a sexual relationship with a 16-year-old student, that would be sexual battery even if the student willingly participated and consented. The 16-year-old did not have the legal capacity to consent to sexual contact with the adult teacher.\n\nWhen Can You Sue for Sexual Abuse?\n\nIn North Carolina, sexual abuse or assault constitutes both a criminal offense and a civil wrongdoing. This grants sexual abuse victims the option to pursue criminal charges and/or initiate a civil lawsuit to seek financial compensation. Any individual who has suffered from sexual abuse or assault has the right to pursue either or both options.\n\nVictims of sexual abuse can pursue a civil lawsuit regardless of whether the perpetrator faced criminal charges or a conviction. In fact, victims can bring a civil lawsuit even if they never reported the abuse to the police and even if they never told anyone about it.\n\nThe burden of proof required to establish sexual battery in a civil case is notably lighter compared to that in a criminal trial. This means that it is much easier for a plaintiff in a civil lawsuit to demonstrate the occurrence of sexual abuse or assault. So even if an offender evades criminal prosecution, they can still be held liable in a civil court of law.\n\nGetting Money from Third Parties in Sex Abuse Lawsuits\n\nThe most obvious defendant in any sexual battery lawsuit would be the person who committed the sexual abuse. The problem with suing the abuser is that they might already be dead or in jail, and even if they are still around, they may not have money or financial resources to pay for any compensation awarded in the case. Going after the abuser only makes sense in a civil case if they are wealthy.\n\nThe best way to get money in a civil sex abuse lawsuit is to sue a third party for negligence in connection with the abuse. Common examples of third parties who can be sued in sex abuse lawsuits include schools, youth organizations, churches, gyms, etc. These parties can be held liable in a child sex abuse lawsuit if the plaintiff can show that their negligence somehow enabled the abuse to occur or to continue. Third parties in sex abuse lawsuits can also be held liable if they attempt to cover up abuse incidents after the fact.\n\nThe following example will help illustrate how third parties can be liable in sexual assault cases. Let's assume that Jimmy was a student at a private school in Charlotte, NC. In 5th grade, Jimmy's teacher, Mr. Smith, sexually abused him over the year. The school had previously received numerous red flags suggesting that Mr. Smith may be a sexual predator, including prior allegations of abuse by students and incidents of highly inappropriate behavior. Jimmy can file a civil lawsuit against the private school for negligently failing to investigate Mr. Smith and prevent him from abusing students.\n\nNorth Carolina Statute of Limitations for Sexual Abuse Lawsuits\n\nIn 2019, North Carolina passed a new law extending the time frame for victims of childhood sexual abuse to file civil lawsuits. Under this law (the SAFE Child Act), childhood victims of sexual abuse have until their 28th birthday to file a civil lawsuit for sexual abuse. N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 1-17(d)\u202f If the sexual abuse occurred when the victim was over the age of 18, the victim has 3 years to file a civil lawsuit under North Carolina law.\n\nNorth Carolina Sexual Abuse Settlements and Verdicts\n\n$175,000 Verdict: The plaintiff claimed that she suffered mental anguish after she was sexually assaulted on a monthly basis between the ages of six and fourteen by the defendant's stepfather. The defendant had pled guilty to two counts of assault of a female, although he denied that he had ever sexually assaulted the plaintiff. The plaintiff's sister, another stepdaughter of the defendant, was likewise molested by the defendant and was awarded for her claim of emotional distress.\n\n$750,000 Verdict: A 25-year-old female inmate claimed that she suffered emotional distress as a result of multiple incidents of sexual misconduct by a male corrections officer employee of the defendant (Department of Corrections). The plaintiff contended that the defendant was negligent in the hiring and supervision of its employees to ensure the safety of inmates and feared that she may have contracted a sexually transmitted disease. The defendant denied liability and contended that the corrections officer was not acting within the scope of his employment or acting under the direction of the correctional authority.\n\n$45,000 Settlement: The plaintiff, A 13-year-old was sexual molested by her male teacher, at the public school where she was enrolled. The plaintiff contended that the school district failed to properly hire, train, and supervise its employees with access to its minor students, failed to prevent the physical and emotional abuse of their students, and that the teacher willfully and maliciously sexually molested the plaintiff with the intent to harm.\n\n$210,000 Verdict: A female plaintiff was a resident at the defendant hospital where she was admitted for depression, suicide attempts and anorexia. While at the hospital a staff member engaged in a sexual liaison with the plaintiff during her treatment. The plaintiff contended that the hospital employee sexually assaulted her, that the hospital failed to properly supervise her, and that the hospital failed to provide a safe environment for the plaintiff while she was in their care.\n\n$176,000 Verdict: The plaintiff claimed that she was sexually abused by a male nurse / psychotherapist, employed by the defendant mental health center, while she was being counseled. The plaintiff contended that the mental health center negligently hired, trained, and supervised the nurse who forced the plaintiff to engage in sexual intercourse.

Many plaintiffs said they were threatened or rewarded to keep quiet.\n\n\"The State of Illinois has allowed a culture of abuse at Illinois Youth Centers to flourish unabated,\" the 186-page complaint said.\n\nThe lawsuit, filed in the Illinois Court of Claims, follows similar harrowing allegations of child sex abuse at juvenile detention centers in Maryland, New Jersey, New Hampshire, California and New York City. Some cases have gone to trial or resulted in settlements; arrests have been infrequent.\n\nThe Illinois lawsuit contends the state failed to supervise, discipline, remove or investigate alleged abusers, enabling the abuse to continue. The complaint alleges the abuse happened at youth centers in locations all over the state including Chicago, Joliet, Harrisburg, Murphysboro and Warrenville. Several locations have since closed.\n\nThe lawsuit names the state of Illinois, the state's Department of Corrections and Department of Juvenile Justice as defendants. It seeks damages of roughly $2 million per plaintiff, the most allowed under law.\n\nIn an emailed statement, the Department of Juvenile Justice said the alleged incidents took place under prior administrations but that the department takes youth safety seriously and that \"all allegations of staff misconduct are immediately and thoroughly investigated.\"\n\nMessages left Monday with Gov. J.B. Pritzker's office and the Department of Corrections weren't immediately returned.\n\nThe 95 plaintiffs are among hundreds of victims of sexual abuse at Illinois detention centers, said Jerome H. Block, an attorney who brought the case and who expects to file more lawsuits. His firm has helped bring lawsuits in Maryland, New Jersey and New York City.\n\n\"The very people that were entrusted with keeping our clients safe when they were children were the ones perpetrating the sexual abuse,\" Block said. \"This is long-term institutionalized sexual abuse.\"\n\nThe Associated Press does not typically name people who say they were sexually assaulted unless they consent to being identified or decide to tell their stories publicly.\n\nThree of the 95 plaintiffs are named in the lawsuit, including Jeffery Christian of Maywood, who said it was important to come forward publicly because he thought it could help others who may be suffering in silence.\n\nThe 36-year-old suburban Chicago man said he was sexually abused at two different detention centers beginning when he was about 13, including by a counselor who groped and fondled him during counseling sessions.\n\nLike many of the plaintiffs, Christian said the abuse was reported at the time, but facility administrators did nothing to address it. He said reporting the abuse made him more of a target. After the incidents, he became withdrawn and anti-social.\n\n\"It prepared me to start looking at the world different,\" he said. \"It took some light out of me.\"\n\nAt least six detention center workers - including a current mayor of a small southern Illinois community - were identified in the lawsuit as alleged repeat offenders with separate accusations from different plaintiffs. Some alleged offenders are named in the lawsuit, while others are identified only as the plaintiffs remembered them by physical attributes, initials or nicknames. Most plaintiffs are identified by initials in the complaint.\n\nAmong other things, the complaint blames the state's use of unconstitutional and systemic strip searches as perpetrating sexual abuse.\n\n\"The State of Illinois has had notice of such abuse for decades and nonetheless neglected to protect its confined youth from sexual abuse and failed to implement policies necessary to ensure such protection,\" the complaint said.\n\nThe lawsuit cites a 2013 U.S. Department of Justice survey of incarcerated youth that found Illinois was among the four worst states nationwide for sexual abuse in detention facilities. It also notes about half a dozen criminal cases from 2000 to 2021 where youth center employees were convicted of sexually abusing children and alleges that abuse continues to this day.\n\nThe alleged repeat offenders include Rocky James, a longtime supervisor at the Harrisburg center who currently serves as the mayor of nearby Eldorado in southern Illinois, according to the lawsuit. Six plaintiffs separately allege that James abused them in the 2000s, including one teenager who was \"regularly and physically coerced\" to have sexual intercourse inside his cell and the bathroom, it said.\n\nJames, a former Eldorado city council member and Saline County board member, has served as mayor of the town of about 3,500 people since 2007. He has not been charged with wrongdoing.\n\nWhen reached Monday by telephone, James, 59, said it was the first he was hearing of the allegations.\n\n\"There's absolutely no truth to it,\" he said, declining further comment.\n\nCriminal charges are not beyond the realm of possibility in some of the more recent cases. Although there's no longer a statute of limitations on crimes related to the sexual abuse of minors occurring after Jan. 1, 2020, a 20-year limit remains on alleged offenses committed prior to that, allowing for the possibility of criminal charges in cases allegedly occurring as long ago as 2004.\n\nMany plaintiffs said their abusers threatened them with violence, solitary confinement, transfers to harsher facilities and longer sentences if they reported the abuse. Others were given extra food, money in their commissary accounts, the chance to play videos games and other rewards if they kept silent.\n\nThe plaintiffs ranged in age from 12 to 17 at the time they said they were abused, often while they were isolated in a bathroom, kitchens or in their cells. When detainees reported abuse, the lawsuit said it was laughed off, with one lieutenant saying, \"He's just playing around,\" or a chaplain who told a 17-year-old boy he allegedly fondled and was upset, \"This is what goes on\" in the church.\n\nThey are now adults, with the oldest in their early 40s. Most are men, but one of the detention centers was co-ed. They are from small communities and big cities, mostly in Illinois. Several are from Indiana, Wisconsin, Ohio, Iowa and Texas.\n\n\"Children, that are detained in juvenile detention centers, are especially vulnerable to sexual abuse. That's because the staff working at these juvenile detention centers have complete and total control over these children,\" Block said. \"There is no way for these children to escape the abuse.\"\n\n___", "source": {"uri": "abc7chicago.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ABC7 Chicago"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_abuse", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sexual abuse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plaintiff", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Plaintiff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_sexual_abuse", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Child sexual abuse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Illinois"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Illinois"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Youth_detention_center", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Youth detention center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juvenile_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Juvenile court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corrections", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Corrections"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New Jersey"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Jersey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maryland", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Maryland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Maryland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prison_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prison officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaplain", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chaplain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gang_rape", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gang rape"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_sex", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oral sex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damages", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Damages"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mayor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prison", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prison"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Christianity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergeant", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sergeant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harrisburg,_Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Harrisburg, Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Harrisburg, Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Hampshire", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Hampshire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Hampshire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warrenville,_Illinois", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Warrenville, Illinois"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Warrenville, Illinois"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joliet,_Illinois", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joliet, Illinois"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murphysboro,_Illinois", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Murphysboro, Illinois"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Murphysboro, Illinois"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._B._Pritzker", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "J.

Some alleged offenders are named in the lawsuit, while others are identified only as the plaintiffs remembered them by physical attributes, initials or nicknames. Most plaintiffs are identified by initials in the complaint.\n\nAmong other things, the complaint blames the state's use of unconstitutional and systemic strip searches as perpetrating sexual abuse.\n\n\"The State of Illinois has had notice of such abuse for decades and nonetheless neglected to protect its confined youth from sexual abuse and failed to implement policies necessary to ensure such protection,\" the complaint said.\n\nThe lawsuit cites a 2013 U.S. Department of Justice survey of incarcerated youth that found Illinois was among the four worst states nationwide for sexual abuse in detention facilities. It also notes about half a dozen criminal cases from 2000 to 2021 where youth center employees were convicted of sexually abusing children and alleges that abuse continues to this day.\n\nThe alleged repeat offenders include Rocky James, a longtime supervisor at the Harrisburg center who currently serves as the mayor of nearby Eldorado in southern Illinois, according to the lawsuit. Six plaintiffs separately allege that James abused them in the 2000s, including one teenager who was \"regularly and physically coerced\" to have sexual intercourse inside his cell and the bathroom, it said.\n\nJames, a former Eldorado city council member and Saline County board member, has served as mayor of the town of about 3,500 people since 2007. He has not been charged with wrongdoing.\n\nWhen reached Monday by telephone, James, 59, said it was the first he was hearing of the allegations.\n\n\"There's absolutely no truth to it,\" he said, declining further comment.\n\nCriminal charges are not beyond the realm of possibility in some of the more recent cases. Although there's no longer a statute of limitations on crimes related to the sexual abuse of minors occurring after Jan. 1, 2020, a 20-year limit remains on alleged offenses committed prior to that, allowing for the possibility of criminal charges in cases allegedly occurring as long ago as 2004.\n\nMany plaintiffs said their abusers threatened them with violence, solitary confinement, transfers to harsher facilities and longer sentences if they reported the abuse. Others were given extra food, money in their commissary accounts, the chance to play videos games and other rewards if they kept silent.\n\nThe plaintiffs ranged in age from 12 to 17 at the time they said they were abused, often while they were isolated in a bathroom, kitchens or in their cells. When detainees reported abuse, the lawsuit said it was laughed off, with one lieutenant saying, \"He's just playing around,\" or a chaplain who told a 17-year-old boy he allegedly fondled and was upset, \"This is what goes on\" in the church.\n\nThey are now adults, with the oldest in their early 40s. Most are men, but one of the detention centers was co-ed. They are from small communities and big cities, mostly in Illinois. Several are from Indiana, Wisconsin, Ohio, Iowa and Texas.\n\n\"Children, that are detained in juvenile detention centers, are especially vulnerable to sexual abuse. That's because the staff working at these juvenile detention centers have complete and total control over these children,\" Block said. \"There is no way for these children to escape the abuse.\"\n\n___", "source": {"uri": "abc7chicago.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ABC7 Chicago"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_abuse", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sexual abuse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plaintiff", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Plaintiff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_sexual_abuse", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Child sexual abuse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Illinois"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Illinois"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Youth_detention_center", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Youth detention center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juvenile_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Juvenile court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corrections", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Corrections"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New Jersey"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Jersey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maryland", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Maryland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Maryland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prison_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prison officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaplain", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chaplain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gang_rape", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gang rape"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_sex", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oral sex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damages", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Damages"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mayor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prison", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prison"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Christianity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergeant", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sergeant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harrisburg,_Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Harrisburg, Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Harrisburg, Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Hampshire", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Hampshire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Hampshire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warrenville,_Illinois", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Warrenville, Illinois"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Warrenville, Illinois"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joliet,_Illinois", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joliet, Illinois"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murphysboro,_Illinois", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Murphysboro, Illinois"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Murphysboro, Illinois"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._B._Pritzker", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "J.

Many plaintiffs said they were threatened or rewarded to keep quiet.\n\n\"The State of Illinois has allowed a culture of abuse at Illinois Youth Centers to flourish unabated,\" the 186-page complaint said.\n\nThe lawsuit, filed in the Illinois Court of Claims, follows similar harrowing allegations of child sex abuse at juvenile detention centers in Maryland, New Jersey, New Hampshire, California and New York City. Some cases have gone to trial or resulted in settlements; arrests have been infrequent.\n\nThe Illinois lawsuit contends the state failed to supervise, discipline, remove or investigate alleged abusers, enabling the abuse to continue. The complaint alleges the abuse happened at youth centers in locations all over the state including Chicago, Joliet, Harrisburg, Murphysboro and Warrenville. Several locations have since closed.\n\nThe lawsuit names the state of Illinois, the state's Department of Corrections and Department of Juvenile Justice as defendants. It seeks damages of roughly $2 million per plaintiff, the most allowed under law.\n\nIn an emailed statement, the Department of Juvenile Justice said the alleged incidents took place under prior administrations but that the department takes youth safety seriously and that \"all allegations of staff misconduct are immediately and thoroughly investigated.\"\n\nMessages left Monday with Gov. J.B. Pritzker's office and the Department of Corrections weren't immediately returned.\n\nThe 95 plaintiffs are among hundreds of victims of sexual abuse at Illinois detention centers, said Jerome H. Block, an attorney who brought the case and who expects to file more lawsuits. His firm has helped bring lawsuits in Maryland, New Jersey and New York City.\n\n\"The very people that were entrusted with keeping our clients safe when they were children were the ones perpetrating the sexual abuse,\" Block said. \"This is long-term institutionalized sexual abuse.\"\n\nThe Associated Press does not typically name people who say they were sexually assaulted unless they consent to being identified or decide to tell their stories publicly.\n\nThree of the 95 plaintiffs are named in the lawsuit, including Jeffery Christian of Maywood, who said it was important to come forward publicly because he thought it could help others who may be suffering in silence.\n\nThe 36-year-old suburban Chicago man said he was sexually abused at two different detention centers beginning when he was about 13, including by a counselor who groped and fondled him during counseling sessions.\n\nLike many of the plaintiffs, Christian said the abuse was reported at the time, but facility administrators did nothing to address it. He said reporting the abuse made him more of a target. After the incidents, he became withdrawn and anti-social.\n\n\"It prepared me to start looking at the world different,\" he said. \"It took some light out of me.\"\n\nAt least six detention center workers - including a current mayor of a small southern Illinois community - were identified in the lawsuit as alleged repeat offenders with separate accusations from different plaintiffs. Some alleged offenders are named in the lawsuit, while others are identified only as the plaintiffs remembered them by physical attributes, initials or nicknames. Most plaintiffs are identified by initials in the complaint.\n\nAmong other things, the complaint blames the state's use of unconstitutional and systemic strip searches as perpetrating sexual abuse.\n\n\"The State of Illinois has had notice of such abuse for decades and nonetheless neglected to protect its confined youth from sexual abuse and failed to implement policies necessary to ensure such protection,\" the complaint said.\n\nThe lawsuit cites a 2013 U.S. Department of Justice survey of incarcerated youth that found Illinois was among the four worst states nationwide for sexual abuse in detention facilities.

Many plaintiffs said they were threatened or rewarded to keep quiet.\n\nAlso Read | Hamas Accepts Egyptian-Qatari Ceasefire Proposal for Gaza After Israel Orders Rafah Evacuation Ahead of Attack.\n\n\"The State of Illinois has allowed a culture of abuse at Illinois Youth Centers to flourish unabated,\" the 186-page complaint said.\n\nThe lawsuit, filed in the Illinois Court of Claims, follows similar harrowing allegations of child sex abuse at juvenile detention centres in Maryland, New Jersey, New Hampshire, California and New York City. Some cases have gone to trial or resulted in settlements; arrests have been infrequent.\n\nAlso Read | Russia Warns Britain, Plans Nuclear Drills Over West's Possible Deepening Role in Ukraine Amid Rising Tensions.\n\nThe Illinois lawsuit contends the state failed to supervise, discipline, remove or investigate alleged abusers, enabling the abuse to continue. The complaint alleges the abuse happened at youth centers in locations all over the state including Chicago, Joliet, Harrisburg, Murphysboro and Warrenville. Several locations have since closed.\n\nThe lawsuit names the state of Illinois, the state's Department of Corrections and Department of Juvenile Justice as defendants. It seeks damages of roughly USD 2 million per plaintiff, the most allowed under law.\n\nMessages left Monday with the governor's office and both corrections agencies were not immediately returned.\n\nThe 95 plaintiffs are among hundreds of victims of sexual abuse at Illinois detention centers, said Jerome H. Block, an attorney who brought the case and who expects to file more lawsuits. His firm has helped bring lawsuits in Maryland, New Jersey and New York City.\n\n\"The very people that were entrusted with keeping our clients safe when they were children were the ones perpetrating the sexual abuse,\" Block said. \"This is long-term institutionalized sexual abuse.\"\n\nThe Associated Press does not typically name people who say they were sexually assaulted unless they consent to being identified or decide to tell their stories publicly.\n\nThree of the 95 plaintiffs are named in the lawsuit, including Jeffery Christian of Maywood, who said it was important to come forward publicly because he thought it could help others who may be suffering in silence.\n\nThe 36-year-old suburban Chicago man said he was sexually abused at two different detention centres beginning when he was about 13, including by a counsellor who groped and fondled him during counselling sessions.\n\nLike many of the plaintiffs, Christian said the abuse was reported at the time, but facility administrators did nothing to address it. He said reporting the abuse made him more of a target. After the incidents, he became withdrawn and anti-social.\n\n\"It prepared me to start looking at the world different,\" he said. \"It took some light out of me.\"\n\nAt least six detention centre workers were identified as alleged repeat offenders with separate accusations from different plaintiffs. Some alleged offenders are named in the lawsuit, while others are identified only as the plaintiffs remembered them by physical attributes, initials or nicknames. Most plaintiffs are identified by initials in the complaint.\n\nAmong other things, the complaint blames the state's use of unconstitutional and systemic strip searches as perpetrating sexual abuse.\n\n\"The State of Illinois has had notice of such abuse for decades and nonetheless neglected to protect its confined youth from sexual abuse and failed to implement policies necessary to ensure such protection,\" the complaint said.\n\nIt cites a 2013 U.S. Department of Justice survey of incarcerated youth that found Illinois was among the four worst states nationwide for sexual abuse in detention facilities. It also notes about half a dozen criminal cases from 2000 to 2021 where youth centre employees were convicted of sexually abusing children and alleges that abuse continues to this day.\n\nCriminal charges are not beyond the realm of possibility in some of the more recent cases. Although there's no longer a statute of limitations on crimes related to the sexual abuse of minors occurring after Jan. 1, 2020, a 20-year limit remains on alleged offenses committed prior to that, allowing for the possibility of criminal charges in cases allegedly occurring as long ago as 2004.\n\nMany plaintiffs said their abusers threatened them with violence, solitary confinement, transfers to harsher facilities and longer sentences if they reported the abuse. Others were given extra food, money in their commissary accounts, the chance to play videos games and other rewards if they kept silent.\n\nThe plaintiffs ranged in age from 12 to 17 at the time they said they were abused, often while they were isolated in a bathroom, kitchens or in their cells. When detainees reported abuse, the lawsuit said it was laughed off, with one lieutenant saying, \"He's just playing around,\" or a chaplain who told a 17-year-old boy he allegedly fondled and was upset, \"This is what goes on\" in the church.\n\nThey are now adults, with the oldest in their early 40s. Most are men, but one of the detention centres was co-ed. They are from small communities and big cities, mostly in Illinois. Several are from Indiana, Wisconsin, Ohio, Iowa and Texas.\n\n\"Children, that are detained in juvenile detention centres, are especially vulnerable to sexual abuse. That's because the staff working at these juvenile detention centres have complete and total control over these children,\" Block said. \"There is no way for these children to escape the abuse.\"

His firm has helped bring lawsuits in Maryland, New Jersey and New York City.\n\n\"The very people that were entrusted with keeping our clients safe when they were children were the ones perpetrating the sexual abuse,\" Block said. \"This is long-term institutionalized sexual abuse.\"\n\nThe Associated Press does not typically name people who say they were sexually assaulted unless they consent to being identified or decide to tell their stories publicly.\n\nThree of the 95 plaintiffs are named in the lawsuit, including Jeffery Christian of Maywood, who said it was important to come forward publicly because he thought it could help others who may be suffering in silence.\n\nThe 36-year-old suburban Chicago man said he was sexually abused at two different detention centres beginning when he was about 13, including by a counsellor who groped and fondled him during counselling sessions.\n\nLike many of the plaintiffs, Christian said the abuse was reported at the time, but facility administrators did nothing to address it. He said reporting the abuse made him more of a target. After the incidents, he became withdrawn and anti-social.\n\n\"It prepared me to start looking at the world different,\" he said. \"It took some light out of me.\"\n\nAt least six detention centre workers were identified as alleged repeat offenders with separate accusations from different plaintiffs. Some alleged offenders are named in the lawsuit, while others are identified only as the plaintiffs remembered them by physical attributes, initials or nicknames. Most plaintiffs are identified by initials in the complaint.\n\nAmong other things, the complaint blames the state's use of unconstitutional and systemic strip searches as perpetrating sexual abuse.\n\n\"The State of Illinois has had notice of such abuse for decades and nonetheless neglected to protect its confined youth from sexual abuse and failed to implement policies necessary to ensure such protection,\" the complaint said.\n\nIt cites a 2013 U.S. Department of Justice survey of incarcerated youth that found Illinois was among the four worst states nationwide for sexual abuse in detention facilities. It also notes about half a dozen criminal cases from 2000 to 2021 where youth centre employees were convicted of sexually abusing children and alleges that abuse continues to this day.\n\nCriminal charges are not beyond the realm of possibility in some of the more recent cases. Although there's no longer a statute of limitations on crimes related to the sexual abuse of minors occurring after Jan. 1, 2020, a 20-year limit remains on alleged offenses committed prior to that, allowing for the possibility of criminal charges in cases allegedly occurring as long ago as 2004.\n\nMany plaintiffs said their abusers threatened them with violence, solitary confinement, transfers to harsher facilities and longer sentences if they reported the abuse. Others were given extra food, money in their commissary accounts, the chance to play videos games and other rewards if they kept silent.\n\nThe plaintiffs ranged in age from 12 to 17 at the time they said they were abused, often while they were isolated in a bathroom, kitchens or in their cells. When detainees reported abuse, the lawsuit said it was laughed off, with one lieutenant saying, \"He's just playing around,\" or a chaplain who told a 17-year-old boy he allegedly fondled and was upset, \"This is what goes on\" in the church.\n\nThey are now adults, with the oldest in their early 40s. Most are men, but one of the detention centres was co-ed. They are from small communities and big cities, mostly in Illinois. Several are from Indiana, Wisconsin, Ohio, Iowa and Texas.\n\n\"Children, that are detained in juvenile detention centres, are especially vulnerable to sexual abuse. That's because the staff working at these juvenile detention centres have complete and total control over these children,\" Block said. \"There is no way for these children to escape the abuse.\"

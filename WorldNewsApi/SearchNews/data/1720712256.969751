Taking place immediately after the formation of Modi 3.0 in New Delhi, this would also be the first meeting of BRICS foreign ministers since the expansion of the grouping was formalised in January.

While Monday\u2019s meeting will be the traditional stand-alone Foreign Ministers\u2019 Meeting at which all foreign ministers of the countries that are members of BRICS are expected to be in attendance, an expanded meeting will take place on Tuesday with the participation from 15 countries invited by Russia. The meetings are expected to discuss current geopolitical issues and improve the global governance system with an emphasis on increasing the role of developing countries. The outcomes of the Foreign Ministers\u2019 Meeting will feed into the 16th BRICS Summit scheduled to take place in Kazan in October. Several bilateral meetings are also planned to take place on the sidelines of the two-day event. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been spotlighting India\u2019s growing profile and emergence as a \u2018Vishwa Bandhu\u2019 in a divided world. In his first comments after staking a claim to form a government for the third consecutive time, PM Modi said on Friday that the time has come to reap the benefits of all the hard work done in the last 10 years to raise India\u2019s profile on the global stage. \u201cA distinct global image has been built in the last 10 years as India has emerged as a Vishwa Bandhu. Its maximum advantage will begin now. I am fully confident that the next five years will be extremely useful for the country as far as the global environment is concerned,\u201d he said while speaking outside Rashtrapati Bhavan after meeting President Droupadi Murmu. A separate section titled \u2018Modi ki guarantee for Vishwa Bandhu Bharat\u2019 in the BJP\u2019s 2024 elections manifesto mentions how the Modi government has made Bharat \u201ca reliable, trusted and dependable voice globally\u201d in the last 10 years. \u201cToday, the world believes that Bharat is the mother of democracy. Our diaspora around the world feels empowered and connected. Our civilisational values, thoughts, wisdom and traditional knowledge have found a place of pride at the world stage. We will strengthen our position and conduct our policies to further our national interests with the spirit of Vishwa Bandhu,\u201d states the BJP \u2018Sankalp Patra\u2019. It mentions further consolidation of India\u2019s position as a voice of the Global South by using Prime Minister Modi\u2019s visionary 5S approach of samman, samvad, sahyog, shanti and samriddhi. \u2013IANS as/dan", "summary": "<p>New Delhi, June 9 (IANS) Continuing its role as a &#8216;Vishwa Bandhu&#8217; (global friend), India is expected to raise the development concerns facing the Global South and challenges facing the&#8230; <a class=\"more-link\" href=\"https://indianews.com.au/brics-fms-meet-in-russia-as-india-carries-forward-pm-modis-vision-of-building-distinct-global-image/\">Continue reading <span class=\"screen-reader-text\">BRICS FMs meet in Russia as India carries forward PM Modi&#8217;s vision of building distinct global image</span></a></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://indianews.com.au/brics-fms-meet-in-russia-as-india-carries-forward-pm-modis-vision-of-building-distinct-global-image/\">BRICS FMs meet in Russia as India carries forward PM Modi\u2019s vision of building distinct global image</a> first appeared on <a href=\"https://indianews.com.au\">Australia India News</a>.</p>", "url": "https://indianews.com.au/brics-fms-meet-in-russia-as-india-carries-forward-pm-modis-vision-of-building-distinct-global-image/", "image": "https://iansportalimages.s3.amazonaws.com/thumbnails/202406093172729.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 13:19:11", "author": "India News Newsdesk", "authors": ["India News Newsdesk"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "AU", "sentiment": 0.42}

The superstar, 45, shared how she wants to become a mother but it has so far been impossible with her packed schedule of work commitments. Hot off an extremely successful West End run, the Norma Desmond actress is just weeks away from returning Sunset Boulevard to Broadway. Nicole is, however, adamant that the time is coming for her to start a family because 'the clock is ticking'. She told The Times on Thursday: 'Oh my gosh, I would love to [have a baby]. I've never shied away from that. I can't wait. It's like the clock is ticking. 'I want to have a baby but work calls. But I'm going to have to make time because, yes, I cannot wait to have children.' When asked if her mother is putting pressure on her to have children Nicole said: 'No, because my mother knows how hard I work and how passionate I am about what I do. 'She is a faithful woman and she just knows, everything in God's timing.' Nicole has been dating Scottish ex-rugby union player Thom since 2020 and they got engaged in 2023. They met in 2019 on The X Factor: Celebrity. She said of the former model: 'It's nice, because he likes a system - he's extremely organised and he's extremely on time, which is the opposite of me, so he makes me so much better in that way. 'I don't know if all rugby players are like this but he's the cleanest. He's OCD like me and I just love it. It's great.' These sentiments were echoed in 2020 when Nicole told The Mirror: 'He's my man... the man of my dreams. I definitely want kids, at the right time. It is all about timing. 'It's kind of hard now because I'm supposed to be touring next year, so it's just about timing. I've always wanted a family.' Nicole added: 'It's just been a blessing to be able to have, like, a normal, healthy relationship and take time for myself. He is my partner in crime, my best friend.' 'We love to laugh together, we are big goofballs. We laugh together, we dance together, we sing together and cook together.' Thom is similarly smitten with Nicole. He told Men's Health in April: 'I'm looking to get married soon. 'I proposed to my fianc\u00e9e in June 2023. It was one of the best days of my life. Getting married to her and starting a family is something I can't wait for.' When asked about a wedding, Nicole confessed she is yet to start planning but is hopeful it will be in the next couple of years, once her Broadway stint is finished. Prior to Thom, Nicole was in a very high-profile on again, off again relationship with Formula One driver Lewis Hamilton from 2007 to 2015. The former Pussycat Dolls frontwoman has also been engaged once before: to Nick Hexum, lead singer of 311, whom she dated from 2000 to 2004. Another potential barrier to motherhood for Nicole is the abandonment issues she has been open about having. Her father Alfonso Valiente 'walked out on Nicole and her mother Rosemary Elikolani when she was just three years old'. While Nicole grew up with a loving stepfather Gary Scherzinger, who adopted her as a child and took his surname, the actress admitted the abandonment still affected her. Speaking on the How to Fail With Elizabeth Day podcast in March, Nicole said: 'I definitely have abandonment issues and that is because my actual biological father did leave me, I think when I was three. 'And so I didn't think it would ever affect me, but I guess somewhere it did affect me. So, I definitely have my own issues with that for sure.' Nicole also has a younger half-sister Keala. Her younger sibling shares the same mother as the singer but have different fathers. 'I have really strong abandonment issues, unfortunately, which is wonderful for my character, Norma in [Sunset Boulevard]. See, it all ties back to that. 'It brought me back, and Norma has huge abandonment issues. She feels so abandoned in her life, so empty, so lonely, and it all just ties into it. It's like, it was just a line meant to be that I was meant to play this role one day.", "summary": "Nicole Scherzinger has admitted time is against her as she shares her desires to have a child with her fianc\u00e9 Thom Evans.", "url": "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-13580783/Nicole-Scherzinger-45-admits-time-against-shares-plans-child-fianc-Thom-Evans.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490", "image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/06/28/16/86703617-0-image-m-10_1719589371594.jpg", "video": "https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2024/06/05/2407807667205028860/1024x576_MP4_2407807667205028860.mp4", "publish_date": "2024-06-29 02:17:24", "author": "Chikamso Chukwuenyem,Editor", "authors": ["Chikamso Chukwuenyem", "Editor"], "language": "en", "source_country": "GB", "sentiment": 0.22}

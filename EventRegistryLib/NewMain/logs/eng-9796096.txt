Many more arrests are expected in the coming days.\n\nThe comments came as the country braced for another day of unrest, with more than 6,000 specialist riot officers on standby amid warnings that far-Right groups are planning to target at least 39 immigration centres across Britain.\n\nMr Parkinson told the BBC: \"There are sentencing guidelines which indicate that many people who have been caught up in this disorder will face immediate imprisonment. There should be no doubt about that. They are going to prison.\n\n\"We are willing to look at terrorism offences. I'm aware of at least one instance where that is happening.\n\n\"Where you have organised groups planning activity for the purposes of advancing an ideology... planning really, really serious disruption - then yes, we will consider terrorism offences.\"\n\nEarlier this week, Neil Basu, a former head of UK counter-terrorism policing, suggested some of the violence being witnessed had \"crossed the line into terrorism\".\n\nMr Basu said the attack on the Holiday Inn Express in Rotherham on Sunday, while people were inside, should be treated as terrorism. He described the rioters as \"bullies and cowards\".\n\nBut Jonathan Hall KC, the Government's independent reviewer of terror legislation, warned politicians not to rush into declaring the riots as terrorism.\n\nHe said caution must be exercised when invoking terrorism powers to a \"live incident\" as you may \"end up with finger-pointing at one group\".\n\nHe added: \"I think that you need to be cautious about applying counter-terrorism in effectively a live incident. It could be escalatory, you'll end up with finger-pointing. One group will start saying: 'Well if you're calling these people terrorists, why don't you call it these people terrorists?'\"\n\nHeidi Alexander, the justice minister, insisted it would be up to the Crown Prosecution Service, not politicians, to decide what charges would be brought against those taking part in disturbances.\n\nOn Tuesday, police confirmed that intelligence sources had identified at least 30 hotspots where trouble could flare on Wednesday, including London.\n\nIn a statement, Scotland Yard Deputy Assistant Commissioner Andy Valentine described the disorder as \"one of the worst spates of violent disorder in the last decade\".\n\nHe said: \"This is a national critical incident, and we will do everything in our power to protect London and its communities. We will not tolerate this on our streets. We will use every power, tactic and tool available to prevent further scenes of disorder.\"\n\nSpeaking from Downing Street on Tuesday evening, Sir Keir Starmer said he was expecting \"substantive sentencing\" for those taking part in the unrest \"before the end of this week\".\n\nFollowing an emergency Cobra meeting at Downing Street, the Prime Minister said: \"Those involved will feel the full force of the law. Over 400 people now have been arrested, 100 have been charged - some in relation to online activity - and a number of them are already in court.\n\n\"That should send a very powerful message to anybody involved, either directly or online, that you are likely to be dealt with within a week.\"\n\nBut he has been criticised by some over his response to the riots, with Elon Musk, the tech billionaire, branding him \"two-tier Keir\".\n\nCommenting on X, formerly known as Twitter - the social media platform he owns - Mr Musk was responding to footage showing rioters hurling missiles at a pub in Birmingham.\n\nOne man was shown being kicked in the head by a rioter, and Mr Musk captioned the video: \"Why aren't all communities protected in Britain?\"\n\nIt comes after accusations of \"two-tier policing\", with critics claiming Right-wing protesters are dealt with more harshly than Left-wing demonstrators.\n\nRobert Jenrick, the Conservative leadership contender, questioned the policing of the riots on Tuesday.\n\nSir Paul Stephenson, a former Met Police chief, called for the \"full force\" of the law to be applied equally to all those involved in violence.\n\nThose who used the internet to incite riots from abroad could face extradition and prosecution where appropriate, Mr Parkinson confirmed.\n\nWhile he did not name anyone suspected of such offences, it was reported earlier this week that Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, the English Defence League founder otherwise known as Tommy Robinson, is on holiday at an all-inclusive resort in Cyprus.\n\nHe left Britain last week after failing to appear in court having been accused of breaching a contempt of court order.\n\nYaxley-Lennon has been accused of spreading misinformation that helped stoke violence in the wake of the killings of three girls in Southport last week.\n\nMr Parkinson stressed he was \"absolutely\" seeking to charge people for online offences relating to the rioting and being based abroad would not prevent them from being prosecuted.\n\nHe added: \"Some people are abroad. That doesn't mean they're safe. We have liaison prosecutors spread around the globe who've got local links with the local judiciary and law enforcement, but also the police are also stationed abroad.\"", "source": {"uri":

We are preparing for activity across 41 forces.\"\n\nMr Parkinson said extradition would \"of course\" be considered in relation to people posting online about inciting UK riots while being out of the country.\n\nHe also said there \"will be short, medium and long-term consequences\" connected to the recent unrest but \"it is too soon to say\" if it will have a knock-on effect on the justice system.\n\nSir Mark Rowley, the head of the Metropolitan Police, said threats against immigration lawyers were \"at the centre of our planning tonight\", adding: \"We will not let the immigration asylum system be intimidated.\"\n\nAddressing what may be considered a terrorism offence, Mr Parkinson told PA: \"We've all read or seen on the news reports of far right groups publishing information about named individuals or immigration law firms, for instance, encouraging activity affecting those individuals.\n\n\"The fact that it's organised groups that might be motivated by ideological reasons, the fact that they're promoting potentially very serious offences - that's the sort of instance where we might want to consider terrorism charges.\"\n\nAsked whether anyone had been charged with terrorism offences or were under consideration for being charged, the DPP said: \"No one's been charged with a terrorism offence yet.\n\n\"I'm aware of one case which is actively under consideration.\n\n\"We're working very closely with counter-terrorism police, so I know there are a number of inquiries that are potentially underway - that includes scouring the internet and social media, looking out for the potential for terrorism offences to be committed.\"\n\nMr Parkinson said all 111 people arrested in connection with disorder in Whitehall last week have been bailed and was expecting to receive files from police to review \"by early next week\".\n\nResources are being shared around the country as forces respond to intelligence, with the Metropolitan Police understood to be sending some officers to Manchester while others in the South East are also travelling to support colleagues in North East and North West forces.\n\nMeanwhile, those arrested continued to appear in court on Wednesday, some reduced to tears as they heard they would be kept in prison before their next hearings.\n\nLiam Ryan, 28, from Bradford, West Yorkshire, cried as he pleaded guilty to violent disorder after disturbances in Manchester city centre on Saturday.\n\nMr Parkinson said he does not believe courts currently need to sit overnight and at weekends to deal with those charged in connection with the recent unrest, but it is something they are \"reviewing constantly\".\n\nAsked if the current disorder could have a knock-on effect with unrelated charging decisions and cases being dealt with as prosecutors are focused on the cases connected to the disorder, he said: \"It's too soon to say. So far, there's been 120 charges.

Many more arrests are expected in the coming days.\n\nThe comments came as Britain braced for another day of unrest with more than 6,000 specialist riot officers on standby amid warnings that far-Right groups are planning to target at least 39 immigration centres across Britain.\n\nMr Parkinson told the BBC: \"There are sentencing guidelines which indicate that many people who have been caught up in this disorder will face immediate imprisonment. There should be no doubt about that. They are going to prison.\n\n\"We are willing to look at terrorism offences. I'm aware of at least one instance where that is happening.\n\n\"Where you have organised groups planning activity for the purposes of advancing [an] ideology... planning really, really serious disruption then yes, we will consider terrorism offences.\"\n\nEarlier this week Neil Basu, the former head of UK counter-terrorism policing, suggested some of the violence being witnessed had \"crossed the line into terrorism\".\n\nMr Basu said the attack on the Holiday Inn Express in Rotherham on Sunday while people were inside should be treated as terrorism, describing the rioters as \"bullies and cowards\".\n\nBut Jonathan Hall KC, the Government's independent reviewer of terror legislation, warned politicians not to rush into declaring the riots as terrorism.\n\nHe said caution must be exercised when invoking terrorism powers to a \"live incident\" as you may \"end up with finger pointing at one group\".\n\nHe said: \"I think that you need to be cautious about applying counterterrorism in effectively a live incident, it could be escalatory, you'll end up with finger pointing, one group will start saying 'well if you're calling these people terrorists, why don't you call it these people terrorists'.\"\n\nHeidi Alexander, the justice minister, insisted it would be the Crown Prosecution Service and not politicians to decide what charges would be brought against those taking part in disturbances.\n\nPolice today confirmed intelligence sources had identified at least 30 hotspots where trouble could flare on Wednesday, including London.\n\n'We will not tolerate this on our streets'\n\nIn a statement Scotland Yard Dept Asst Commissioner Andy Valentine described the disorder as \"one of the worst spates of violent disorder in the last decade\".\n\nHe said: \"This is a national critical incident and we will do everything in our power to protect London and its communities. We will not tolerate this on our streets. We will use every power, tactic and tool available to prevent further scenes of disorder.\"\n\nSpeaking from Downing Street on Tuesday evening, Sir Keir Starmer said he is expecting \"substantive sentencing\" for those taking part in the unrest \"before the end of this week\".\n\nFollowing an emergency COBR meeting at Downing Street on Tuesday evening, Sir Keir Starmer said: \"Those involved will feel the full force of the law... over 400 people now have been arrested, 100 have been charged - some in relation to online activity - and a number of them are already in court.\"\n\n\"That should send a very powerful message to anybody involved, either directly or online, that you are likely to be dealt with within a week.\"\n\nBut the Prime Minister has been criticised by some over his response to the riots, with Elon Musk, the tech billionaire branding him \"two-tier Keir\".\n\nCommenting on X, the social media platform he owns that was formerly known as Twitter, Mr Musk was responding to footage showing rioters hurling missiles at a pub in Birmingham.\n\nOne man was shown being kicked in the head by a rioter. Mr Musk captioned the video: \"Why aren't all communities protected in Britain?\"\n\nIt comes after accusations of \"two-tier policing\", with critics claiming that Right-wing protesters are dealt with more harshly than Left-wing demonstrators.\n\nRobert Jenrick, the Conservative leadership contender, also questioned policing of the riots on Tuesday, while Sir Paul Stephenson, a former Met Police chief, called for the \"full force\" of the law to be applied equally to all those involved in violence.\n\nThose who used the internet to incite riots from abroad could face extradition and prosecution where appropriate, the DPP confirmed today.\n\nWhile he did not name anyone suspected of such offences it was reported earlier this week that the English Defence League founder, Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, otherwise known as Tommy Robinson, is on holiday at an all inclusive resort in Cyprus.\n\nHe left Britain last week after failing to appear in court having been accused of breaching a contempt of court order.\n\nYaxley-Lennon has been accused of spreading misinformation which helped stoke violence in the wake of the killings of three girls in Southport last week.\n\nMr Parkinson stressed he was \"absolutely\" seeking to charge people for online offences relating to the rioting and being based abroad would not prevent them from being prosecuted.\n\nHe added: \"Some people are abroad. That doesn't mean they're safe. We have liaison prosecutors spread around the globe who've got local links with the local judiciary and law enforcement, but also the police are also stationed abroad.\"", "source": {"uri":

The mobs mounted anti-immigrant riots after the murder of three girls last months in Southport town. This is the worst rioting in the United Kingdom in several years.\n\nThe Sun has reported that riots have taken place in at least 23 locations across England and Northern Ireland since Friday. The mobs have also attacked and injured police personnel with bricks, bottles, and firebombs.\n\nThe situation may further escalate on Wednesday as the police have intelligence that riots are being planned at as many as 39 locations across the UK. The newspaper reported that an 'arson manual' is being circulated in an online forum as rioters plan to attack 39 immigrants' centres on Wednesday.\n\nIn the wake of such threats, Starmer said that around 6,000 specialised riot-control police personnel are being deployed across the UK to contain the situation.\n\nFollowing the emergency meeting with top ministers and security officers, Starmer said that riots will \"feel the full force of the law\".\n\nSpeaking to reporters, Starmer said that everyone involved in the rioting will be sentenced within a week and there will not be lengthy trials.\n\n\"Those involved will feel the full force of the law...Over 400 people now have been arrested, 100 have been charged -- some in relation to online activity -- and a number of them are already in court.

There should be no doubt about that.

brands UK violence 'a national emergency'", "body": "Asked whether some offenders may be charged under terrorism laws, Stephen Parkinson confirmed: \"there is that potential, yes\"\n\nThe UK's most senior prosecutor has declared the ongoing riots across the UK a \"national emergency,\" urging swift and decisive action must be taken to target offenders.\n\nIn an interview with ITV News', the Director of Public Prosecution Stephen Parkinson said \"justice must be done\" to restore order and hold those responsible accountable.\n\nThe unrest, marked by widespread violence against police and anti-immigration sentiments, has gripped several major cities across the UK and Northern Ireland across the past seven days.\n\nAs tensions continue to escalate, Mr Parkinson said the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) will take \"swift and robust action\" to bring stringent sentences against those involved\n\n\"The system is under enormous pressure, I'm not going to pretend otherwise.\n\n\"In circumstances such as these, which amount to a national emergency, all of us across the criminal justice are working together, raising the level of performance and finding the resources to serve the public in the way they expect us to.\"\n\nWhen questioned over his terming of the situation as a 'national emergency', Mr Parkinson said: \"The scenes we've seen over the last few days justify that description and justify the swift and robust action we're taking as a result.\"\n\nPolice have reported some of the violence was incited online, with inflammatory posts and coordinated efforts on social media platforms playing a significant role in the unrest.\n\nWhen Mr Parkinson was asked about how the criminal justice system intends to deal with these individuals, he said: \"If we know where they are and they are in the UK, then clearly arrests can be made.\"\n\nHe explained the CPS has a team of lawyers across the globe who are working with local authorities to deal with individuals outside of the country.\n\n\"There's no way to hide for people planning this sort of activity\".\n\nAsked whether Tommy Robinson - whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon - would be among those on that list of offenders, Mr Parkinson said: \"I think Tommy Robinson should be very careful about the language he is using and should be very worried about what he's said so far.\"\n\nRobinson has been tweeting prolifically since the unrest began from a luxury hotel in Cyprus.\n\nMr Parkinson added: \"But I'm not going to go into details about particular cases.\"\n\nMore than 400 people have now been arrested in the wake of disorder around the country, according to police sources, with the number expected to continue to rise in the coming days.\n\nMr Parkinson said this has produced an estimated 100 charges, with the remaining 300 released on bail pending further investigation.\n\nAsked whether some offenders may be charged under terrorism laws, Mr Parkinson confirmed: \"there is that potential, yes\".\n\n\"If certain elements are in place, if behaviour of this kind is motivated by ideology or political persuasion, it's designed to intimate the public, there's an element of planning, we will definitely consider terrorism offences and those can result in even stiffer sentences.\"\n\nProbed over whether the definition of a terrorism offence has been met in some of the instances being brought to courts across, Mr Parkinson said \"it is too soon to say\".\n\nBut, he added: \"The most serious examples of criminality will be met by the most serious charges.\"", "source": {"uri": "itv.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ITV Hub"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Parkinson,_Baron_Parkinson_of_Whitley_Bay",

Within a matter of days, some of the criminals involved in these riots have been put behind bars.\n\n'This is just the start, with over 400 arrests, 120 charged and more people being hauled in front of the courts every day.\n\n'Our criminal justice system is showing violent thuggery has no place on our streets.'\n\nMs Rayner today visited the Holiday Inn Express at Manvers, near Rotherham, which has been used to house asylum seekers and was stormed by violent thugs on Sunday.\n\nShe said: 'Coming on the streets throwing missiles at the police, attacking police, attacking hotels like this one here today is not a legitimate grievance.\n\n'It's not the way we do politics in this country and nobody should be condoning that.\n\n'This is thuggery, this is violence, someone could've got seriously injured over the last couple of days and it's no excuse for that, and people should stay away from it.'\n\nMr Parkinson, the DPP and head of the Crown Prosecution Service, said no one had yet been charged with terrorism offences following the outbreak of rioting.\n\nBut he added: 'I'm aware of one case which is actively under consideration.\n\n'We're working very closely with counter terrorism police, so I know there are a number of inquiries that are potentially underway.\n\n'That includes scouring the internet and social media, looking out for the potential for terrorism offences to be committed.'\n\nMr Parkinson revealed the publication of immigration law firms as potential targets for disorder could be considered for terrorism charges.\n\n'It's only going to be a minute number of instances where we'd even consider that,' he added.\n\n'But we've all read or seen on the news reports of far right groups publishing information about named individuals or immigration law firms, for instance, encouraging activity affecting those individuals.\n\n'The fact that it's organised groups that might be motivated by ideological reasons, the fact that they're promoting potentially very serious offences - that's the sort of instance where we might want to consider terrorism charges.\n\n'Most criminal activity that's going on is perfectly adequately covered by the normal criminal law - including low level criminality.'\n\nHe also said the CPS would consider extradition in relation to people posting online about inciting UK riots while being out of the country, if it represented 'serious criminality'.\n\nThose arrested over the riots continued to appear in court on Wednesday, some reduced to tears as they heard they would be kept in prison before their next hearings.\n\nLiam Ryan, 28, from Bradford, West Yorkshire, cried as he pleaded guilty to violent disorder after disturbances in Manchester city centre on Saturday.\n\nProsecutors said Ryan had played an 'active role' in the disorder, in which a black man was attacked by a 'large group of far-right protesters' in Piccadilly Gardens. He is expected to be sentenced next week.\n\nOthers have already received prison sentences for their parts in the rioting.\n\nDerek Drummond, 58, of Pool Street, Southport, who was sentenced at Liverpool Crown Court to three years in prison. He admitted violent disorder and assaulting an emergency worker\n\nDeclan Geiran, 29, and Liam Riley, 40, received sentences of 30 months and 20 months respectively for their roles in disturbances in Liverpool on Saturday\n\nDerek Drummond, 58, from Southport, Merseyside, was jailed for three years on Wednesday after he pleaded guilty to charges of violent disorder and assaulting an emergency worker during the unrest in Southport on July 30.\n\nHe is the first person to receive a substantial prison sentence for taking part in the violence that has rocked parts of the UK over the past week.\n\nTwo other men, Declan Geiran, 29, and Liam Riley, 40, received sentences of 30 months and 20 months respectively for their roles in disturbances in Liverpool on Saturday.\n\nIn a social media post, Sir Keir said the sentences were an example of 'the swift action we're taking'\n\nHe added: 'If you provoke violent disorder on our streets or online, you will face the full force of the law.'\n\nPolice said thousands of officers remained on standby across the country to deal with potential disorder tonight.\n\nSir Mark Rowley, the head of the Metropolitan Police, said threats against immigration lawyers were 'at the centre of our planning tonight'.\n\n'We will not let the immigration asylum system be intimidated', he added.\n\nA list of solicitors' firms and advice agencies has been shared in chat groups as possible targets for disturbances on Wednesday, and the message invited people to 'mask up' if they attend.\n\nSir Mark told broadcasters the police had 'decided to marshal thousands of police officers across the country' in readiness for potential violence.\n\nHe said: 'We've changed our tactics in the last couple of days\n\n'And so besides marshalling more officers, we're brigading some of them at key strategic locations across the country to give us more agility to respond to wherever the protests are most intense.\n\n'So that we can respond with agility and show overwhelming force, so that the criminals and thugs on the streets don't succeed.'\n\nThe Met Commissioner also rejected claims that recent disturbances had been dealt with more harshly than if they had been committed by people from ethnic minorities.\n\nHe said claims of 'two-tier policing' - such as those made by Elon Musk, the owner of social media platform X - were 'complete nonsense' and put police officers at risk.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The British government has said an 'army' of around 6,000 riot-control police personnel have been deployed to tackle the mobs.\n\nFor more than a week, far-right mobs have rampaged through British towns and have indulged in violence in at least 23 locations since Friday, according to The Sun.\n\nThe anti-immigrant riots began after a murder of three girls last month in the British town of Southport. Since then, the UK has witnessed some of the worst rioting in many years with shops and settlements of immigrant communities, including those from South Asia, being attacked and marketplaces being looted. More than 400 riots have so far been arrested and their prosecution has already started.\n\nFar-right mobs to hold 100 rallies, issue 'hit list' of 39 places\n\nThe British police forces, including specialised riot-control personnel, are bracing for far-right demonstrations at 100 places.\n\nMoreover, the security services are also bracing for attacks on dozens of places as the far-right groups have circulated a 'hit list' of 39 places comprising immigration lawyers, asylum centres, and non-governmental organisations (NGOs).\n\nThe police are particularly concerned as far-right groups have been circulating 'arson manuals'.\n\nThe Sun has reported that the manual has instructions on how to make petrol bombs to carry out attacks as part of the riots. It further said that a watchdog has revealed that far-right online forums have also issued calls for the murder of ethnic minorities and government ministers.\n\nOne of the biggest security operations since World War II\n\nIn the wake of nearly-nationwide far-right violence, the British security services have mounted one of the biggest security operations since the World War II.\n\nIn addition to 6,000 riot-control police personnel, around 2,000 additional personnel have been drafted to protect specific locations expected to be attacked, according to The Sun.\n\nSo far, more than 100 police personnel have been injured in the attacks. The newspapers reported that 51 police personnel were injured while protecting an asylum centre in Rotherham and another 53 were injured in Southport last week.\n\nThe police are also preparing to tackle the fall-out from around 30 counter-demonstrations against the far-right mobs.\n\nThe newspaper has reported that riot hotspots for Wednesday are London, Birmingham, Aldershot, Middlesbrough, Tamworth, and Rotherham.\n\nAs more than 400 arrested, Starmer issues stern warning\n\nAs more than 400 rioters have been arrested, British PM Sir Starmer has warned that the riots will face the full force of the law.\n\nOf those arrested, around 100 people have already been charged.\n\nFollowing an emergency meeting on Tuesday, Starmer said that rioters will be sentenced within one week of their arrest and there will be no lengthy trials.\n\nStarmer said, \"Those involved will feel the full force of the law...Over 400 people now have been arrested, 100 have been charged -- some in relation to online activity -- and a number of them are already in court. I'm now expecting substantive sentencing before the end of this week.\"\n\nStarmer further said everyone involved in the rioting, either online or offline, will be punished.\n\n\"That should send a very powerful message to anybody involved, either directly or online, that you are likely to be dealt with within a week and that nobody, but nobody should be involving themselves in this disorder,\" said Starmer.\n\nSeparately, the top British prosecutor has said that terrorism charges are being considered against the rioters.\n\n\"We are willing to look at terrorism offences. I'm aware of at least one instance where that is happening. Where you have organised groups planning activity for the purposes of advancing [an] ideology... planning really, really serious disruption then yes, we will consider terrorism offences,\" said

I ask people to move away from that, to not get involved in that,\" she said.\n\nShe said the violent behaviour was \"not our British values\" and it had been caused by a \"small minority\".\n\nMs Rayner added: \"Police will be there to keep the public safe and there is no excuse for thuggery and criminality on the streets.\"", "source": {"uri": "inews.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "inews.co.uk"}, "authors": [{"uri": "chloe_chaplain@inews.co.uk", "name": "Chloe Chaplain", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telegram_(messaging_service)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Telegram (messaging service)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riot", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Riot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Progressive_Party", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Progressive Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Immigration law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far-right_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Far-right politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shabana_Mahmood", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shabana Mahmood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Chancellor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lord Chancellor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Justice_(United_Kingdom)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Justice (United Kingdom)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keir_Starmer", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Keir Starmer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crown_Prosecution_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Crown Prosecution Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Director_of_Public_Prosecutions", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Director of Public Prosecutions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Crown", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Crown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counterterrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Counterterrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angela_Rayner", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Angela Rayner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deputy_Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Deputy Prime Minister of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Criminal law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Crime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Research", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Research", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 78}], "image": "https://wp.inews.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/SEI_215893052_d80dae.jpg?w=1200&h=675&crop=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9796096", "eventUri": "eng-9796096", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.584313725490196, "wgt": 152, "relevance": 1}

Parkinson, the Director of Public Prosecutions, told Sky News that people merely liking or retweeting other people's content could be committing a serious criminal offence.\n\nModernity.news reports: Parkinson said social media users could be guilty of \"incitement to racial hatred\" if they post \"insulting or abusive\" content that is \"likely to stir up racial hatred.\"\n\n\"So if you retweet that, then you're republishing that and then potentially you're committing that offence,\" he added, noting that dedicated police officers are \"scouring social media\" looking for such material.\n\n\"People might think they're not doing anything harmful, they are, and the consequences will be visited upon them,\" Parkinson warned.\n\nSky News clarified that \"sharing online material of riots could be an offence.\"\n\nThe public official also asserted separately that individuals who publish protest/riot locations, such as those outside immigration law firms, could be hit with terrorism charges.\n\n\"The fact that it's organised groups that might be motivated by ideological reasons, the fact that they're promoting potentially very serious offences - that's the sort of instance where we might want to consider terrorism charges,\" said Parkinson.\n\nHe even previously suggested that social media influencers who are currently located abroad like Tommy Robinson could be extradited and hit with terrorism charges in the UK on nebulous charges of inciting the riots.\n\nAs we highlighted earlier, numerous prominent people in the UK are now calling on the government to mimic Communist China by banning Twitter (X) altogether in the country to stop civil unrest.\n\nCambridge professor Sander van der Linden said the government could \"geo-restrict access to a platform if the situation got so bad\" and Twitter could also be \"banned from the app store for violating policies.\"\n\nKeir Starmer proudly proclaimed the implementation of a \"standing army\" of riot police to deal with what he has called right-wing thugs, although the Prime Minister has failed to condemn similar violent attacks and riots by Muslim mobs.", "source": {"uri": "thepeoplesvoice.tv",

It may take longer to get them back, but there's no issue around if we can get them back, then prosecuting them.\"", "source": {"uri": "shropshirestar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Shropshire Star"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Parkinson,_Baron_Parkinson_of_Whitley_Bay", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stephen Parkinson, Baron Parkinson of Whitley Bay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Director_of_Public_Prosecutions", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Director of Public Prosecutions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Crime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riot", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Riot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosecutor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prosecutor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incitement_to_ethnic_or_racial_hatred", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Incitement to ethnic or racial hatred"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incitement", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Incitement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_celebrity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Internet celebrity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extradition", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Extradition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organized_crime", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Organized crime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "TikTok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_aid", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Legal aid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keyboard_instrument", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Keyboard instrument"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Criminal justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 70}], "image": "https://www.shropshirestar.com/resizer/v2/A5JHRENA4JDNJGLKKA5BHGOH2E.jpg?auth=e0846f882bab2af3332de4b277ffce25eb04168173924f7773a8924dac981d69&width=1200&height=900", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9796096", "eventUri": "eng-9796096", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.4980392156862745, "wgt": 126, "relevance": 1}

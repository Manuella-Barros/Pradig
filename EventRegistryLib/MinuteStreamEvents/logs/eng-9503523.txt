It's the second time they've designated Tonkin for assignment within the season's first three and a half weeks. The Mets traded him to the Twins for cash last time, only to claim him back off waivers from Minnesota late last week when the Twins also designated him. The roster spots for Tonkin and Hartwig will go to right-hander Sean Reid-Foley and lefty Josh Walker. Reid-Foley is returning from the 15-day IL, while Walker is being recalled from Syracuse.\n\nTonkin's second Mets stint last only two appearances and three innings. The 33-year-old righty pitched both Saturday and Sunday, allowing a pair of runs over three innings. He's logged nine innings in the majors this season, yielding six earned runs (plus another six unearned) on 10 hits, four walks and four hit batters with 11 strikeouts.\n\nTonkin spent the 2023 season in the Braves' bullpen, logging a 4.28 ERA, 24.2% strikeout rate and 9.1% walk rate in 80 innings. That set a new career-high MLB workload for the journeyman right-hander, who owns a career 4.44 ERA (4.54 FIP, 3.70 SIERA) with a 23.1% strikeout rate, 8% walk rate and 39.5% grounder rate in 235 1/3 big league innings between Minnesota, Atlanta and New York.

He was originally designated for assignment earlier in the month, with the Minnesota Twins picking him up as a waiver claim. Once they DFA'd him, he was claimed by the Mets again, and this will be the third team he's on in the early season. As a corresponding move, the Yankees have designated McKinley Moore for assignment, all of which has been announced by the team officially.\n\nIn his time with the Twins and Mets over the season, he has a 6.00 ERA in nine innings, striking out 23.9% of batters faced with a 44.2% groundball rate.\n\nThere are some interesting aspects of Tonkin's repertoire, as he throws from a lower arm slot, and that causes him to get some unique movement profiles. Despite standing in at 6'7, he has a 5.25 release height on his four-seamer and a 5.14 release height on his sinker, and his sidearm action could prove to be valuable to a bullpen. The problem for him has been the long ball, as he's allowed a 1.49 HR/9 across 192 appearances in his MLB career.\n\nA 3.70 SIERA and 23.1% strikeout rate in his career have kept him on bullpen depth charts, but the inability to command reliably in-zone has burnt him at every step of his career. He could be a pitcher who benefits from utilizing matchup data more to overwhelm hitters, platooning his sweeper usage based on righty/lefty matchups but the problem has been that none of his pitches have been effective outside of his gyro slider.\n\nThe four-seamer was supposed to be a new weapon for him up in the zone, but it hasn't been able to do the job, and his sinker-heavy approach last season has gone away. Perhaps the Yankees get him more to his 2023 pitch usage, throwing his sinker and gyro slider nearly 99% of the time and getting good results on those pitches. He might also benefit from just being a slider-first arm, as the pitch is extremely effective to any kind of hitter.\n\nDating back to 2023, the 34-year-old has generated a 30.8% Whiff Rate and .233 wOBA on his slider, which has plenty of dropping action and generates soft contact as well. He'll still need something he can throw with velocity to keep hitters from teeing off on a hanging slider, but it's hard to figure out what that could be.\n\nAaron Boone needs more options to go to in his bullpen as the Yankees have a slog of games coming up with no days off until the end of the Detroit Tigers series in the Bronx. That means they won't see another off day until May 6th, which is nightmare fuel for a bullpen that's already stretched thin. Michael Tonkin may not be some young fireballer who you can pencil in as the next Matt Blake success story, but he is someone who can mop up innings for you and can easily be DFA'd if you need a fresh arm.\n\nTonkin is out of Minor League options, so the Yankees would have to designate him for assignment if they wanted to shuffle him out of the bullpen.", "source": {"uri": "empiresportsmedia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Empire Sports Media"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ryan_garcia@empiresportsmedia.com", "name": "Ryan Garcia", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Mets", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Mets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Yankees", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Yankees"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Twins", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Twins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinker_(pitch)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sinker (pitch)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slider_(pitch)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Slider (pitch)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Tonkin", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Michael Tonkin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four-seam_fastball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Four-seam fastball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_transactions", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball transactions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Designated_for_assignment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Designated for assignment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullpen", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bullpen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Earned run average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relief_pitcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Relief pitcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitcher", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pitcher"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidearm_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sidearm (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeouts_per_nine_innings_pitched", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Strikeouts per nine innings pitched"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platoon_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Platoon system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pitch (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_runs_per_nine_innings", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Home runs per nine innings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings_pitched", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Innings pitched"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Boone", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aaron Boone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_pitcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Power pitcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit_Tigers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Detroit Tigers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bronx", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Bronx"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "The Bronx"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Instruction", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Instruction", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://empiresportsmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/MLB-Minnesota-Twins-at-Detroit-Tigers-23010926.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9503523", "eventUri": "eng-9503523", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-06", "textStart": 2534, "textEnd": 2541}], "sentiment": -0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 143, "relevance": 1}

The model, 21, who is the daughter of Kate Moss, showcased her jaw-dropping figure as she slipped into a burgundy bikini while soaking up the sun on the Spanish island. Letting her blonde locks fall loose down her shoulders, Lila wore a gold necklace for the outing as she displayed her sun-kissed tan. The stunner relaxed on the yacht with a group of female friends before they were all seen diving off the edge. Lila appeared in good spirits as she went for a swim and was also seen on shore with a paddle board by her side. The group appeared to on cloud nine as they frolicked in the water before Lila and one pal hopped on the paddle board together. Lila has long been compared to her famous mother, 50, with their similar striking looks and tall slender frames. The up and coming star is certainly discovering it pays to resemble one of the world's biggest supermodels as she has nearly tripled her earnings in one year. Accounts for Lila's own company Grace Grove Ltd, published on Thursday, reveal her pay check jumped from \u00a3129,458 in 2022 to \u00a3359,433 in 2023. It is is evidence of a very successful year for Lila after she fronted campaigns for the likes of Pepe Jeans, an international denim brand based on Portobello Road in Notting Hill. She also starred in a campaign for the French brand Maje last year and is currently walking in several exclusive shows for Paris Fashion Week, or gracing the front row alongside Kate. After being signed to her mother's Kate Moss Agency when she was just 15, Lila became the face of Marc Jacobs Beauty in 2018. She went on to make her runway debut for the Italian fashion house Miu Miu in 2020, became an ambassador for YSL and made headlines when she walked the pink carpet for Victoria's Secret World Tour last year. The 21-year-old has been hit with her fair share of nepotism accusations - the most recent being when she appeared in an edition of Vogue called Legendary alongside the likes of Oprah Winfrey and Victoria Beckham. In 2021, when Lila was 19, she became the director of Grace Grove Ltd - the name of the company is a nod to The Grove, her family home in North London, which Kate sold in 2021. The company initially shared the same address as the Kate Moss Agency in Holborn but it appears that Lila has become independent of her 'protective' mother and moved to Soho. Success has struck the Moss family after Kate's agency also almost tripled the income for the bevvy of young models she's signed. Accounts for the company showed last year that feeds owed to its roster of models have rocketed from \u00a3814,000 to \u00a32.1million over the course of the year. The published accounts stated: 'Included in trade creditors is \u00a32,123,670 due to models in 2022, which was \u00a3813,929 in 2021.' Aside from Lila, Kate's talent agency includes singer Rita Ora, 33, and rocker Bobby Gillespie's son Lux, 20.", "summary": "The model, 21, who is the daughter of Kate Moss, showcased her jaw-dropping figure as she slipped into a burgundy bikini while soaking up the sun on the Spanish island.", "url": "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-13508839/Lila-Moss-21-showcases-incredible-figure-burgundy-bikini-enjoys-boat-trip-friends-holiday-Ibiza.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490", "image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/06/08/15/85874171-0-image-m-156_1717855621745.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 14:22:29", "author": "Editor,Sean O'grady", "authors": ["Editor", "Sean O'grady"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": 0.092}

However, when the IPO was announced, GMP was trading at Rs 16.\n\nAlso Read: RBI MPC Meeting Begins On Tuesday, Repo Rate Likely To Remain Unchanged", "source": {"uri": "english.jagran.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Jagran English"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ola_Electric", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ola Electric"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initial_public_offering", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Initial public offering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_rupee", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indian rupee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crore", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Crore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FirstCry", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FirstCry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bombay_Stock_Exchange", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bombay Stock Exchange"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Public company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_Bank_of_India", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reserve Bank of India"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Major_Companies", "label": "dmoz/Business/Major Companies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Marketing_and_Advertising", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Marketing and Advertising", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://imgeng.jagran.com/images/2024/08/06/article/image/IPO-1722933911869.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9794034", "eventUri": "eng-9794034", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-06", "textStart": 52, "textEnd": 60, "freq": 3}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-02", "textStart": 368, "textEnd": 377, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": 0.3019607843137255, "wgt": 207, "relevance": 1}

The low subscription level came despite the leading electric two-wheeler company's valuation eased to about $4 billion ahead of the Rs 6,145 crore IPO.\n\nCategories-wise, the heavy lifting was done by Qualified Institutional Buyers (QIBs) and retail investors as their portion was subscribed 5.31 times and 3.86 times the allotted quota, respectively. The non-institutional investors (High Net-worth Individuals) bid 2.39 times the portion set aside for them. The portion set aside for employees was subscribed 11.66 times against the reserved portion.\n\nOwing to low enthusiasm and rising volatility in the broader market, the grey market premium (GMP) of Ola Electric has fallen sharply in recent times, indicating a not-so-buoyant listing gain. Last checked, Ola Electric was commanding no premium in the unofficial market.\n\nBrokerage firms and analysts too have mixed views on the IPO as they expect Ola Electric to incur losses. They are also not satisfied with the $4 billion valuation. The Bengaluru-based reported a net loss of Rs 1,584.40 crore with a revenue of Rs 5,243.27 crore for the financial year ended on March 31, 2024.\n\nOla Electric is demanding an EV/sales multiple of 6.3 times, which is at a significant premium, said Choice Broking in a note. It added that key concern for the company is its reliance on government subsidies for generating sales and its loss-making operations.\n\nElara Securities in an IPO note said Ola Electric's EV market share of CY24TD is not sustainable, given peers are yet to ramp up their product portfolio and distribution network. Elara added that Ola's investment in cell manufacturing is a double-edged sword because to claim advanced chemistry cell (ACC) PLI, it will have to ramp up capacity to 20GWh by FY28 while captive demand could be much lower. Hence, if Ola Electric does not get OEM customers for its cell manufacturing, it would present a challenge.\n\nInCread Equities said that a cut in IPO valuation to $4 billion eases valuation risk at 6.8xFY24 sales versus global EV peers at 3-8xCY23F. \"We are constructive on IPO, however, quarterly volatility from policy, EV cell plant delay penalty risk and regular PE share sale to limit stock price gains. EV cell production success can extend an option value of Rs.7-10 per share,\" it stated.\n\nFor Ola Electric, the IPO will provide the much-needed impetus to invest in enhancing cell manufacturing capacity and research and development on future technologies and products.\n\nAccording to its prospectus, the company plans to utilise Rs 1,227.6 crore out of the proceeds of its Rs 5,500-crore public issue on capacity expansion of its cell manufacturing plant to 6.4 GWh from 5 GWh.\n\nThe company is also looking to use Rs 1,600 crore from the fresh fund on research and product development, another Rs 800 crore will be deployed to repay debts and Rs 350 crore for organic growth initiatives.", "source": {"uri": "newindianexpress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New Indian Express"}, "authors": [{"uri": "arshad_khan@newindianexpress.com", "name": "Arshad Khan", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ola_Electric", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ola Electric"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initial_public_offering", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Initial public offering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crore", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Crore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valuation_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Valuation (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_rupee", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Indian rupee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Common stock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatility_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Volatility (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Electric vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Investor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grey_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Grey market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broker", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Broker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsidy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Subsidy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_share", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Market share"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiscal_year", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fiscal year"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilowatt-hour", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kilowatt-hour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valuation_risk", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Valuation risk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organic_compound", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Organic compound"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospectus_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prospectus (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research_and_development", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Research and development"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemistry", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chemistry"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Cash_Flow", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Cash Flow", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Fuel_Cells", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Fuel Cells", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://media.assettype.com/newindianexpress%2F2024-08%2F9cf48721-b336-407a-b6f9-1facd4c8faf2%2FANI_20240801140657.jpg?w=1200&ar=40%3A21&auto=format%2Ccompress&ogImage=true&mode=crop&enlarge=true&overlay=false&overlay_position=bottom&overlay_width=100", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9794034", "eventUri": "eng-9794034", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 201, "relevance": 1}

Additionally, the Employee Portion was highly sought after, with a subscription rate of 11.66 times.\n\nInvestors have refrained from putting money on this year's biggest IPO so far despite the buzz created ahead of its D-Street debut.\n\nThe reason for this could be the market downturn which has gripped not just the Indian stock markets but also global markets.\n\nOLA Electric's IPO has a current Grey Market Premium (GMP) of Rs 0, as of August 6, 2024, 05:01 PM.\n\nGiven the price band of Rs 76, the anticipated listing price for OLA Electric's IPO is Rs 76 (sum of the cap price and today's GMP). This implies an expected percentage change in value per share of 0.00%.\n\nBrokerage firms have varied opinions on the IPO. Some analysts highlight Ola Electric's leadership in the electric two-wheeler (E2W) market, its focus on EVs, and the supportive regulatory environment as positive factors. However, concerns remain about the company's loss-making history and high valuations.\n\nFor the fiscal year 2023-24, Ola Electric reported a revenue of Rs 5,243.27 crore and a net loss of Rs 1,584.40 crore.

Being the first of a new batch of unicorns waiting in the wings to cruise into the capital markets, Ola would also give investors an early chance to buy into the EV adoption story, which is expected to follow a similar growth trajectory as China but range issues and a lack of charging infrastructure remain genuine handicaps, putting a brake on Ola's electrifying IPO this year.\n\nAbout the founder, Bhavish Aggarwal's electric scooters are as colourful as his tweets, which often mock colleagues, publications, and even pronouns. 'They (Ola) need to put their heads down and grow for another ten years before launching an IPO. If they go public now, they will put the company under unnecessary stress. The product is half baked, the organisation is half baked, and the CEO tweets as if he had fully baked,' says one user in a Reddit chat on X, depicting the public sentiments about the company.\n\nSo, will the hard-working entrepreneur capture the imagination of the Indian stock markets as he brings Ola Electric Mobility public in the largest IPO of the year thus far?\n\nIn FY24, the firm had sales of INR5,000 crore, a 90% increase over the previous year. However, it recorded losses of INR1,584 crore. Ola has reported losses for three years in a row despite staggering sales growth. Its operating revenue has grown, but so have its expenses, which include charges for technology, raw materials, and advertising.\n\nRevenue from operations climbed by more than seven times in FY23 to \u20b9 2,630.93 crore, up from \u20b9 373.42 crore the previous year. For the three months ending June 2023, revenue from operations was \u20b9 1,242.75 crore. However, the losses continue to pile up. In FY21, their loss was \u20b9 199.23 crore, which increased to Rs784.15 crore in FY22 and a huge \u20b9 1,472.07 crore in FY23. Net cash spent for operational operations increased to \u20b9 1,507.27 crore in FY23 from \u20b9 252.02 crore in FY21. The company has provided little guidance on what it intends to do to become profitable.\n\nMeanwhile, advertising, marketing, and sales promotion consume a great amount of money. In FY23, ad and marketing costs were for 2.34 % (\u20b9 61.47 crore) of revenue from operations, a decrease from \u20b9 49.24 crore or 13.23 % in FY22. Even while its spending on technology is growing, its share of the total revenue is decreasing as the pie grows larger. In FY21, technology expenses were \u20b9 9.43 crore, accounting for 1091.55 % of revenue from operations. This increased to \u20b9 98.3 crore in FY23, although it still only accounts for 3.76 % of revenue from operations.\n\nAnother key parameter contributing to its financial losses is a high attrition rate. Its staff attrition rate was 42.06 % and 47.48 % for the seven-month period ended October 2023 (on an annualised basis) and fiscal 2023, respectively. In other words, Ola merely checks the proper boxes in terms of growth, not profitability.\n\nDespite rising losses, Ola Electric maintained the market leader by volume in December and increased its market share to 40% in the EV two-wheeler sector. Ola increased its market share the highest, followed by Bajaj Auto, while TVS Motor had the greatest loss. Ola's market share increased greatly as a result of the company's strong marketing campaign, 'December to Remember', which gave aggressive discounts to customers and lowered product pricing.\n\nDelhi saw the greatest increase in penetration, rising from 6.9 % in November to 19.8 %. So, this game of discounting is not going to work in the long run. While Ola was able to raise gross margins, other expenditures remained relatively stable at 29% of sales, resulting in Ebidta losses of 25% of sales, leaving Ola with little room for improvement in profitability.\n\nWhat strikes out is that promoter Bhavish Aggarwal is offloading most shares in the OFS (Offer for sale). He plans to sell 4.73 crore equity shares through the IPO. As the only promoter with the greatest shareholding, selling almost 50 % of the total OFS shares, it raises concerns about Aggarwal's confidence in Ola Electric's company. Pre-IPO, Aggarwal owned 36.94 % of Ola Electric, with ANI Technologies and Indus Trust owning 4.35 and 3.85 %, respectively. Typically, promotors do participate in OFS during an IPO; however, in this case of Ola Electric, the promoter selling the most shares in the overall OFS is odd. It raises concerns about the promoter's confidence and commitment.\n\nThe firm is heavily reliant on the skills and reputation of Bhavish Aggarwal, the founder, chairman, and managing director of Ola Electric. He has a big impact on Ola Electric and ANI Technologies Private Limited, where he serves as chairman and managing director. Krutrim SI Designs Private Limited is his most recent venture. Ola Electric states in the DRHP that his engagement with ANI Technologies Private Limited and Krutrim SI Designs Private Limited may detract from the time that he may devote to the core firm.\n\nSecond, Aggarwal is a shareholder in Tork Motors Private Limited, which is in the same company as Ola Electric. \"Any potential conflict of interest may have a negative impact on Ola's business, prospects, operational performance, and financial condition,\" the firm notes. The business claims it cannot guarantee that Aggarwal would not prioritise the interests of such other companies over those of Ola Electric.\n\nTo be honest, Ola Electric is a company with a difference. It represents Bhavish Agarwal's penchant for taking big risks. He takes a unique approach to EVs and battery cells. In an industry known for its measured, slow-and-steady approach, he prefers sprinting all the time. But with speed come bumps. Ola Cabs has been diversifying. However, several of its operations (food delivery, foreign expansion, etc.) have closed or struggled due to significant losses, signalling the haphazard reputation of the founder that may trigger risks for the company.\n\nAgarwal has failed to deliver on numerous of his tall claims, including a svelte car, sleek motorbikes or a global rollout. He's missed production, sales, and other crucial deadlines while transitioning from one experiment to the next - ride-hailing, financial services, food, and now AI - with varied results. Such leaps of faith and irresponsible leadership will result in serious consequences for any public corporation. Finally, the method of price cuts for scaling carries its own set of hazards.\n\nOla has now captured a third of the E2W market in the year to March, representing a sixfold increase in only two years. With income rising 88% over FY23-24, Agarwal's story is based on sales numbers driving margin gains. When the overall running costs are already two-thirds cheaper, according to Bloomberg NEF calculations, the appeal of e-scooters to the huge, price-sensitive middle class is also obvious. But this is when the energy source begins to fail.\n\nLegacy peers like Bajaj and TVS, now second and third in the pecking order, have turned up the heat at the cost of market leader Ola, whose sales have halved in Q1FY25 (April-June 2024), according to Vahan statistics. Rajiv Bajaj, whom Agarwal challenged in a public debate, derived 14% of his revenue from E-variants with two and three Ws in the same June quarter. TVS IQube E-scooter sales have octupled in just 12 months, ending March 23. Second, even after six years of Sarkari subsidies, India's E2Ws control just 5% of the entire scooter market, according to HSBC estimates. Ola's disruption and dominance must be viewed through that lens.\n\nEV technology is rapidly changing, and Ola Electric faces significant risk as it attempts to stay ahead of the technology race. The company also relies on investor funding because its operation does not generate cash flows. On the other hand, legacy players like TVS Motor, Hero MotoCorp, and Bajaj Auto, with their successful ICE (internal combustion engine) operations, are making a lot of money and using some of it to support their efforts to exploit new possibilities in electric vehicles. Therefore, Investors must recognise that investing in pure EV firms entails a greater risk.\n\nFurthermore, as a new player in the EV business, Ola Electric has minimal experience producing, testing, delivering, and servicing EVs. While every EV it supplies must fulfil the applicable EV standards set by the Automotive Research Association of India and the Automotive Industry Standards as revised, these testing and approval methods may fail to detect and correct all latent, possible, and other problems.\n\nOla's warranty provision is 5.9% of sales, showing issues with product quality and after-sales. Ola's after-sales service has sparked public criticism. While same-day service is common in the two-wheeler market, the firm has been chastised for lengthy repair periods and overcrowded service centres. Ola has since expanded its service centres from 431 to 600 between March and July 2024.\n\nOla's valuation has fallen by a quarter at the upper end of the price range and over 35% at the lower end in less than a year after marquee private investors like Temasek jumped in at a tantalising $5.4 billion. It's crucial to investigate what has happened in the firm or the business strategy that has caused Aggarwal to lower his expectations. More so, when some of his late-stage backers are themselves taking some money off the table, some within couple of years after joining the cap table, even at a loss. Are they observing something in the organisation, like a major financial shortage, that we are not aware of?\n\nThe largest undertaking at Ola Electric is undoubtedly battery cell manufacture. This is also founder's passion project. The initial 6.4 GWH capacity planned for April 2025 is anticipated to cost roughly INR 3500 crore. Ola aims to increase the capacity to 20 GWH. The firm has had free cash outflows of roughly INR2,000 crore in the previous pair of years, and given that the enormous gigafactory will be ramped up and likely begin commercial production in the near future, we anticipate the company consuming a great amount of cash in the next two years. This signifies that the company will require a large amount of money. Aside from that, this endeavour poses a number of great hazards.\n\nOla aims to mass-manufacture a new technology format (4680 cells) but without the help of a technological partnership like Exide or Amara Rajas for lithium-ion batteries. Given this, there may be occasions when many problems arise, making resolution difficult and costly. Ola argues that its R&D prowess and vertically integrated technology and manufacturing skills, which include indigenous battery cell manufacture at its Giga plant, enable it to stand apart and decrease costs by a third. However, worldwide, battery technology is continually advancing. Lithium-ion is the finest chemistry available today, but it is pricey, import-dependent, and unstable (think scooter fires and regulatory penalties). Even Chinese engineers, who now dominate the EV industry, have yet to produce an alternative.\n\nThe 4680 cells can handle both LFP (lithium iron phosphate) and NMC (nickel manganese cobalt) chemistry. However, given Ola's large capacity plans, persuading other manufacturers to buy cells from its manufacturing would be vital. This will only be achievable if Ola's cells exhibit superior performance, dependability, and economic benefits in real-world applications.\n\nWith some of the tech startups selling below their IPO pricing, it's understandable that investors believe unit economics is the most important indicator of efficiency. To be sure, they agree that fledgling firms may burn cash and generate losses, but only if these losses are due to fresh investments and each vehicle sold contributes positively to the bottom line.\n\nLarge new-age digital businesses, like Nykaa (FSN E-Commerce Ventures), Zomato, and Paytm (One97 Communications), that went public in 2021, fared poorly in the secondary markets, resulting in significant value loss for stockholders. For example, investors in One97 Communications' IPO lost about 70% of their investment within 1.5 years after the offering. This made investors aware of the values of IPO-bound firms and raised concerns about their commercial prospects.\n\nIn the end, an impressive R&D expenditure is not enough; investors want to see what comes out of it. Without strong quality standards, a seasoned supply chain, a well-oiled governance structure, depth of distribution, and a churn rate that is more than four times industry averages, Ola could fall over while trying to grow, hence making OLA Electric IPO the biggest crash, bigger than Paytm & Zomato.", "source": {"uri": "inventiva.co.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "Inventiva"}, "authors": [],

Institutional investors oversubscribed by 5.3 times, while retail investors bid 3.9 times the shares up for grabs. This reflects strong market confidence, aligning with Prime Minister Narendra Modi's clean energy goals. However, the $4 billion valuation target is 25% lower than its 2023 funding round. Even with sales goal cuts and an 8% increase in losses due to raw material costs, Ola holds a dominant 46% share of India's e-scooter market as of June 30.\n\nThe broad investor appeal in Ola Electric's IPO amidst a global equity sell-off showcases robustness in the domestic market, which has raised $5 billion through 150 IPOs this year. Yet, the subscription rate for Ola was lower compared to previous big IPOs like Emcure Pharma, which saw 20 to 80 times oversubscription. Despite a 2.7% drop in local stock exchanges on the Monday before the IPO close, this successful listing demonstrates continued investor appetite for promising ventures in the EV sector.\n\nThe bigger picture: Global economic shifts on the horizon.\n\nOla Electric's impressive IPO performance underlines the growing demand for clean energy solutions amidst global economic challenges. Investing $150 million from the IPO into battery cell manufacturing underscores its strategy to overcome current financial difficulties and propel future profitability. As international markets navigate uncertainties, India's focus on sustainable ventures aligns with broader global trends toward clean energy and technological innovation.", "source": {"uri": "finimize.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Finimize"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ola_Electric", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ola Electric"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initial_public_offering", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Initial public offering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Electric vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institutional_investor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Institutional investor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Investor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stock market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorized_scooter", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Motorized scooter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valuation_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Valuation (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_energy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sustainable energy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narendra_Modi", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Narendra Modi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equity_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Equity (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_battery", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Electric battery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_exchange", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stock exchange"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innovation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Innovation"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Marketing_and_Advertising", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Marketing and Advertising", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Consulting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Consulting", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 78}], "image": "https://finimize-img.imgix.net/https%3A%2F%2Fchivas-assets.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com%2Fstatic%2Fimages%2Fdefault_prefix-img-Cp6ElX1SulaWajIKdxU0VKBK.png?ixlib=python-3.1.2&s=894f95d0338d1265e94edbda4d6abd87", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9794034", "eventUri": "eng-9794034", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-30", "textStart": 796, "textEnd": 803}], "sentiment": 0.2784313725490195, "wgt": 169, "relevance": 1}

The most important part is that early signs of profitability is seen, post the second half of FY27. All things put together, he believes that a price target about Rs 140 plus on the stock over the next 12 to 18 months is very reasonable and achievable. Bolinjkar says subscribers should buy into this story on IPO and on listing.\n\nWhat is your outlook on the Ola Electric IPO? On day 2, it has been subscribed fully. What is your outlook on the kind of interest that we have seen? Any take on the final subscription data?\n\nVinit Bolinjkar: We are very positive on the outlook for the company. In a crowded market with a very large number of incumbent players, they managed to carve out a 40% market share in a market which has just started penetrating. Today, the market penetration is about 5.5%. And we expect that over the next three years penetration should double and touch 9% to 10%. And even if we see that market share slip to about 30%, which is being realistic, we expect that their volumes will double. Turnover will also obviously double.\n\nWe also believe that the existing capacity that they have rolled out of 6.25 lakh vehicles per annum should be adequate even if they do not want to go for a capex plan to augment capacity keeping future in mind from here. The positive side about this is the fact that they are getting into battery packs also, which will help them to have complete control on the ecosystem.\n\nTheir margins are going to go up substantially. The most important part is we see early signs of profitability coming in, post the second half of FY27. If you put all these things together, we believe that a price target about Rs 140 plus on the stock over the next 12 to 18 months is very reasonable, achievable and we believe that subscribers should definitely buy into this story on IPO and immediately on listing.\n\nWhat about the real risk of disruption to a business? In the two-wheeler space, the existing incumbents are coming with their own line. Second, is the battery business. They do have technology, but again billions of dollars of global R&D is moving into bringing battery cost down. So, what are the chances that what looks good today could actually be disrupted?\n\nThat risk is always there and that is a moving target for the company. So, they will also be bettering their portfolio and bettering their technology. It is a very technologically and scientifically oriented organisation. They build everything in-house and they understand what goes into the working of the battery packs as well as the Ola electric vehicle.\n\nSecond thing that we must look at is if your batteries do not function or they lack performance compared to what developments happen internationally, they can always buy out batteries which they are doing currently as of now. So, to that extent, that risk gets mitigated by the fact that batteries would be easily available going ahead.\n\nWhat is the benchmark valuation for a business like this? What is the best way to understand, that this is the right way to establish the enterprise value or the market cap of Ola Electric?\n\nVinit Bolinjkar: We have built out an extensive DCF based model. We have done some forecasting based on how the ecosystem is expected to cannibalise from the ICE engines. And we have considered that there would be three or four large players who would have a reasonable market share in the system and which is the current story today.\n\nIf you see scooters, there are primarily four players. There is Bajaj, there is Hero, there is TVS and one more player if you can add. So, keeping this in mind, the incumbents that have come in, we believe that they would have a reasonable amount of market share between all of them. And keeping all this in mind, we believe a price has been deciphered on the basis of our discounted cash flow model.\n\nSo, what is the outlook in terms of any concerns that you see from Ola Electric? We spoke about the competitive intensity, but that aside what do you believe would be the challenges down the line?\n\nVinit Bolinjkar: Challenges down the line as I have been put on is obviously going to be technology and the battery pack, which is the heart of any mobility electric vehicle, that is going to be the key challenge. They are entering a space in which they do not have prior experience, which is the two-wheeler industry. But we need to understand also that Ola came into the higher market, they have developed a massive brand for themselves. Brand recall is very strong.\n\nOla's distribution network is very widely spread. They have put in place a gigafactory. So they understand the economies of scale and they have had the foresight to not only make the vehicle, but also to backward integrate into development of a battery pack. So, considering the foresight and the thought that the company has put into it, the challenges which are there stand mitigated by the actions that the company has taken.", "source": {"uri": "economictimes.indiatimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Economic Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ola_Electric", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ola Electric"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_battery", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Electric battery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initial_public_offering", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Initial public offering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_share", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Market share"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_rupee", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Indian rupee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_penetration", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Market penetration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battery_pack", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Battery pack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equity_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Equity (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lakh", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lakh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revenue", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Revenue"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_expenditure", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Capital expenditure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electric vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research_and_development", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Research and development"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discounted_cash_flow", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Discounted cash flow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economies_of_scale", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economies of scale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterprise_value", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Enterprise value"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hero_MotoCorp", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hero MotoCorp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bajaj_Auto", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bajaj Auto"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valuation_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Valuation (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scooter_(motorcycle)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scooter (motorcycle)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_combustion_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Internal combustion engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_capitalization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Market capitalization"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-112315116,width-1200,height-630,imgsize-29538,overlay-etmarkets/photo.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9794034", "eventUri": "eng-9794034", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 151, "relevance": 1}

Of these, the QIBs bid for 134.03 Cr shares.\n\nThe QIBs were allotted 25.23 Cr shares, and this portion was oversubscribed 5.31X. Among these, foreign institutional investors (FIIs) bid for the maximum number of shares at 82.42 Cr, while mutual funds subscribed to 41.44 Cr shares.\n\nMeanwhile, the retail investors' portion was subscribed 3.92X. They bid for a total of 33.26 Cr shares against 8.48 Cr shares on offer.\n\nNon-institutional investors (NIIs) bid for 2.4X of the total allotment of 12.72 Cr shares. This portion received bids for 30.5 Cr shares.\n\nThe portion reserved for Ola Electric's employees received 12X bids. The employees bid for 1.01 Cr shares as against 8.46 Lakh shares on offer.\n\nOla Electric will become the first automobile manufacturer to list on the Indian bourses in nearly two decades. The company is going public at a valuation of $4 Bn. Its public issue opened for subscription on August 2 and closed today (August 6).\n\nThe IPO comprised a fresh issue of shares worth INR 5,500 Cr and an OFS component of 8.49 Cr shares. The company set a price band of 72-76 per equity share for the offering. At the upper end of the price band, the EV manufacturer will raise over INR 6,145.6 Cr in total.\n\nOla Electric's net loss widened 7.6% year-on-year (YoY) to INR 1,584.4 Cr in FY24, while operating revenue jumped over 90% YoY to INR 5,009.8 Cr.\n\nWhile many brokerages recommended investors to 'subscribe' for its IPO, a few also raised some concerns.\n\nLKP Securities said in a recent research note, \"The vision (of the company) to become a one-stop shop for the EV industry by providing the cutting edge technology, state of the art infrastructure including the battery manufacturing should augur well for the future growth. Having said this, we are cognizant of the fact that the company is running into losses at the operating level itself, though the extent of loss margins are reducing.\"\n\n\"... based on the narrative of EV proliferation in the country (current EV scooter penetration at 15%), we believe Ola to run the tide being the only pure play 2W EV. Therefore, keeping an eye and a cautious view on the demand and thereby the reduction in losses for Ola, we recommend to subscribe this IPO with a long-term perspective,\" analyst Ashwin Patil said.\n\nInCred Equities said that it's positive on the IPO, however, reasons like policy volatility and penalty risk due to delay in commissioning EV cell plant would limit Ola Electric's stock price gains.\n\nMeanwhile, it is pertinent to note that the subscription of 4.27X for Ola Electric's public issue was quite low compared to the response received by startups which went public in recent times. Traveltech major ixigo's public issue was oversubscribed 98.34X, coworking startup Awfis received 11.4X subscription, while insurtech unicorn Go Digit's public issue was subscribed 9.6X.", "source": {"uri": "inc42.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Inc42 Media"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tapanjana_rudra@inc42.com", "name": "Tapanjana Rudra", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ola_Electric", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ola Electric"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_rupee", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indian rupee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromium", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chromium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initial_public_offering", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Initial public offering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institutional_investor", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Institutional investor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_fund", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mutual fund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Common stock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Electric vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Investor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broker", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Broker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valuation_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Valuation (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equity_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Equity (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lakh", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lakh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automotive_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Automotive industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_battery", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Electric battery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicorn_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Unicorn (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatility_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Volatility (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Startup_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Startup company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coworking", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coworking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scooter_(motorcycle)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scooter (motorcycle)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Cash_Flow", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Cash Flow", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://inc42.com/cdn-cgi/image/quality=75/https://asset.inc42.com/2024/01/Ola-electric-ipo-social.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9794034", "eventUri": "eng-9794034", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-02", "textStart": 1313, "textEnd": 1321}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-06", "textStart": 1340, "textEnd": 1348}], "sentiment": 0.3725490196078431, "wgt": 127, "relevance": 1}

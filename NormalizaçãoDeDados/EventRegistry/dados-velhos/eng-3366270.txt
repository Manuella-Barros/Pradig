Physicist Stephen Hawking and tech entrepreneur Elon Musk have also warned about the dangers of going too far, too quickly, in developing \"thinking robots\" with programmed intelligence that might keep evolving self-awareness, similar to the humanoids in the HBO series \"Westworld.\"\n\nHawking told the BBC in 2014 that \"development of full artificial intelligence could spell the end of the human race.\"\n\nSo there's that.\n\nResearchers vary in projections on how long from now, if ever, such a threat could exist.\n\nFor now, deaths by robot are very rare among industrial accidents.\n\nHowever, in July 2015, a 57-year-old technician was killed by a robotic machine in an Ionia, Michigan, plant that makes auto bumpers, trailer hitches and chrome-plated plastics. Her husband filed a federal lawsuit, being contested by the defendants, alleging a malfunctioning robot took her \"by surprise,\" crushing her head.\n\nAs chief technology officer for a private-public effort to facilitate robotic solutions in U.S. manufacturing, professor Howie Choset of Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh sees the fear of robots taking jobs making his mission tougher.\n\n\"You have to start this discussion with the baseline that automation and innovation creates jobs,\" he said, by leading to new products and processes and the new jobs to make and operate them.\n\n\"Then you have to ask yourself, why would robots be different? And people are very quick to say, 'Well, robots are intelligent, they do what humans can do,' and there's this fear that was sort of instilled by science fiction.\"\n\nComparing fear of robots to 19th-century worries about steam engines, Choset said: \"Robots are just the next generation of tools.\"\n\nSinger Aimee Mann, with help from actress Laura Linney, humorously depicted the danger of letting robots help you too much in a music video. And Choset was amused by a recent \"Dilbert \" strip about the boss' inability to stop a robot worker who decided to quit.\n\nChris Boggess, 18, found the 2004 movie \"I, Robot ,\" about a rogue killer robot drawn from Asimov stories frightening, but has come to appreciate their potential through the robotics program at Colerain High School near Cincinnati.\n\nCONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE\n\nCopyright 2017 The Associated Press.

Yet their impact is playing out differently throughout Ohio.\n\nFor example, although Ohio ranks second in the nation for the number of industrial robots in 2015 -- 20,415 altogether, according to the Brookings Institution -- there are more than three times as many industrial robots on a per-human-worker basis in the Toledo area as in Akron -- and as in Cincinnati, Cleveland or Columbus, too.\n\nThis has implications for the workforce, for politics and, of course, for the economy. They're both positive and negative; it depends on how society adapts as the trend marches onward.\n\nBrookings, a Washington think tank, is studying the implications across the country. This week it released a map and study showing where the robots are. It turns out that robots are heavily clustered in Michigan and Northwest Ohio, which is logical.\n\nWe'll explain with maps and charts, but first: Brookings made extensive geographical data available, so cleveland.com downloaded it, spoke with Brookings and conducted other interviews to look more closely at industrial robots in Ohio's metro areas.\n\nThese are industrial robots, or robots that perform tasks in factories and industrial settings. Brookings defines them as \"automatically controlled, reprogrammable machines\" capable of replacing labor in a range of tasks.\n\nThe growth rate and their penetration into the workforce in just five years has been phenomenal. Nationally, the number of industrial robots in the workplace grew by 19 percent a year from 2010 to 2015, the Brookings data show. That matches the 19 percent rate in Ohio.\n\nLet's repeat: That's 19 percent a year. The raw numbers show the number of industrial robots grew by 143 percent nationally in that short span, and just about the same in Ohio.\n\nThis figure does not measure productivity. But experts say once the robots are up and running and workers know how to use them, robots can boost a factory's productivity, particularly when performing repetitive tasks.\n\nIf you're a company shareholder or appreciate the gains that productivity contribute to the nation's role in the global economy, this might sound good. If your family or community income depends upon jobs with repetitive tasks that are likely to become automated, this is probably worrisome.\n\nNationally, they're clustered.\n\nBrookings plans to examine social and economic effects in coming months, but when looking at where the robots are, it found big clusters in the upper industrial Midwest.\n\n\"Robots, it turns out, are congregating densely in some places but are hardly found in others,\" said the study, by Mark Muro, a senior fellow and director of Brookings' Metropolitan Policy Program. \"Specifically, the map makes clear that while industrial robots are by no means everywhere, they are clustered heavily in a short list of Midwestern and Southern manufacturing states, especially the upper Midwest.\"\n\n\"This clustering follows logically from the fact that the auto industry--highly concentrated in the Midwest and upper South--currently employs nearly half of all industrial robots in use,\" the study said.\n\nThe recent growth occurred for a reason.\n\nRobots have been popular for the last 20 years, but the growth since the last recession has been striking. It's also been logical.\n\nIt followed the government's audo industry bailout of 2009.\n\n\"The crisis and near-death of the auto industry clearly reinforced really intensive efforts to reinvent and boost productivity,\" Muro said in a telephone interview. Some of that \"was demanded\" by the bailout, \"essentially demanding better practices and productivity.\"\n\nThe number of robots is interesting. Other numbers are more telling.\n\nNationwide, there were nearly 235,000 industrial robots in the United States in 2015. Michigan had the most -- 27,632, followed by Ohio's 20,415.\n\nBut density of robots, measured by their number in a state's workplaces compared with the number of workers, reveals more. Indiana, Kentucky and Alabama, for example, have fewer residents than Ohio, and therefore fewer workers. They also have fewer robots.\n\nBut they have more robots on a per capita basis, measured by the number of robots for every 1,000 workers. That suggests robots have played a significant role in their workforce changes and in the states' economies.\n\nCheck out Tennessee. Its factories have almost half as many robots as Ohio's, and it has a smaller overall population. But on a robot-per-worker basis, Tennessee matches Ohio.\n\nWhat about Ohio?\n\nWe mentioned that the Toledo area is among the leaders in robots. But that's on a per capita basis. If you want to look at the raw number of robots, the Cincinnati metro area, which includes northern Kentucky, is top in the state, followed by Cleveland and Columbus.\n\nHere's a look at the numbers. The blue lines show the number of industrial robots in each metro area in 2010. The red lines show the growth by 2015.\n\nBut let's look a different way.\n\nIt's no coincidence that the longest lines fall in parts of Ohio with the most people, the most jobs and the broadest economic bases. Sure, those cities have a lot of robots. But they also have a lot of factories without robots.\n\nHow can we tell? Brookings makes is easy by supplying per-capita numbers, too. Look how things change when you view robots on the basis of 1 robot for every 1,000 workers.\n\nWhat's the deal with Akron?\n\nSo why does Akron have so few robots compared with living, breathing workers?\n\nWe asked a few experts. First, it's important to remember the strong correlation between the auto industry and robotics. That's why Toledo, Springfield, Lima, Mansfield and Youngstown rank so high. Half of all industrial robots are in plants making cars and trucks, said Brookings' Muro.\n\nAkron's low per-capita number also reflects the kind of industries using -- and not using -- robots right now. A company is willing to invest in a robot that can save it money on repetitive tasks, or do jobs that don't require piece-by-piece, project-by-project adjustments.\n\nRobots work well for assembly of cars and trucks They are good when heavy lifting is involved. But Akron has developed an industrial base that focuses on polymers, coatings, chemicals and lighter materials. Akron workers do research and development and make pieces and parts shipped elsewhere for final assembly. The workers play a role in the supply chain.\n\nThese are jobs not necessarily requiring or aided by robotics, said Eric Amis, dean of the University of Akron's College of Polymer Science and Polymer Engineering.\n\nAmis, like others interviewed, said that was his guess, although they all acknowledged they are speculating because they have not looked into it more deeply.\n\n\"We don't have heavy footprints,\"said Richard Redabow, executive vice president of the Greater Akron Chamber. By that, he means large industrial plants of 500,000 or 1 million square feet. \"We don't have heavy industrial, but we have specialty manufacturing.\"\n\nThe I-75 corridor plays a role.\n\nRyan Ausburger, vice president of the Ohio Manufacturers' Association, said all this rang true, and he suggested looking at another perspective: a map showing manufacturing density, or the share of manufacturing jobs in every Ohio county. While it doesn't directly correlate with where the robots are, it adds to the understanding of why the Toledo area ranks so high.\n\nThe common denominator, he said, is the Interstate 75 corridor that runs straight up Ohio's western side, connecting the state to Michigan's auto industry. I-75, he said, \"is a line that supports automaking.\"\n\nThis leads to President Trump.\n\nSo about robots: They do work once performed by people. And workers who are displaced and cannot find replacement jobs tend to get anxious. That may have played out in the 2016 presidential election.\n\n\"It is telling that the robot incidence in red states that voted for President Trump in November is more than twice that in the blue states that voted for Hillary Clinton,\" Muro says in his paper, citing Brookings' research using data from the International Federation of Robotics.\n\n\"This is not to say robots determined the outcome of the 2016 election,\" Muro adds. \"However, the red-state robot concentration does suggest that to the extent industrial automation brings difficult labor market transitions and anxiety, it will visit those difficulties most heavily on a particular swath of red-leaning America--specifically, the most robot-exposed locations in the industrial Midwest.\"\n\nIf you know Ohio, you might shake your head at this, because while it's true that Trump carried Ohio, Toledo -- the metro area where robots have had the biggest impact -- still votes Democratic.\n\nBut winning elections is all about the margins.\n\nClinton won Lucas county, whose seat is Toledo, just as Democrats always do. But her margin of victory (she carried Lucas with 56.1 percent of the vote) was lower than any Democrat's in a presidential election since 1992, according to a post-election analysis by cleveland.com data analysis editor Rich Exner.\n\nWhat the future holds.\n\nMuro isn't convinced the march of robots spells doom. \"It should not be assumed that a high number\" for robot density \"is a scary number and negative,\" he said.\n\nSuch a number can spell efficiency and technological advances in the workplace.\n\nBut \"there certainly is displacement\" and anxiety, he added.\n\nThat is bolstered by a research paper in March from MIT economists who concluded \"robots may reduce employment and wages.\"\n\nThat study looked at past losses. Later this year, Brookings hopes to examine the implications for the future. Meanwhile, asked what this all means to a worker in Cleveland, Muro said, \"I think it's a wake-up call.\"\n\nWorkers, employers, politicians and the government will need to consider how to adapt -- and how to help the current workforce as well as displaced workers -- as automation spreads, aided by advances in artificial intelligence. This has implications beyond the factory.\n\n\"The bottom line,\" Muro said, \"is that this is a reminder that workers are going to need new skills and a new mindset, because clocking in and doing a routine job is going to be done by robots.\"", "id": "9899476", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-18", "title": "Robots are affecting jobs in Ohio -- and maybe politics, too", "image":

And heavy lifting too, as they twirl while hauling fabric shelves filled with cinder blocks.\n\nAnd finally - once they've been given the green light by their makers - about 38 robots assemble in a tight four-row formation and in orderly fashion wheel themselves up onto pallets that will be shipped to one of the 25 Amazon warehouses that employ automatons.\n\nAmazon staffers call it the \"graduation ceremony,\" and it takes place several times a day. \"It's a proud-mama moment,\" an Amazon spokeswoman said, during the first visit to the facility by a reporter since the e-commerce giant bought the former Kiva Systems in 2012. So far this year the company has graduated more than 55,000 robots.\n\nThese robots, and the thousands of Amazonians who build, program and use them, are laying out the next episode in a very old story - the evolving relationship between humans and their tools.\n\nFrom the sharp stones wielded by our early ancestors to the internet, every step along the way has awakened new possibilities, and new fears too.\n\nNow, it's the turn of robotics, a discipline that after decades of experimentation and recent big leaps in artificial intelligence has finally reached a maturity that allows mass deployment.\n\n\"We're at an inflection point - the ability of robots to be useful at a low-cost point,\" said Beth Marcus, a robotics expert and startup founder who recently joined Amazon Robotics as a senior principal technologist.\n\nThis latest wave of automation has spurred anxiety among scholars and policymakers. They warn it might contribute to a growing economic divide, in which workers with more education or the right skills reap the benefits of automation, while those with inadequate training are replaced by robots and increasingly left out of lucrative jobs. It's not a novel concern: Spinning jennies, which revolutionized the weaving industry, sparked similar resistance in 19th century England. And in the 1960s, the U.S. government created a task force to study the impact of technology on livelihoods. \"If we understand it, if we plan for it, if we apply it well, automation will not be a job destroyer or a family displaced,\" President Lyndon Johnson said at the time.\n\nHistory has shown that, over time, job losses in rapidly advancing sectors are offset by gains in other activities spurred by a growing economy.\n\nThat perspective doesn't quell contemporary concerns. Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates has proposed taxing robots to pay for other jobs, such as teachers. Some scholars also seem to be losing faith in the old playbook.\n\n\"There's never been a worse time to be a worker with only 'ordinary' skills and abilities to offer, because computers, robots and other digital technologies are acquiring these skills and abilities at an extraordinary rate,\" Massachusetts Institute of Technology professors Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee wrote in their 2014 book, \"The Second Machine Age.\"\n\nIn a recent report, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development said that technology is contributing to the disappearance of middle-skill jobs, both in manufacturing and in clerical work, even though it helps create both highly skilled and low skilled positions.\n\nAmazon is the modern poster child for automation, and not only because of the orange warehouse robots. Its machine-learning software lets the company predict customer behavior. New retail concepts, such as the Amazon Go convenience store in downtown Seattle, heavily rely on sensor technology in an effort to do away with the need for cashiers.\n\nAmazon is also working hard to have drones deliver items to people's homes, a move that may replace a lot of delivery drivers.\n\nBut automation certainly hasn't slowed down Amazon's colossal appetite for people. The company's payroll expansion has long exceeded revenue growth: In the quarter that ended last June, its workforce grew by 42 percent to 382,400 jobs, versus sales growth of 25 percent.\n\nIt's hard to say, in the case of Amazon, how many potential human jobs have gone to the robots, or inversely, how many new positions have been created to handle this new feature of working life.\n\nBut Amazon says that warehouses equipped with robotics typically see \"greater job creation with more full-time employees,\" due to the increased volume of orders these centers can handle. Amazon also says automation has meant the creation of desirable, high-skilled jobs designing robots and teaching them how to do things, as well as middle-skilled jobs such as repairing the robots, or simply focusing on more sophisticated warehouse tasks while letting machines do the boring stuff.\n\nMarcus says that there are plenty of tasks humans will monopolize for a long time.\n\n\"There are many things humans do really well that we don't even understand yet,\" Marcus said.\n\nAmazon Robotics' facility, in suburban Boston, was first established by Kiva Systems, a company founded on the concept of flipping warehouse logistics around. Instead of having workers walk to products, it sought to bring items to the workers. The solution: flat, wheeled robots called \"drive units\" that navigate a warehouse by reading stickers on the floor, all while carrying merchandise on their back.\n\nAmazon bought Kiva in 2012 for $775 million in cash and started introducing the robots into its warehouses in 2014.\n\nSince then, the robotics facility stopped selling to other customers, while its orange robots, now in their fourth generation, have come to play an important part in Amazon's operations. In fact, robotics seem to be more important to Amazon's bottom line than to other tech giants also making big bets in the field, such as Google, experts say.\n\n\"For Amazon, it's mission critical,\" said Pedro Domingos, a machine-learning expert at the University of Washington.\n\nTye Brady, the chief technologist for Amazon Robotics, noted that the e-commerce behemoth is in a \"unique spot.\"\n\n\"We have the ability, through our automation and our robotics, to change the real world\" by immediately deploying the most recent advances throughout the company's widespread footprint, he said in an interview.\n\nBrady, who joined Amazon two years ago after a two-decades-long career in aerospace and robotics, said that in his ideal vision of the future, society might look a little bit like the original \"Star Wars\" movie, in which humans and robots coexisted happily, with the latter capably helping humans lead more purposeful lives. \"Our machines will allow us to focus on what we want,\" he said.\n\nA few steps into the Amazon Robotics building, a small sign warns visitors - in jest - to please not feed the robots.\n\nSome 500 employees work in the facility, mostly engineers and scientists, as well as technicians who assemble the robots. The hardware side is led by Parris Wellman. As a kid he wanted to build cars and went on to earn a mechanical-engineering degree at the University of Pennsylvania. There, studying under prominent roboticist Vijay Kumar, Wellman discovered robots. After a Ph.D. from Harvard and a few years in biotech and in medical devices, he joined Amazon Robotics, returning to what he calls his \"first love.\"\n\nWhat he likes about the opportunity is that he can build something and deploy it en masse pretty quickly.\n\nAnother interesting aspect of the work, he said, is that the roboticists get plenty of feedback from the warehouse associates who will be dealing directly with the robots. For example, associates helped designers pick out the color of the new lightweight fabric shelves that the robots carry: yellow, because that makes it easier to see the items they carry.\n\nAnd it was a maintenance worker at a warehouse who designed, and patented with Amazon's help, a metal rod that staffers use to push inactive robots around the factory floor (it's easier than picking up the 750-pound robots).\n\n\"Innovation is not restricted to a particular set of people,\" Wellman said.\n\nIn addition to hardware engineers, the facility employs software developers who animate the drive units throughout the Amazon empire. \"People don't realize Amazon Robotics has a huge software stack,\" says Jill Sestini, a developer who was Kiva System's 30th employee when she joined in 2006.\n\nThat software prowess got a huge boost after the Amazon acquisition because of the proprietary technology the new owner brought to the table, she said.\n\nThe current job of the Boston-area native - who builds motorcycles as a hobby and comes from a family of amateur craftspeople who made their own furniture - is to oversee the interfaces that allow the robots to interact with humans more easily.\n\nOne of her projects: an app on a Fire tablet that lets warehouse workers without highly advanced computer skills control the drive units when they fail or an item falls in their path. Hundreds of tablet-toting warehouse workers across the 25 highly automated warehouses operated by Amazon now have that ability.\n\nBrady, the Amazon Robotics' chief technologist, says the roboticists' efforts have brought a more than 50 percent increase in storage efficiency at the Amazon warehouses that employ robots. That means they can contain more items in a smaller space. These warehouses are also where Amazon figures out how people and machines can work together as in a \"beautiful symphony,\" according to Brady.\n\nOne of these centers is in DuPont, Wash., a warehouse dedicated to mid-size and large items, where 500 humans work alongside hundreds of robots. There the automatons have the run of the core of the warehouse, a maze brimming with metal shelves stocked with merchandise.\n\nThey operate in a different space from the humans, who are mostly on the outskirts of the facility. But they work together in an elaborate, seemingly seamless dance.\n\nThe robots bring empty shelves out from the depths of the warehouse to a person who loads them with individual items unpacked from pallets as they arrive at the distribution center. The robot then races back into the interior of the facility, putting the shelf back in its place. The automatons can lift up to 3,000 pounds.\n\nWhen an order comes in, a human operator in another part of the warehouse calls up an item from a computer. A robot will then wheel out the shelf containing the item, which the human will pick out and place on a conveyor belt.\n\nThe interaction with the robotic workforce has created new types of roles.\n\nBarry Tormoehlen, a former electrician and conveyance mechanic, is one of a dozen people at DuPont who do preventive maintenance on the drive units, \"wipe them down\" every once in a while and fix them when needed.\n\nOver time, Tormoehlen has learned to recognize the individual units, which each have a number and a maintenance history of their own. The collaboration between these robots and humans has created a local folklore.\n\nWorkers have painted some of the robots to give them personality: A robot with fiery flames on its sides is known as the \"devil drive.\" Another, decorated by warehouse workers in blue and yellow instead of the usual orange, is dubbed \"The Minion,\" after animated characters who have the same color pattern.\n\nDuring a recent visit to the DuPont center, 29-year old Ashley Parks, a former medical assistant from Yelm, Wash., stowed newly arrived items of various shapes and sizes onto a shelf atop \"The Minion.\"\n\n\"They kind of dance around you,\" she said of the automatons, adding that they make her more efficient in her job.\n\nAs for fears of one day losing her job to a machine, she seemed nonchalant. \"I don't think they're going to take away our jobs,\" she said. \"They stay on their side, I stay on my side.\"", "id": "9439038", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-16", "title":

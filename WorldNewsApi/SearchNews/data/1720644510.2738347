This year, football legends and celebrities will join forces at Stamford Bridge on Sunday for the 18th time. Since kickstarting in 2006, the event has raised an eye-watering \u00a390 million for the charity, helping those in need in countries such as Cambodia. 2024 will see the likes of Robbie Williams, Paddy McGuinness, Tom Grennan, Erin Doherty and Bobby Brazier taking part for the England team. Meanwhile, Roman Kemp, Usain Bolt, Tommy Fury, Martin Compston and Lee Mack will feature on the World XI team. Previously, Mark has played in six matches for the charity match but last year was forced to miss Soccer Aid due to prior commitments. The former The Only Way Is Essex star had previously played as an impressive left-back in the matches. Speaking in 2023, Mark said: \"On a personal level I've decided not to do Soccer Aid this year. I have done it for six years in a row now and I love it, I love the charity and would love to be involved and still raise money for Unicef. If I'm around I'll maybe still watch the game, but I just need to keep myself free around that time. I need to let someone else have a go and maybe I'll come back next year but for now I'm going to have a year out.\" During his last appearance in 2022, Wright scored from the penalty spot during the 2-2 draw and even managed to find the net during the shootout before England were ultimately defeated.

It's an amazing time, what it seems on the exterior is this really serious match but it's such a wonderful vibe, everyone is friendly, everyone is happy to be there and it raises so much money, you hear people say it but it's really for a good cause. You see where the money's going and we get to live out our childhood dreams. \"You've got these fully grown men and women that are melting at the fact that we're able to go out in these stadiums with legends and these are the parts of the job of someone that is in the industry, this is the great perk of the job.\" \"I've been lucky enough to do this a few times now,\" he said before continuing: \"Even to say you're in the same dressing room as them is like an out-of-body experience and for someone like me, I would do anything for any form of football of my life. I melt in the presence of footballers, I can meet anyone in our industry but as soon as it comes to a footballer, I'm gone to the world. You just don't want to make any form of mistake.\" Since commencing in 2006, England have won five times but their last win was in 2018.

However, today\u2019s economic realities facing pre-retirees and retirees differ vastly from those of previous generations. Gone are the days of pensions, economic stability and low interest rates. Within my own company, we have found we must consider that those who seek our guidance may not actually be living the full retirement experience. The Changing Retirement Landscape More than 4.1 million Americans will reach age 65 through 2027, which could result in more than 11,000 Americans retiring daily. But for many pre-retirees, the traditional retirement age of 65 no longer applies. With the decline of company-paid pensions and reduced employer support for retirement savings, seven out of 10 pre-retirees believe they will face more challenges in retirement than their parents and grandparents did. Those retiring today face a fluctuating market, where withdrawing from retirement accounts may deplete savings faster than anticipated. Given the potential for future financial challenges and stubborn inflation, it's common for pre-retirees to believe they must save more today to create a buffer for their future. Looking Toward The Future For many workers today, retirement no longer involves quitting their jobs altogether. One recent report revealed that 57% of Americans plan to work at least part-time during retirement. While financial necessity is a driving factor for some, others do still seek the fulfillment and social engagement that work provides.

Working with these younger generations, we know they often feel behind when it comes to milestones like homeownership and may one day look to part-time work in retirement to fill that gap. Fortunately, recent legislative changes taking effect this year have made saving for retirement more accessible. Provisions from the Secure 2.0 Act offer several benefits to future retirees. Employers can now consider student loan payments as qualifying contributions toward retirement-matching programs, and they can offer employees the option of contributing to an emergency fund paired with their retirement plan. Emergency access to retirement savings accounts has been made more accessible, allowing people to withdraw up to $1,000 annually for specific emergency needs without penalty. Contribution limits for health savings accounts (HSAs), 401(k) plans, and individual retirement accounts (IRAs) have all increased, and more people will be able to contribute to Roth IRA accounts with increased income limit ranges. Taking Next Steps This \u201cnew retirement\u201d presents challenges and opportunities for future retirees and financial services professionals alike. Based on my experience helping clients pivot their plans, I believe that creating a holistic retirement strategy encompassing health and wealth that can allow you to be fully prepared, no matter what. Diversifying portfolios across asset classes and considering guaranteed sources of income\u2014like life insurance or annuities\u2014as part of a prudent retirement plan can help provide you with stability and security for years to come When designing your retirement plan, here are several steps that can help ensure your plan will support you in your retirement years. 1. Diversify your portfolio: To manage risks associated with fluctuating markets, diversify your investments across different asset classes. This approach helps mitigate any sequence of returns risk. Avoid putting all your financial eggs in one basket, which can lead to significant losses in volatile markets. 2. Incorporate guaranteed income sources: Consider including life insurance or annuities in your retirement strategy. These can provide a stable income stream and help cover essential expenses. Avoid overlooking these options, as they can be crucial in maintaining a set standard of living. 3. Maximize benefits from recent legislative changes: Take full advantage of the provisions offered by the Secure 2.0 Act. For instance, if you have student loans, you may want to seek an employer that considers these payments as qualifying contributions toward retirement-matching programs. Also, contribute to an emergency fund that pairs with your chosen retirement plan, and make use of the increased contribution limits for HSAs, 401(k)s and IRAs. 4. Plan for part-time work, if desired: Reflect on the possibility of part-time work during retirement, not only for additional income but also for personal fulfillment and social engagement. This step is increasingly popular and can help bridge financial gaps while staying active and engaged. Retirement is a chance at a new beginning.

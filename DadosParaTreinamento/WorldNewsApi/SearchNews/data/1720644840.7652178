Speaking at the opening of the Extraordinary Meeting of the D-8 Council of Foreign Ministers in Istanbul, Fidan said those who stand for peace in Palestine will prevail. The meeting was hosted by Turkiye at the Dolmabahce Palace in Istanbul to discuss the situation in Gaza. The organization brings together various countries from three continents, totaling 1.2 billion people and a combined gross domestic product of up to $5 trillion, Fidan said. \u201cToday, as D-8 countries, Bangladesh, Egypt, Indonesia, Iran, Malaysia, Nigeria, Pakistan, and Turkiye, we announce our strongest support for Palestine from Istanbul.\u201d Highlighting that this organization is based on six principles \u2013 peace, dialogue, cooperation, justice, equality, and democracy, Fidan said that these principles are all the more relevant as the world grapples with various challenges and uncertainties. This meeting was organized to demonstrate further support and solidarity for Palestine, he added. \u201cMore than ever, Gaza needs hope and support, but above all, it needs action. This war is not a war of Israel-Palestine anymore but a challenge to global democracy.\u201d Fidan pointed out the international system is collapsing due to its \u201chypocrisy\u201d and the \u201cblindness\u201d of some countries. The developments in Gaza before their eyes for the past eight months indicate the erosion of norms and values since last October, the Turkish foreign minister said. \u201cContinuation of Israeli carnage is triggering further societal escalation and public anger.

Turkiye believes in resolving regional problems with regional solutions, Fidan said. Fidan emphasized that since the early days of the war, the OIC has taken resolute steps and for the first time, the Muslim world has shown such a resolved stance in its own regional problems. \u201cThere are countries changing their policies and countries accepting the just cause of Palestine.\u201d \u201cIn addition to the OIC (Organisation of Islamic Cooperation), efforts of Muslim world continue under different forums such as the Arab League, Organization of Turkic States and the Gulf Cooperation Council. \u201cThese undertakings are all components of a comprehensive approach for creating a systematic leverage against Israel. \u201cIn addition to the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, steps have been taken in organizations such as the Arab League, the Turkic Council, and the Gulf Cooperation Council.\u201d Due to Israel\u2019s attempts to escalate the war, our brothers and sisters are under increasing threat in the region and beyond, he said. The recent incident on the border with Egypt, the targeting of Lebanon, and the attacks on the Iranian Consulate in Syria are examples of this \u201cregional spill-over,\u201d he said. The D-8 provides another platform for them to demonstrate their solidarity against Israeli aggression, said Fidan. \u201cThis is also a venue for supporting our brothers in the region in these difficult times.\u201d The foreign minister also appreciated Egypt for its \u201coutstanding role in the entry of humanitarian assistance into Gaza.\u201d Stating that Israel has committed all crimes under international law one after the other, Fidan said: \u201cWhat is happening in Gaza is a disgrace to humanity.\u201d \u201cStanding with Gaza against such tyranny and oppression is a duty we should all fulfill in the name of humanity.\u201d He added It is a fight to maintain dignity and against occupation, annexation and illegal settlements.

Our meeting today is a reaffirmation of our commitment. \u201c Fidan said Turkiye has been steadfastly committed to a two-state solution. \u201cThe establishment of a sovereign, independent and contiguous state of Palestine on the 1967 lines with East Jerusalem as its capital is a precondition,\u201d he said. He noted that with Spain, Norway, Ireland, and most recently Slovenia recognizing Palestine as a state, hundreds of countries have stood against \u201chistorical injustice.\u201d \u201cThe rest of the countries will eventually follow suit. \u201c \u201cAt one point, Palestine will be a full member of the UN. We steadily call on others to recognize the State of Palestine. \u201cIt is high time that the UN Security Council should heed this call and not be kept hostage to one country.\u201d Palestine deserves all kinds of political, economic and legal support, Fidan stressed. \u201cOur efforts are therefore currently focused on sustained, unimpeded and continuous humanitarian access to Gaza and an immediate and lasting cease-fire,\u201d he said. He added that Israel has always \u201cmanipulated\u201d and \u201crejected\u201d these cease-fire efforts. \u201cWe must work for a just and lasting peace after securing a permanent cease-fire. This can only be achieved by diplomacy and compromise. \u201cThere is no other choice but an independent and sovereign Palestine State. This is a must for the safety and security of Israeli people as well as regional and international stability. \u201cFor that, it is time to think outside the box and away from the box of tried and tested approaches.\u201d He added Turkiye is prepared to exert every effort toward this goal and endorse these viable options.

A mix of materials is almost as bountiful, with leather used for the white base and overlays in yellow, green and red. Corduroy is used for the white collar, while pink suede forms the toe tip and heel counter. What looks to be patent leather is also used for the blue strap and black mustache, the latter of which features a metallic silver Nike Air logo. Based on the shots taken of Nigo wearing the sneaker, there don't appear to be any external marks denoting his involvement.\n\nNigo, who founded Bape and led the brand as its creative director until selling it in 2013. He was a frequent collaborator with Adidas at Bape, and the Japanese streetwear brand's Air Force 1-lookalike Bape-Sta led to a lawsuit filed by Nike well after his departure and settled in April with an agreement for Bape to discontinue several sneaker models and modify the designs of others.\n\nThe Japanese designer was spotted in another Air Force 3 colorway last fall, with rumors of a Nigo x Nike debut circulating ever since. Through Kenzo, he also launched a new partnership with Asics earlier this year.\n\nLike the rest of the sneakers in Nike's Air Force series, the Air Force 3 hasn't been nearly as popular as the Air Force 1. The Air Force 3 made its debut in 1988 and was worn by many players in the NBA. Nike has brought back the sneaker infrequently, the most recent occasion being a Don C collaboration in 2017.\n\nThe Nigo x Nike Air Force 3 is expected to release this fall, although no further information has been revealed yet.

The bright colorway caught many eyes as NIGO walked out to close KENZO's SS25 runway at Paris Fashion Week. Buzz has already started growing around the silhouette as it's something new and original in a game that's growing bored of the old and remixed.\n\nPer Hypebeast:\n\nIt was first reported in April 2023 that NIGO and Nike had a collaborative shoe in the works. In November, NIGO was spotted in New York wearing a pair of Nike Air Force 3 Lows with mocha brown details, seemingly inspired by 1988's Air Force 3 High \"Escape.\"\n\nAt Kenzo, NIGO rocked a totally different Nike Air Force 3 Low, albeit still with a retro-inspired design. Spotted by @stevenvictor, the crisp white shoes featured multi-colored panels - with shades of pink, yellow, green, red, purple and black - as well as a red Swoosh.\n\nNIGO also reworked the tongue on the shoes, which reads \"AIRFORCE\" at the top, along with another logo that was partially concealed by the laces.\n\nWe're not gonna lie, we're low-key feeling these joints.\n\nThe NIGO x Nike Air Force 3s are expected to release some time this coming fall for a reasonable $160.\n\nWill you be trying to cop a pair?

We may receive compensation when you click on links to those products. The opinions and information provided on this site are original editorial content of Sneaker News.\n\nSneakerheads were caught off guard by news of a Comme des Gar\u00e7ons x Nike Air Max TL 2.5 collaboration earlier this year, but after the most recent SNKRS Showcase, everything makes a lot more sense. While we're still waiting on the CDG collab to arrive later this Fall, Nike plans to deliver fresh general release Air Max TL 2.5 colorways in Spring 2025.\n\nOne of several obscure models from the late 2000s, the Air Max TL 2.5 falls within a line of \"Total\" Air Max shoes that began in the 1990s. Aesthetically speaking, it's probably best recognized by shared qualities with the Air Max 97. A full-length Air unit warrants the \"Total\" moniker, while wavy TPU overlays encompass the base in familiar fashion.\n\nSneakerheads can expect a handful of new and old colorways for Spring 2025, but anticipation kicks off with a stealthy black/green pair and balanced black/white/orange mix. The Air Max TL 2.5 probably won't command the same reception as the more sought-after Nike Spiridon, which is returning in its OG colorway for Holiday 2024, but has fertile grounds for success within the Air Max catalog.

The \"Maxxed Out\" section included a ton of high-heat releases for this winter and beyond, and none are more flashy than the Swarovski Air Max Plus, coming in women's sizing at the tail end of this year.\n\nA shoe that never falls far out of favor, the Air Max Plus \"Sunset\" makes another appearance here, a logical jumping off point for a crystallized take on the acclaimed Tn model. The iconic gradient is replicated with the company's jewels, spread across scores of red, orange and yellow that fill in between the TPU waves. Inversely, a \"Triple Black\" pair serves as a foil to that colorful edition, swapping the layout of the crystals onto those plastic overlays and creating a Swoosh via outline.\n\nWhile the Austrian jewelry company isn't particularly picky when it comes to the sneaker companies they join up with, the history of Nike x Swarovski is already quite deep. Silhouettes like the Ja 1, Air Force 1 , Air Max 97 and Air Max 95 (with the help of Supreme) have shuffled into the jewelry imprint's oeuvre over just the past few years.\n\nConcrete release information will surely emerge as we get closer to both pairs' launches towards the end of the year.

The opinions and information provided on this site are original editorial content of Sneaker News.\n\nNike is absolutely no stranger to pushing together two or more of their own designs, regardless of the eras that either of the composite models come from. However, it's hard to think of a hybrid that takes its cues from further ends of the spectrum than the Nike Air Max Waffle SP, revealed during the latest SNKRS Showcase.\n\nIn the showcase itself, the presenters described the silhouette as \"hallucinogenic,\" and it's not hard to see why. While the simplistic construction of the Waffle Trainer and the wonky sole unit of the Air Max Plus are both iconic, and thus easily understood on their own, their clashing design language makes for a surreal mashup. However, some unexpected synergy comes with the application of \"Waffle\" traction, shockingly meshes well when grafted on the Air Max Plus' outsole.\n\nThe \"Action Green\" edition here leans into the punch of the mismatch construction, creating clear separation via the opposing neon tones spotlighted on top and bottom. Truthfully, it's easier to see the vision on the \"Voltage Purple\" style, creating cohesion with the paired purple nylon upper and TPU shank, the orange Swoosh and Air unit, and the anchoring jet black that outlines the whole design.\n\nAs with many Nike hybrids of this kind, the composition will likely take a bit to sink in either way, and you've got some time let that happen.

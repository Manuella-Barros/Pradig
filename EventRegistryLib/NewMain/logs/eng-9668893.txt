Stat. \u00a7 346.02(8)(a).\n\nThe Door County Circuit Court initially ruled in favor of the village, stating that sidewalks are not pedestrian ways under the relevant statutes.\n\nThe court concluded that the statutory language does not include sidewalks within the definition of pedestrian ways.\n\nJustice Dallet explained that the definition of pedestrian way in \u00a7 346.02(8)(a), when read in the broader context of related statutes, does not encompass sidewalks.\n\nThe court noted that the legislature could have explicitly included sidewalks in the prohibition if that was their intention but chose not to.\n\n\"The ordinary meaning of the statutes, considered in their entirety and context, suggests that sidewalks and pedestrian ways are distinct categories,\" Justice Dallet wrote. \"Therefore, the limitations on condemnation in \u00a7\u00a7 32.015 and 61.34(3)(b) did not prohibit the Village from condemning Sojenhomer's property to build a sidewalk.\"\n\nChief Justice Ziegler, joined by Justices Rebecca Grassl Bradley and Brian Hagedorn, dissented. The dissenting opinion argued that the statutory definition of a pedestrian way is broad and plainly includes sidewalks, which are specifically constructed for pedestrian use.\n\n\"All sidewalks are pedestrian ways, but not all pedestrian ways are sidewalks,\" Chief Justice Ziegler wrote. \"The Village exceeded its condemnation authority when it acquired Sojenhomer's property through condemnation to construct a sidewalk.\"\n\nThe Supreme Court's decision allows the Village of Egg Harbor to proceed with its sidewalk construction project.\n\nThis ruling establishes a precedent for future cases involving property condemnation under eminent domain.", "source": {"uri": "theepochtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "www.theepochtimes.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statute", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Statute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidewalk", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sidewalk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisconsin_Supreme_Court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wisconsin Supreme Court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Supreme court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Local government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eminent_domain", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Eminent domain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circuit_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Circuit court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plaintiff", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Plaintiff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisconsin", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wisconsin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wisconsin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Door_County,_Wisconsin", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Door County, Wisconsin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Door County, Wisconsin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Hagedorn", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brian Hagedorn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prohibition_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prohibition in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissenting_opinion", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dissenting opinion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_Justice_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief Justice of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precedent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Precedent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legislature", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Legislature"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Property_Rights", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Property Rights", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Flying_Discs/Double_Disc_Court", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Flying Discs/Double Disc Court", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Real_Estate/Undeveloped_or_Vacant", "label": "dmoz/Business/Real Estate/Undeveloped or Vacant", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 57}], "image": "https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2024/06/20/id5672298-Wisconsin_Redistricting_24017582635854-OP-1080x720.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9668893", "eventUri": "eng-9668893", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-19", "textStart": 57, "textEnd": 64}], "sentiment": 0.04313725490196085, "wgt": 236, "relevance": 1}

In 2022, a California court notoriously ruled that bees qualify as fish. Today, in Sojenhomer v. Village of Egg Harbor, the Supreme Court of Wisconsin ruled that a sidewalk is not a \"pedestrian way.\" They thereby enabled local governments to use eminent domain to condemn property to build sidewalks, despite a state law forbidding the use of eminent domain to take property to for \"pedestrian way[s].\" The close 4-3 decision might become a staple of law school textbooks.\n\nIt may seem obvious that a sidewalk is, in fact, a pedestrian way. Indeed, as the court notes, the relevant statute defines a \"pedestrian way\" as \"a walk designated for the use of\n\npedestrian travel.\" That seems to pretty obviously include sidewalks! You don't have to be a property scholar like me to see that.\n\nBut the majority opinion by Justice Rebecca Frank Dallet emphasizes that \"[t]he ordinary meaning of a statute is dictated by more than the literal meaning of a single phrase, read in isolation.\" She argues that the statute uses \"pedestrian way\" and \"sidewalk\" in ways that indicate the two are supposed to be separate and distinct concepts:\n\nReading the text of this section as a whole, we find several indications that the definition of pedestrian way does not include sidewalks. For starters, both \u00a7 346.02(8)(a) and (b) use the terms \"sidewalk\" and \"pedestrian way\" in ways that signify that each term has a separate, non-overlapping meaning....\n\nSection 346.02(8)(b) states that pedestrian ways shall be treated \"as if\" they were sidewalks for utility installation and assessment purposes. The phrase \"as if\" signals that one category (pedestrian ways) should receive the same treatment as a different category (sidewalks)....\n\nThe language of \u00a7 346.02(8)(a) also suggests that sidewalks are not pedestrian ways. That paragraph makes the rules of the road pertaining to sidewalks also applicable to pedestrian ways. But if sidewalks are pedestrian ways, then the rules of the road applicable to sidewalks would already apply to pedestrian ways. The point here, to be clear, is not that reading the term \"pedestrian way\" to include sidewalks would\n\nresult in surplusage....\n\nThese arguments are clever. But I don't think they overcome the definition of \"pedestrian ways\" spelled out in the text of the statute: \"a walk designated for the use of\n\npedestrian travel.\" When the legislature specifically defines a term, that definition trumps any indirect contextual inferences that judges can extract from other passages in the law.\n\nSometimes, a term might have a specialized technical meaning in a statute that is different from its ordinary language meaning. But that isn't the case here. The legislature specifically defined the term in a way that precludes interpreting it as a convoluted \"term of art.\"\n\nIn addition, the seeming anomalies identified by the majority are effectively dealt with in Chief Justice Annette Kingsland Ziegler:\n\nThe plain language of the statute demonstrates that the term \"pedestrian way\" is broadly defined, and includes sidewalks. A sidewalk -- -- that portion of the highway created for the travel of persons on foot -- -- is clearly a subset of pedestrian ways -- -- walks set apart or assigned for the use of pedestrian travel. It is a straightforward, common sense interpretation of the statutory language that a \"walk designated for the use of pedestrian travel\" necessarily includes that part of the highway \"constructed for the use of pedestrians...\"\n\n[I]n other words, a closer look at the plain meaning of the statutes reveals that all\n\nsidewalks are pedestrian ways, but that not all pedestrian ways are sidewalks....\n\nI acknowledge that Wis. Stat. \u00a7 346.02(8) employs both the term \"sidewalk\" and the term \"pedestrian way\" in two separate sentences, in close proximity. And under some\n\ncircumstances, these things might suggest that the terms have wholly distinct meanings. But a logical answer exists to this assumption: A sidewalk is always a pedestrian way, but the term \"pedestrian way\" is broader than solely being a sidewalk....\n\nOnce you recognize that \"all sidewalks are pedestrian ways, but that not all pedestrian ways are sidewalks,\" then there is no mystery created by statutory language that, for example, says pedestrian ways must be treated \"as if\" they are sidewalks. The meaning of that section is that the rules applying to sidewalks also apply to pedestrian ways, even those that are not sidewalks. And, as the Chief Justice points out, that latter category includes a lot of things, such as \"a skywalk or a walking path in a public park not adjacent to the highway.\"\n\nI would add that the eminent domain context is also notable here. In Wisconsin, as in many other states, statutes granting the power of eminent domain must be \"strictly construed\" against the government. As a previous Wisconsin Supreme Court decision put it, courts must \"strictly construe the condemnor's power . . . while liberally construing\n\nprovisions favoring the landowner.\" If the government is going to use the \"despotic power\" of eminent domain, property owners should at least be given clear indication about the purposes for which their land might be taken.\n\nThe majority refused to apply this rule here, because it claimed that the relevant statutes are \"not ambiguous\" and clearly indicate the government can use eminent domain to condemn property to build sidewalks.

The Supreme Court ruling overturned an appeals court ruling in March of 2023 that sided with Sojenhomer LLC, the property owner.\n\nThe main issue the justices considered was if a sidewalk falls under the umbrella of being a \"pedestrian way.\" State statues do not allow condemnation of property by a municipality to make a pedestrian way, such as a walking trail or bicycle lanes, but municipalities can condemn properties to build a road safety feature.\n\nSojenhomer's contention was that sidewalks are pedestrian ways, which State Statute 346.02(8)(a) defines as \"a walk designated for the use of pedestrian travel.\" However, Egg Harbor claimed that sidewalks are considered as part of the road according to State Statute 340.01(58), which says, \"'Sidewalk' means that portion of a highway between the curb lines, or the lateral lines of a roadway, and the adjacent property lines, constructed for use of pedestrians,\" thus opening the door for condemnation.\n\nThe sidewalk is on County G next to Shipwrecked as part of a safety improvement project around the road's intersection with State 42, where the restaurant and brewery is located. Previously, pedestrians had to walk on the narrow road that could see heavy traffic and vehicle parking at peak times.\n\nThe village sought to buy a sliver of the Shipwrecked property, about 392 square feet (0.009 acres), bordering County G so it could build the sidewalk. But after two offers were rejected by Sojenhomer as inadequate and not coming close to the appraised value, Egg Harbor condemned the property in 2019 so it could proceed with the sidewalk.\n\nSojenhomer sued in 2020, but Door County Circuit Court Judge David Weber ruled in favor of the village a year later, agreeing with Egg Harbor's position that state statutes define \"sidewalk\" and \"pedestrian way\" distinctly.\n\nSojenhomer appealed, and in March of 2023 the District 3 Court of Appeals overturned Weber's decision and ruled in Sojenhomer's favor. The judges wrote in their decision that \"the general definition of a pedestrian way in (state statute) is broad and plainly includes sidewalks because a sidewalk is a 'walk designated for the use of pedestrian travel.'\"\n\nWithin a month of the appeals court decision, Egg Harbor filed a petition with the state Supreme Court to reconsider.\n\nWriting for the majority, Justice Rebecca Dallet noted all parties agreed that if sidewalks were to be considered as pedestrian ways by statute, the village would have been prohibited from condemning the property to build the sidewalk.\n\nHowever, Dallet cited the language in 346.02(8)(a) that says, \"All of the applicable provisions of this chapter pertaining to highways, streets, alleys, roadways and sidewalks also apply to pedestrian ways\" and similar language in 346.02(8)(b) as an indication that sidewalks are not the same as pedestrian ways.\n\nShe also noted that the state statutes that ban condemnation of property to create a pedestrian way specifically mention recreational trails, bicycle ways and pedestrian ways but not sidewalks, again emphasizing that sidewalks are defined by the state as being part of the roadway.\n\n\"Given that, we conclude that the definition of 'pedestrian way' in 346.02(8)(a) does not include sidewalks, and accordingly hold that the limitations on condemnation in (the statutes) did not prohibit the village from condemning Sojenhomer's property to build a sidewalk,\" Dallet wrote. She was joined in the majority by justices Ann Walsh Bradley, Jill Kaorfsky and Janet Protasiewicz.\n\nIn her dissent, Justice Annette Ziegler wrote that the statute's definition of \"pedestrian way\" does include sidewalks because they're meant for pedestrians even if they are part of the roadway. She also wrote that the majority decided that sidewalks are not pedestrian ways without more firmly establishing what is a pedestrian way. Joining Ziegler in dissent were fellow conservative-leaning justices Rebecca Bradley and Brian Hagedorn.\n\n\"The plain language of the statute demonstrates that the term 'pedestrian way' is broadly defined, and includes sidewalks,\" Ziegler wrote. \"A sidewalk - that portion of the highway created for the travel of persons on foot - is clearly a subset of pedestrian ways - walks set apart or assigned for the use of pedestrian travel. It is a straightforward, common sense interpretation of the statutory language that a 'walk designated for the use of pedestrian travel' necessarily includes that part of the highway 'constructed for the use of pedestrians' and intended 'for the use of persons on foot.'\n\n\"... A closer look at the plain meaning of the statutes reveals that all sidewalks are pedestrian ways, but that not all pedestrian ways are sidewalks. As a result, the village cannot condemn this property.\"\n\nContact Christopher Clough at 920-562-8900 or cclough@gannett.com.\n\nMORE: Southern Door elementary principal also will be middle school principal in cost-saving move", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craft_beer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Craft beer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shipwrecked_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Shipwrecked (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statute", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Statute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "U.S. state"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidewalk", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sidewalk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Village", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Village"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisconsin_Supreme_Court", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wisconsin Supreme Court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Municipality", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Municipality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedestrian", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pedestrian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberalism_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Liberalism in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicycle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bicycle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisconsin's_3rd_congressional_district", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wisconsin's 3rd congressional district"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebecca_Dallet", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rebecca Dallet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisconsin_circuit_courts", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wisconsin circuit courts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Weber", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "David Weber"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brewery", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brewery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Door_County,_Wisconsin", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Door County, Wisconsin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Door County, Wisconsin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebecca_Bradley_(justice)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rebecca Bradley (justice)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janet_Protasiewicz", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Janet Protasiewicz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Hagedorn", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brian Hagedorn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ann_Walsh_Bradley", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ann Walsh Bradley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annette_Ziegler", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Annette Ziegler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_school", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Middle school"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Roads_and_Highways", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Roads and Highways", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Roads_and_Highways/North_America", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Roads and Highways/North America", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Urban_Living", "label": "dmoz/Home/Urban Living", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Roads_and_Highways/Photography", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Roads and Highways/Photography", "wgt": 8}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/GO8XJbZOR8DwSxTwMj42QQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/green-bay-press-gazette/ddd07e3d27af4ffc069afd0dfdf91ddc", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9668893", "eventUri": "eng-9668893", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-19", "textStart": 118, "textEnd": 125}], "sentiment": 0.1529411764705881, "wgt": 233, "relevance": 1}

The area had been identified as hazardous for both pedestrians and motorists, prompting the village to seek solutions to improve safety.\n\nThe proposed sidewalk required taking .009 acres of land from Sojenhomer LLC, the owner of Shipwrecked Brew Pub and Restaurant.\n\nSojenhomer LLC challenged the Village's action, arguing that Wisconsin Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 32.015 and 61.34(3)(b) prohibit the use of condemnation to acquire property for pedestrian ways.\n\nThe plaintiff contended that sidewalks fall within the definition of pedestrian ways as \"walks designated for the use of pedestrian travel\" under Wis. Stat. \u00a7 346.02(8)(a).\n\nThe Door County Circuit Court initially ruled in favor of the village, stating that sidewalks are not pedestrian ways under the relevant statutes.\n\nHowever, the Court of Appeals reversed this decision, agreeing with Sojenhomer LLC that sidewalks are indeed pedestrian ways, thus blocking the village's condemnation efforts.\n\nThe majority opinion by Justice Rebecca Dallet and joined by Justices Ann Walsh Bradley, Jill Karofsky, and Janet Protasiewicz, sided with the Village of Egg Harbor.\n\nThe court concluded that the statutory language does not include sidewalks within the definition of pedestrian ways.\n\nJustice Dallet explained that the definition of pedestrian way in \u00a7 346.02(8)(a), when read in the broader context of related statutes, does not encompass sidewalks.\n\nThe court noted that the legislature could have explicitly included sidewalks in the prohibition if that was their intention but chose not to.\n\n\"The ordinary meaning of the statutes, considered in their entirety and context, suggests that sidewalks and pedestrian ways are distinct categories,\" Justice Dallet wrote. \"Therefore, the limitations on condemnation in \u00a7\u00a7 32.015 and 61.34(3)(b) did not prohibit the Village from condemning Sojenhomer's property to build a sidewalk.\"\n\nChief Justice Ziegler, joined by Justices Rebecca Grassl Bradley and Brian Hagedorn, dissented. The dissenting opinion argued that the statutory definition of a pedestrian way is broad and plainly includes sidewalks, which are specifically constructed for pedestrian use.\n\n\"All sidewalks are pedestrian ways, but not all pedestrian ways are sidewalks,\" Chief Justice Ziegler wrote. \"The Village exceeded its condemnation authority when it acquired Sojenhomer's property through condemnation to construct a sidewalk.\"\n\nThe Supreme Court's decision allows the Village of Egg Harbor to proceed with its sidewalk construction project.\n\nThis ruling establishes a precedent for future cases involving property condemnation under eminent domain.", "source": {"uri": "ntd.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NTD"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statute", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Statute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Supreme court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisconsin_Supreme_Court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wisconsin Supreme Court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Local government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eminent_domain", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Eminent domain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circuit_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Circuit court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plaintiff", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Plaintiff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisconsin", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wisconsin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wisconsin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Door_County,_Wisconsin", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Door County, Wisconsin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Door County, Wisconsin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janet_Protasiewicz", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Janet Protasiewicz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jill_Karofsky", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jill Karofsky"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebecca_Dallet", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rebecca Dallet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Hagedorn", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brian Hagedorn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ann_Walsh_Bradley", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ann Walsh Bradley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prohibition_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prohibition in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majority_opinion", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Majority opinion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissenting_opinion", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dissenting opinion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precedent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Precedent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legislature", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Legislature"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Property_Rights", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Property Rights", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Flying_Discs/Double_Disc_Court", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Flying Discs/Double Disc Court", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Bocce", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Bocce", "wgt": 10}], "image": "https://i.ntd.com/assets/uploads/2024/06/id1000511-AP24169788462953.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9668893", "eventUri": "eng-9668893", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-19", "textStart": 57, "textEnd": 64}], "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 231, "relevance": 1}

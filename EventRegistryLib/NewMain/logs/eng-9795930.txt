Andy Ogles of Tennessee said Tuesday that the FBI confiscated his cellphone in an investigation into issues with his campaign finance reporting.\n\nThe first-term member of the conservative Freedom Caucus said on the social platform X that the FBI took his phone last Friday and he promised to fully cooperate with the agency, saying he already has done so with the Federal Election Commission.\n\nOgles had just defeated an opponent in a Republican primary election the day before with an endorsement from former President Donald Trump,\n\nOgles said his understanding is that the FBI is investigating \"mistakes in our initial financial filings\" that have been \"widely reported for months.\" Among the discrepancies: Ogles had reported that he loaned his 2022 campaign $320,000, but in recent months adjusted the report to remove the loan.\n\n\"I am confident all involved will conclude that the reporting discrepancies were based on honest mistakes, and nothing more,\" Ogles said in the post.\n\nOgles also was the subject of a January ethics complaint by the nonprofit Campaign Legal Center over his personal and campaign finances, in which the group compared him to expelled GOP U.S. Rep. George Santos of New York.\n\nAn FBI spokesperson said that under Justice Department policy, it could not confirm nor deny an investigation, and referred questions to the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Middle District of Tennessee. An official with the U.S. attorney's office declined to comment.\n\nOgles faces Democrat Maryam Abolfazli in the November election. Her campaign did not immediately return an emailed request for comment.\n\nLast Thursday, Ogles defeated a well-funded Republican opponent, Nashville Metro Councilmember Courtney Johnston, by 12 percentage points, despite her description of Ogles as a \"do-nothing grandstander\" who is \"mired in scandals.\"\n\nOgles won the seat in 2022 after Republicans redrew the state's congressional districts to their advantage after the last census, splitting the heavily Democratic Nashville area into three seats and forcing Nashville's then-Democratic congressman, Jim Cooper, into retirement.\n\nOgles is a former mayor of Maury County, two counties south of Nashville.", "source": {"uri": "washingtontimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Times"}, "authors":

Andy Ogles' phone amid campaign finance issues", "body": "U.S. Rep. Andy Ogles, R-Columbia, defeated Metro Nashville Council member Courtney Johnston. He now faces Democrat Maryam Abolfazli in November.\n\nThe FBI on Friday took possession of U.S. Rep. Andy Ogles' cell phone as part of an investigation he believed concerned his campaign finance filings, the freshman congressman said in a social media post Tuesday afternoon.\n\n\"It has been widely reported for months that my campaign made mistakes in our initial financial filings,\" Ogles said in the post made to X, formerly known as Twitter. \"We have worked diligently with attorneys and reporting experts to correct the errors and ensure compliance going forward. It is my understanding that they are investigating the same well-known facts surrounding these filings.\"\n\nOgles' phone was taken one day after he survived a primary election challenge last week. The congressman faces ongoing scrutiny over his federal campaign finance filings, and personal finance disclosures.\n\nOgles is seeking re-election in Tennessee's 5th Congressional district this year, with former President Donald Trump's endorsement. Ogles defeated a well-funded primary challenge from Republican Courtney Johnston on Thursday evening, who challenged Ogles' integrity and first-term record. U.S. Department of Justice typically does not take overt investigative action against political candidates that could influence how people vote within 60 days of an election.\n\nElizabeth Clement-Webb, a spokesperson for the FBI's Memphis Field Office declined to confirm or deny the search, pursuant to U.S. Department of Justice policy.\n\nMark Wildasin, spokesperson for the U.S. District Attorney's Office for the Middle District of Tennessee, declined to confirm or deny the existence of a search warrant.\n\nOgles' congressional office did not respond to a request for comment. His chief of staff directed The Tennessean to Ogles' social media post.\n\nChannel 5 reported earlier Tuesday that the FBI executed a search warrant on Ogles but did not specify where the search occurred nor what was searched.\n\nFor more than two years, Ogles has faced scrutiny and multiple complaints over his federal campaign finance disclosures.\n\nShortly before the primary in 2022, an Federal Election Commission complaint was filed against him alleging a \"pattern of malfeasance\" in Ogles' financial dealings. Ogles' attorney responded to a request for comment with a threat of legal action.\n\nHe's also had to deal with chronic problems stemming from his campaign finance disclosures. He was required to pay $5,750 in civil penalties for campaign finance violations after the 2022 cycle, the Nashville Scene first reported.\n\nHe recently admitted that a self-loan of $320,000 that he had reported as cash to the FEC for two years was in fact a \"pledge\" for funding for which the need never arose.\n\n\"We set money aside. It was in a joint account, which you can't do -- we know that now -- so technically we have to go back and say the campaign didn't have full control,\" Ogles said. \"But that being said when my wife and I and decided that I was going to run for Congress, we set aside every penny we had to put into the race.\"\n\nOgles' personal finance disclosures do not reflect a savings or checking account under Ogles' control with the amount he said he made available to his campaign. But his disclosure does include a mortgage loan initiated in January 2022 in the corresponding amount range. Maury County property records do not reflect any property purchase in January 2022 by Ogles. But he did buy a house adjacent to his family home in September, just after winning the primary. He later sold that home to his Congressional district director at a $60,000 loss.\n\n\"That money was real, it existed, and it was ready to be used. Fortunately, we didn't have to use it,\" Ogles said during a recent radio interview. \"That was money that we had saved over time being frugal. It was a big commitment. We went all in. ... We really felt that this was a God thing.\"\n\nOgles has said publicly that he hired an outside campaign finance compliance consultant to go back \"with a fine-toothed comb\" and fix mistakes reported to the FEC.\n\nIn his social media post on Tuesday, Ogles said he would cooperate with the FBI and the FEC.\n\n\"I am confident all involved will conclude that the reporting discrepancies were based on honest mistakes, and nothing more,\" he wrote.\n\nOgles is also currently facing an ethics complaint filed by the Campaign Legal Center in January requesting an investigation into discrepancies in the congressman's financial disclosures, including the personal loan of $320,000.\n\nCampaign Legal Center Ethics Director Kedric Payne on Tuesday said the watchdog group expected a possible FBI investigation since Ogles had significant discrepancies in his financial reports, but the swift action is surprising.\n\nPayne, a former deputy chief counsel for the Office of Congressional Ethics, said such investigations usually take much longer.\n\n\"With a move this quickly, the evidence must be strong, especially to move in an election year,\" he said. \"It looks like what we complained about is the tip of the iceberg of what may be going on. It looks very serous.\"\n\nOgles has also admitted that he was \"mistaken\" about what degree he received from Middle Tennessee State University, after scrutiny that he embellished his credentials and work experience during the 2022 primary.", "source": {"uri": "tennessean.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Tennessean"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Ogles says FBI took phone day after primary win amid campaign finance scrutiny", "body": "Rep. Andy Ogles (R-Tenn.) said that the FBI took possession of his cell phone last week as part of what he said is an apparent investigation into campaign finance issues.\n\n\"It has been widely reported for months that my campaign made mistakes in our initial financial filings. We have worked diligently with attorneys and reporting experts to correct the errors and ensure compliance going forward,\" Ogles said in a post on X on Tuesday.\n\n\"Last Friday, the FBI took possession of my cell phone. It is my understanding that they are investigating the same well-known facts surrounding these filings. I will of course fully cooperate with them, just as I have with the Federal Election Commission,\" Ogles said. \"I am confident all involved will conclude that the reporting discrepancies were based on honest mistakes, and nothing more.\"\n\nLocal Tennessee outlet NewsChannel 5 Nashville broke the news that the FBI executed a search on Ogles earlier on Tuesday.\n\nThe FBI seizure of Ogles' cell phone came a day after he defeated a well-financed primary challenger. The Department of Justice generally avoids taking steps in an investigation close to an election, often referred to as the 60-day rule, though it is not established in writing.\n\nOgles, a first-term lawmaker and member of the House Freedom Caucus who did not immediately support former Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) in January 2023, won the primary with 56.5 percent of the vote, according to Decision Desk HQ.\n\nLegal counsel for Ogels did not immediately return The Hill's request for comment, nor did the FBI.\n\nU.S. Attorney's Office for the Middle District of Tennessee spokesperson Mark Wildasin declined to comment, \"pursuant to department policy.\"\n\nThough federal authorities have not confirmed the reason for the search, it is apparently the latest development in Ogles getting heat over campaign finance issues and his personal biography.\n\nAt the center of the scrutiny was a $320,000 loan that Ogles reported that he made to his own 2022 campaign as it began. NewsChannel 5 raised questions about how Ogles financed that loan since he also reported few personal assets.\n\nThe Campaign Legal Center, a nonprofit watchdog, filed a complaint with the Congressional Ethics Office in January over the issue, saying that Ogles failed to disclose \"the assets that he purportedly used\" to make the loan, as well as failing to report a $700,000 line of credit that he opened in 2022.\n\nThe complaint compared Ogles to former Rep. George Santos (R-N.Y.), who famously fabricated swaths of his biography and is facing felony charges for fraud after his own campaign finance issues, and was expelled from Congress last year. Ogles, a NewsChannel 5 report alleged, had exaggerated his credentials - which the ethics complaint referenced, noting his claims of being \"an 'economist' who formerly worked in 'law enforcement' and 'worked in international sex crimes' or 'human trafficking' when he lacks meaningful career or educational background in any of these fields.\"\n\nOgles later filed a series of amendments to his Federal Election Commission disclosures\n\nOgles said in a statement in May that while he had pledged to loan his own campaign up to $320,000 \"if needed\" - \"everything I own\" - he only needed to transfer $20,000.\n\n\"Unfortunately, the full amount of my pledge was mistakenly included on my campaign's FEC reports,\" Ogles said in the statement, saying that he files amendments to his FEC reports to \"reflect the circumstances of my original pledge.\"", "source": {"uri": "thehill.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hill"}, "authors": [{"uri": "emily_brooks@thehill.com", "name": "Emily Brooks", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campaign_finance", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Campaign finance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Ogles", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Andy Ogles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WTVF", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "WTVF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennessee", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tennessee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tennessee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_Desk_HQ", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Decision Desk HQ"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_Caucus", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Freedom Caucus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_McCarthy_(actor)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kevin McCarthy (actor)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Election_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal Election Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nashville,_Tennessee", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nashville, Tennessee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nashville, Tennessee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Speaker of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Santos", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "George Santos"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campaign_Legal_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Campaign Legal Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Felony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_trafficking", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Human trafficking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economist", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonprofit_organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nonprofit organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ethics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fraud"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Science_and_Technology", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Science and Technology", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Commercial_Lending", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Commercial Lending", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/12/oglesandy_111522gn_w.jpg?strip=1&w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9795930", "eventUri": "eng-9795930", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.04313725490196085, "wgt": 226, "relevance": 1}

(WTVF) -- FBI agents executed a search warrant late last week on Tennessee Congressman Andy Ogles as the first-term Republican faces continuing scrutiny over fraudulent campaign financial reports that he filed, NewsChannel 5 has confirmed.\n\nReached by telephone Tuesday, Ogles' attorney declined to comment, although he did not deny that his client had been targeted for a search by federal authorities.\n\n\"I'm not going to confirm or deny that there was a search warrant issued,\" the attorney, G. Kline Preston IV, told NewsChannel 5 Investigates in a brief conversation.\n\nDetails of exactly what areas were authorized to be searched remain murky, although individuals familiar with such investigations suggested the warrant may have been limited to Ogles' electronic devices.\n\nA spokesperson for the FBI declined to comment, referring questions about Ogles to the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Middle District of Tennessee.\n\n\"Pursuant to department policy, we have no comment,\" U.S. Attorney spokesperson Mark Wildasin said in an email to NewsChannel 5.\n\nLaw enforcement sources in Maury County, where Ogles' home is located, were not notified about any searches, although one source was told that the FBI had executed a search warrant somewhere in the county in recent days.\n\nNeighbors in the sparsely populated rural area told NewsChannel 5 Investigates that they had not seen any unusual activity around the congressman's home.\n\nExecution of the search warrant came immediately after Ogles defeated Courtney Johnston in the Republican primary as he seeks a second term in the U.S. Congress. Department of Justice guidelines generally prohibit law enforcement from taking any overt actions in investigations of a political candidate in the 60 days before an election.\n\nBack in May, Ogles filed a series of amended campaign financial reports, admitting he had not personally loaned his campaign $320,000 as he had reported back in 2022.\n\nOther amendments to his campaign financial reports resulted in Ogles retracting claims regarding thousands of dollars in campaign contributions and expenditures that he had previously reported to the Federal Election Commission.\n\nThat development came several months after NewsChannel 5 Investigates raised questions about whether Ogles had the financial resources to make that personal loan. Despite having reported making the $320,000 personal loan, Ogles' personal financial disclosures did not show any substantial investments -- not even a savings account.\n\nA watchdog group, the Campaign Legal Center, later filed a complaint with the Office of Congressional Ethics, comparing Ogles' conduct to disgraced New York Congressman George Santos.\n\nSantos is now facing a criminal indictment that accuses him of reporting non-existent personal loans to his campaign in order to be eligible for other campaign contributions.\n\nThis is a developing story.

Andy Ogles (R-TN) late last week.\n\nDetails are sparse but Nashville's WTVF reports Congressman Ogles \"faces continuing scrutiny over fraudulent campaign financial reports that he filed, NewsChannel 5 has confirmed.\"\n\nThe Associated Press adds Ogles says the FBI took his cell phone.\n\n\"Back in May, Ogles filed a series of amended campaign financial reports, admitting he had not personally loaned his campaign $320,000 as he had reported back in 2022,\" WTVF reports. \"Other amendments to his campaign financial reports resulted in Ogles retracting claims regarding thousands of dollars in campaign contributions and expenditures that he had previously reported to the Federal Election Commission.\"\n\nIn January the watchdog group Campaign Legal Center alleged, \"Rep. Ogles' financial disclosure reports appear to include over $1 million in financial discrepancies, including his failure to report assets he purportedly used to personally loan his campaign committee $320,000 and a $700,000 line of credit.\"\n\nREAD MORE: Can Kamala Harris Win Florida? She's Getting a Lot of Support - Even From Republicans\n\nThen-Speaker Kevin McCarthy appointed Ogles, a member of the far-right Freedom Caucus, to the House Financial Services Committee. Ogles had falsely claimed to be an economist, despite having little financial experience and no actual degree in economics.\n\nNewsChannel 5's award-winning reporter Phil Williams on Tuesday noted that Ogles, \"doesn't report having checking or savings,\" and asked, \"So where did Andy Ogles get $320,000 for his campaign?\"\n\n\"If you believe Middle Tennessee's newest congressman,\" WTVF reported in 2023, \"he's not only a businessman, he's also an economist, a nationally recognized expert in tax policy and health care, a trained police officer, even an expert in international sex crimes. But an exclusive NewsChannel 5 investigation discovered that Andy Ogles' personal life story is filled with exaggerations, a story that's often too good to be true.\"\n\nWhile running for office in 2022 Ogles responded to the U.S. Supreme Court striking down the 49-year old landmark decision that found abortion is a constitutional right. Justice Clarence Thomas, in his concurring opinion, had called for a review of all laws that were based on the established right to privacy.\n\n\"The next thing we need to do is go after gay marriage,\" Ogles declared, WKRN reported. \"We need to revert that back to the states, so each and every state can decide her destiny.\"\n\nREAD MORE: First Harris-Walz Ads Go Viral as Democratic Donations Surge\n\nOgles's Democratic opponent posted video of his remarks.\n\nOnce elected, Rep. Ogles filed legislation to ban any federal Dept. of Education funds to be used for drag queen performances, and to ban any federal funds from being used to create any forms that extend gender identification beyond male and female. In his press release, Ogles stated he was introducing \"two bills that fight back against the radical agenda of the LBGT movement and protect children in schools.\"\n\nHe included in his press release a statement from a member of an anti-LGBTQ hate group.\n\nIn February, The Tennessean reported Ogles had comes under fire for telling \"a Palestinian activist he thinks 'we should kill them all' after she confronted him about the deaths of children in Gaza amid the ongoing Israel-Hamas war, though Ogles' office said he referred specifically to Hamas.\"\n\nTennessee Democratic state Rep. Gloria Johnson, a member of the \"Tennessee Three\" who is running to unseat Republican U.S. Senator Marsha Blackburn, noted, \"Interestingly, a lawyer with deep ties to Marsha Blackburn and Russian government assets is representing Ogles.\"\n\nThat claim was also made by The Tennessee Holler.\n\nRep. Johnson also responded to the news of Congressman Ogles's search warrant by comparing him to disgraced and expelled former House Republican George Santos.\n\n\"Uhoh, looks like Tennessee Santos is about to go through some things.\"\n\nWatch the video above or at this link.", "source": {"uri": "thenewcivilrightsmovement.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New Civil Rights Movement"},

Andy Ogles' phone amid campaign finance issues", "body": "The FBI on Friday took possession of U.S. Rep. Andy Ogles' cell phone as part of an investigation he believed concerned his campaign finance filings, the freshman congressman said in a social media post Tuesday afternoon.\n\n\"It has been widely reported for months that my campaign made mistakes in our initial financial filings,\" Ogles said in the post made to X, formerly known as Twitter. \"We have worked diligently with attorneys and reporting experts to correct the errors and ensure compliance going forward. It is my understanding that they are investigating the same well-known facts surrounding these filings.\"\n\nOgles' phone was taken one day after he survived a primary election challenge last week. The congressman faces ongoing scrutiny over his federal campaign finance filings, and personal finance disclosures.\n\nOgles is seeking re-election in Tennessee's 5th Congressional district this year, with former President Donald Trump's endorsement. Ogles defeated a well-funded primary challenge from Republican Courtney Johnston on Thursday evening, who challenged Ogles' integrity and first-term record. U.S. Department of Justice typically does not take overt investigative action against political candidates that could influence how people vote within 60 days of an election.\n\nElizabeth Clement-Webb, a spokesperson for the FBI's Memphis Field Office declined to confirm or deny the search, pursuant to U.S. Department of Justice policy.\n\nMark Wildasin, spokesperson for the U.S. District Attorney's Office for the Middle District of Tennessee, declined to confirm or deny the existence of a search warrant.\n\nOgles' congressional office did not respond to a request for comment. His chief of staff directed The Tennessean to Ogles' social media post.\n\nChannel 5 reported earlier Tuesday that the FBI executed a search warrant on Ogles but did not specify where the search occurred nor what was searched.\n\nFor more than two years, Ogles has faced scrutiny and multiple complaints over his federal campaign finance disclosures.\n\nShortly before the primary in 2022, an Federal Election Commission complaint was filed against him alleging a \"pattern of malfeasance\" in Ogles' financial dealings. Ogles' attorney responded to a request for comment with a threat of legal action.\n\nHe's also had to deal with chronic problems stemming from his campaign finance disclosures. He was required to pay $5,750 in civil penalties for campaign finance violations after the 2022 cycle, the Nashville Scene first reported.\n\nHe recently admitted that a self-loan of $320,000 that he had reported as cash to the FEC for two years was in fact a \"pledge\" for funding for which the need never arose.\n\n\"We set money aside. It was in a joint account, which you can't do -- we know that now -- so technically we have to go back and say the campaign didn't have full control,\" Ogles said. \"But that being said when my wife and I and decided that I was going to run for Congress, we set aside every penny we had to put into the race.\"\n\nOgles' personal finance disclosures do not reflect a savings or checking account under Ogles' control with the amount he said he made available to his campaign. But his disclosure does include a mortgage loan initiated in January 2022 in the corresponding amount range. Maury County property records do not reflect any property purchase in January 2022 by Ogles. But he did buy a house adjacent to his family home in September, just after winning the primary. He later sold that home to his Congressional district director at a $60,000 loss.\n\n\"That money was real, it existed, and it was ready to be used. Fortunately, we didn't have to use it,\" Ogles said during a recent radio interview. \"That was money that we had saved over time being frugal. It was a big commitment. We went all in. ... We really felt that this was a God thing.\"\n\nOgles has said publicly that he hired an outside campaign finance compliance consultant to go back \"with a fine-toothed comb\" and fix mistakes reported to the FEC.\n\nIn his social media post on Tuesday, Ogles said he would cooperate with the FBI and the FEC.\n\n\"I am confident all involved will conclude that the reporting discrepancies were based on honest mistakes, and nothing more,\" he wrote.\n\nOgles is also currently facing an ethics complaint filed by the Campaign Legal Center in January requesting an investigation into discrepancies in the congressman's financial disclosures, including the personal loan of $320,000.\n\nCampaign Legal Center Ethics Director Kedric Payne on Tuesday said the watchdog group expected a possible FBI investigation since Ogles had significant discrepancies in his financial reports, but the swift action is surprising.\n\nPayne, a former deputy chief counsel for the Office of Congressional Ethics, said such investigations usually take much longer.\n\n\"With a move this quickly, the evidence must be strong, especially to move in an election year,\" he said. \"It looks like what we complained about is the tip of the iceberg of what may be going on. It looks very serous.\"\n\nOgles has also admitted that he was \"mistaken\" about what degree he received from Middle Tennessee State University, after scrutiny that he embellished his credentials and work experience during the 2022 primary.\n\nStaff writer Kelly Puente contributed to this report.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

Andy Ogles survives Republican primary challenge from Nashville council member", "body": "Columbia Republican U.S. Rep. Andy Ogles soundly defeated Metro Nashville Council member Courtney Johnston on Thursday in a Republican primary.\n\nOgles's win, by a margin of 55% to 44% when The Associated Press called the race around 8:30 p.m. Thursday, sets him up to face Democrat Maryam Abolfazli in the November general election in a seat that leans heavily toward the Republican Party.\n\nAbolfazli is the founder of the nonprofit Rise and Shine Tennessee. She has become a frequent face at the state capitol, advocating for stricter gun laws and better public education funding.\n\nShe was also the plaintiff in the American Civil Liberties Union lawsuit against state House Speaker Cameron Sexton's rules to ban signs during hearings.\n\nOgles is the former mayor of Maury County and used to work as a lobbyist for Americans for Prosperity in Tennessee. He's a member of the U.S. House Freedom Caucus, which serves as the most ideological right-wing part of the Republican Party.\n\n(READ MORE: Rep. Patsy Hazlewood loses Tennessee House seat)\n\nPolitical action committees for Americans for Prosperity and the House Freedom Caucus spent almost $300,000 to independently back Ogles, who ran his most recent campaign on a past endorsement by President Donald Trump and unwavering support for gun rights.\n\nOgles also tried to brandish his conservative credentials in the final weeks of the campaign by filing articles of impeachment against Vice President Kamala Harris after she became the presumptive presidential nominee for the Democratic Party.\n\nDuring his time in Congress, Ogles was one of the 20 members who initially held out on supporting U.S. House Speaker Kevin McCarthy in his quest for the speakership at the start of 2023.\n\nOgles has also faced allegations that he embellished his resume and lied about how he would use funds raised through GoFundMe, according to reports from NewsChannel 5. He also admitted to wrongly reporting that he loaned his campaign $320,000 in 2022 during a pivotal fundraising time.\n\nPROXY BATTLE\n\nThe Ogles-Johnston race served as a proxy between the Nashville-based wing of the Republican Party and more suburban and rural parts of surrounding Columbia and Franklin.\n\nOgles first won the seat in 2022 after defeating former Republican state House Speaker Beth Harwell, and Brig. Gen. Kurt Winstead, both from Nashville. In that race, Ogles managed to win over about a third of primary voters, leaving open the hope among Republicans living in Tennessee's capital that he could be defeated in a one-on-one primary matchup.\n\nA political action committee called Conservatives With Character backing Johnston raised and spent nearly $640,000, blanketing the airwaves with commercials attacking Ogles in the final weeks of the campaign.\n\n(READ MORE: Harshbarger upsets veteran Sen. Lundberg in East Tennessee GOP primary)\n\nFormer Hendersonville Republican State Rep. Randy Stamps is the director of Conservatives With Character. The Best of Tennessee, another political action committee that claims to be bipartisan, gave $120,000 to Conservatives With Character.\n\nThe Best of Tennessee does not disclose all its donors, but is run by Knoxville-turned-Nashville lawyer Chloe Akers alongside longtime Nashville Republican political operatives Tom Ingram and Kim Kaegi.\n\nDemocrat Jim Cooper represented Tennessee's 5th District, which at that time encompassed all of Metropolitan Nashville, for about two decades. Cooper announced he would not run for reelection after state Republicans split Nashville across three districts, and Ogles won the newly drawn 5th District seat in 2022. The split means no U.S. congressman representing Nashville is currently from the city.\n\nThe district has a Republican partisan lean of +11 percentage points, roughly the same margin by which Ogles won the 2022 general election over Democrat state Sen. Heidi Campbell.\n\nRead more at TennesseeLookout.com.\n\nCourtney Johnston and husband Daniel are seen Thursday at a campaign event as she conceded the 5th District Republican primary.

(Photo: John Partipilo)\n\nNashville Republicans liked their chances if they could get U.S. Rep. Andy Ogles in a one-on-one Republican primary matchup, but that scenario fell flat during last week's Tennessee Republican U.S. House primary, when Ogles handily defeated Nashville Councilmember Courtney Johnston.\n\nFormer Tennessee House Speaker Beth Harwell and Brigadier General Kurt Winstead, both Nashville Republicans, received nearly 3,000 more votes than Johnston when they went up against Ogles in 2022. Despite a higher turnout, Johnston received fewer votes in every county compared to the combined total of Harwell and Winstead except in Davidson and Williamson.\n\nThe outcome came even after over $1 million was spent by Johnston and an independent group called Conservatives With Character on television advertisements that blanketed television airwaves over the last weeks of election.\n\nOgles, a former mayor of Maury County, beat Johnston in every part of the district except the Nashville suburbs that comprise just a part of Tennessee's 5th U.S. Congressional District.\n\nThe one-term congressman didn't need much support in Tennessee's capital city as long as he consolidated the suburban and rural Republican voters who make up a majority of primary voters in the district.\n\nThe 5th district is a heavily gerrymandered seat, created during the 2022 redistricting cycle when Tennessee Republicans in the General Assembly divided Nashville across three districts in hopes of flipping it from a Democrat seat.\n\nThe new drawings worked, allowing Republicans to win it along with eight of the state's nine congressional districts despite only winning about 60% of the vote in the last two presidential elections. Redistricting has also meant no member of congress representing Nashville is from the city.\n\nOgles defeated Harwell, Winstead, and six other Republican candidates in 2022 by winning 35% of the primary vote. He defeated Nashville Democratic state Sen. Heidi Campbell in the general election with 56% of the vote.\n\nA former lobbyist for Americans for Prosperity, Ogles is a very conservative lawmaker, serving in the U.S. House Freedom Caucus. His plurality victory and ideological views left open the possibility for some Nashville and Williamson County Republicans that he could be vulnerable in a less crowded primary.\n\nAmericans for Prosperity and other conservative groups like Club for Growth have been financial backers of Ogles, spending a couple million dollars in 2022 on advertisements to boost him and around $300,000 this year.\n\nDuring his time in Congress, he was one of the 20 members who initially held out on supporting U.S. House Speaker Kevin McCarthy in his quest for the speakership at the start of 2023.\n\nOgles has also faced allegations that he embellished his resume and lied about how he would use funds raised through GoFundMe, according to reports from NewsChannel 5. He also admitted to wrongly reporting that he loaned his campaign $320,000 in 2022 during a pivotal fundraising time.\n\nJohnston and Conservatives With Character tried to us these allegations against Ogles to paint him as too untrustworthy to hold the seat.\n\nBut Ogles managed to improve his Republican vote in district going from around 21,000 votes in 2022 to over 32,000 this year.\n\nHe will face Democrat Maryam Abolfazli in the November general election.\n\nAbolfazli is the founder of the nonprofit Rise and Shine Tennessee. She has become a frequent face at the state capitol, advocating for stricter gun laws and better public education funding.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"},

Andy Ogles, a Tennessee Republican, confirmed the FBI is investigating him for fraud. (Photo: John Partipilo)\n\nU.S. Rep. Andy Ogles confirmed Tuesday the FBI is conducting a fraud investigation into his campaign finances.\n\nThe Maury County Republican, who won the Republican primary over Metro Councilwoman Courtney Johnston for the 5th Congressional District seat last week, said in an online post federal agents confiscated his cell phone August 2 as part of the probe. He said he will \"fully cooperate\" with the investigation, which was first reported by NewsChannel5.\n\nOgles acknowledged media reports about \"mistakes\" his campaign made on its first financial filings with the Federal Election Commission and said in the post he has \"worked diligently\" with lawyers and experts to correct errors and comply with federal requirements.\n\n\"I am confident all involved will conclude that the reporting discrepancies were based on honest mistakes, and nothing more,\" he said.\n\nOgles admitted this summer he didn't lend his campaign $320,000 as he first reported in 2022. He also announced in early 2022 he had raised $453,000 in the first 30 days of his campaign, but a late report showed he brought in only $264,400 and claimed $584,000 in total receipts, a figure bolstered by the personal loan now said to be false.\n\nThe Federal Election Commission sent a second batch of warnings to Ogles in September 2023 notifying him it could audit his campaign finance account or take \"enforcement action\" for several violations, including excessive contributions from the House Freedom Caucus' political action committee and possibly illegal corporate donations.\n\nThe agency notified Ogles' treasurer, Thomas Datwyler, last summer that a detailed summary page of the congressman's amended April and July quarterly reports appeared to be incorrect and violate federal campaign finance regulations.\n\nDatwyler also is at the heart of a campaign finance complaint filed by Tennessee Sen. Ken Yager, a Kingston Republican who claims collusion between a political action committee and U.S. Rep. Diana Harshbarger in connection with her son's recent race against Sen. Jon Lundberg in Senate District 4. Harshbarger defeated Lundberg last Thursday in the primary. Datwyler is treasurer for both Rep. Harshbarger and the PAC.\n\nIn addition to questions about his campaign finances, Ogles came under fire early in his first two-year term for an inflated resume.

Ogles's attorney didn't deny that a warrant was issued, but declined to comment, as did the FBI and the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Middle District of Tennessee.\n\nOnly last week, Ogles won his primary race for the Tennessee 5th congressional district, meaning that he could be under FBI investigation during the general election in November. The Department of Justice generally doesn't make overt actions in investigations of political candidates 60 days before an election.\n\nIn May, Ogles filed amended campaign financial reports, admitting that when he first ran in 2022, he hadn't loaned his campaign $320,000 as he had previously reported. He also filed more amendments retracting claims made in his financial reports of thousands of dollars in campaign contributions and expenditures.\n\nAt the time, Ogles was compared to disgraced ex-Congressman George Santos, who is facing criminal charges for inflating campaign fundraising numbers after also reporting loaning his campaign a lot of his own money.\n\nNewsChannel5 reported last year that Ogles didn't have the resources or assets to make such a loan to his campaign, raising the question of where the congressman got the money from, and if he made some illicit or extravagant purchases like Santos. Like Santos, Ogles was found to have lied about his background, making up details about his education. He also raised $25,000 on GoFundMe to build a garden in memory of his stillborn child, but the garden was never built.\n\nIt appears that the law might soon be catching up to Ogles, who has a history of sponsoring futile, symbolic bills. He has proposed sending protesting students to Gaza, tried to lift the gag order in Trump's hush-money trial, and has tried to require the White House to inform Congress any time President Biden takes a drug \"that could alter his alertness, judgment or mood.\" It looks like he'll finally have to spend his time doing something more serious: fighting possible federal charges.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [{"uri": "hafiz_rashid@yahoo.com", "name": "Hafiz Rashid", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennessee", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tennessee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tennessee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Santos", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "George Santos"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Ogles", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Andy Ogles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_America_Great_Again", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Make America Great Again"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campaign_finance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Campaign finance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nashville,_Tennessee", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nashville, Tennessee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nashville, Tennessee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_warrant", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Search warrant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Carolina's_5th_congressional_district", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "South Carolina's 5th congressional district"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "General election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santos_FC", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Santos FC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gag_order", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gag order"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GoFundMe", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "GoFundMe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bribery", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bribery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/College_Financing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/College Financing", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Major_Companies/Company_Information", "label": "dmoz/Business/Major Companies/Company Information", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_new_republic_521/c343ee854869f28a1447e5762d3da91d", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9795930", "eventUri": "eng-9795930", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 195, "relevance": 1}

Rep. Andy Ogles, R-Tenn., who represents a portion of Nashville, was searched by federal authorities, local outlet WTVF reported Tuesday.\n\nOgles had just won his competitive Republican primary election on August 1. The Tennessee representative is currently embroiled in a controversy regarding his campaign's finances.\n\nPreviously he admitted to making 'mistakes' on his campaign finance disclosures. 'Pursuant to U.S. Department of Justice policy, the FBI can neither confirm nor deny,' the report of the search, an FBI spokesperson told DailyMail.com Tuesday.\n\nIn May, Ogles filed numerous amended campaign financial reports and admitted he had not personally loaned his campaign $320,000 as he previously reported. Other financial disclosure amendments prompted Ogles to retract claims he made to the Federal Election Commission.\n\n'I am a grassroots representative, and I pledged everything I own to run for the honor of representing Tennessee's Fifth Congressional District,' Ogles said in a May statement.\n\n'That $320,000 pledge comprised several documented assets, including bank and retirement accounts, which I was ready to personally risk for the chance to fight for Middle Tennessee.'\n\n'While we only needed to transfer $20,000, unfortunately, the full amount of my pledge was mistakenly included on my campaign's FEC reports,' his statement said. Ogles' attorney declined to comment on the FBI action to WTVF Tuesday. 'I'm not going to confirm or deny that there was a search warrant issued,' G. Kline Preston IV, the Republican's attorney, told the outlet.\n\nNeighbors who live in the remote area near Olges' residence told the TV station they had not seen any unusual activity near the member's home in recent days. Most law enforcement personnel in his home county were not notified of any FBI searches, sources told WTVF.\n\nThough one source did disclose to WTVF that the FBI did execute a search warrant within the county recently. The Republican's office and U.S. Attorney's Office for the Middle District of Tennessee did not immediately respond to DailyMail.com's request for comment.\n\nWant more stories like this from the Daily Mail?

Seizes Republican Lawmaker's Phone Amid Scrutiny Over Loan", "body": "The F.B.I. has seized the phone of Representative Andy Ogles, Republican of Tennessee, as it carries out an apparent investigation into his campaign finances.\n\nThe bureau served a search warrant at Mr. Ogles's home in central Tennessee on Friday and took his phone, according to his lawyer, G. Kline Preston IV.\n\n\"There was a search warrant for a phone,\" Mr. Preston said. \"That was it. It was a limited search, and we cooperated with the F.B.I.\".\n\nMr. Preston said it was his understanding that the search was related to allegations of financial improprieties. \"Hopefully this will be resolved quickly,\" he added.\n\nNewsChannel 5 in Nashville reported on the search warrant earlier on Tuesday. The Justice Department and federal prosecutors in Tennessee declined to comment.\n\nMr. Ogles has been under scrutiny after reporting a $320,000 loan to his campaign in April 2022. That prompted questions about whether Mr. Ogles, who also reported limited financial resources on his House financial disclosure forms, could have afforded to lend that amount. In May, Mr. Ogles, who called the reported loan a mistake, amended his campaign finance reports to remove it.\n\nThe Campaign Legal Center, a watchdog group, filed a complaint against Mr. Ogles in January, seeking an ethics investigation into whether the congressman violated financial disclosure requirements.\n\nThe complaint alleged that Mr. Ogles's financial disclosure statements did not include the assets that he purportedly used to personally loan $320,000 to his campaign committee. The complaint also said that he did not report a $700,000 line of credit that he apparently opened in September 2022, according to bank records.\n\n\"The over $1 million of financial disclosure discrepancies provide reasonable basis for O.C.E. to investigate whether Rep. Ogles complied with the Ethics in Government Act and House rules,\" the complaint stated, referring to the Office of Congressional Ethics.\n\nMr. Ogles is one of the most conservative lawmakers in the House and a member of the hard-right Freedom Caucus. He has routinely voted against government funding bills, opposed aid to help Ukraine fight off the Russian invasion, and recently introduced articles of impeachment against Vice President Kamala Harris that accused her of mishandling the southern border.\n\nThe seizure of his phone came one day after he turned back a primary challenge from Courtney Johnston, a Republican on the Metropolitan Council in Nashville.\n\nJustice Department policy prohibits federal prosecutors and agents from choosing the timing of \"any action, including investigative steps, criminal charges or statements, for the purpose of affecting any election.\"\n\nMr. Ogles will now face Maryam Abolfazli, a Democratic activist who ran unopposed in the primary and has frequently challenged the conservative state legislature.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_warrant", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Search warrant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennessee", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tennessee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tennessee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Ogles", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Andy Ogles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WTVF", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "WTVF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campaign_finance_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Campaign finance in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_F.B.I._(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The F.B.I.

Please try again later.\n\nFBI agents used a court order Friday to search and seize Rep. Andrew Ogles's cellphone as part of federal campaign finance probe, according to a lawyer for the congressman.\n\nG. Kline Preston IV, the Tennessee-based lawyer representing Ogles (R-Tenn.), said the search warrant was limited, asking only for the congressman's phone.\n\n\"We are cooperating at this point and we will see where the investigation goes,\" Preston said.\n\nNews Channel 5 in Nashville first reported on the execution of the search warrant. A spokesperson for Ogles's House office did not immediately respond to request for comment.\n\nOgles, a member of the far-right House Freedom Caucus, was first elected to Congress in 2022 and last year filed articles of impeachment against President Biden and Vice President Harris. He won a Republican primary this month in Tennessee's 5th District, which includes parts of Nashville.\n\nEarlier this year, a nonprofit congressional watchdog group filed an ethics complaint against Ogles, accusing him of misstatements on his financial disclosure statements. The complaint stated that Ogles did not include that he reportedly used a $320,000 loan to fund his 2022 campaign. He also allegedly failed to a report a $700,000 line of credit that he opened in 2022.\n\nThe complaint from the Campaign Legal Center alleged that, in all, Ogles's financial report contained more than $1 million in discrepancies.\n\nPreston said law enforcement officials did not provide him with information on the investigation beyond that it is related to campaign finances.\n\n\"It's like a game show,\" he said. \"They tell us some stuff and we try to figure out what it means.\"\n\nThe U.S. attorney's office for the Middle District of Tennessee, which is leading the investigation, declined to comment.\n\nOgles's tenure in Congress has been marred by controversy: Last year it was revealed by Nashville television station WTVF that he had made a number of misrepresentations about his background, including embellishing his r\u00e9sum\u00e9. Ogles called himself an \"economist,\" even though he took only one college economics course that he barely passed -- and he acknowledged misstating the degree he received from Middle Tennessee State University. Ogles said he received a degree in liberal studies and not international relations, as he had previously claimed.\n\nOgles's Republican primary opponent, Nashville Metro Council member Courtney Johnston, tried to attack the House Freedom Caucus member based on the controversies he faced over his campaign finances and background. Ogles, however, soundly beat Johnston and is expected to win reelection in November in the right-leaning district.", "source": {"uri": "washingtonpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington

I am confident all involved will conclude that the reporting discrepancies were based on honest mistakes, and nothing more.\n\nThe search warrant was executed by the FBI just one day after the Trump-endorsed Republican sailed to victory against Never Trump-backed Nashville Council Member Courtney Johnston in the Tennessee Republican primary.\n\nOgles carried every county in the 5th Congressional District except Davidson County, where Nashville is located, which was one of just three Tennessee counties won by Biden in 2020.\n\nIt also came less than two weeks after Ogles introduced new articles of impeachment against Vice President Kamala Harris, alleging the Democratic presidential candidate committed \"high crimes and misdemeanors\" through her neglect of the southern border.\n\nYahoo noted that he could be under investigation during the election. How convenient. They're making criminals of Republicans over paperwork mistakes, while Act Blue is probably taking donations illegally.\n\nCampaign finance laws, pushed by Democrats, are only used against Republicans, never against Democrats. This is why Donald Trump had 34 felonies - alleged paperwork errors in a fraudulent campaign finance case.\n\nOf course, we'll have to see what the FBI comes up with, but there is a lot of smoke around Act Blue, and not much around Rep. Ogles, a Trump supporter.", "source": {"uri": "independentsentinel.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "www.independentsentinel.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "m_dowling@independentsentinel.com", "name": "M Dowling", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_warrant", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Search warrant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Ogles", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Andy Ogles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campaign_finance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Campaign finance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nashville,_Tennessee", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nashville, Tennessee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nashville, Tennessee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maury_County,_Tennessee", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Maury County, Tennessee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Maury County, Tennessee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Election_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal Election Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennessee", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tennessee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tennessee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Davidson_County,_Tennessee", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Davidson County, Tennessee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Davidson County, Tennessee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article_of_impeachment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Article of impeachment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_crimes_and_misdemeanors", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "High crimes and misdemeanors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Yahoo!"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Felony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Politics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://www.independentsentinel.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Andy_Ogles_118th_Congress.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9795930", "eventUri": "eng-9795930", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 162, "relevance": 1}

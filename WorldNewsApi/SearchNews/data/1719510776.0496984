{"id": 223681822, "title": "Hard to follow' - National media make Erik ten Hag point after Manchester United FA Cup win", "text": "Manchester United stunned rivals Manchester City 2-1 at Wembley on Saturday to lift a 13th FA Cup. Goals from Alejandro Garnacho and Kobbie Mainoo secured a memorable victory for Erik ten Hag's side after a miserable season which saw them finish eighth in the Premier League. Despite masterminding a famous win, Ten Hag's future at Old Trafford remains uncertain after reports that he will be sacked regardless of whether United won the cup or not. MEN Sport understands that whilst co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe remains unconvinced by the Dutchman, the working assumption is that the club will be planning for next season under the former Ajax boss. Below is what some of the national media have said about Saturday's game and Ten Hag's future.

Did Erik ten Hag save the best for last? \"Was this, as was widely reported on the morning of the game, his last act as United manager? If so, it will be a hard one to follow, short term at least. An FA Cup final victory over bitter rivals, lifting the trophy for the first time since 2016. Ten Hag may depart in the manner of the master showman Phineas T Barnum, leaving his audience wanting more. \"More performances like this, more of United\u2019s young players \u2014 this is the first time two teenagers have scored in an FA Cup final \u2014 more of a well-marshalled, hard-working team that were deserved winners, even if Manchester City took them to the brink on several occasions in the second half.\" Jamie Jackson of the Guardian wrote: \"Erik ten Hag: the manager Manchester United are poised to sack despite the same record of two trophies in two seasons as Pep Guardiola had at the start of his Manchester City tenure. \"Football, bloody hell, or football, the quaintest of old games, because with a squad near to full fitness for the first time in an age, Ten Hag showed what he can do, which was a Roy of the Rovers-esque 2-1 victory that broke City hearts, claimed the FA Cup for United, and was the sweetest of ripostes to the 54-year-old\u2019s naysayers. \"At the close he walked to the United end of Wembley and bowed as he was regaled by the jubilant support with simple volleys of 'Ten Hag, Ten Hag, Ten Hag'. This 13th FA Cup triumph ensured Europa League football next season and Sir Jim Ratcliffe, who plans to remove the manager, would not be human if he did not doubt his own wisdom.\" Miguel Delaney of the Independent wrote: \"In an FA Cup final when Manchester City history was supposed to be made, and Erik ten Hag\u2019s future supposed to be set, he and Manchester United lifted the old trophy by seizing the day. \"The new winners were fully immersed in the moment. It may be a moment of history in itself, given how United silverware is such a surprise, but it was all the sweeter for that. The celebration of the crowd said enough. Ten Hag has the last word. The Dutch coach relished a second trophy in two years \u2013 especially if this was indeed to be his final match at the club. \"Belatedly, Ten Hag has at least made the best possible case to keep his job, and maybe change expectations. His team defied all expectations about this match, as well as Pep Guardiola\u2019s recent record. The Manchester City coach was beaten in a domestic cup final for the first time since 2011, to ensure he will not enjoy English football\u2019s first-ever \u201cdouble double\u201d, to amplify last year\u2019s treble.\" Oliver Brown of the Telegraph wrote: \"As a blissful delirium washed over the red half of Wembley, Erik ten Hag looked briefly like a man reborn. He had arrived here fearing he would walk the plank and ended this FA Cup final walking on water, hoisted aloft by Lisandro Martinez as if he were some cherished mascot. \"But if you looked closer at this wild scene, certain details suggested his joy would be short-lived. His royal box handshake from Sir Jim Ratcliffe, for example, was curiously perfunctory for a man who had just engineered this jolting upset against the champions. There was no embrace, only the thinnest of smiles. Manchester United\u2019s co-owner showed greater warmth to Pep Guardiola. \"In business, Ratcliffe has not become a multi-billionaire by shirking tough decisions. He once earned the moniker of \u201cDr No\u201d among union chiefs at Grangemouth oil refinery through his obstinate refusal to compromise. Little compares, though, to the difficulty of the call he must now make on Ten Hag. Few stock values have ever fluctuated as violently as the Dutchman\u2019s. The United manager entered this match a condemned man and he finished it an apparent tactical genius, with his players all imploring him to have his moment with his trophy.\"", "summary": "Latest Manchester United news as the national media react to United's shock FA Cup victory over Manchester City at Wembley on Saturday", "url": "https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/hard-follow-national-media-make-29241398", "image": "https://i2-prod.coventrytelegraph.net/incoming/article29241514.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_GettyImages-2154652415.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-26 12:42:40", "author": "Isaac Seelochan", "authors": ["Isaac Seelochan"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": 0.182}

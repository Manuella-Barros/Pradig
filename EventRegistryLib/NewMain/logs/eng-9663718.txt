He was also featured on Beyonc\u00e9's country record, \"Cowboy Carter,\" for a duet called \"Levii's Jeans.\"\n\nMore recently, Malone performed the album's second single, \"Pour Me a Drink,\" alongside Blake Shelton for CMA Fest's Spotify House.

They praised his performance, stating, \"But his emphasis on the 1990s/2000s hits of his childhood and youth (plus Tyler Childers, for good modern measure) would have captivated the crowd even without Dwight Yoakam, Brad Paisley and Sara Evans showing up to seal the deal.\"", "source": {"uri": "thesource.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Source"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post_Malone", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Post Malone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nashville,_Tennessee", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nashville, Tennessee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nashville, Tennessee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beyonc\u00e9", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Beyonc\u00e9"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Album", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Album"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapping", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rapping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morgan_Wallen", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Morgan Wallen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_genre", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Music genre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Swift"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billboard_Hot_100", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Billboard Hot 100"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billboard_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Billboard (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Country music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I'm_Gonna_Miss_Her_(The_Fishin'_Song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "I'm Gonna Miss Her (The Fishin' Song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Check_Yes_or_No", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Check Yes or No"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don't_Take_the_Girl", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Don't Take the Girl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stagecoach_Festival", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stagecoach Festival"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyler_Childers", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tyler Childers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwight_Yoakam", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dwight Yoakam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sara_Evans", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sara Evans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Strait", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "George Strait"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toby_Keith", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Toby Keith"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Paisley", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brad Paisley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CMA_Music_Festival", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CMA Music Festival"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_McGraw", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tim McGraw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blake_Shelton", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Blake Shelton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_chart", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Record chart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spotify", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spotify"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variety_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Variety (magazine)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Cross_Country", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Cross Country", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Government-Related_Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Government-Related Organizations", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Charts", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Charts", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography/Albums_and_Frames", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography/Albums and Frames", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Crafts/Scrapbooking", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Crafts/Scrapbooking", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://thesource.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Post-Malone003.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9663718", "eventUri": "eng-9663718", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-16", "textStart": 150, "textEnd": 159, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": 0.2, "wgt": 196, "relevance": 1}

The billboard revealed the album's name to be 'F-1 Trillion', while the rapper confirmed on Instagram that it's due to arrive on August 16. You can pre-save the album now.\n\nWhile the album's track listing has yet to be revealed, the album is believed to be country-leaning, seeing as Posty has been releasing a string of country singles and collaborations with country singers in the past handful of months.\n\nIn April, Post Malone performed a Hank Williams cover during a surprise gig in Nashville. Later that month, he played an entire set of classic country cover songs at Stagecoach Festival. The set included a guest showing from Brad Paisley, with whom he duetted on Paisley's 'I'm Gonna Miss Her', as well as Vince Gill's 'One More Last Chance' and Alan Jackson's 'Chattahoochee'.\n\nIn May, he released his first single since 2023's 'Austin', titled 'I Had Some Help' with Morgan Wallen. Later that month, he debuted a new song 'Never Love You Again' while performing at the Country Music Awards. Later this week (June 21), the singer will release a new single, 'Pour Me A Drink', with Blake Shelton.\n\nBack in 2022, Malone told Howard Stern that he had been considering the shift in style. \"To be honest, there's nothing stopping me from taking a camera or setting up in my studio in Utah and just recording a country album and putting it on fucking YouTube,\" he said. In 2021, he also performed two country covers of songs by Brad Paisley and Sturgill Simpson for the We're Texas relief fundraiser livestream.\n\nMalone's fifth album 'Austin' scored a four-star review from NME upon its release last year, with Erica Campbell writing: \"The shift from trap beats and hip-hop delivery to purer pop suits Malone well, proving that slowing down can be a creative advantage, especially when you're heading in the right direction.\"", "source": {"uri": "nme.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NME Music News, Reviews, Videos, Galleries, Tickets and Blogs |

Malone already released his single \"I Had Some Help\" featuring Wallen, which has been the No. 1 song on the Billboard Country charts for five weeks straight.\n\nHis single with Shelton, titled \" Pour Me A Drink,\" is scheduled to release on June 21.\n\nThe Grapevine artist rose to fame in the rap and pop music scene, but has dabbled in country music over the years, mainly as covers that were posted to social media.\n\nMany got a first taste of Post Malone's country chops when he performed during Matthew McConaughey's We're Texas Benefit during the COVID-19 pandemic. Sitting on a chair in a studio with a guitar in hand, camouflage cap on and cowboy boots on his feet, he swooned us all with his rendition of \"I'm Gonna Miss Her\" by Brad Paisley. They also performed this song together at Stagecoach in front of a sold-out crowd.\n\nIn anticipation of the country album, Malone has slowly released clips from his songs before dropping the full singles. Excerpts of \"I Had Some Help\" and \"Pour Me A Drink\" were posted weeks before the songs came out. Similarly, Malone has been teasing another song on his TikTok, which was released after Father's Day and seems to be centered around his daughter and her future wedding day.\n\n\"When I walk her down the aisle and do what daddy's have to do. And she might be wearing white, but her first dress ... it was pink. She might be your better half, but she's my everything. We'll both love her forever, but I loved her long before. And one day I know, I'll give her away, buddy that don't me she's yours,\" Malone says in the lyric.\n\nThe country album adds to a busy year for Post Malone. He's collaborated on the releases of Beyonce's Cowboy Carter album and Taylor Swift's Tortured Poets Department album, featuring on a song with both artists. Post Malone features on Beyonce's song \"LEVII'S JEANS,\" and Taylor Swift's song \"Fortnight.\"", "source": {"uri": "wfaa.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WFAA-TV Channel 8"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grapevine,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Grapevine, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Grapevine, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Malone", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Karl Malone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blake_Shelton", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Blake Shelton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Country music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapping", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rapping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morgan_Wallen", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Morgan Wallen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Songwriter", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Songwriter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pop music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billboard_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Billboard (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luke_Combs", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Luke Combs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I'm_Gonna_Miss_Her_(The_Fishin'_Song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "I'm Gonna Miss Her (The Fishin' Song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post_Malone", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Post Malone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Paisley", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brad Paisley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_McConaughey", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Matthew McConaughey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cowboy_boot", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cowboy boot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guitar", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Guitar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "TikTok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Father's_Day", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Father's Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Swift"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beyonc\u00e9", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Beyonc\u00e9"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coming_out", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coming out"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeans", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jeans"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Lyrics", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Lyrics", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Recordings", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Recordings", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Charts", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Charts", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Team_Spirit/Fight_Songs", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Team Spirit/Fight Songs", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Weddings/Music", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Weddings/Music", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://media.wfaa.com/assets/WFAA/images/a43282ed-cf97-437f-a331-ac02bf136a26/20240619T140607/a43282ed-cf97-437f-a331-ac02bf136a26_1140x641.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9663718", "eventUri": "eng-9663718", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-21", "textStart": 448, "textEnd": 455}], "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 174, "relevance": 1}

The surprises didn't stop coming as Blake welcomed his new duet partner and buddy Post Malone to the stage, where the two performed their collaboration, \"Somebody Pour Me A Drink.\"\n\nBlake posted some images of himself, Malone, and his wife, Gwen Stefani, on his Instagram. He captioned the post to his nearly seven million Instagram followers, \"Welcome to country music @postmalone!!!!!\"\n\nHis fans were thrilled with the post, one wrote, \"Iconic duo for sure.\" Another fan commented, \"Duo of the year !!!!!\" One more fan said, \"This is wonderful!\"\n\nSee that post here.\n\nMalone also posted about the moment and shared a video clip of it on his Instagram. He wrote, \"Pour me a drink @blakeshelton @cma.\"\n\nPosty's fans reacted in droves.

In the caption he wrote, \"Sup motherf****s...F-1 Trillion August 16th.\" Now, he's followed that up with a post revealing the album's artwork and a pre-order link. The cover, a surreal photo of a pickup truck balancing on the surface of a lake, was shot by Gonzalo Lebrija. We also learned creative direction for the album was done by Los Angeles-based studio Playlab, Inc.\n\nThe album title was first teased at Post's recent Bonnaroo set, where fans spotted tee shirts for sale that read \"'Pour Me a Drink' is a song featuring Blake Shelton on Post Malone's new album, F-1,000,000,000,000.\" Post had already announced that the song would drop on June 21st before the tees showed up, sharing a photo of him and Shelton playing their guitars. Fans also noticed that the artist began following an empty TikTok account with the username F-ONETRILLION.\n\nAll details are pointing towards F-1 Trillion being Post's first-ever country focused album, from the Shelton collaboration to the Nashville billboard to the pickup truck album art. Towards the end of 2023, Post revealed in a Twitch live stream that he's been working on two albums, one of which is a country record. The genre-defying artist has had recent success in the country world: his collaboration with Morgan Wallen, \"I Had Some Help\" is still holding the number one spot on the Billboard 200, and his feature on Beyonc\u00e9's country debut Cowboy Carter is a fan favorite.\n\nLast year, Post talked about his relationship with the genre an interview, explaining, \"You used to get trapped in one thing and you're like, 'Oh, well, this is all I listen to.' And that's what I think has made my career so interesting, just being able to f*cking take what I like and mix it in a way that is authentic to me.\"", "source": {"uri": "udiscovermusic.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "uDiscover Music"}, "authors": [{"uri": "hannah_zwick@udiscovermusic.com", "name": "Hannah Zwick", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post_Malone", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Post Malone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-order", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pre-order"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blake_Shelton", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Blake Shelton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nashville,_Tennessee", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nashville, Tennessee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nashville, Tennessee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-shirt", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "T-shirt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pickup_truck", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pickup truck"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billboard_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Billboard (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Album", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Album"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "TikTok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonnaroo_Music_Festival", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bonnaroo Music Festival"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guitar", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Guitar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebrija", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lebrija"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Lebrija"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitch_(service)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitch (service)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morgan_Wallen", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Morgan Wallen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Album_cover", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Album cover"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billboard_200", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Billboard 200"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_genre", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Music genre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beyonc\u00e9", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Beyonc\u00e9"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military/Veterans", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military/Veterans", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Government-Related_Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Government-Related Organizations", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography/Albums_and_Frames", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography/Albums and Frames", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Crafts/Scrapbooking", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Crafts/Scrapbooking", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Supplies", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Supplies", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://www.udiscovermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-2156505394.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9663718", "eventUri": "eng-9663718", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-16", "textStart": 148, "textEnd": 159, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-18", "textStart": 189, "textEnd": 198}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-21", "textStart": 944, "textEnd": 953}], "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 170, "relevance": 1}

Bell, Charlie Handsome, and Hoskins produced the track.\n\nWhat else can be expected on 'F-1 Trillion?'\n\nAs he noted at the Stagecoach Festival, Malone \"f***ing loves\" country music.\n\nTo wit, he has nearly two dozen country and Americana favorites he's capably performed in a live setting over the past five years.\n\nThus, the broadest spread possible of the genre's influences could be expected on the album.\n\nAt Stagecoach, Malone brought out special guests for his first-ever 45-minute country cover set on the Mane Stage. The event included appearances from Dwight Yoakam, Brad Paisley and Sara Evans.\n\nHis set opened with Tyler Childers' \"Whitehouse Road.\" Yoakam joined for \"Little Ways,\" Paisley for \"I'm Gonna Miss Her\" and Vince Gill's 1992 hit \"One More Last Chance.\" Evans arrived and performed \"Suds in the Bucket.\"\n\nMalone also played Tim McGraw's \"Don't Take The Girl,\" John Michael Montgomery's \"Be My Baby Tonight,\" \"Chattahoochee\" by Alan Jackson, Toby Keith's \"Who's Your Daddy\" and George Strait's 1995 chart-topper \"Check Yes or No.\"\n\nFive months prior, at 2023's CMA Awards, the \"Rockstar\" vocalist sang Joe Diffie's \"John Deere Green\" and \"Pickup Man\" with HARDY and Wallen.\n\nOther highlight moments in years past included performances of Sturgill Simpson's \"You Can Have the Crown\" and Paisley's \"I'm Gonna Miss Her\" during Matthew McConaughey's \"We're Texas\" fundraising event after Winter Storm Uri in 2021.", "source": {"uri": "tennessean.com", "dataType":

From the likes of Taylor Swift and Ariana Grande to Dua Lipa and Sabrina Carpenter, your favorite artists have likely at some point adjusted their sound. If not for the sake of capturing a new set of listeners, oftentimes, it's credited as a growth in artistic sensibilities. Though, in recent years, none have gone through a switch-up as drastic as Post Malone has.\n\nWe've already seen country to pop because of Swift. Heck, we've even seen a DJ become a full-blown singer thanks to The Chainsmokers. Rap to country? Now that's new, and something Post Malone is fully committing to with his upcoming album, \"F-1 Trillion.\"\n\nREAD: All the artists we're looking forward to at F\u00eate de la Musique 2024\n\nThe rapper-turned-country singer revealed the new album on Instagram. The post featured a photo of the billboard announcement in Nashville with a caption that read: \"Sup motherfuckas...F-1 Trillion August 16th.\"\n\nThe specific musical direction of his sixth studio album hasn't actually been officially revealed. Though, would it really be a surprise if it were country?\n\nAnd it's not just because of the trajectory of his discography -- which has steadily veered from rap and into the realm of guitar pop.

A free, exclusive Bud Light-sponsored \"A Night in Nashville\" concert event that (at a soon-to-be-named venue), via a press statement, will \"bring fans 21+ closer to one of most highly anticipated album releases of the year.\"\n\nFans are encouraged to direct message Bud Light's Instagram or Facebook \"A Night In Nashville\" for information on how to enter for a chance to win tickets to the show through Bud Light's Easy Wishes sweepstakes platform.\n\nMalone's continuing country moment\n\nMalone offers that he \"can't wait\" to continue what has evolved into a six-month process of \"(sharing) what I've been working on with everybody\" that has included recently appearing with Lainey Wilson and Ashley Gorley at the Bluebird Cafe, Billy Strings at Bonnaroo and with Blake Shelton at CMA Fest events at Nissan Stadium and Ole Red's Spotify House activation.\n\nAs well, at events including November 2023's Country Music Association Awards, May's Academy of Country Music Awards and 2024's Stagecoach Festival, he's also been paired with Sara Evans, Reba McEntire, Brad Paisley, HARDY, Shelton, Wallen, and Dwight Yoakam as on-stage and in-studio collaborators while singing songs from a dozen country favorites -- a diverse list spanning Tyler Childers and Sturgill Simpson to Joe Diffie and Alan Jackson.\n\nHis Nashville moments in 2024 have also included making his Ryman Auditorium debut in April 2024, by joining acts including Sam Hunt, Jon Pardi, Megan Moroney, Ben Rector, Ian Munsick, Nate Smith, Mat Kearney, Edwin McCain, Grace Bowers, and Lauren Watkins onstage for multimedia personality Bobby Bones' 7th Annual Million Dollar Show, which raised $215,000 for St. Jude Children's Research Hospital.\n\nAt present, Malone's Morgan Wallen collaboration \"I Had Some Help\" has topped Billboard's all-genre Hot 100 chart plus, outside of Garth Brooks' \"More Than A Memory\" in 2007, it is the fastest-rising single on country's radio charts in 20 years.\n\nOnly five songs, including \"I Had Some Help\" and \"More Than A Memory,\" have reached the top 10 on country's charts in under a month in a quarter century: Alan Jackson's \"Where Were You (When the World Stopped Turning),\" Darryl Worley's \"Have You Forgotten?,\" Tim McGraw's \"Live Like You Were Dying\" are also among that quintet.\n\nPost Malone's country album\n\nAlongside singing Joe Diffie tunes with HARDY and Morgan Wallen at 2023's Country Music Association Awards, the multi-platinum \"Rockstar\" vocalist also sang a steel guitar-aided acoustic guitar rendition of \"America The Beautiful\" at Super Bowl LVIII.\n\nThis followed him spending considerable time in Nashville throughout the close of 2023 alongside artists including Paisley, Luke Combs, ERNEST, Jelly Roll, Wallen and more. Those trips seem to have yielded \"I Had Some Help,\" plus the Blake Shelton duet \"Pour Me A Drink.\"\n\nOther highlight moments in years past that could offer clues to his forthcoming album's stylings include performances of Sturgill Simpson's \"You Can Have the Crown\" and Brad Paisley's \"I'm Gonna Miss Her\" during Matthew McConaughey's \"We're Texas\" fundraising event after Winter Storm Uri in 2021.\n\nOn Tuesday, Malone announced the name of his upcoming, \"F-1 Trillion\" album, expected to arrive Aug. 16.\n\n\"Post Malone is the hottest artist in the world and a loyal Bud Light partner and true fan of the brand. Bud Light has been so lucky to have a front row seat to his remarkable career over the years and we couldn't be more excited to embark on this new era with him,\" said Todd Allen, SVP of Marketing for Bud Light.\n\nFor over the past half-decade, Malone has been a pitchman for the Bud Light brand, including memorable moments like having Bud Light-branded sweatshirts and sweatpants sold at a New York City pop-up and online (while engaging in a Garth Brooks-style \"Dive Bar\" mini-concert tour), plus having his face emblazoned on Bud Light beer cans.\n\nFor more information on all Bud Light-related

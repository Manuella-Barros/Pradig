Hochstein told reporters in Beirut on Tuesday that it was a \"very serious situation\" and that a diplomatic solution to prevent a larger war was urgent.\n\nNasrallah said a wider war with Lebanon would have regional implications and that Hezbollah would attack any other country in the region that assisted Israel in the war effort, citing Cyprus, which has hosted Israeli forces for training exercises. He suggested Cyprus might allow Israel to use its bases in event of a wider war.\n\nIn response, Cypriot President Nikos Christodoulides said his island nation \"is in no way involved\" in any military operations in the region. Cyprus is \"part of the solution, not part of the problem\" he said, pointing out the Cyprus-Gaza maritime corridor used to deliver aid to the Palestinian territory.\n\nIsrael views Hezbollah as its most direct threat, and the two fought a 34-day war in 2006 that ended in a stalemate. Hezbollah's military capabilities have grown significantly since then, and the United States and Israel estimate the group, along with other Lebanese militant factions, has about 150,000 missiles and rockets.

Bilal Hussein/Associated Press\n\nBEIRUT -- Lebanon's Hezbollah has new weapons and intelligence capabilities that could help it target more critical positions deeper inside Israel in case of an all-out war, the militant group's leader warned on Wednesday.\n\nHassan Nasrallah's comments came as the monthslong cross-border conflict simmering between Hezbollah and Israel appears to be reaching a boiling point and a day after a top U.S. envoy met Lebanese officials in his latest attempt to ease tensions.\n\n\"We now have new weapons. But I won't say what they are,\" he said in a televised address commemorating a top Hezbollah commander killed in an Israeli airstrike in southern Lebanon last week. \"When the decision is made, they will be seen on the front lines.\"\n\nHezbollah has used locally made explosive drones for the first time since the start of the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza last October, as well as surface-to-air missiles to chase off Israeli jets.\n\nNasrallah said in 2021 that Hezbollah has 100,000 fighters but now he claimed the number is much higher, without elaborating. He also said he has rejected offers from allied countries and militias in the region that could add tens of thousands to his ranks.\n\nA nearly 10-minute-long video allegedly filmed by a Hezbollah surveillance drone and released Tuesday shows parts of Haifa - a city far from the Israel-Lebanon border. Nasrallah in his speech Wednesday said Hezbollah has much more footage - an apparent threat it could reach sites deep in Israel.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIsrael's military chief, Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi, visited Israeli air-defense soldiers near the border with Lebanon on Wednesday, saying Israel was aware of Hezbollah's capabilities demonstrated in the video and has solutions for these threats.\n\n\"We of course have infinitely greater capabilities,: he said and added, \"I think the enemy is only familiar with a few of them and (we) will confront them at the right time.\"\n\nHezbollah, an ally of the Palestinian militant group Hamas, has been exchanging strikes with Israel almost daily since the war in Gaza erupted on Oct. 7, with the aim to pull Israeli forces away from the embattled Gaza Strip.\n\nHezbollah's attacks escalated after Israel expanded its offensive last month into the southern Gaza city of Rafah and spiked further last week after an Israeli strike killed high-ranking Hezbollah commander Taleb Sami Abdullah, the most senior militant killed so far during the Israel-Hamas war.\n\nAlso Tuesday, the Israeli army said it has \"approved and validated\" plans for an offensive in Lebanon, although the decision to actually launch such an operation would have to come from the country's political leadership.\n\nThe warnings by both sides followed a visit by President Biden's senior adviser Amos Hochstein, who this week met with officials in Lebanon and Israel in his latest attempt to deescalate tensions. Hochstein told reporters in Berlin on Tuesday that it was a \"very serious situation\" and that a diplomatic solution to prevent a larger war was \"urgent.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNasrallah said a wider war with Lebanon would have regional implications and that Hezbollah would attack any other country in the region that assisted Israel in the war effort, citing Cyprus, which has hosted Israeli forces for training exercises. He suggested Cyprus might allow Israel to use its bases in event of a wider war.\n\nIn response, Cypriot President Nikos Christodoulides said his island nation \"is in no way involved\" in any military operations in the region. Cyprus is \"part of the solution, not part of the problem\" he said, pointing out the Cyprus-Gaza maritime corridor used to deliver aid to the Palestinian territory.\n\nOnly a cease-fire in Gaza would halt the Lebanon-Israel border fighting or the attacks on Western and Israel-linked targets from Yemen's Houthi rebels and Iraqi militias allied with Hezbollah.\n\nIsrael views Hezbollah as its most direct threat, and the two fought a 34-day war in 2006 that ended in a stalemate. Hebollah's military capabilities have significantly grown since then, and the United States and Israel estimate the group, along with other Lebanese militant factions, has about 150,000 missiles and rockets. Hezbollah also has been working on precision-guided missiles.\n\nHezbollah said at least four of its fighters were killed in Israeli strikes on Wednesday as Hochstein returned to Israel for a new round of meetings there.\n\nLebanese state media reported the strikes along the border and near the coastal city of Tyre, about 20 miles away. The Israeli military said two Hezbollah launches damaged several vehicles in northern Israel.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKamel Mohanna, the head of the Amel Association, an NGO providing health services in different areas of Lebanon, said the association health center in the town of Khiam was hit and damaged by the Israeli shelling.\n\nIsraeli strikes have killed more than 400 people in Lebanon, most of them Hezbollah and other militants, but also over 80 civilians and non-combatants. In northern Israel, 16 soldiers and 11 civilians have been killed by strikes launched from Lebanon.\n\nAssociated Press writers Melanie Lidman and Josef Federman in Jerusalem, and Menelaos Hadjicostis

But I won't say what they are,\" he said in a televised address commemorating a top Hezbollah commander killed in an Israeli airstrike in southern Lebanon last week. \"When the decision is made, they will be seen on the front lines.\"\n\nHezbollah has used locally made explosive drones for the first time since the start of the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza last October, as well as surface-to-air missiles to chase off Israeli jets.\n\nNasrallah said in 2021 that Hezbollah has 100,000 fighters but now he claimed the number is much higher, without elaborating. He also said he has rejected offers from allied countries and militias in the region that could add tens of thousands to his ranks.\n\nA nearly 10-minute-long video allegedly filmed by a Hezbollah surveillance drone shows parts of Haifa - a city far from the Israel-Lebanon border. Nasrallah said Hezbollah has much more footage - an apparent threat it could reach sites deep in Israel.\n\nIsrael's military chief, Lt Gen Herzi Halevi, visited Israeli air-defence soldiers near the border with Lebanon this week saying Israel was aware of Hezbollah's capabilities demonstrated in the video and has solutions for these threats.\n\n\"We of course have infinitely greater capabilities,\" he said and added: \"I think the enemy is only familiar with a few of them and [we] will confront them at the right time.\"\n\nHezbollah, an ally of the Palestinian militant group Hamas, has been exchanging strikes with Israel almost daily since the war in Gaza erupted on October 7, with the aim to pull Israeli forces away from the embattled Gaza Strip.\n\nHezbollah's attacks escalated after Israel expanded its offensive last month into the southern Gaza city of Rafah and spiked further last week after an Israeli strike killed high-ranking Hezbollah commander Taleb Sami Abdullah, the most senior militant killed so far during the Israel-Hamas war.\n\nThe Israeli army said it has \"approved and validated\" plans for an offensive in Lebanon, although the decision to actually launch such an operation would have to come from the country's political leadership.\n\nThe warnings by both sides followed a visit by President Joe Biden's senior adviser Amos Hochstein, who this week met with officials in Lebanon and Israel in his latest attempt to de-escalate tensions. While in Berlin, Hochstein told reporters that it was a \"very serious situation\" and that a diplomatic solution to prevent a larger war was \"urgent\".\n\nNasrallah said a wider war with Lebanon would have regional implications and that Hezbollah would attack any other country in the region that assisted Israel in the war effort, citing Cyprus, which has hosted Israeli forces for training exercises. He suggested Cyprus might allow Israel to use its bases in event of a wider war.\n\nIn response, Cypriot President Nikos Christodoulides said his island nation \"is in no way involved\" in any military operations in the region. Cyprus is \"part of the solution, not part of the problem\" he said, pointing out the Cyprus-Gaza maritime corridor used to deliver aid to the Palestinian territory.\n\nOnly a ceasefire in Gaza would halt the Lebanon-Israel border fighting or the attacks on Western and Israel-linked targets from Yemen's Houthi rebels and Iraqi militias allied with Hezbollah.\n\nIsrael views Hezbollah as its most direct threat, and the two fought a 34-day war in 2006 that ended in a stalemate. Hezbollah's military capabilities have significantly grown since then, and the United States and Israel estimate the group, along with other Lebanese militant factions, has about 150,000 missiles and rockets. Hezbollah also has been working on precision-guided missiles.\n\nHezbollah said at least four of its fighters were killed in Israeli strikes this week as Hochstein returned to Israel for a new round of meetings there.\n\nLebanese state media reported the strikes along the border and near the coastal city of Tyre, about 30km away. The Israeli military said two Hezbollah launches damaged several vehicles in northern Israel.\n\nKamel Mohanna, the head of the Amel Association, an NGO providing health services in different areas of Lebanon, said the association health centre in the town of Khiam was hit and damaged by the Israeli shelling.\n\nIsraeli strikes have killed more than 400 people in Lebanon, most of them Hezbollah and other militants, but also over 80 civilians and non-combatants.

But I won't say what they are,\" he said in a televised address commemorating a top Hezbollah commander killed in an Israeli airstrike in southern Lebanon last week. \"When the decision is made, they will be seen on the front lines.\"\n\nHezbollah has used locally made explosive drones for the first time since the start of the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza in October, as well as surface-to-air missiles to chase off Israeli jets.\n\nNasrallah said in 2021 that Hezbollah has 100,000 fighters but now he claimed the number is much higher, without elaborating. He also said he has rejected offers from allied countries and armed groups in the region that could add tens of thousands to his ranks.\n\nA nearly 10-minute-long video allegedly filmed by a Hezbollah surveillance drone and released Tuesday shows parts of Haifa - a city far from the Israel-Lebanon border. In his speech Wednesday, Nasrallah said Hezbollah has much more footage - an apparent threat it could reach sites deep in Israel.\n\nIsrael's military chief, Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi, visited Israeli air-defense soldiers near the border with Lebanon on Wednesday, saying Israel was aware of Hezbollah's capabilities demonstrated in the video and has solutions for these threats.\n\n\"We of course have infinitely greater capabilities,\" he said. \"I think the enemy is only familiar with a few of them and (we) will confront them at the right time.\"\n\nHezbollah, an ally of the Palestinian resistance group Hamas, has been exchanging strikes with Israel almost daily since Israel launched its brutal war on Gaza on Oct. 7, with the aim of pulling Israeli forces away from the embattled Gaza Strip.\n\nHezbollah's attacks escalated after Israel expanded its offensive into the southern Gaza city of Rafah in May and spiked further in June after an Israeli strike killed high-ranking Hezbollah commander Taleb Sami Abdullah, the most senior member killed so far during the Gaza conflict.\n\nEarlier Tuesday, the Israeli army said it has \"approved and validated\" plans for an offensive in Lebanon, although the decision to actually launch such an operation would have to come from the country's political leadership.\n\nThe warnings by both sides followed a visit by U.S. President Joe Biden's senior adviser Amos Hochstein, who met with officials in Lebanon and Israel in his latest attempt to deescalate tensions.\n\nHochstein told reporters in Beirut on Tuesday that it was a \"very serious situation\" and that a diplomatic solution to prevent a larger war was urgent.\n\nNasrallah said a wider war with Lebanon would have regional implications and that Hezbollah would attack any other country in the region that assisted Israel in the war effort, citing the Greek Cypriot administration, which has hosted Israeli forces for training exercises.\n\nHe suggested that the administration might allow Israel to use its bases in the event of a wider war.\n\nIn response, Greek Cypriot administration President Nikos Christodoulides said his island nation \"is in no way involved\" in any military operations in the region.\n\nWe are \"part of the solution, not part of the problem,\" he said, pointing out the Gaza maritime corridor used to deliver aid to the Palestinian territory.\n\nOnly a cease-fire in Gaza would halt the Lebanon-Israel border fighting or the attacks on Western and Israel-linked targets from Yemen's Houthi rebels and Iraqi armed groups allied with Hezbollah.\n\nIsrael views Hezbollah as its most direct threat, and the two fought a 34-day war in 2006 that ended in a stalemate. Hezbollah's military capabilities have grown significantly since then, and the United States and Israel estimate the group, along with other Lebanese factions, has about 150,000 missiles and rockets. Hezbollah also has been working on precision-guided missiles.\n\nHezbollah said at least four of its fighters were killed Wednesday in Israeli strikes as Hochstein returned to Israel for a new round of meetings there.\n\nLebanese state media reported the strikes along the border and near the coastal city of Tyre, about 30 kilometers (20 miles) away. The Israeli military said two Hezbollah launches damaged several vehicles in northern Israel.\n\nKamel Mohanna, the head of the Amel Association, a nongovernmental organization providing health services in different areas of Lebanon, said the association's health center in the town of Khiam was hit and damaged by the Israeli shelling.\n\nIsraeli strikes have killed more than 400 people in Lebanon, most of them Hezbollah members, but also over 80 civilians and non-combatants. In northern Israel, 16 soldiers and 11 civilians have been killed by strikes launched from Lebanon.", "source": {"uri": "dailysabah.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Sabah"}, "authors":

Nasrallah on June 19 warned \"no place\" in Israel would be spared in case of full-blown war against the Lebanese group, and threatened Cyprus if it opened its airports to Israel. Agence France-Presse\n\nBEIRUT -- Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah on Wednesday warned \"no place\" in Israel would be spared in case of full-blown war against the Lebanese group, and threatened Cyprus if it opened its airports to Israel.\n\n\"The enemy knows well that we have prepared ourselves for the worst... and that no place... will be spared our rockets,\" Nasrallah said in a televised address.\n\nIsrael must expect \"us on land, by sea and by air\", he said.\n\n\"The enemy really fears that the resistance will penetrate Galilee\" in northern Israel, he said, adding that this was possible \"in the context of a war that could be imposed on Lebanon\".\n\nREAD: Israel minister warns Hezbollah of destruction in 'total war'\n\nIsrael and Hezbollah, a powerful Lebanese movement allied with Hamas, have traded near-daily cross-border fire since the Palestinian militant group's October 7 attack on Israel which triggered war in the Gaza Strip.\n\nThe exchanges between the foes, which last went to war in 2006, have escalated in recent weeks, and the Israeli military said Tuesday that \"operational plans for an offensive in Lebanon were approved and validated\".\n\nEarlier, Foreign Minister Israel Katz had warned of Hezbollah's destruction in a \"total war\".\n\nNasrallah said his Iran-backed group had been informed that Israel could use airports and bases in Cyprus if Hezbollah struck Israeli airports.\n\nREAD: Hezbollah rains rockets on Israel after strike kills commander\n\nCyprus, a European Union member, has good relations with Israel and Lebanon, and lies close to the coast of both countries.\n\n\"Opening Cypriot airports and bases to the Israeli enemy to target Lebanon would mean that the Cypriot government is part of the war, and the resistance will deal with it as part of the war,\" Nasrallah threatened.\n\nBritain has also retained sovereign control over two base areas in its former colony Cyprus under the terms of the treaties that granted the island independence in 1960.\n\n'New weapons'\n\nNasrallah's statements came a day after US envoy Amos Hochstein -- who in 2022 brokered a maritime border deal between Israel and Lebanon -- called for \"urgent\" de-escalation during a visit to Lebanon.\n\nHe also met with senior officials in Israel on his regional tour.\n\n\"Everything the enemy says and that the mediators convey, including with threats of war on Lebanon... this doesn't scare us,\" Nasrallah said.\n\nOn Tuesday, Hezbollah released a more than nine-minute video showing aerial footage purportedly taken by the movement over northern Israel, including what it said were sensitive military, defence and energy facilities and infrastructure in the city and port of Haifa.\n\nNasrallah said the footage was taken by a drone that \"flew for long hours\" over the Haifa port.\n\nHe also warned that his group had only used \"a part of\" its weapons since October.\n\n\"We have obtained new weapons,\" Nasrallah said, without elaborating.\n\n\"We have developed some of our weapons... and we are keeping others for the days that will come,\" he said.\n\n\"Years ago we talked about 100,000 fighters... today, we have greatly exceeded\" that number, Nasrallah added.\n\n\"The resistance has more (manpower) than it needs... even in the worst circumstances,\" he said.\n\nHezbollah on Wednesday claimed several attacks on Israeli troops and positions in northern Israel, and announced the death of four of its fighters.\n\nThe cross-border violence has killed at least 478 people in Lebanon, most of them fighters but also including 93 civilians, according to an AFP tally.\n\nIsraeli authorities say at least 15 soldiers and 11 civilians have been killed in the country's north.", "source": {"uri":

REUTERS/Mohamed Azakir\n\nThe head of Lebanon's Hezbollah said on Wednesday that nowhere in Israel would be safe if a full-fledged war breaks out between the two foes, and also threatened EU member Cyprus for the first time and other parts of the Mediterranean.\n\nHezbollah has been trading fire with Israel for more than eight months in parallel with the Gaza war. On Tuesday, the Iran-backed group published what it said was drone footage of sensitive military sites deep in Israeli territory.\n\nIn a televised address on Wednesday, Hezbollah chief Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah said \"there will be no place safe from our missiles and our drones\" in Israel in the event of a broader war.\n\nThe group also had \"a bank of targets\" that it could target in precision strikes, he said.\n\nIsrael \"knows that what also awaits it in the Mediterranean is very big ... In the face of a battle of this magnitude, it knows that it must now wait for us on land, in the air, and at sea,\" Nasrallah added.\n\nIsraeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz had warned on Tuesday that a decision on an all-out war with Hezbollah was coming soon and Israel's military said \"operational plans for an offensive in Lebanon were approved and validated\".\n\nNasrallah also threatened Cyprus - the EU member state in closest proximity to Lebanon, with which it has cordial relations - accusing it of allowing Israel to use its airports and bases for military exercises.\n\n\"The Cypriot government must be warned that opening Cypriot airports and bases for the Israeli enemy to target Lebanon means that the Cypriot government has become part of the war and the resistance (Hezbollah) will deal with it as part of the war,\" Nasrallah said.\n\nCYPRUS DENIES TAKING SIDES\n\nCypriot President Nikos Christodoulides denied any suggestion Cyprus was taking sides in any conflict.\n\n\"It (Cyprus) is not part of the problem, it is part of the solution. That role is evident, for example, through the humanitarian (aid) corridor which has been acknowledged not only by the Arab world, but from the international community,\" he said, referring to shipments of aid from Cyprus to Gaza.\n\nCyprus is not known to offer any land or base facilities to the Israeli military, but has in the past allowed Israel to use its vast airspace - its flight information region - to occasionally conduct air drills, but never during conflict.\n\nSovereign British military bases on Cyprus have been used by Britain for operations in Syria in the past and more recently, Yemen. The Cyprus government has no say in the matter. There are two British bases in Cyprus, which was a colony until 1960.\n\nNasrallah said his group would fight with \"no rules\" and \"no ceilings\" in the event of a broader war. He was speaking at a memorial event for a commander killed in an Israeli strike last week - the most senior Hezbollah figure to be killed so far in the current conflict with Israel.\n\nHezbollah unleashed its largest volleys of drones and rockets at Israel in retaliation. UN officials expressed concern at the escalation, and US envoy Amos Hochstein travelled to Israel and Lebanon to urge both sides not to move into a full-scale conflict.\n\nHezbollah first showed it could hit a vessel at sea by striking an Israeli warship in the Mediterranean during their 2006 war.\n\nReports by media and analysts have for years indicated that Hezbollah acquired Russian-made anti-ship Yakhont missiles in Syria, after its forces deployed there more than a decade ago to help President Bashar al-Assad fight the country's civil war.", "source": {"uri": "bdnews24.com",

But I won't say what they are,\" he said in a televised address commemorating a top Hezbollah commander killed in an Israeli airstrike in southern Lebanon last week. \"When the decision is made, they will be seen on the front lines.\"\n\nHezbollah has used locally made explosive drones for the first time since the start of the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza in October, as well as surface-to-air missiles to chase off Israeli jets.\n\nNasrallah said in 2021 that Hezbollah has 100,000 fighters but now he claimed the number is much higher, without elaborating. He also said he has rejected offers from allied countries and militias in the region that could add tens of thousands to his ranks.\n\nA nearly 10-minute-long video allegedly filmed by a Hezbollah surveillance drone and released Tuesday shows parts of Haifa -- a city far from the Israel-Lebanon border. In his speech Wednesday, Nasrallah said Hezbollah has much more footage -- an apparent threat it could reach sites deep in Israel.\n\nIsrael's military chief, Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi, visited Israeli air-defense soldiers near the border with Lebanon on Wednesday, saying Israel was aware of Hezbollah's capabilities demonstrated in the video and has solutions for these threats.\n\n\"We of course have infinitely greater capabilities,\" he said. \"I think the enemy is only familiar with a few of them and (we) will confront them at the right time.\"\n\nHezbollah, an ally of the Palestinian militant group Hamas, has been exchanging strikes with Israel almost daily since the war in Gaza erupted on Oct. 7, with the aim to pull Israeli forces away from the embattled Gaza Strip.\n\nHezbollah's attacks escalated after Israel expanded its offensive into the southern Gaza city of Rafah in May, and spiked further in June after an Israeli strike killed high-ranking Hezbollah commander Taleb Sami Abdullah, the most senior militant killed so far during the Israel-Hamas war.\n\nAlso Tuesday, the Israeli army said it has \"approved and validated\" plans for an offensive in Lebanon, although the decision to actually launch such an operation would have to come from the country's political leadership.\n\nThe warnings by both sides followed a visit by United States President Joe Biden's senior adviser Amos Hochstein, who met with officials in Lebanon and Israel in his latest attempt to deescalate tensions. Hochstein told reporters in Berlin on Tuesday that it was a \"very serious situation\" and that a diplomatic solution to prevent a larger war was urgent.\n\nNasrallah said a wider war with Lebanon would have regional implications and that Hezbollah would attack any other country in the region that assisted Israel in the war effort, citing Cyprus, which has hosted Israeli forces for training exercises. He suggested Cyprus might allow Israel to use its bases in event of a wider war.\n\nIn response, Cypriot President Nikos Christodoulides said his island nation \"is in no way involved\" in any military operations in the region. Cyprus is \"part of the solution, not part of the problem\" he said, pointing out the Cyprus-Gaza maritime corridor used to deliver aid to the Palestinian territory.\n\nOnly a cease-fire in Gaza would halt the Lebanon-Israel border fighting or the attacks on Western and Israel-linked targets from Yemen's Houthi rebels and Iraqi militias allied with Hezbollah.\n\nIsrael views Hezbollah as its most direct threat, and the two fought a 34-day war in 2006 that ended in a stalemate. Hezbollah's military capabilities have grown significantly since then, and the United States and Israel estimate the group, along with other Lebanese militant factions, has about 150,000 missiles and rockets. Hezbollah also has been working on precision-guided missiles.\n\nHezbollah said at least four of its fighters were killed Wednesday in Israeli strikes as Hochstein returned to Israel for a new round of meetings there.\n\nLebanese state media reported the strikes along the border and near the coastal city of Tyre, about 30 kilometers (20 miles) away. The Israeli military said two Hezbollah launches damaged several vehicles in northern Israel.\n\nKamel Mohanna, the head of the Amel Association, a nongovernmental organization providing health services in different areas of Lebanon, said the association health center in the town of Khiam was hit and damaged by the Israeli shelling.\n\nIsraeli strikes have killed more than 400 people in Lebanon, most of them Hezbollah and other militants, but also over 80 civilians and non-combatants. In northern Israel, 16 soldiers and 11 civilians have been killed by strikes launched from Lebanon.", "source": {"uri": "bostonglobe.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Boston Globe"}, "authors":

He also said he has rejected offers from allied countries and militias in the region that could add tens of thousands to his ranks.\n\nA nearly 10-minute-long video allegedly filmed by a Hezbollah surveillance drone and released Tuesday shows parts of Haifa -- a city far from the Israel-Lebanon border. Nasrallah in his speech Wednesday said Hezbollah has much more footage -- an apparent threat it could reach sites deep in Israel.\n\nIsrael's military chief, Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi, visited Israeli air-defense soldiers near the border with Lebanon on Wednesday, saying Israel was aware of Hezbollah's capabilities demonstrated in the video and has solutions for these threats.\n\n\"We of course have infinitely greater capabilities,: he said and added, \"I think the enemy is only familiar with a few of them and (we) will confront them at the right time.\"\n\nHezbollah, an ally of the Palestinian militant group Hamas, has been exchanging strikes with Israel almost daily since the war in Gaza erupted on Oct. 7, with the aim to pull Israeli forces away from the embattled Gaza Strip.\n\nHezbollah's attacks escalated after Israel expanded its offensive last month into the southern Gaza city of Rafah and spiked further last week after an Israeli strike killed high-ranking Hezbollah commander Taleb Sami Abdullah, the most senior militant killed so far during the Israel-Hamas war.\n\nAlso Tuesday, the Israeli army said it has \"approved and validated\" plans for an offensive in Lebanon, although the decision to actually launch such an operation would have to come from the country's political leadership.\n\nThe warnings by both sides followed a visit by President Joe Biden's senior adviser Amos Hochstein, who this week met with officials in Lebanon and Israel in his latest attempt to deescalate tensions. Hochstein told reporters in Berlin on Tuesday that it was a \"very serious situation\" and that a diplomatic solution to prevent a larger war was \"urgent.\"\n\nNasrallah said a wider war with Lebanon would have regional implications and that Hezbollah would attack any other country in the region that assisted Israel in the war effort, citing Cyprus, which has hosted Israeli forces for training exercises. He suggested Cyprus might allow Israel to use its bases in event of a wider war.\n\nIn response, Cypriot President Nikos Christodoulides said his island nation \"is in no way involved\" in any military operations in the region. Cyprus is \"part of the solution, not part of the problem\" he said, pointing out the Cyprus-Gaza maritime corridor used to deliver aid to the Palestinian territory.\n\nOnly a cease-fire in Gaza would halt the Lebanon-Israel border fighting or the attacks on Western and Israel-linked targets from Yemen's Houthi rebels and Iraqi militias allied with Hezbollah.\n\nIsrael views Hezbollah as its most direct threat, and the two fought a 34-day war in 2006 that ended in a stalemate. Hebollah's military capabilities have significantly grown since then, and the United States and Israel estimate the group, along with other Lebanese militant factions, has about 150,000 missiles and rockets. Hezbollah also has been working on precision-guided missiles.\n\nHezbollah said at least four of its fighters were killed in Israeli strikes on Wednesday as Hochstein returned to Israel for a new round of meetings there.\n\nLebanese state media reported the strikes along the border and near the coastal city of Tyre, about 30 kilometers (20 miles) away. The Israeli military said two Hezbollah launches damaged several vehicles in northern Israel.\n\nKamel Mohanna, the head of the Amel Association, an NGO providing health services in different areas of Lebanon, said the association health center in the town of Khiam was hit and damaged by the Israeli shelling.\n\nIsraeli strikes have killed more than 400 people in Lebanon, most of them Hezbollah and other militants, but also over 80 civilians and non-combatants. In northern Israel, 16 soldiers and 11 civilians have been killed by strikes launched from Lebanon.\n\nAssociated Press writers Melanie Lidman and Josef Federman in Jerusalem, and Menelaos Hadjicostis

In a phone call with his Lebanese counterpart on Thursday, Cypriot Foreign Minister Constantinos Kombos reiterated his country's position and stressed that \"Cyprus has no intention of getting involved in any way in the ongoing war in the region.\"\n\nThe Israeli military reported the launch of 25 rockets toward the western Galilee, saying there were no casualties. It later said another volley of 20 rockets was fired in the same area, and fell in open fields without causing any injuries.\n\nThe Iran-backed Hezbollah, which has been engaged in heavy cross-border fire with Israel since last October, said it struck the Samaqa and Ruwaisat al-Alam sites in the Israeli-occupied Kfar Shuba Hills with \"appropriate weapons\" and heavy machine guns. It also claimed an attack with artillery shelling on the Zabidin site in the Shebaa Farms area.\n\nIn an earlier statement, Hezbollah said it launched dozens of Katyusha rockets on the Zarit military barracks in northern Israel in response to the killing of one of its members in an Israeli strike earlier on Thursday.\n\nLebanon's official National News Agency had reported the death of one person in an Israeli drone strike that hit a vehicle in the southern town of Deir Kifa on Thursday morning. Hezbollah later announced the death of Abbas Ibrahim Hamada, which it said was \"martyred on the road to Jerusalem,\" a phrase commonly used by the group in reference to its members killed in Israeli strikes.\n\nThe Israeli army confirmed the strike, saying it killed Hamada who was Hezbollah's operations officer in the Jouaiyya area near Deir Kifa. The army said he planned and carried out attacks against Israel.\n\nAccording to the Israeli military, at least 349 Hezbollah fighters have been killed since the start of the hostilities along the Israel-Lebanon border in the wake of the war in Gaza Oct. 8. The conflict has also killed 93 civilians on the Lebanese side of the border, per an Agence France-Presse tally, while 15 soldiers and 11 civilians have been killed in Israel.\n\nIsrael, Hezbollah exchange threats of war\n\nTensions have soared in recent days as the two parties escalated their rhetoric. Hezbollah's Secretary General Hassan Nasrallah on Wednesday threatened a wide response against Israel in the event of a full-blown war.\n\n\"The enemy [Israel] knows well that we have prepared ourselves for the worst ... and that no place ... will be spared our rockets,\" Nasrallah said in a televised address.\n\nIsrael must \"wait for us on land, by sea and by air,\" he added, warning that his group will fight \"without restrictions.\"\n\nNasrallah also took aim at Cyprus, saying that Hezbollah had received information that the small Mediterranean island will allow Israel to use its bases during a potential war against the Lebanese group.\n\n\"Opening Cypriot airports and bases to the Israeli enemy to target Lebanon would mean that the Cypriot government is part of the war, and the resistance will deal with it as part of the war,\" Nasrallah threatened.\n\nChristodoulides responded to Nasrallah's remarks in a statement on Wednesday, saying that his country \"is not part of the problem,\" rather it \"is part of the solution.\"\n\nFor its part, the European Union expressed its full support to Cyprus.\n\n\"Any threat against one of our member states is a threat against the European Union,\" Peter Stano, the European Commission's spokesperson for external affairs, told reporters in Brussels on Thursday.\n\nThe drums of war are increasingly beating as Israeli officials are calling for a harsher response toward Hezbollah as they can no longer tolerate the repeated attacks.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warned earlier this month that his country is ready for an \"extremely powerful\" response to Hezbollah.\n\n\"We can't accept the continuation of the situation in the north, it won't continue,\" he said.\n\nThe Israeli military announced Tuesday that it approved \"operational plans for an offensive in Lebanon.\" According to a statement, the head of the army's Northern Command and head of the Operations Directorate also approved decisions to increase \"the readiness of the forces on the ground.\"\n\nIsrael's foreign minister said later on Tuesday that a war with Lebanon was coming soon.\n\n\"We are getting very close to the moment of deciding on changing the rules of the game against Hezbollah and Lebanon,\" Israel Katz wrote on X.\n\n\"In an all-out war, Hezbollah will be destroyed and Lebanon will be severely hit,\" he threatened.", "source": {"uri": "al-monitor.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Al-Monitor"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hassan_Nasrallah", "type": "person",

But I won't say what they are,\" he said in a televised address commemorating a top Hezbollah commander killed in an Israeli airstrike in southern Lebanon last week. \"When the decision is made, they will be seen on the front lines.\"\n\nHezbollah has used locally made explosive drones for the first time since the start of the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza last October, as well as surface-to-air missiles against Israeli jets.\n\nNasrallah said in 2021 that Hezbollah has 100,000 fighters but now he claimed the number is much higher. He also said he has rejected offers from allied countries and militias in the region that could add tens of thousands to his ranks.\n\nA nearly 10-minute-long video allegedly filmed by a Hezbollah surveillance drone and released Tuesday shows parts of Haifa -- a city far from the Israel-Lebanon border. Nasrallah in his speech Wednesday said Hezbollah has much more footage -- an apparent threat it could reach sites deep in Israel.\n\nIsrael's military chief, Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi, visited Israeli air-defense soldiers near the border with Lebanon on Wednesday, saying Israel was aware of Hezbollah's capabilities demonstrated in the video and has solutions for these threats.\n\n\"The enemy only knows a small part of our capabilities and will see them at the needed time,\" he said.\n\nHezbollah, an ally of the Palestinian terrorist group Hamas, has been exchanging strikes with Israel almost daily since the war in Gaza erupted on Oct. 7, with the aim to pull Israeli forces away from the embattled Gaza Strip.\n\nHezbollah's attacks escalated after Israel expanded its offensive last month into the southern Gaza city of Rafah and spiked further last week after an Israeli strike killed high-ranking Hezbollah commander Taleb Sami Abdullah, the most senior terrorist killed so far during the Israel-Hamas war.\n\nAlso Tuesday, the Israeli army said it has \"approved and validated\" plans for an offensive in Lebanon, although the decision to actually launch such an operation would have to come from the country's political leadership.\n\nThe warnings by both sides followed a visit by President Joe Biden's senior adviser Amos Hochstein, who this week met with officials in Lebanon and Israel in his latest attempt to deescalate tensions. he situation. Hochstein told reporters in Berlin on Tuesday that it was a \"very serious situation\" and that a diplomatic solution to prevent a larger war was \"urgent.\"\n\nNasrallah said a wider war with Lebanon would have regional implications and that Hezbollah would attack any other country in the region backing Israel, citing Cyprus, which has hosted Israeli forces for training exercises.\n\nOnly a cease-fire in Gaza would halt the Lebanon-Israel border fighting or the attacks on Western and Israel-linked targets from Yemen's Houthi terrorists and Iraqi militias allied with Hezbollah.\n\nIsrael views Hezbollah as its most direct threat, and the two fought a 34-day war in 2006 that ended in a stalemate. Hebollah's military capabilities have significantly grown since then, and the United States and Israel estimate the group, along with other Lebanese terrorist factions, has about 150,000 missiles and rockets. Hezbollah also has been working on precision-guided missiles.\n\nHezbollah said at least four of its fighters were killed in Israeli strikes on Wednesday as Hochstein returned to Israel for a new round of meetings there.\n\nLebanese state media reported the strikes along the border and near the coastal city of Tyre, about 20 miles away. The Israeli military said two Hezbollah launches damaged several vehicles in northern Israel.\n\nKamel Mohanna, the head of the Amel Association, an NGO providing health services in different areas of Lebanon, said the association health center in the town of Khiam was hit and damaged by the Israeli shelling.\n\nIsraeli strikes have killed more than 400 people in Lebanon, most of them Hezbollah and other terrorists, but also over 80 civilians and noncombatants. In northern Israel, 16 soldiers and 11 civilians have been killed by strikes launched from Lebanon.", "source": {"uri": "reviewjournal.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Las Vegas Review-Journal"},

In an all-out war, Hezbollah will be destroyed and Lebanon will be severely hit,\" Katz wrote in a social media post.\n\n\"The State of Israel will pay a price on the front and home fronts, but with a strong and united nation, and the full power of the [Israeli military], we will restore security to the residents of the north.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, Nasrallah underscored Hezbollah's military capabilities, saying that the group has acquired new weapons and has an abundance of drones that it manufactures locally.\n\n\"The enemy knows well that we have prepared ourselves for the most difficult days,\" he said. \"The enemy knows well what awaits it, and that's why it has been deterred so far. And it knows that there will be no place in the [country] that would be spared our rockets and drones. And it won't be indiscriminate bombing: every rocket - a target.\"\n\nNasrallah also suggested that Hezbollah may send ground forces into Israeli territory.\n\n\"There is a lot of fear from the enemy that the resistance would invade northern Israel, and this is a standing possibility that remains present in the context of any war imposed on Lebanon,\" he said.\n\nThe Iran-aligned Lebanese organisation started attacking military bases in northern Israel on the day after the outbreak of the war on Gaza on October 7 in what it says is a \"support front\" to back Palestinian armed groups.\n\nNasrallah stressed that the Lebanese front is making a difference in the broader confrontation against Israel and drawing Israeli military resources away from Gaza.\n\nNasrallah also issued a warning to Cyprus, a European Union member that sits in the eastern Mediterranean west of the Lebanese and Israeli coasts.\n\nHe said the group has information that Israel is conducting military exercises in Cyprus in similar terrains to south Lebanon.\n\nNasrallah added that Israel plans to use airports and bases in Cyprus for military purposes if its military infrastructure is attacked during a major war.\n\n\"Opening Cypriot airports and bases for the Israeli enemy to target Lebanon means the Cypriot government has become part of the war, and the resistance will deal with it as part of the war,\" he said without elaborating.\n\nNasrallah also warned that the group would open a naval front against Israel in the Mediterranean.\n\nHe added that Hezbollah will continue its continuing attacks against Israeli targets, saying that the solution to the crisis is \"clear\": ending the Israeli war on Gaza.\n\nMore than 37,000 people have been killed in the Israeli assault on Gaza since October, according to Palestinian health officials.\n\nIsrael launched the war on October 7 after Hamas, the Palestinian group that governs Gaza, led an attack on southern Israel, killing at least 1,139 people, according to an Al Jazeera tally based on Israeli statistics, and seizing about 250 others as captives.\n\nNasrallah defended Hamas for making its own demands on a multiphased United States-led proposal that Washington says would lead to an \"enduring ceasefire\".\n\nHe said the US plan has an \"obvious\" gap that would allow Israel to resume the war after the first stage of the proposal, which would see the release of some Israeli captives held by Hamas.", "source": {"uri": "aljazeera.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Al Jazeera Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

regional tour.\n\n\"Everything the enemy says and that the mediators convey, including with threats of war on Lebanon... this doesn't scare us,\" Nasrallah said.\n\nOn Tuesday, Hezbollah released a more than nine-minute video showing aerial footage purportedly taken by the movement over northern Israel, including what it said were sensitive military, defence and energy facilities and infrastructure in the city and port of Haifa.\n\nNasrallah said the footage was taken by a drone that \"flew for long hours\" over the Haifa port.\n\nHe also warned that his group had only used \"a part of\" its weapons since October.\n\n\"We have obtained new weapons,\" Nasrallah said, without elaborating.\n\n\"We have developed some of our weapons... and we are keeping others for the days that will come,\" he said.\n\n\"Years ago we talked about 100,000 fighters... today, we have greatly exceeded\" that number, Nasrallah added.\n\n\"The resistance has more (manpower) than it needs... even in the worst circumstances,\" he said.\n\nHezbollah on Wednesday claimed several attacks on Israeli troops and positions in northern Israel, and announced the death of four of its fighters.\n\nThe cross-border violence has killed at least 478 people in Lebanon, most of them fighters but also including 93 civilians, according to an AFP tally.\n\nIsraeli authorities say at least 15 soldiers and 11 civilians have been killed in the country's north.", "source": {"uri": "euractiv.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "EurActiv.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Cyprus is not known to offer any land or base facilities to the Israeli military, but has in the past allowed Israel to use its vast airspace - its flight information region - to occasionally conduct air drills, but never during conflict.\n\nSovereign British military bases on Cyprus have been used by Britain for operations in Syria in the past and more recently, Yemen. The Cyprus government has no say in the matter. There are two British bases in Cyprus, which was a colony until 1960. Nasrallah said his group would fight with \"no rules\" and \"no ceilings\" in the event of a broader war. He was speaking at a memorial event for a commander killed in an Israeli strike last week - the most senior Hezbollah figure to be killed so far in the current conflict with Israel.\n\nHezbollah unleashed its largest volleys of drones and rockets at Israel in retaliation. U.N. officials expressed concern at the escalation, and U.S. envoy Amos Hochstein travelled to Israel and Lebanon to urge both sides not to move into a full-scale conflict. Hezbollah first showed it could hit a vessel at sea by striking an Israeli warship in the Mediterranean during their 2006 war.\n\nReports by media and analysts have for years indicated that Hezbollah acquired Russian-made anti-ship Yakhont missiles in Syria, after its forces deployed there more than a decade ago to help President Bashar al-Assad fight the country's civil war.\n\n(This story has

Israeli enemy to target Lebanon would mean that the Cypriot government is part of the war, and the resistance will deal with it as part of the war,\" Nasrallah threatened.\n\nBritain has also retained sovereign control over two base areas in its former colony Cyprus under the terms of the treaties that granted the island independence in 1960.\n\n'New weapons'\n\nNasrallah's statements came a day after US envoy Amos Hochstein -- who in 2022 brokered a maritime border deal between Israel and Lebanon -- called for \"urgent\" de-escalation during a visit to Lebanon.\n\nHe also met with senior officials in Israel on his regional tour.\n\n\"Everything the enemy says and that the mediators convey, including with threats of war on Lebanon... this doesn't scare us,\" Nasrallah said.\n\nOn Tuesday, Hezbollah released a more than nine-minute video showing aerial footage purportedly taken by the movement over northern Israel, including what it said were sensitive military, defence and energy facilities and infrastructure in the city and port of Haifa.\n\nNasrallah said the footage was taken by a drone that \"flew for long hours\" over the Haifa port.\n\nHe also warned that his group had only used \"a part of\" its weapons since October.\n\n\"We have obtained new weapons,\" Nasrallah said, without elaborating.\n\n\"We have developed some of our weapons... and we are keeping others for the days that will come,\" he said.\n\n\"Years ago we talked about 100,000 fighters... today, we have greatly exceeded\" that number, Nasrallah added.\n\n\"The resistance has more (manpower) than it needs... even in the worst circumstances,\" he said.\n\nHezbollah on Wednesday claimed several attacks on Israeli troops and positions in northern Israel, and announced the death of four of its fighters.\n\nThe cross-border violence has killed at least 478 people in Lebanon, most of them fighters but also including 93 civilians, according to an AFP tally.\n\nIsraeli authorities say at least 15 soldiers and 11 civilians have been killed in the country's north.", "source": {"uri": "france24.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "France 24"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

He also threatened Cyprus for supposedly supporting Israel. This comes amidst an ongoing exchange of fire with Israel and the broader Mediterranean region's tension.\n\nThe head of Lebanon's Hezbollah said on Wednesday that nowhere in Israel would be safe if a full-fledged war breaks out between the two foes, and also threatened EU member Cyprus for the first time and other parts of the Mediterranean. Hezbollah has been trading fire with Israel for more than eight months in parallel with the Gaza war. On Tuesday, the Iran-backed group published what it said was drone footage of sensitive military sites deep in Israeli territory.\n\nIn a televised address on Wednesday, Hezbollah chief Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah said \"there will be no place safe from our missiles and our drones\" in Israel in the event of a broader war. The group also had \"a bank of targets\" that it could target in precision strikes, he said.\n\nIsrael \"knows that what also awaits it in the Mediterranean is very big ... In the face of a battle of this magnitude, it knows that it must now wait for us on land, in the air, and at sea,\" Nasrallah added. Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz had warned on Tuesday that a decision on an all-out war with Hezbollah was coming soon and Israel's military said \"operational plans for an offensive in Lebanon were approved and validated\".\n\nNasrallah also threatened Cyprus - the EU member state in closest proximity to Lebanon, with which it has cordial relations - accusing it of allowing Israel to use its airports and bases for military exercises. \"The Cypriot government must be warned that opening Cypriot airports and bases for the Israeli enemy to target Lebanon means that the Cypriot government has become part of the war and the resistance (Hezbollah) will deal with it as part of the war,\" Nasrallah said.\n\nCYPRUS DENIES TAKING SIDES Cypriot President Nikos Christodoulides denied any suggestion Cyprus was taking sides in any conflict.\n\n\"It (Cyprus) is not part of the problem, it is part of the solution. That role is evident, for example, through the humanitarian (aid) corridor which has been acknowledged not only by the Arab world, but from the international community,\" he said, referring to shipments of aid from Cyprus to Gaza. Cyprus is not known to offer any land or base facilities to the Israeli military, but has in the past allowed Israel to use its vast airspace - its flight information region - to occasionally conduct air drills, but never during conflict.\n\nSovereign British military bases on Cyprus have been used by Britain for operations in Syria in the past and more recently, Yemen. The Cyprus government has no say in the matter. There are two British bases in Cyprus, which was a colony until 1960. Nasrallah said his group would fight with \"no rules\" and \"no ceilings\" in the event of a broader war. He was speaking at a memorial event for a commander killed in an Israeli strike last week - the most senior Hezbollah figure to be killed so far in the current conflict with Israel.\n\nHezbollah unleashed its largest volleys of drones and rockets at Israel in retaliation. U.N. officials expressed concern at the escalation, and U.S. envoy Amos Hochstein travelled to Israel and Lebanon to urge both sides not to move into a full-scale conflict. Hezbollah first showed it could hit a vessel at sea by striking an Israeli warship in the Mediterranean during their 2006 war.\n\nReports by media and analysts have for years indicated that Hezbollah acquired Russian-made anti-ship Yakhont missiles in Syria, after its forces deployed there more than a decade ago to help President Bashar al-Assad fight the country's civil war.\n\n(This story has

On Tuesday, the Iran-backed group published what it said was drone footage of sensitive military sites deep in Israeli territory.\n\nIn a televised address on Wednesday, Hezbollah chief Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah said \"there will be no place safe from our missiles and our drones\" in Israel in the event of a broader war.\n\nThe group also had \"a bank of targets\" that it could target in precision strikes, he said.\n\nIsrael \"knows that what also awaits it in the Mediterranean is very big ... In the face of a battle of this magnitude, it knows that it must now wait for us on land, in the air, and at sea,\" Nasrallah added.\n\nIsraeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz had warned on Tuesday that a decision on an all-out war with Hezbollah was coming soon and Israel's military said \"operational plans for an offensive in Lebanon were approved and validated\".\n\nNasrallah also threatened Cyprus - the EU member state in closest proximity to Lebanon, with which it has cordial relations - accusing it of allowing Israel to use its airports and bases for military exercises.\n\n\"The Cypriot government must be warned that opening Cypriot airports and bases for the Israeli enemy to target Lebanon means that the Cypriot government has become part of the war and the resistance (Hezbollah) will deal with it as part of the war,\" Nasrallah said.\n\nCypriot President Nikos Christodoulides denied any suggestion Cyprus was taking sides in any conflict.\n\n\"It (Cyprus) is not part of the problem, it is part of the solution. That role is evident, for example, through the humanitarian (aid) corridor which has been acknowledged not only by the Arab world, but from the international community,\" he said, referring to shipments of aid from Cyprus to Gaza.\n\nCyprus is not known to offer any land or base facilities to the Israeli military, but has in the past allowed Israel to use its vast airspace - its flight information region - to occasionally conduct air drills, but never during conflict.\n\nSovereign British military bases on Cyprus have been used by Britain for operations in Syria in the past and more recently, Yemen. The Cyprus government has no say in the matter. There are two British bases in Cyprus, which was a colony until 1960.\n\nNasrallah said his group would fight with \"no rules\" and \"no ceilings\" in the event of a broader war. He was speaking at a memorial event for a commander killed in an Israeli strike last week - the most senior Hezbollah figure to be killed so far in the current conflict with Israel.\n\nHezbollah unleashed its largest volleys of drones and rockets at Israel in retaliation. U.N. officials expressed concern at the escalation, and U.S. envoy Amos Hochstein travelled to Israel and Lebanon to urge both sides not to move into a full-scale conflict.\n\nHezbollah first showed it could hit a vessel at sea by striking an Israeli warship in the Mediterranean during their 2006 war.\n\nReports by media and analysts have for years indicated that Hezbollah acquired Russian-made anti-ship Yakhont missiles in Syria, after its forces deployed there more than a decade ago to help President Bashar al-Assad fight the country's civil war.", "source": {"uri": "odt.co.nz",

Picture: REUTERS/MOHAMED AZAKIR\n\nBeirut -- The head of Lebanon's Hezbollah said on Wednesday that nowhere in Israel would be safe if a full-fledged war breaks out between the two foes, and he also threatened Cyprus and other parts of the Mediterranean.\n\nHezbollah has been trading fire with Israel for more than eight months in parallel with the Gaza War. On Tuesday, the Iran-backed group published what it said was drone footage of sensitive military sites deep in Israeli territory.\n\nIn a televised address on Wednesday, Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah said \"there will be no place safe from our missiles and our drones\" in Israel in the event of a broader war.\n\nThe group also had \"a bank of targets\" that it could target in precision strikes, he said.\n\nIsrael \"knows that what also awaits it in the Mediterranean is very big... In the face of a battle of this magnitude, it knows that it must now wait for us on land, in the air, and at sea,\" Nasrallah added.\n\nThe group first showed it could hit a vessel at sea by striking an Israeli warship in the Mediterranean during their 2006 war.\n\nReports by media and analysts have for years indicated that Hezbollah acquired Russian-made anti-ship Yakhont missiles in Syria, after its forces deployed there more than a decade ago to help President Bashar al-Assad fight the country's civil war.\n\nNasrallah also threatened Cyprus for the first time, accusing it of allowing Israel to use its airports and bases for military exercises.\n\n\"The Cypriot government must be warned that opening Cypriot airports and bases for the Israeli enemy to target Lebanon means that the Cypriot government has become part of the war and the resistance (Hezbollah) will deal with it as part of the war,\" Nasrallah said.\n\nThere was no immediate comment from authorities in Cyprus.\n\nCyprus is not known to offer any land or base facilities to the Israeli military, but has in the past allowed Israel to use its vast airspace to conduct air drills, but never during conflict.\n\nSovereign British military bases have been used by the UK for operations in Syria and more recently, Yemen. The Cyprus government has no say in the matter. There are two British bases in Cyprus, which was a colony until 1960.\n\nNasrallah said his group would fight with \"no rules\" and \"no ceilings\" in the event of a broader war. He was speaking at a memorial event for a commander killed in an Israeli strike last week -- the most senior Hezbollah figure to be killed so far in the current conflict with Israel.\n\nHezbollah unleashed its largest volleys of drones and rockets at Israel in retaliation.

But, its success has also left it with very few viable targets left that won't result in a significant Israeli strike.'\n\n'On Israel's northern border, the ever-growing exchange of fire between the IDF and Hezbollah is bringing the conflict to the brink of crossing over to a full-scale war,' Melamed added.\n\nThis comes as Hezbollah chief Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah said that 'no place' would be safe, while also threatening to attack Cyprus.

In an all-out war, Hezbollah will be destroyed and Lebanon will be severely hit,\" Katz wrote in a social media post.\n\n\"The State of Israel will pay a price on the front and home fronts, but with a strong and united nation, and the full power of the [Israeli military], we will restore security to the residents of the north.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, Nasrallah stressed Hezbollah's military capabilities, saying that the group has acquired new weapons and has an abundance of drones that it manufactures locally.\n\n\"The enemy knows well that we have prepared ourselves for the most difficult days,\" he continued, adding, \"The enemy knows well what awaits it, and that's why it has been deterred so far. And it knows that there will be no place in the [country] that would be spared our rockets and drones. And it won't be indiscriminate bombing: every rocket - a target.\"\n\nNasrallah also suggested that Hezbollah may send ground forces into Israeli-occupied territories.\n\n\"There is a lot of fear from the enemy that the resistance would invade northern Israel, and this is a standing possibility that remains present in the context of any war imposed on Lebanon,\" he stated.\n\nThe Iran-aligned Lebanese organisation started attacking military bases in northern Israel on the day after the outbreak of the war on Gaza on October 7 in what it says is a \"support front\" to back Palestinian armed groups.\n\nNasrallah stressed that the Lebanese front is making a difference in the broader confrontation against Israel and drawing Israeli military resources away from Gaza.\n\nNasrallah also issued a warning to Cyprus, a European Union member that sits in the eastern Mediterranean west of the Lebanese and Israeli coasts.\n\nHe said the group has information that Israel is conducting military exercises in Cyprus in similar terrains to south Lebanon.\n\nNasrallah added that Israel plans to use airports and bases in Cyprus for military purposes if its military infrastructure is attacked during a major war.\n\n\"Opening Cypriot airports and bases for the Israeli enemy to target Lebanon means the Cypriot government has become part of the war, and the resistance will deal with it as part of the war,\" he stated without elaborating.\n\nNasrallah also warned that the group would open a naval front against Israel in the Mediterranean.\n\nHe added that Hezbollah will continue its continuing attacks against Israeli targets, saying that the solution to the crisis is \"clear\": ending the Israeli war on Gaza.\n\nMore than 37,000 people have been killed in the Israeli assault on Gaza since October, according to Palestinian health officials.\n\nIsrael launched the war on October 7 after Hamas, the Palestinian group that governs Gaza, led an attack on southern Israel, killing at least 1,200 people and seizing about 250 others as captives.\n\nNasrallah defended Hamas for making its own demands on a multiphased United States-led proposal that Washington says would lead to an \"enduring ceasefire\".\n\nHe said the US plan has an \"obvious\" gap that would allow Israel to resume the war after the first stage of the proposal, which would see the release of some Israeli captives held by Hamas.", "source": {"uri": "ifpnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Iran Front Page"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hassan_Nasrallah", "type":

The threat towards Cyprus is a result of what Nasrallah said was the Israeli use of bases on the eastern Mediterranean island.\n\n\"The Cypriot government must be warned that opening Cypriot airports and bases for the Israeli enemy to target Lebanon means that the Cypriot government has become part of the war and the resistance [Hezbollah] will deal with it as part of the war,\" Nasrallah said.\n\nAlthough the United Kingdom has two bases in Cyprus, there has been no officially acknowledged Israeli use of Cypriot land or airbases. Israel has used Cypriot airspace to conduct drills in the past.\n\nThe heightened rhetoric from Nasrallah comes a day after Hezbollah published footage it said was taken by one of its drones above the Israeli city of Haifa. The footage, which Nasrallah said only showed a small part of the footage captured, appeared to be a warning to Israeli authorities of Hezbollah's reach, should Israel continue to threaten an expansion of its attacks on Lebanon.\n\nIsrael had announced on Tuesday that operational plans for a military offensive in its northern neighbour were \"approved and validated\". More than 90,000 Israelis have fled their homes in the north of the country since hostilities began with Hezbollah on October 8, a day after the conflict between Israel and Hamas began in Gaza. At least 90,000 people have also fled their homes in southern Lebanon as a result of Israeli attacks.\n\nIsrael has assassinated a number of Hezbollah commanders, including, most recently, Taleb Abdallah, a senior commander who was killed last week. Hezbollah responded to the attack by firing more than 200 rockets - the most it has fired in a single day towards Israel since October. Since then, Israel has continued its air strikes on southern Lebanon, including the city of Tyr.\n\nBut despite that, and despite the rhetoric from both sides, there is a belief among observers that both sides are still largely sticking to the rules of engagement, with escalations occurring gradually.\n\n\"The intensity of hostilities has increased but not their nature,\" Eyal Lurie-Pardes of the Middle East Institute said. \"No red line has been crossed. A rocket attack on Haifa, for instance, would signal greater capability, so would almost constitute a red line [for Israel].\"\n\n\"Hezbollah have said they'll stop with a ceasefire in Gaza. Israel just needs to deal with the displaced people of the north. Both are one miscalculation away from conflict.\"\n\nDiplomatic efforts continue. United States envoy Amos Hochstein, who previously helped mediate a maritime deal between Lebanon and Israel, was recently in Beirut to try and ease tensions at the border, which could still draw in other regional actors.\n\n\"[Hochstein's] mission is constrained by the need for a comprehensive agreement that would involve both Hamas and Hezbollah,\" said Imad Salamey, a political scientist at the Lebanese American University. \"This necessity has not been fully recognised or addressed by either the American or Israeli sides, limiting the effectiveness of Hochstein's efforts to achieve lasting peace and stability.\"\n\nAlthough an all-out conflict between Hezbollah and Israel can still be avoided, many Lebanese are growing increasingly worried.\n\n\"The feeling in Lebanon is one of growing worry and anxiety about the possible breakout of an all-out war,\" said Salamey. \"The Israeli military's approval of a war plan is taken very seriously by the Lebanese people, leading to heightened fears of escalation. This approval has significantly undermined plans for tourism and investment in the country, as potential visitors and investors are reconsidering their decisions due to the increased threat of conflict.\"\n\nLebanon has had one of the century's worst economic crises and has been stuck in a political deadlock without a president since October 2022. The country has lacked political and economic stability in recent years, even before the war. Infrastructure is stretched and an expanded war could have a devastating effect on the already struggling nation.\n\nLebanon is not in a position to effectively respond to an Israeli invasion or a wider aerial war on its infrastructure,\" Salamey said. \"Any significant expansion of conflict would be devastating, as the destruction of infrastructure would be difficult to repair or replace. The Lebanese government lacks the resources for reconstruction, and there are few international donors willing to provide the necessary support, unlike the aftermath of the 2006 war.\"\n\nThe further dissolution of the Lebanese state could have serious repercussions for the region as well, Salamey said, adding that it \"could exacerbate existing political and social tensions within Lebanon, making recovery even more challenging\".\n\n\"The destruction of Lebanon would produce a state of chaos with armed groups pouring into its territory, hence creating a much more unstable situation [for the Israelis, too],\" he said.\n\nShould Israel decide to further engage with Lebanon, however, its military and civilian infrastructure could also sustain serious damage. Hezbollah is significantly stronger and better equipped than Hamas and the group has recently unveiled new weapons, including anti-aircraft missiles that have driven Israeli military aircraft out of Lebanese airspace for the first time.\n\n\"What is particularly worrisome and significant is that the Israelis seem to have learned absolutely nothing after their past experiences in Lebanon,\" Karim Emile Bitar, professor of international relations at University Saint Joseph in Beirut, told Al Jazeera. \"The announcement they made yesterday that they are about to wage a total war that would annihilate Hezbollah is at best extraordinarily naive and at worst, it shows amateurism.\"\n\n\"Hezbollah could inflict serious and significant and even unprecedented damage on Israel,\" he added.\n\nIsrael invaded Lebanon in 1978 and 1982, where it put west Beirut under siege to drive out Yasser Arafat's Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO). It occupied south Lebanon from 1985 until the year 2000.\n\nWhile Israel's military establishment seems to be aware of Hezbollah's capability, many in Israel, including far-right ministers like Itamar Ben-Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich, are pushing for military solutions over diplomacy. Smotrich in particular has even floated the idea of reoccupying south Lebanon, though Lurie-Pardes said that \"only the extreme right/radical fringe ... would want to conquer Lebanon\".\n\nThere is a widespread belief that Israel would need a ceasefire in Gaza to be able to turn its full focus towards Lebanon, but Lurie-Pardes said that operating on two fronts is not outside the realms of possibility.\n\n\"Israel can handle another front,\" he said. \"The human and financial cost would be immense, but they could do it.\"\n\nInside Israel, political pressure is mounting on politicians as the school year approaches and residents in the north want to return home. There's a growing view from the Israeli side of the border that they will not be able to live in security as long as Hezbollah operates nearby.\n\n\"The public wants it both ways,\" Lurie-Pardes said. \"They want to feel secure in the north and they want to see a military action that will make that happen.\"\n\n\"People want to see that answered. However, they also understand that Hezbollah is more powerful than Hamas and has more complex weaponry.\"\n\nWhat is clear is that an expanded war will have few winners. Israel has struggled to achieve its stated goal of eradicating Hamas over the last eight months, and Hezbollah has far more capabilities than the Palestinian group. And while Israel could do serious damage to Lebanon it could also lead to unforeseen long-term repercussions, as has happened in the past.\n\n\"In 1982, the Israelis wanted to do away with the PLO and succeeded, but it led to the birth of Hezbollah - a movement much more radical and more organised than Fatah,\" Bitar said. \"The same scenario could happen all over again.\"", "source": {"uri":

We have prepared for the worst case scenario and Israel knows it,\" he said.\n\nDescribing Hezbollah's intelligence gathering, which was dramatised by the broadcast of drone surveillance footage of Haifa on Tuesday, Nasrallah said: \"Since 8 October, the enemy has understood that certain places would be targeted,\" adding that Haifa had hours of surveillance footage.\n\n\"It knows we have information about these locations,\" he said.\n\n\"In 2006, [during the second Lebanese war] we had the ambition to bomb the Israeli base on Mount Meron. Today we just tell the fighters to do it, and they do it immediately.\"\n\n\"Whatever our intentions,\" he continued, \"whether we want all out war or not, the enemy is obliged to remain ready in the north of the country,\" adding that Israeli threats had \"no impact\" on Hezbollah's calculations.\n\nOn Wednesday, before Nasrallah's speech, Israeli strikes in southern Lebanon killed three Hezbollah fighters, the militant group said, as a US envoy tasked with avoiding a devastating regional war returned to Israel after meeting officials in Lebanon.\n\nOne Israeli airstrike landed near the southern coastal Lebanese city of Tyre, 20 miles from the frontier, which is sheltering many Lebanesepeople displaced from the immediate border area.\n\nOn the Israeli side of the Blue Line, which divides Israel and Lebanon, Hezbollah said it had fired rockets at an army base near the town of Kiryat Shmona on Wednesday afternoon, setting several fires.\n\nFears of a wider war between Israel and Hezbollah have intensified since Israel's killing last week of Abdallah, to which Hezbollah responded by launching hundreds of munitions, including drones and rockets, against Israel in the heaviest barrage of the latest conflict.\n\nHopes that the violence may subsiding, at least temporarily, were shattered by Hezbollah's release of surveillance drone footage that was filmed over the city of Haifa, prompting threats of \"all out war\" from Israel's foreign minister and the announcement that IDF generals had signed off on plans for a Lebanon offensive.\n\nMeanwhile, satellite images and data collected by regional officials in southern Lebanon suggest widespread and growing devastation from the conflict which has seen 1,700 houses completely destroyed and 14,000 suffering partial damage.\n\nNasrallah spoke as Amos Hochstein, a senior adviser to the US president, Joe Biden, was back in Israel after meetings in Lebanon on Tuesday.\n\nThere was no indication of any progress in his efforts to defuse the conflict amid warnings that an escalation to full scale war could lead to a regional conflict.\n\nWith the Israeli offensive in Gaza now in its ninth month, international criticism has grown steadily over the US's support for Israel's air and ground attacks.\n\nThe top United Nations court has concluded there is a \"plausible risk of genocide\" in Gaza - a charge Israel strongly denies. Israel blames civilian deaths on Hamas, saying militants operate among the population.\n\nIsraeli airstrikes and clashes between troops and Palestinian militants rocked Gaza on Wednesday, after Israel's army warned it had readied an \"offensive\" against the Hezbollah on the country's northern front.\n\nWitnesses and the civil defence agency in the Gaza Strip reported Israeli bombardment in western Rafah, where medics said drone strikes and shelling killed at least seven people.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [{"uri":

says Lebanon offensive ready - World News", "body": "Hezbollah supporters raise their fists and cheer as they watch a speech given by Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah on a screen during a ceremony to commemorate the death of senior Hezbollah commander Taleb Sami Abdullah, 55, who was killed last week by an Israeli strike in south Lebanon, in the southern Beirut suburb of Dahiyeh, Lebanon, Wednesday, June 19, 2024.\n\nHezbollah on Wednesday said none of Israel would be spared in a war, after Israel said it had approved plans for a Lebanon offensive, stoking fears of the Gaza conflict spreading.\n\nHezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah said \"no place\" in Israel would \"be spared our rockets\", in a televised address broadcast amid spiralling tensions across the Israel-Lebanon border.\n\nNasrallah -- whose powerful Iran-backed group has exchanged near-daily fire with Israel since its ally Hamas's Oct. 7 attack -- also threatened the nearby island nation of Cyprus if it opened its airports or bases to Israel \"to target Lebanon.\"\n\nThe Mediterranean island is home to two British military bases including an airbase, but they are in sovereign British territory and not controlled by the Greek Cypriot government.\n\nGreek Cypriot President Nikos Christodoulides denied his country's involvement in the war and said it was \"part of the solution\", pointing to its role in a maritime humanitarian corridor to Gaza \"recognized by the entire international community\".\n\nMeanwhile, the war between Israel and Hamas raged in Gaza, with Israeli air strikes and clashes between troops and Palestinian militants.\n\nWitnesses and the civil defense agency in the Hamas-run Gaza Strip reported an Israeli bombardment in western Rafah, where medics said drone strikes and shelling killed at least seven people.\n\nAnd medics at the European hospital in Khan Yunis told AFP 10 bodies were brought to the facility after an Israeli air strike killed a group of people on Salah al-Din road, east of Rafah city, as they waited for aid trucks to arrive.\n\nIslamic Jihad, a Palestinian armed group that has fought alongside Hamas, said its militants were battling troops amid Israeli shelling of western Rafah.\n\nThe war has spilled across the region, drawing in a number of Iran-backed groups saying they are acting in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza.\n\n'Greater capabilities'\n\nFears that Israel might launch a full-blown war in Lebanon have spiked, with the Israeli military on Tuesday announcing that \"operational plans for an offensive in Lebanon were approved and validated\".\n\nOn Wednesday, Israel said its warplanes had struck Hezbollah sites in southern Lebanon overnight, while reporting a drone had infiltrated near the border town of Metula and targeted troops in an attack claimed by Hezbollah.\n\nHezbollah, meanwhile, announced the death of four of its fighters.\n\nLebanon's official National News Agency reported Israeli strikes on several areas in south Lebanon on Wednesday morning, including on the border village of Khiam, where an AFP photographer saw a large cloud of smoke.\n\nHezbollah later said it had fired \"dozens of Katyusha rockets and artillery rounds\" towards a barracks in Kiryat Shmona in northern Israel in retaliation for the attacks.\n\nIsrael said the Hezbollah attack caused no casualties and that its own \"artillery struck the sources of fire\".\n\nThe day before, the Islamist group released a more than nine-minute video showing aerial footage purportedly taken over northern Israel, including what it said were sensitive military, defense and energy facilities and infrastructure in the city and port of Haifa.\n\nSpeaking on a visit to troops on the northern border, Israel's military chief Lieutenant General Herzi Halevi said the video showed \"a capability that we knew about\" and that Israel was \"creating solutions to deal with\" it.\n\n\"We of course have infinitely greater capabilities,\" he added.\n\n'Total war'\n\nThe Israeli army's announcement that its plans for an offensive in Lebanon had been approved, along with a warning from Foreign Minister Israel Katz of Hezbollah's destruction in a \"total war\", came as U.S. envoy Amos Hochstein visited the region to push for de-escalation.\n\nHochstein returned to Israel on Tuesday evening for more talks with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu after a series of meetings in Lebanon, according to an Israeli official.\n\nFormer Israeli security officials were split on the significance of the approval, with one telling AFP there would be an operation in Lebanon \"within a few weeks\" while another said the government was \"more interested in a ceasefire\".\n\nThe cross-border violence has killed at least 478 people in Lebanon, most of them fighters but also including 93 civilians, according to an AFP tally.\n\nIsraeli authorities say at least 15 soldiers and 11 civilians have been killed in the country's north.\n\nSyrian state media said an Israeli strike on military sites in the country's south killed an army officer on Wednesday. Israel has not commented on the report.\n\n'Drastic deterioration' in aid\n\nThe Israel-Lebanon escalation comes as more than eight months of war have led to dire humanitarian conditions in Gaza and repeated U.N. warnings of famine.\n\nU.N. deputy spokesman Farhan Haq told reporters that in recent weeks there had been \"an improvement\" in aid reaching northern Gaza \"but a drastic deterioration in the south\".\n\nIsrael launched its war on Gaza in retaliation for the Hamas' Oct. 7 attacks that resulted in the deaths of more than 1,190 people, mostly civilians, according to Israeli official figures.\n\nHamas seized 251 hostages. Of these 116 remain in Gaza, although the army says 41 of them are dead.\n\nIsrael's offensive has killed at least 37,396 people in Gaza, mostly civilians, according to the Hamas-run territory's health ministry.\n\nA U.N. report issued on Wednesday detailed six \"indiscriminate and disproportionate\" Israeli strikes that killed at least 218 people in the first two months of the war.\n\nIn a message on the Muslim holiday of Eid al-Adha, U.S. President Joe Biden called for the implementation of a ceasefire plan he outlined last month.\n\nHochstein said the plan would ultimately lead to \"the end of the conflict in Gaza\", which would in turn quell fighting between Israel and Hezbollah.\n\nBut U.S., Qatari and Egyptian mediation efforts have stalled for months since a one-week truce in November.", "source": {"uri": "hurriyetdailynews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hurriyet Daily News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hassan_Nasrallah",

But I won't say what they are,\" he said in a televised address commemorating a top Hezbollah commander killed in an Israeli airstrike in southern Lebanon last week. \"When the decision is made, they will be seen on the front lines.\"\n\nHezbollah has used locally made explosive drones for the first time since the start of the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza last October, as well as surface-to-air missiles to chase off Israeli jets.\n\nNasrallah said in 2021 that Hezbollah has 100,000 fighters but now he claimed the number is much higher, without elaborating. He also said he has rejected offers from allied countries and militias in the region that could add tens of thousands to his ranks.\n\nA nearly 10-minute-long video allegedly filmed by a Hezbollah surveillance drone and released Tuesday shows parts of Haifa -- a city far from the Israel-Lebanon border. Nasrallah in his speech Wednesday said Hezbollah has much more footage -- an apparent threat it could reach sites deep in Israel.\n\nIsrael's military chief, Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi, visited Israeli air-defense soldiers near the border with Lebanon on Wednesday, saying Israel was aware of Hezbollah's capabilities demonstrated in the video and has solutions for these threats.\n\n\"We of course have infinitely greater capabilities,\" he said and added, \"I think the enemy is only familiar with a few of them and (we) will confront them at the right time.\"\n\nHezbollah, an ally of the Palestinian militant group Hamas, has been exchanging strikes with Israel almost daily since the war in Gaza erupted on Oct. 7, with the aim to pull Israeli forces away from the embattled Gaza Strip.\n\nHezbollah's attacks escalated after Israel expanded its offensive last month into the southern Gaza city of Rafah and spiked further last week after an Israeli strike killed high-ranking Hezbollah commander Taleb Sami Abdullah, the most senior militant killed so far during the Israel-Hamas war.\n\nAlso Tuesday, the Israeli army said it has \"approved and validated\" plans for an offensive in Lebanon, although the decision to actually launch such an operation would have to come from the country's political leadership.\n\nThe warnings by both sides followed a visit by President Joe Biden's senior adviser Amos Hochstein, who this week met with officials in Lebanon and Israel in his latest attempt to deescalate tensions. Hochstein told reporters in Berlin on Tuesday that it was a \"very serious situation\" and that a diplomatic solution to prevent a larger war was \"urgent.\"\n\nNasrallah said a wider war with Lebanon would have regional implications and that Hezbollah would attack any other country in the region that assisted Israel in the war effort, citing Cyprus, which has hosted Israeli forces for training exercises. He suggested Cyprus might allow Israel to use its bases in event of a wider war.\n\nIn response, Cypriot President Nikos Christodoulides said his island nation \"is in no way involved\" in any military operations in the region. Cyprus is \"part of the solution, not part of the problem\" he said, pointing out the Cyprus-Gaza maritime corridor used to deliver aid to the Palestinian territory.\n\nOnly a cease-fire in Gaza would halt the Lebanon-Israel border fighting or the attacks on Western and Israel-linked targets from Yemen's Houthi rebels and Iraqi militias allied with Hezbollah.\n\nIsrael views Hezbollah as its most direct threat, and the two fought a 34-day war in 2006 that ended in a stalemate. Hebollah's military capabilities have significantly grown since then, and the United States and Israel estimate the group, along with other Lebanese militant factions, has about 150,000 missiles and rockets. Hezbollah also has been working on precision-guided missiles.\n\nHezbollah said at least four of its fighters were killed in Israeli strikes on Wednesday as Hochstein returned to Israel for a new round of meetings there.\n\nInformation for this article was contributed by Melanie Lidman, Josef Federman and Menelaos Hadjicostis of The Associated Press.\n\nHezbollah supporters watch a speech given by Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah on a screen during a ceremony to commemorate the death of senior Hezbollah commander Taleb Sami Abdullah, 55, who was killed last week by an Israeli strike in south Lebanon, in the southern Beirut suburb of Dahiyeh, Lebanon, Wednesday, June 19, 2024.

He also met with senior officials in Israel on his regional tour.\n\n\"Everything the enemy says and that the mediators convey, including with threats of war on Lebanon... this doesn't scare us,\" Mr Nasrallah said.\n\nOn Tuesday, Hezbollah released a more than nine-minute video showing aerial footage purportedly taken by the movement over northern Israel, including what it said were sensitive military, defence and energy facilities and infrastructure in the city and port of Haifa.\n\nMr Nasrallah said the footage was taken by a drone that \"flew for long hours\" over the Haifa port. He also warned that his group had only used \"a part of\" its weapons since October.\n\n\"We have obtained new weapons,\" Mr Nasrallah said. \"We have developed some of our weapons... and we are keeping others for the days that will come.\n\n\"Years ago we talked about 100,000 fighters... today, we have greatly exceeded\" that number. The resistance has more manpower than it needs... even in the worst circumstances.\"\n\nFatalities in northern Israel\n\nHezbollah on Wednesday claimed several attacks on Israeli troops and positions in northern Israel, and announced the death of four of its fighters.\n\nThe cross-border violence has killed at least 478 people in Lebanon, most of them fighters but also including 93 civilians, according to an AFP tally.\n\nIsraeli authorities say at least 15 soldiers and 11 civilians have been killed in the country's north.", "source": {"uri": "uk.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News UK"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hassan_Nasrallah", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hassan Nasrallah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hezbollah", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hezbollah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebanon", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lebanon"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Lebanon"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyprus", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cyprus"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Cyprus"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Independence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediterranean_Sea", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mediterranean Sea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereignty", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sovereignty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Katz", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Israel Katz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_District_(Israel)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Northern District (Israel)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Northern District (Israel)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Foreign_Affairs_(Israel)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Israel)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_fedayeen", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Palestinian fedayeen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galilee", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Galilee"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Israel Defense Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_of_Haifa", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Port of Haifa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned_aerial_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Unmanned aerial vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agence_France-Presse", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Agence France-Presse"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding/Middle_East", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding/Middle East", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Strength_Sports/Tug-of-War", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Strength Sports/Tug-of-War", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 54}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_telegraph_818/5ab4d6d1e00626c43a165a77b192e3d2", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9665510", "eventUri": "eng-9665510", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-10-07", "textStart": 1408, "textEnd": 1413}], "sentiment": -0.403921568627451, "wgt": 203, "relevance": 1}

Avi Melamed, who used to work for Israeli intelligence, claimed the Iran-backed terror group is running out of Israeli targets to hit without provoking a significant counterstrike by Jerusalem. He told MailOnline: 'Since October 8, Hezbollah has harassed Israel's northern communities, turning them into ghost towns through its aerial strikes both of missiles and attack drones,' Melamed added.\n\n'It has also managed to ignite forest fires in northern Israel, all in service of its partners in Gaza , part of Iran's network of \"resistance\". But, its success has also left it with very few viable targets left that won't result in a significant Israeli strike.' 'On Israel 's northern border, the ever-growing exchange of fire between the IDF and Hezbollah is bringing the conflict to the brink of crossing over to a full-scale war,' Melamed added.\n\nThis comes as Hezbollah chief Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah (pictured) said that 'no place' would be safe, while also threatening to attack Cyprus. In a dramatic escalation in rhetoric, Nasrallah said his group would fight with 'no rules' and 'no ceilings' in the event of a broader war. Nasrallah was speaking at a memorial event for a commander killed in an Israeli strike last week - the most senior Hezbollah figure to be killed so far in the current conflict with Israel. 'Israel has managed to continuously attack Hezbollah commanders, military infrastructure and fighters,' Melamed said. In a strike yesterday, Israeli jets struck a Hezbollah military structure in the Tyre area in Lebanon, according to the IDF.\n\nMelamed said that the strike 'highlights not only Israel's prowess both in gathering intelligence and acting on it, but also the significant number of additional targets it can strike at will without igniting a full-scale war'. He added increased exchange of fire is also causing internal pressure within Iran 's axis of resistance and defiance for Hamas to compromise and sign the Israeli-American deal on the table, giving Hezbollah the \"excuse\" to take the step back.'\n\nMelamed warned: 'Hezbollah is at a crossroads on both the political and operational routes where unless it is given an exit ramp, it will force itself to trigger a full-scale war with Israel. This is why it's extremely likely that the rumours of Hezbollah pressuring Hamas to sign the deal that would bring a ceasefire to Gaza which Hezbollah can claim it had a hand in pressuring the US and Israel into.' Meanwhile, Hezbollah chief Nasrallah said that nowhere in Israel would be safe if a full-fledged war breaks out between the two foes, and also threatened EU member Cyprus for the first time and other parts of the Mediterranean.\n\nHezbollah has been trading fire with Israel for more than eight months in parallel with the Gaza war. On Tuesday, the Iran-backed group published what it said was drone footage of sensitive military sites deep in Israeli territory. In a televised address on Wednesday, Hezbollah chief Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah said 'there will be no place safe from our missiles and our drones' in Israel in the event of a broader war.\n\nThe group also had 'a bank of targets' that it could target in precision strikes, he said. Israel 'knows that what also awaits it in the Mediterranean is very big ... In the face of a battle of this magnitude, it knows that it must now wait for us on land, in the air, and at sea,' Nasrallah added.\n\nIsraeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz (Pictured) had warned on Tuesday that a decision on an all-out war with Hezbollah was coming soon and Israel's military said 'operational plans for an offensive in Lebanon were approved and validated'. Nasrallah also threatened Cyprus - the EU member state in closest proximity to Lebanon, with which it has cordial relations - accusing it of allowing Israel to use its airports and bases for military exercises. 'The Cypriot government must be warned that opening Cypriot airports and bases for the Israeli enemy to target Lebanon means that the Cypriot government has become part of the war and the resistance (Hezbollah) will deal with it as part of the war,' Nasrallah said. Cypriot President Nikos Christodoulides denied any suggestion Cyprus was taking sides in any conflict.\n\n'It (Cyprus) is not part of the problem, it is part of the solution. That role is evident, for example, through the humanitarian (aid) corridor which has been acknowledged not only by the Arab world, but from the international community,' he said, referring to shipments of aid from Cyprus to Gaza. Cyprus is not known to offer any land or base facilities to the Israeli military, but has in the past allowed Israel to use its vast airspace - its flight information region - to occasionally conduct air drills, but never during conflict. Ex-intelligence officer Melamed said on the Hezbollah threats: 'Nasrallah's comments [on Wednesday] speak for the Iranian regime in that Tehran has laid claim to a foothold in the Eastern Basin of the Mediterranean Sea and by effect, has put Cyprus in its crosshairs.\n\n'While the words were spoken from Nasrallah's mouth, their author sits in Tehran. This move comes after years of failed Western Policy which has unsuccessfully dealt with Iran's Hegemonic plans which wrought instability throughout the Middle East, currently threatens trade and global commercial shipping in the Red Sea via the Houthis and now will threaten Europe's Natural Gas supply chain in the Eastern Basin through Hezbollah. Unless the West decides to change its standard operating procedure and to in fact directly address Iran, Tehran has telecasted what it plans to do.' Hezbollah unleashed its largest volleys of drones and rockets at Israel in retaliation. U.N. officials expressed concern at the escalation, and U.S. envoy Amos Hochstein travelled to Israel and Lebanon to urge both sides not to move into a full-scale conflict.\n\nHezbollah first showed it could hit a vessel at sea by striking an Israeli warship in the Mediterranean during their 2006 war. Reports by media and analysts have for years indicated that Hezbollah acquired Russian-made anti-ship Yakhont missiles in Syria, after its forces deployed there more than a decade ago to help President Bashar al-Assad fight the country's civil war.\n\nWant more stories like this from the Daily Mail?

His remarks on the conflict were the most hard-hitting since Iran-backed Hezbollah began attacking Israel last October across the border with Lebanon in support of Hamas in Gaza.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Israeli military said it had approved a plan for an offensive to push Hezbollah further back from the border, but was still hoping for a diplomatic solution. Nasrallah as well repeated that Hezbollah did not want war, but that the current fighting risked sliding into a much wider battle.\n\nNasrallah said that in previous wars with Israel, Hezbollah had only hoped of being able to strike Israel's Meron air base -- the center for its northern Israel operations command. Since the conflict began, Hezbollah says it has fired dozens of rockets and missiles at the base. The group was created with the help of Iran after Israel's 1982 invasion of Lebanon. Hezbollah fought another war with Israel in 2006.\n\n\"Everything you see we can see and everything we can strike we are not sparing in this battlefront,\" Nasrallah said, speaking at an undisclosed location. \"And it won't be random bombardment. Every drone will have a target. Every missile will have a target.\"\n\nHe noted that Hezbollah had a large stockpile of drones, what he called a surplus of fighters and new weapons that would be unveiled. He did not specify what they were.\n\nHe said Hezbollah had continued to receive weapons from Iran even after attacks on presumed weapons-carrying convoys in Syria. He said Hezbollah was also producing weapons in Lebanon.\n\nThis week, Hezbollah released a nine-minute video it said it had shot with an Iranian-made drone showing in high resolution images of the Israeli port of Haifa and specific buildings and vessels. It also pinpointed other potential target cities in Israel.\n\nNasrallah on Wednesday gloated that the drone had slipped through Israel's extensive air defenses.\n\nHe also warned that the Mediterranean Sea would also become a target in any war.\n\n\"Now they are preoccupied in the Red Sea, the Arabian Sea. The brothers in Yemen are trying,\" he said referring to Yemeni Houthiattacks on Israeli-linked ships and tankers.\"If they open a war in Lebanon, the situation in the Mediterranean Sea would become completely different. All of the coastline, all of the ships, all of the harbors,\" he said, indicating that Iran would also target those sites.\n\nAnalyst Lina Khatib, an associate fellow at the Chatham House think tank in London, said Nasrallah's comments and recent threats from Israel were likely intended to avoid escalation by either side.\n\n\"This is part of the psychological warfare that both Hezbollah and Israel have been engaging in, with each side wanting to show the other that it has the upper hand when it comes to information and this serves as a deterrent,\" she said.\n\nNasrallah also threatened Cyprus, saying the European Union member was hosting Israeli military maneuvers in its mountains, which resemble the mountains of Lebanon, and allowing Israel to use its air bases.\n\nCyprus and Israel have a joint defense agreement and have conducted joint military exercises in the past. Nasrallah said Cyprus allowing its bases to be used to target Lebanon would make it \"part of the war, and the resistance will deal with it as part of the war.\"\n\nCypriot President Nikos Christodoulides responded by saying his country was not involved in the war in Gaza but rather the humanitarian response.\n\nNasrallah said the only way for Israel to achieve an end to the conflict at the Lebanese border - as well as with Iraqi and Yemeni groups supporting Hamas - was to end the war in Gaza. He said there was little incentive for Hamas to accept a U.S.-backed deal which offers a limited ceasefire in exchange for the release of Israeli hostages.\n\n\"They want us to talk with Hamas, Islamic Jihad, the Palestinian brothers to accept,\" he said. \"Accept what? To accept this solution which allows for a pause in the fighting for six months and takes away one of the strongest elements they have?\"", "source": {"uri": "npr.org", "dataType": "news", "title":

In the face of a battle of this magnitude, it knows that it must now wait for us on land, in the air, and at sea,\" Mr Nasrallah added.\n\nEarlier, the Israeli army warned that it had readied an \"offensive\" against Hezbollah on the country's northern front.\n\nThe group first showed it could hit a vessel at sea by striking an Israeli warship in the Mediterranean during their 2006 war.\n\nReports by media and analysts have for years indicated that Hezbollah acquired Russian-made anti-ship Yakhont missiles in Syria, after its forces deployed there more than a decade ago to help President Bashar al-Assad fight the country's civil war.\n\nNasrallah also threatened Cyprus for the first time, accusing it of allowing Israel to use its airports and bases for military exercises.\n\n\"The Cypriot government must be warned that opening Cypriot airports and bases for the Israeli enemy to target Lebanon means that the Cypriot government has become part of the war and the resistance (Hezbollah) will deal with it as part of the war,\" Nasrallah said.\n\nThere was no immediate comment from authorities in Cyprus.\n\nCyprus is not known to offer any land or base facilities to the Israeli military, but has in the past allowed Israel to use its vast airspace - its flight information region (FIR) - to occasionally conduct air drills, but never during conflict.\n\nSovereign British military bases have been used by the United Kingdom for operations in Syria and more recently, Yemen. The Cyprus government has no say in the matter. There are two British bases in Cyprus, which was a colony until 1960.\n\nMr Nasrallah said his group would fight with \"no rules\" and \"no ceilings\" in the event of a broader war.\n\nHe was speaking at a memorial event for a commander killed in an Israeli strike last week - the most senior Hezbollah figure to die in the current conflict with Israel.\n\nHezbollah unleashed its largest volleys of drones and rockets at Israel in retaliation.\n\nUnited Nations officials expressed concern at the escalation, and US envoy Amos Hochstein travelled to Israel and Lebanon to urge both sides not to enter a full-scale conflict.\n\nThe Israeli military, which has traded near-daily cross-border fire with Hezbollah since October, said that \"operational plans for an offensive in Lebanon were approved and validated\".\n\nForeign Minister Israel Katz warned of the group's destruction in a \"total war\".\n\nIsrael's military said warplanes had struck militant sites in southern Lebanon overnight, while reporting a drone had infiltrated near the border town of Metula in an attack claimed by Hezbollah and targeting troops.\n\nThe group also announced the death of two of its fighters.\n\nLebanon's official National News agency reported Israeli strikes on several areas in south Lebanon this morning, including on the border village of Khiam.\n\nSyrian state media said an Israeli strike on military sites in the country's south killed an army officer today.

But it's unaffordable for many people.\"\n\nIslamic Jihad, a Palestinian armed group that has fought alongside Hamas, said its militants were battling troops amid Israeli shelling of western Rafah.\n\nWitnesses reported seeing Israeli military vehicles enter the city's Saudi neighbourhood, followed by gun battles.\n\nThere has also been fighting in central Gaza with witnesses reporting artillery shelling and heavy gunfire in Gaza City's Zeitun neighbourhood.\n\nThe 7 October attack resulted in the deaths of 1,194 people, mostly civilians, according to Israeli official figures.\n\nThe militants also seized 251 hostages. Of these, 116 remain in Gaza, although the army says 41 are dead.\n\nIsrael's retaliatory offensive has killed at least 37,396 people in Gaza, also mostly civilians, according to the territory's health ministry.\n\nAt least 24 people died over the past day, the ministry said.\n\nIn a message on the occasion of the Muslim holiday of Eid al-Adha, US President Joe Biden called for the implementation of a ceasefire plan he outlined last month.\n\nMr Hochstein said the plan would ultimately lead to \"the end of the conflict in Gaza\", which would in turn quell fighting between Israel and Hezbollah.\n\nBut US, Qatari and Egyptian mediation efforts have stalled for months since a one-week truce in November that saw dozens of hostages freed and increased aid deliveries into Gaza.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has faced mounting criticism at home over his handling of the Gaza war and hostage crisis, with regular mass demonstrations led by captives' relatives and anti-government activists.\n\nThousands gathered in front of parliament in Jerusalem last night, calling for early elections and the resumption of truce talks.\n\nIn a video recording, Mr Netanyahu criticised the US - a close ally - for \"withholding weapons and ammunitions to Israel\", in remarks rejected by the White House.", "source": {"uri": "rte.ie", "dataType": "news",

Israel if war is declared on Lebanon", "body": "Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah has warned Cyprus against allowing Israel to use its airports if an all-out war between Israeli forces and the Lebanese group broke out.\n\n\"The opening of Cypriot airports and bases to Israel to target Lebanon would mean that the Cypriot government is involved in the war,\" Mr Nasrallah said in a speech to mark the death of a senior Hezbollah and three fighters last week.\n\nHe said that Israel carried out annual military exercises in Cyprus.\n\nMr Nasrallah promised that Hezbollah would fight \"without limits\" and \"on land, in the air and at sea\" against Israel in the event of a total war.\n\nHezbollah would consider itself at war with Cyprus if it allowed Israel to use its airports, he said.\n\nCyprus is not known to offer any land or base facilities to the Israeli military, but has in the past allowed Israel to use its vast airspace - its flight information region (FIR) - to occasionally conduct air drills, but never during conflict.\n\nHezbollah and Israeli forces have been engaged in daily exchanges of fire across the Lebanese border since October 8, after the Lebanese group opened a front in support of its ally Hamas in Gaza.\n\nIn recent weeks, the fighting on the Lebanon-Israel border has increased in intensity, leading to fears that an all-out war would break out.\n\nIsraeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz on Tuesday said that Hezbollah would be destroyed in the event of a \"total war\" between the two, while the military has approved plans for an assault on the country.\n\nWhile Mr Nasrallah reiterated that Hezbollah did not want a full-on war, he said the Lebanese armed group and political party was ready if one became inevitable.\n\nMr Nasrallah said attacking Israel's Galilee region remained an option if large-scale combat were to begin, as he claimed that Hezbollah had more than 100,000 fighters in its ranks.\n\nHezbollah said it will not end its attacks until Israel ends its siege on the embattled Gaza Strip, where more than 37,000 Palestinians have been killed.\n\nIt said it is carrying out the attacks in support of its ally Hamas, which carried out an deadly raid into southern Israel on October 7, killing 1,200 people, taking 240 hostages and setting off retaliatory attacks.\n\nMr Nasrallah also spoke about the US-backed ceasefire deal and talks towards a truce that have stalled in recent weeks.\n\nMr Nasrallah said there were \"gaps\" in the deal, including the lack of commitment to a permanent ceasefire, which Hamas has also demanded.\n\nHe said that Israel \"will be able to resume the war\" without one.\n\nThe US-backed deal would begin with a six-week pause in the fighting, but Hamas fears that Israel will continue the war after it returns hostages.\n\nThe Israel-Lebanon clashes have killed at least 478 people in Lebanon, most of them fighters but also 93 civilians, according to AFP.\n\nIsraeli authorities said 15 soldiers and 11 civilians have been killed in the country's north.", "source": {"uri": "thenationalnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The National"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jamie_prentis@thenationalnews.com",

Cyprus is not participating in any military engagements.\"\n\nChristodoulides said the threat would be raised through diplomatic channels.\n\nNasrallah's remarks came a day after Israeli generals said they had signed off on planning for a wider offensive against Hezbollah, and Israel's foreign minister, Israel Katz, suggested the country was on the brink of deciding whether to expand the war.\n\nSpeaking at a memorial for Taleb Sami Abdallah, the most senior Hezbollah commander to be killed by Israel since the two sides began cross border exchanges on 8 October, Nasrallah insisted that Hezbollah's role was to support Hamas fighting in Gaza and that it had succeeded in tying up Israeli forces in the country's north.\n\nNasrallah spoke about a strategy of a limited conflict with Israel, short of all-out war and aimed at a ceasefire in Gaza, but the rhetoric appeared more heated as he said that nowhere in Israel would be safe from Hezbollah's attacks.\n\nNasrallah's televised speech underlined the difficulty of diplomatic efforts to de-escalate the conflict between the two sides as it has edged into ever more dangerous territory.\n\n\"We have more than 100,000 fighters, and even more, even in the worst-case scenario. We have prepared for the worst-case scenario and Israel knows it,\" he said.\n\nDescribing Hezbollah's intelligence-gathering, which was dramatised by the broadcast of drone surveillance footage of Haifa on Tuesday, Nasrallah said: \"Since 8 October, the enemy has understood that certain places would be targeted,\" adding that the militia had hours of surveillance footage of Haifa.\n\n\"It knows we have information about these locations,\" he said.\n\n\"In 2006 [during the second Lebanese war], we had the ambition to bomb the Israeli base on Mount Meron. Today we just tell the fighters to do it, and they do it immediately.\"\n\n\"Whatever our intentions,\" he continued, \"whether we want all-out war or not, the enemy is obliged to remain ready in the north of the country,\" adding that Israeli threats had \"no impact\" on Hezbollah's calculations.\n\nOn Wednesday, before Nasrallah's speech, Israeli strikes in southern Lebanon killed three Hezbollah fighters, the militant group said, as a US envoy tasked with avoiding a devastating regional war returned to Israel after meeting officials in Lebanon.\n\nOne Israeli airstrike landed near the southern coastal Lebanese city of Tyre, 20 miles from the frontier, which is sheltering many Lebanese people displaced from the immediate border area.\n\nOn the Israeli side of the Blue Line, which divides Israel and Lebanon, Hezbollah said it had fired rockets at an army base near the town of Kiryat Shmona on Wednesday afternoon, starting several fires.\n\nFears of a wider war between Israel and Hezbollah have intensified since Israel's killing last week of Abdallah, to which Hezbollah responded by launching hundreds of munitions, including drones and rockets, against Israel in the heaviest barrage of the latest conflict.\n\nHopes that the violence may subsiding, at least temporarily, were shattered by Hezbollah's release of surveillance drone footage that was filmed over the city of Haifa, prompting threats of \"all-out war\" from Israel's foreign minister and the announcement that IDF generals had signed off on plans for a Lebanon offensive.\n\nMeanwhile, satellite images and data collected by regional officials in southern Lebanon suggest widespread and growing devastation from the conflict which has seen 1,700 houses completely destroyed and 14,000 suffering partial damage.\n\nNasrallah spoke as Amos Hochstein, a senior adviser to the US president, Joe Biden, was back in Israel after meetings in Lebanon on Tuesday.\n\nThere was no indication of any progress in his efforts to defuse the conflict amid warnings that an escalation to full-scale war could lead to a regional conflict.\n\nWith the Israeli offensive in Gaza now in its ninth month, international criticism has grown steadily over the US's support for Israel's air and ground attacks.\n\nThe top UN court has concluded there is a \"plausible risk of genocide\" in Gaza - a charge Israel strongly denies. Israel blames civilian deaths on Hamas, saying militants operate among the population.\n\nIsraeli airstrikes and clashes between troops and Palestinian militants rocked Gaza on Wednesday, after the IDF's warning it had readied an \"offensive\" against Hezbollah.\n\nWitnesses and the civil defence agency in the Gaza Strip reported Israeli bombardment in western Rafah, where medics said drone strikes and shelling killed at least seven people.", "source": {"uri": "uk.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News UK"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Israel has not commented on the report.\n\n- 'Drastic deterioration' in aid -\n\nThe Israel-Lebanon escalation comes as more than eight months of war have led to dire humanitarian conditions in Gaza and repeated UN warnings of famine.\n\nUN deputy spokesman Farhan Haq told reporters that in recent weeks, there had been \"an improvement\" in aid reaching northern Gaza \"but a drastic deterioration in the south\".\n\nWhile the humanitarian situation remains dire, fighting in the Gaza Strip continued.\n\nIslamic Jihad, a Palestinian armed group that has fought alongside Hamas, said its militants were battling troops amid Israeli shelling of western Rafah.\n\nThe October 7 attack that triggered the war resulted in the deaths of 1,194 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli official figures.\n\nThe militants also seized 251 hostages. Of these, 116 remain in Gaza, although the army says 41 are dead.\n\nIsrael's retaliatory offensive has killed at least 37,396 people in Gaza, also mostly civilians, according to the territory's health ministry.\n\nIn a message on the occasion of the Muslim holiday of Eid al-Adha, US President Joe Biden called for the implementation of a ceasefire plan he outlined last month.\n\nHochstein said the plan would ultimately lead to \"the end of the conflict in Gaza\", which would in turn quell fighting between Israel and Hezbollah.\n\nBut US, Qatari and Egyptian mediation efforts have stalled for months since a one-week truce in November.\n\nA UN report issued Wednesday detailed six \"indiscriminate and disproportionate\" Israeli strikes that killed at least 218 people in the first two months of the war.", "source": {"uri": "al-monitor.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Al-Monitor"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hassan_Nasrallah", "type":

Fire exchanges have intensified since an Israeli airstrike last week killed a senior Hezbollah commander, Taleb Sami Abdullah, along with three other group operatives.\n\nIn a televised speech at the official's memorial service on Wednesday, Hezbollah Secretary General Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah said: \"Israel knows very well that no place will be safe from our missiles and drones\" in the event of a war between the neighboring states, according to comments carried by the Hezbollah-aligned al-Manar TV news outlet.\n\nHe added that Hezbollah has now \"obtained new weapons,\" but did not share any more details. The group often uses rockets, anti-tank missiles and Burkan heavy warhead rockets, which are modeled off the Iranian Ababil drones, according to Seth Frantzman, adjunct fellow at the U.S.-based Foundation for Defense of Democracies think tank.\n\nNasrallah declared that Hezbollah's numbers have now \"far exceeded 100,000 fighters,\" after first saying they'd hit that threshold in 2021, according to the Associated Press. The secretive nature of the group -- which wields considerable political, military and social influence in Lebanon -- makes it challenging to verify the figures. Lebanon's formal military forces are estimated to have around 80,000 personnel, according to data portal IndexMundi.\n\nThe Hezbollah leader also threatened war against the Mediterranean island of Cyprus, if the European Union member permits Israel to launch military operations from its territory. Nasrallah accused Israel of \"conducting maneuvers in preparation for the Lebanon war\" in Cyprus, without disclosing his sources.\n\n\"I say that the Cypriot government must be careful because opening airports for the enemy to attack Lebanon means that Cyprus is part of the war and we will deal with it as part of the war,\" al-Manar quoted Nasrallah as saying, according to a Google translation.\n\nCyprus has denied the accusations, but it has stepped up defense cooperation and participated in joint military exercises with Israel as recently as May 2023.\n\nIn response to Nasrallah, Cyprus' President Nikos Christodoulides on Wednesday stressed that his country is not involved in the conflict and is, in fact, part of the solution, according to the Cyprus News Agency.\n\nCNBC has reached out to the Cypriot Ministry of Foreign Affairs for comment on whether Cypriot sites are used for Israeli military activity.\n\nNasrallah's speech fans the flames of increasingly heated rhetoric over the past week, as the spike in missiles traded between Israel and Lebanon raises concerns of a wider conflict in the Middle East.\n\nEarlier this week, Hezbollah released a video, allegedly captured by its surveillance drones, showing military sites in Israeli port Haifa. In response, the Israel Defense Forces on Tuesday said that \"operational plans for an offensive in Lebanon were approved and validated, and decisions were taken on the continuation of increasing the readiness of troops in the field,\" without detailing the extent of the initiative or whether it would involve troop deployment across the border.\n\nIsraeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz also warned that his country is now \"very close to the moment of decision to change the rules against Hezbollah and Lebanon.\"\n\nThe U.S.' efforts to abate the conflict and gain traction for its peace framework for the Gaza enclave have so far proven futile, with senior White House envoy Amos Hochstein meeting with leaders in Israel and Lebanon earlier this week.", "source": {"uri": "nbcnewyork.com",

The so-called Iron Dome Israel is so proud of for its capability to destroy oncoming projectiles appears to be less effective against Hezbollah's latest weapons.\n\nWhen Hezbollah tells the Middle East's most powerful nation, Israel, \"Come on, hit me,\" it demonstrates its readiness for a fight and its confidence that it could teach the enemy an unforgettable lesson. It is an aggressive challenge.\n\nThe pro-Iranian Hezbollah in Lebanon, Hamas in Palestine, the Houthis in Yemen, and several armed groups in Iraq form the axis of resistance against Israeli expansionism and Western imperialism. Hezbollah's challenge to Israel comes despite its knowledge that Israel is no respecter of international law and international humanitarian laws during war. Hezbollah is also not unaware of Israel's devastating military doctrine known as Dahiya, which does not differentiate between civilian and military targets. The doctrine is so-called after Israel pulverised the Dahieh quarter of Beirut during the 2006 war on Lebanon.\n\nExplaining this doctrine in 2008, General Gadi Eizenkot, commander of the Israeli Defence Force's northern front, had this to say:\n\n\"What happened in the Dahieh quarter of Beirut in 2006 will happen in every village from which shots will be fired in the direction of Israel. We will wield disproportionate power and cause immense damage and destruction. From our perspective, these are military bases. This isn't a suggestion. It's a plan that has already been authorised. Every one of the Shiite villages is a military site, with headquarters, an intelligence centre, and a communications centre. Dozens of rockets are buried in houses, basements, and attics, and the village is run by Hezbollah men. Hezbollah understands well that its fire from within villages will lead to their destruction.\"\n\nIf Hezbollah knows well what the Dahiya doctrine entails, why is this Lebanese David aiming his catapult at the Israeli Goliath?\n\nA brief background is necessary to understand the escalation of the current tension between Israel and Hezbollah. Israel shares its northern border with Lebanon's south, an area dominated by Shiite Muslims, who constitute 32 percent of Lebanon's 5.4 million population. Sunni Muslims make up 31 percent, and Christians -- mostly Maronite -- 30 percent.\n\nHezbollah was founded in 1982 after Israel's invasion and occupation of Lebanon, a 10,452-square-kilometre country. Hezbollah's main goals are resisting Israeli expansionism and Western imperialism and contributing to the social welfare of the Lebanese people. Its continuous resistance forced Israel to end its occupation of Lebanon in 2000 after a 22-year military presence.\n\nBut war broke out between Israel and Hezbollah once again in 2006, when, in a daring attack, Hezbollah killed eight soldiers inside Israel and kidnapped two. South Lebanon was pounded by Israel for 34 days, but Hezbollah successfully countered the attack with weapons supplied by Iran and destroyed an Israeli frigate and several tanks, although the civilians paid a heavy price. More than 1,100 civilians were killed, and South Lebanon's civilian infrastructure, including its residential complexes, was destroyed, but Hezbollah claimed a historic victory when Israel withdrew.\n\nSince then, the popularity and influence of Hezbollah have been on the rise. It is the most powerful member of the Iran-led axis of resistance.\n\nSince Israel began its war on Gaza in response to a Hamas raid into Israel on October 7 last year, Hezbollah, in solidarity with the Palestinian resistance group, has been attacking Northern Israel in an apparent bid to thin out Israeli military resources and weaken its ability to continue the Gaza war. As a result of these Hezbollah attacks, Israel has evacuated some 90,000 settlers from northern Israel. Short of a ground invasion, Israel has been hitting Hezbollah targets, killing senior members.\n\nIn recent weeks, Israel has been surprised by Hezbollah's firepower. The so-called Iron Dome Israel is so proud of for its capability to destroy oncoming projectiles appears to be less effective against Hezbollah's latest weapons. Israel has suffered major fires in its northern territory due to Hezbollah attacks. On Tuesday, in yet another daring act and a huge embarrassment to Israel, Hezbollah posted on social media video footage captured by its spy drones deep inside Israel. The clips showed the Haifa Port and sensitive Israeli sites such as chemical and oil storages. The message Hezbollah tries to deliver to Israel is that its drones can go undetected and unintercepted by the Iron Dome.\n\nIn a major statement and a warning to Israel on Wednesday, Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah vowed to intensify the missile attacks on Israel and said the group has enough manpower and firepower not only to take on Israel but also for an invasion.\n\nThe televised address came days after the death of senior Hezbollah commander Sami Taleb Abullah in an Israeli attack and against the backdrop of a United States special envoy visiting Lebanon to deliver a threat to the Lebanese militia group and Israeli leaders announcing their plan for an all-out war on Lebanon.\n\nRejecting the US special envoy's mission, Nasrallah said the threats and warnings the mediators bring -- and what is being said in the Israeli media -- about a war in Lebanon \"do not scare us.\"\n\nThe US has said it has Israel's back in the event of a full-scale war against Hezbollah and has increased its naval presence in the Mediterranean Sea region. But if a full-scale war breaks out, Yemen's Houthi rebels as well as pro-Iranian militias in Iraq will also join in in support of Hezbollah. Vulnerable to their attacks will be US facilities in the Middle East. Although Iran is unlikely to be drawn in, it certainly won't sit idle.\n\nThe possibility of the war deteriorating into a region-wide conflict cannot be ruled out. In his speech, Nasrallah also threatened to attack Cyprus if it allowed its military facilities to be used by Israel for attacks on Lebanon.\n\nHe warned that Hezbollah's counteroffensive will come with \"no restraint, no rules, and no ceilings.\"\n\n\"The enemy knows well that we have prepared ourselves for the worst... and that no place... will be spared our rockets,\" Nasrallah said.\n\nHe said the only way the impending war could be averted was by bringing an end to Israel's war on Gaza.\n\nOn Tuesday, Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz said the Zionist state was very close to the moment of decision to change the rules against Hezbollah and Lebanon. \"In an all-out war, Hezbollah will be destroyed,\" he wrote in a social media post.\n\nIt needs to be said that the annexation of Lebanon is part of the Zionist plan for Greater Israel, or Eretz Israel.\n\nAt a time when Lebanon is struggling to come out of its worst economic crisis, the last thing it wants is a war. Its economy has been suffering from the impact of the COVID epidemic and the port explosion in 2020, besides the prolonged political instability. The adverse economic consequences of the Gaza war spreading into Lebanon and the wider region are beyond developing nations' power to cushion the impact.\n\nThe way forward is not for Israel to start another war with the full backing of the US, but to end the Gaza war and implement the UN-recognised two-state solution.", "source": {"uri": "dailymirror.lk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily

On Tuesday, the Iran-backed group published what it said was drone footage of sensitive military sites deep in Israeli territory.\n\nIn a televised address on Wednesday, Hezbollah chief Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah said \"there will be no place safe from our missiles and our drones\" in Israel in the event of a broader war.\n\nThe group also had \"a bank of targets\" that it could target in precision strikes, he said.\n\nIsrael \"knows that what also awaits it in the Mediterranean is very big ... In the face of a battle of this magnitude, it knows that it must now wait for us on land, in the air, and at sea,\" Nasrallah added.\n\nIsraeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz had warned on Tuesday that a decision on an all-out war with Hezbollah was coming soon and Israel's military said \"operational plans for an offensive in Lebanon were approved and validated\".\n\nNasrallah also threatened Cyprus - the EU member state in closest proximity to Lebanon, with which it has cordial relations - accusing it of allowing Israel to use its airports and bases for military exercises.\n\n\"The Cypriot government must be warned that opening Cypriot airports and bases for the Israeli enemy to target Lebanon means that the Cypriot government has become part of the war and the resistance (Hezbollah) will deal with it as part of the war,\" Nasrallah said.\n\nCYPRUS DENIES TAKING SIDES\n\nCypriot President Nikos Christodoulides denied any suggestion Cyprus was taking sides in any conflict.\n\n\"It (Cyprus) is not part of the problem, it is part of the solution. That role is evident, for example, through the humanitarian (aid) corridor which has been acknowledged not only by the Arab world, but from the international community,\" he said, referring to shipments of aid from Cyprus to Gaza.\n\nCyprus is not known to offer any land or base facilities to the Israeli military, but has in the past allowed Israel to use its vast airspace - its flight information region - to occasionally conduct air drills, but never during conflict.\n\nSovereign British military bases on Cyprus have been used by Britain for operations in Syria in the past and more recently, Yemen. The Cyprus government has no say in the matter. There are two British bases in Cyprus, which was a colony until 1960.\n\nNasrallah said his group would fight with \"no rules\" and \"no ceilings\" in the event of a broader war. He was speaking at a memorial event for a commander killed in an Israeli strike last week - the most senior Hezbollah figure to be killed so far in the current conflict with Israel.\n\nHezbollah unleashed its largest volleys of drones and rockets at Israel in retaliation. U.N. officials expressed concern at the escalation, and U.S. envoy Amos Hochstein travelled to Israel and Lebanon to urge both sides not to move into a full-scale conflict.\n\nHezbollah first showed it could hit a vessel at sea by striking an Israeli warship in the Mediterranean during their 2006 war.\n\nReports by media and analysts have for years indicated that Hezbollah acquired Russian-made anti-ship Yakhont missiles in Syria, after its forces deployed there more than a decade ago to help President Bashar al-Assad fight the country's civil war.

says Lebanon offensive ready - Khmer Times", "body": "BEIRUT - Hezbollah on Wednesday said none of Israel would be spared in a war, after Israel said it had approved plans for a Lebanon offensive, stoking fears of the Gaza conflict spreading.\n\nHezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah said \"no place\" in Israel would \"be spared our rockets\", in a televised address broadcast amid spiralling tensions across the Israel-Lebanon border.\n\nNasrallah -- whose powerful Iran-backed group has exchanged near-daily fire with Israel since its ally Hamas's October 7 attack -- also threatened the nearby island nation of Cyprus if it opened its airports or bases to Israel \"to target Lebanon\".\n\nThe Mediterranean island is home to two British military bases including an airbase, but they are in sovereign British territory and not controlled by the Cypriot government.\n\nCypriot President Nikos Christodoulides denied his country's involvement in the war and said it was \"part of the solution\", pointing to its role in a maritime humanitarian corridor to Gaza \"recognised by the entire international community\".\n\nMeanwhile, the war between Israel and Hamas raged in Gaza, with Israeli air strikes and clashes between troops and Palestinian militants.\n\nWitnesses and the civil defence agency in the Hamas-run Gaza Strip reported an Israeli bombardment in western Rafah, where medics said drone strikes and shelling killed at least seven people.\n\nAnd medics at the European hospital in Khan Yunis told AFP 10 bodies were brought to the facility after an Israeli air strike killed a group of people on Salah al-Din road, east of Rafah city, as they waited for aid trucks to arrive.\n\nIslamic Jihad, a Palestinian armed group that has fought alongside Hamas, said its militants were battling troops amid Israeli shelling of western Rafah.\n\nThe war has spilled across the region, drawing in a number of Iran-backed groups saying they are acting in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza.\n\nFears that Israel might launch a full-blown war in Lebanon have spiked, with the Israeli military on Tuesday announcing that \"operational plans for an offensive in Lebanon were approved and validated\".\n\nOn Wednesday, Israel said its warplanes had struck Hezbollah sites in southern Lebanon overnight, while reporting a drone had infiltrated near the border town of Metula and targeted troops in an attack claimed by Hezbollah.\n\nHezbollah, meanwhile, announced the death of four of its fighters.\n\nLebanon's official National News Agency reported Israeli strikes on several areas in south Lebanon on Wednesday morning, including on the border village of Khiam, where an AFP photographer saw a large cloud of smoke.\n\nHezbollah later said it had fired \"dozens of Katyusha rockets and artillery rounds\" towards a barracks in Kiryat Shmona in northern Israel in retaliation for the attacks.\n\nIsrael said the Hezbollah attack caused no casualties and that its own \"artillery struck the sources of fire\".\n\nThe day before, the Islamist group released a more than nine-minute video showing aerial footage purportedly taken over northern Israel, including what it said were sensitive military, defence and energy facilities and infrastructure in the city and port of Haifa.\n\nSpeaking on a visit to troops on the northern border, Israel's military chief Lieutenant General Herzi Halevi said it showed \"a capability that we knew about\" and Israel was \"creating solutions to deal with\" it.\n\n\"We of course have infinitely greater capabilities,\" he added.\n\nThe Israeli army's announcement that its plans for an offensive in Lebanon had been approved, along with a warning from Foreign Minister Israel Katz of Hezbollah's destruction in a \"total war\", came as US envoy Amos Hochstein visited the region to push for de-escalation.\n\nHochstein returned to Israel on Tuesday for more talks with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu after a series of meetings in Lebanon, according to officials.", "source": {"uri": "khmertimeskh.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Khmer Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

He asserted that the Shiite group does not seek \"total war\" but is supporting Hamas.\n\nSince October 8, Hezbollah has been launching attacks on northern Israel, prompting Israeli retaliation and escalating tensions, with warnings from Israel about the potential for all-out war.\n\nNasrallah warned that if Israel initiated a large-scale attack on Hezbollah, it should brace for assaults by land, air, and sea, drastically altering the situation in the Mediterranean. He emphasized that \"no place\" in Israel would be beyond the reach of Hezbollah's arsenal in the event of full-scale conflict, pledging to fight with \"no rules\" and \"no ceilings.\" Nasrallah stated, \"The enemy knows well that we have prepared ourselves for the worst... and that no place... will be spared from our rockets.\"\n\nHe added that Israel is aware of significant threats awaiting it in the Mediterranean, possibly alluding to attacks on offshore gas installations.\n\nFor the first time, Nasrallah also targeted Cyprus, accusing it of permitting Israel to use its airports and bases for military operations, warning that Hezbollah might consider it \"a part of the war\" and target it if it continued to support Israeli logistics.\n\n\"Opening Cypriot airports and bases to the Israeli enemy to target Lebanon would mean that the Cypriot government is part of the war, and the resistance will deal with it as part of the war,\" he declared.\n\nCyprus is not known to provide land or base facilities to the Israeli military but has allowed occasional airspace use for Israeli drills. British bases on Cyprus, remnants of its colonial past, have been used for operations in Syria and Yemen, beyond Cypriot government control. According to Hebrew media, British Royal Air Force jets launched from these bases to intercept a massive Iranian drone and missile attack on Israel in mid-April.\n\nFollowing Nasrallah's threats, Cypriot President Nikos Christodoulides clarified that Cyprus is \"in no way involved\" in any military actions in the region, dismissing Nasrallah's remarks as inaccurate. He emphasized that Cyprus aims to be \"part of the solution, not part of the problem,\" highlighting its humanitarian efforts such as the Cyprus-Gaza maritime corridor.\n\nNasrallah claimed that Hezbollah has extensive surveillance footage of sensitive Israeli military targets, including those deep within Israeli territory, uncovered by their drones. He asserted that these targets include well-camouflaged military bases.\n\nIDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi downplayed the significance of the drone footage, stating that the IDF is developing solutions to counter such capabilities and possesses \"infinitely more powerful capabilities\" unknown to Hezbollah.\n\nNasrallah insisted that Israeli military leaders have been aware since October 8 of Hezbollah's capabilities to target critical sites within Israel, citing the Mount Meron air traffic control base as a key target now within Hezbollah's reach.\n\nHe further boasted about Hezbollah's ongoing development and production of new missiles and drones, claiming the group's military resources are at their peak.\n\nHe pointed out that Hezbollah's continuous attacks have forced the IDF to divert resources from Gaza, causing significant economic losses for Israel due to the evacuation of northern towns and disruption of agricultural and industrial activities.\n\nDespite these setbacks, Nasrallah argued that Israeli leaders are downplaying the damage to avoid putting pressure on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, whose main focus remains the conflict with Hamas in Gaza.\n\nHe mocked Israel's claims of having the region's strongest army, noting the IDF's prolonged struggle to dismantle Hamas forces in Rafah despite an extensive ground operation.\n\n\"We will continue to support Gaza and we are ready for anything. We are not afraid. Our demand is clear: A complete and permanent ceasefire in Gaza,\" Nasrallah declared, criticizing the ceasefire proposal from US President Joe Biden to Hamas as insufficient for not ensuring a permanent halt to fighting.\n\nNasrallah accused Netanyahu of refusing a ceasefire and warned that his far-right coalition partners, Itamar Ben Gvir and Betzalel Smotrich, would lead Israel into disaster.\n\nConcluding his speech, Nasrallah addressed the families of deceased Hezbollah fighters and displaced Lebanese citizens, claiming that Hezbollah is engaged in its \"largest battle since 1948\" against Israel.", "source": {"uri": "matzav.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "matzav.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hassan_Nasrallah", "type":

[Reuters]\n\nThe head of Lebanon's Hezbollah said on Wednesday that nowhere in Israel would be safe if a full-fledged war breaks out between the two foes, and he also threatened Cyprus and other parts of the Mediterranean.\n\nHezbollah has been trading fire with Israel for more than eight months in parallel with the Gaza War. On Tuesday, the Iran-backed group published what it said was drone footage of sensitive military sites deep in Israeli territory.\n\nIn a televised address on Wednesday, Hezbollah chief Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah said \"there will be no place safe from our missiles and our drones\" in Israel in the event of a broader war.\n\nThe group also had \"a bank of targets\" that it could target in precision strikes, he said.\n\nIsrael \"knows that what also awaits it in the Mediterranean is very big,\" Nasrallah added, without elaborating.\n\nThe group first showed it could hit a vessel at sea by striking an Israeli warship in the Mediterranean during their 2006 war.\n\nReports by media and analysts have for years indicated that Hezbollah acquired Russian-made anti-ship Yakhont missiles in Syria, after its forces deployed there more than a decade ago to help President Bashar al-Assad fight the country's civil war.\n\nNasrallah also threatened Cyprus for the first time, saying it had been allowing Israel to use its airports and bases for military exercises.\n\n\"The Cypriot government must be warned that opening Cypriot airports and bases for the Israeli enemy to target Lebanon means that the Cypriot government has become part of the war and the resistance [Hezbollah] will deal with it as part of the war,\" Nasrallah said.\n\nCyprus is not known to offer any land or base facilities to the Israeli military, but has in the past allowed Israel to use its vast airspace - its flight information region (FIR) - to occasionally conduct air drills, but never during conflict.\n\nSovereign British military bases have been used for operations in Syria and more recently, Yemen.

On Tuesday, the Iran-backed group published what it said was drone footage of sensitive military sites deep in Israeli territory.\n\nIn a televised address on Wednesday, Hezbollah chief Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah said \"there will be no place safe from our missiles and our drones\" in Israel in the event of a broader war.\n\nThe group also had \"a bank of targets\" that it could target in precision strikes, he said.\n\nIsrael \"knows that what also awaits it in the Mediterranean is very big...In the face of a battle of this magnitude, it knows that it must now wait for us on land, in the air, and at sea,\" Nasrallah added.\n\nThe group first showed it could hit a vessel at sea by striking an Israeli warship in the Mediterranean during their 2006 war.\n\nReports by media and analysts have for years indicated that Hezbollah acquired Russian-made anti-ship Yakhont missiles in Syria, after its forces deployed there more than a decade ago to help President Bashar al-Assad fight the country's civil war.\n\nNasrallah also threatened Cyprus for the first time, accusing it of allowing Israel to use its airports and bases for military exercises.\n\n\"The Cypriot government must be warned that opening Cypriot airports and bases for the Israeli enemy to target Lebanon means that the Cypriot government has become part of the war and the resistance (Hezbollah) will deal with it as part of the war,\" Nasrallah said.\n\nThere was no immediate comment from authorities in Cyprus.\n\nCyprus is not known to offer any land or base facilities to the Israeli military, but has in the past allowed Israel to use its vast airspace - its flight information region (FIR) - to occasionally conduct air drills, but never during conflict.\n\nSovereign British military bases have been used by the United Kingdom for operations in Syria and more recently, Yemen. The Cyprus government has no say in the matter. There are two British bases in Cyprus, which was a colony until 1960.\n\nNasrallah said his group would fight with \"no rules\" and \"no ceilings\" in the event of a broader war. He was speaking at a memorial event for a commander killed in an Israeli strike last week - the most senior Hezbollah figure to be killed so far in the current conflict with Israel.\n\nHezbollah unleashed its largest volleys of drones and rockets at Israel in retaliation. U.N. officials expressed concern at the escalation, and U.S. envoy Amos Hochstein traveled to Israel and Lebanon to urge both sides not to move into a full-scale conflict.\n\nReporting by Laila Bassam

military says Lebanon offensive ready", "body": "Hezbollah on Wednesday said none of Israel would be spared in a war, after Israel said it had approved plans for a Lebanon offensive, stoking fears of the Gaza conflict spreading.\n\nHezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah said \"no place\" in Israel would \"be spared our rockets\", in a televised address broadcast amid spiralling tensions across the Israel-Lebanon border.\n\nNasrallah -- whose powerful Iran-backed group has exchanged near-daily fire with Israel since its ally Hamas's October 7 attack -- also threatened the nearby island nation of Cyprus if it opened its airports or bases to Israel \"to target Lebanon\".\n\nThe Mediterranean island is home to two British military bases including an airbase, but they are in sovereign British territory and not controlled by the Cypriot government.\n\nCypriot President Nikos Christodoulides denied his country's involvement in the war and said it was \"part of the solution\", pointing to its role in a maritime humanitarian corridor to Gaza \"recognised by the entire international community\".\n\nMeanwhile, the war between Israel and Hamas raged in Gaza, with Israeli air strikes and clashes between troops and Palestinian militants.\n\nWitnesses and the civil defence agency in the Hamas-run Gaza Strip reported an Israeli bombardment in western Rafah, where medics said drone strikes and shelling killed at least seven people.\n\nAnd medics at the European hospital in Khan Yunis told AFP 10 bodies were brought to the facility after an Israeli air strike killed a group of people on Salah al-Din road, east of Rafah city, as they waited for aid trucks to arrive.\n\nIslamic Jihad, a Palestinian armed group that has fought alongside Hamas, said its militants were battling troops amid Israeli shelling of western Rafah.\n\nThe war has spilled across the region, drawing in a number of Iran-backed groups saying they are acting in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza.\n\n- 'Greater capabilities' -\n\nFears that Israel might launch a full-blown war in Lebanon have spiked, with the Israeli military on Tuesday announcing that \"operational plans for an offensive in Lebanon were approved and validated\".\n\nOn Wednesday, Israel said its warplanes had struck Hezbollah sites in southern Lebanon overnight, while reporting a drone had infiltrated near the border town of Metula and targeted troops in an attack claimed by Hezbollah.\n\nHezbollah, meanwhile, announced the death of four of its fighters.\n\nLebanon's official National News Agency reported Israeli strikes on several areas in south Lebanon on Wednesday morning, including on the border village of Khiam, where an AFP photographer saw a large cloud of smoke.\n\nHezbollah later said it had fired \"dozens of Katyusha rockets and artillery rounds\" towards a barracks in Kiryat Shmona in northern Israel in retaliation for the attacks.\n\nIsrael said the Hezbollah attack caused no casualties and that its own \"artillery struck the sources of fire\".\n\nThe day before, the Islamist group released a more than nine-minute video showing aerial footage purportedly taken over northern Israel, including what it said were sensitive military, defence and energy facilities and infrastructure in the city and port of Haifa.\n\nSpeaking on a visit to troops on the northern border, Israel's military chief Lieutenant General Herzi Halevi said the video showed \"a capability that we knew about\" and that Israel was \"creating solutions to deal with\" it.\n\n\"We of course have infinitely greater capabilities,\" he added.\n\n- 'Total war' -\n\nThe Israeli army's announcement that its plans for an offensive in Lebanon had been approved, along with a warning from Foreign Minister Israel Katz of Hezbollah's destruction in a \"total war\", came as US envoy Amos Hochstein visited the region to push for de-escalation.\n\nHochstein returned to Israel on Tuesday evening for more talks with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu after a series of meetings in Lebanon, according to an Israeli official.\n\nFormer Israeli security officials were split on the significance of the approval, with one telling AFP there would be an operation in Lebanon \"within a few weeks\" while another said the government was \"more interested in a ceasefire\".\n\nThe cross-border violence has killed at least 478 people in Lebanon, most of them fighters but also including 93 civilians, according to an AFP tally.\n\nIsraeli authorities say at least 15 soldiers and 11 civilians have been killed in the country's north.\n\nSyrian state media said an Israeli strike on military sites in the country's south killed an army officer on Wednesday. Israel has not commented on the report.\n\n- 'Drastic deterioration' in aid -\n\nThe Israel-Lebanon escalation comes as more than eight months of war have led to dire humanitarian conditions in Gaza and repeated UN warnings of famine.\n\nUN deputy spokesman Farhan Haq told reporters that in recent weeks there had been \"an improvement\" in aid reaching northern Gaza \"but a drastic deterioration in the south\".\n\nThe unprecedented October 7 attack by Hamas that triggered the war resulted in the deaths of 1,194 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli official figures.\n\nThe militants also seized 251 hostages. Of these, 116 remain in Gaza, although the army says 41 are dead.\n\nIsrael's retaliatory offensive has killed at least 37,396 people in Gaza, also mostly civilians, according to the territory's health ministry.\n\nA UN report issued on Wednesday detailed six \"indiscriminate and disproportionate\" Israeli strikes that killed at least 218 people in the first two months of the war.\n\nIn a message on the Muslim holiday of Eid al-Adha, US President Joe Biden called for the implementation of a ceasefire plan he outlined last month.\n\nHochstein said the plan would ultimately lead to \"the end of the conflict in Gaza\", which would in turn quell fighting between Israel and Hezbollah.\n\nBut US, Qatari and Egyptian mediation efforts have stalled for months since a one-week truce in November.", "source": {"uri": "zawya.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Zawya.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hassan_Nasrallah", "type": "person", "score": 5,

He pointed to its role in a maritime humanitarian corridor to Gaza.\n\nIsrael's retaliatory offensive in Gaza has killed at least 37,396 people, also mostly civilians, according to the health ministry in the territory.\n\nThe Yemenis and Lebanese both say they are acting in response to Israel's actions in Gaza.\n\nOn Tuesday Israel's military announced that \"operational plans for an offensive in Lebanon were approved and validated\", and Foreign Minister Israel Katz warned of Hezbollah's destruction in a \"total war\". US envoy Amos Hochstein called for \"urgent\" de-escalation.\n\nOn Tuesday Hezbollah published a more than nine-minute video showing drone footage taken by the movement over northern Israel, including parts of the city and port of Haifa. Two former Israeli security officials were split on the prospect of wider conflict.\n\nOne said that there would be an operation in Lebanon \"within a few weeks\" while another said the government was \"more interested in a ceasefire\".\n\nThe cross-border violence has killed at least 478 people in Lebanon, most of them fighters but also 93 civilians. Israeli authorities say at least 15 soldiers and 11 civilians have been killed in the country's north.\n\nTens of thousands have been displaced on the Israeli side of the frontier, and the UN's International Organization for Migration says more than 95,000 have been uprooted in Lebanon. -- AFP", "source": {"uri": "omanobserver.om", "dataType": "news", "title": "Oman Observer"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hezbollah", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hezbollah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebanon", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lebanon"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Lebanon"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rocket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hassan_Nasrallah", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hassan Nasrallah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beirut", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Beirut"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beirut"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Lebanon"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikos_Christodoulides", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nikos Christodoulides"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_Cyprus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "President of Cyprus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarian_aid", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Humanitarian aid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yemen", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Yemen"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Yemen"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyprus", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cyprus"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Cyprus"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Katz", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Israel Katz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_of_Haifa", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Port of Haifa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Foreign_Affairs_(Israel)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Israel)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceasefire", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ceasefire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Organization_for_Migration", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International Organization for Migration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internally_displaced_person", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Internally displaced person"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned_aerial_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Unmanned aerial vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agence_France-Presse", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Agence France-Presse"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History", "label": "dmoz/Society/History", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Strength_Sports/Tug-of-War", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Strength Sports/Tug-of-War", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 65}], "image": "https://www.omanobserver.om/omanobserver/uploads/images/2024/06/20/thumbs/600x600/2697250.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9665510", "eventUri": "eng-9665510", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beirut"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Lebanon"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-10-07", "textStart": 557, "textEnd": 566}], "sentiment": -0.5529411764705883, "wgt": 194, "relevance": 1}

He also threatened Cyprus, indicating the escalating regional tensions. Hezbollah has a background of targeting maritime assets, increasing the stakes in this conflict.\n\nThe head of Lebanon's Hezbollah said on Wednesday that nowhere in Israel would be safe if a full-fledged war breaks out between the two foes, and he also threatened Cyprus and other parts of the Mediterannean.\n\nHezbollah has been trading fire with Israel for more than eight months in parallel with the Gaza War. On Tuesday, the Iran-backed group published what it said was drone footage of sensitive military sites deep in Israeli territory. In a televised address on Wednesday, Hezbollah chief Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah said \"there will be no place safe from our missiles and our drones\" in Israel in the event of a broader war.\n\nThe group also had \"a bank of targets\" that it could target in precision strikes, he said. Israel \"knows that what also awaits it in the Mediterranean is very big,\" Nasrallah added, without elaborating.\n\nThe group first showed it could hit a vessel at sea by striking an Israeli warship in the Mediterranean during their 2006 war. Reports by media and analysts have for years indicated that Hezbollah acquired Russian-made anti-ship Yakhont missiles in Syria, after its forces deployed there more than a decade ago to help President Bashar al-Assad fight the country's civil war.\n\nNasrallah also threatened Cyprus for the first time, saying it had been allowing Israel to use its airports and bases for military exercises. \"The Cypriot government must be warned that opening Cypriot airports and bases for the Israeli enemy to target Lebanon means that the Cypriot government has become part of the war and the resistance (Hezbollah) will deal with it as part of the war,\" Nasrallah said.\n\nCyprus is not known to offer any land or base facilities to the Israeli military, but has in the past allowed Israel to use its vast airspace - its flight information region (FIR) - to occasionally conduct air drills, but never during conflict. Sovereign British military bases have been used for operations in Syria and more recently, Yemen. The Cyprus government has no say in the matter. There are two British bases in Cyprus, which was a colony until 1960.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hassan_Nasrallah", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hassan Nasrallah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hezbollah", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hezbollah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebanon", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lebanon"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Lebanon"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyprus", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cyprus"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Cyprus"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_in_Iraq_(2013\u20132017)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "War in Iraq (2013\u20132017)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediterranean_Sea", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mediterranean Sea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned_aerial_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Unmanned aerial vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missile", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Missile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Warship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akrotiri_and_Dhekelia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Akrotiri and Dhekelia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Lankan_Civil_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sri Lankan Civil War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_exercise", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Military exercise"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_information_region", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Flight information region"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airspace", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Airspace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Israel Defense Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bashar_al-Assad", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bashar al-Assad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yemen", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Yemen"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Yemen"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syria", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Syria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Syria"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History", "label": "dmoz/Society/History", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Genealogy/Military", "label": "dmoz/Society/Genealogy/Military", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Strength_Sports/Tug-of-War", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Strength Sports/Tug-of-War", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 53}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/aiimagegallery/03_06_2024_15_57_16_8214476.png?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9665510", "eventUri": "eng-9665510", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.4666666666666667, "wgt": 193, "relevance": 1}

Cyprus is 'part of the solution, not part of the problem' he said, pointing out the Cyprus-Gaza maritime corridor used to deliver aid to the Palestinian territory.\n\nNasrallah's fiery comments came as the monthslong cross-border conflict simmering between Hezbollah and Israel appears to be reaching a boiling point.\n\nThe nearly 10-minute long video published on Tuesday was the clearest indication of a willingness to escalate the conflict.\n\nThe footage allegedly shows reconnaissance drones flying over Haifa, a city deep in Israel.\n\nHaifa is home to the Port of Haifa, one of Israel's three international seaports. The city also plays host to a well-developed military base, which the footage claims would be a target in an upcoming conflict.\n\nThe footage, which was geolocated to the western side of the port, claims to show, among other military targets, buildings belonging to a submarine unit, logistics and support ships, Dvora-class patrol ships and German-made Sa'ar corvette warships.\n\nSmoke rises as a result of an Israeli air strike in the southern Lebanese town of Khiam,\n\nA fire rages resulting from Israeli military shelling that swept over the fields and reached the houses, in the village of Shebaa, close to the southern Lebanese border with Israel\n\nHezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah delivers a speech via a screen at a memorial ceremony for senior Field Commander, Taleb Sami Abdallah\n\nNasrallah said Hezbollah has much more footage - an apparent threat it could reach sites deep in Israel.\n\nIsrael's military chief, Lieutenant General Herzi Halevi, visited Israeli air-defense soldiers near the border with Lebanon on Wednesday, saying Israel was aware of Hezbollah's capabilities demonstrated in the video and has solutions for these threats.\n\n'We of course have infinitely greater capabilities,' he said. 'I think the enemy is only familiar with a few of them and (we) will confront them at the right time.'\n\nHezbollah, an ally of the Palestinian militant group Hamas, has been exchanging strikes with Israel almost daily since the war in Gaza erupted on Oct. 7, with the aim to pull Israeli forces away from the embattled Gaza Strip.\n\nHezbollah's attacks escalated after Israel expanded its offensive into the southern Gaza city of Rafah in May, and spiked further in June after an Israeli strike killed high-ranking Hezbollah commander Taleb Sami Abdullah, the most senior militant killed so far during the Israel-Hamas war.\n\nAlso Tuesday, the Israeli army said it has 'approved and validated' plans for an offensive in Lebanon, although the decision to actually launch such an operation would have to come from the country's political leadership.\n\nThe warnings by both sides followed a visit by Joe Biden's senior adviser Amos Hochstein, who met with officials in Lebanon and Israel in his latest attempt to deescalate tensions.\n\nHochstein told reporters in Beirut on Tuesday that it was a 'very serious situation' and that a diplomatic solution to prevent a larger war was urgent.\n\nIsrael views Hezbollah as its most direct threat, and the two fought a 34-day war in 2006 that ended in a stalemate.\n\nHezbollah's military capabilities have grown significantly since then, and the United States and Israel estimate the group, along with other Lebanese militant factions, has about 150,000 missiles and rockets. Hezbollah also has been working on precision-guided missiles.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

If needed, Mr. Nasrallah said, Hezbollah could unleash them on \"a bank of targets\" in precision strikes.\n\n\"The enemy knows it must expect us on land, in the air, and at sea,\" he said.\n\nEver since Hezbollah began trading fire with Israeli forces in the wake of the Hamas-led assault on Israel on Oct. 7, over 100 civilians in Israel and Lebanon have been killed, and more than 150,000 have been displaced from their homes.

Hezbollah has stepped up attacks on Israel following the October 7 massacres by Hamas, an allied Iran-sponsored terror group.\n\nNasrallah also threatened the Mediterranean island nation of Cyprus if it supported Israel in case of a military conflict.\n\nThe head of Lebanon's Hezbollah said on Wednesday that nowhere in Israel would be safe if a full-fledged war breaks out between the two foes, and also threatened EU member Cyprus for the first time and other parts of the Mediterranean.\n\nHezbollah has been trading fire with Israel for more than eight months in parallel with the Gaza war. On Tuesday, the Iran-backed group published what it said was drone footage of sensitive military sites deep in Israeli territory.\n\nIn a televised address on Wednesday, Hezbollah chief Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah said \"there will be no place safe from our missiles and our drones\" in Israel in the event of a broader war.\n\nThe group also had \"a bank of targets\" that it could target in precision strikes, he said.\n\nIsrael \"knows that what also awaits it in the Mediterranean is very big ... In the face of a battle of this magnitude, it knows that it must now wait for us on land, in the air, and at sea,\" Nasrallah added.\n\nNasrallah also threatened Cyprus - the EU member state in closest proximity to Lebanon, with which it has cordial relations - accusing it of allowing Israel to use its airports and bases for military exercises.\n\n\"The Cypriot government must be warned that opening Cypriot airports and bases for the Israeli enemy to target Lebanon means that the Cypriot government has become part of the war and the resistance (Hezbollah) will deal with it as part of the war,\" Nasrallah said.\n\nThe Israel Defense Forces (IDF) was mobilizing troops to counter the growing Hezbollah threat along the northern border, IDF Chief of the General Staff, Lt.-Gen. Herzi Halevi assured Wednesday.\n\n\"We are in a state of war for over eight months, and you have defended for over eight months, providing a complex defense,\" the IDF Chief of Staff said. \"This defense gives a great deal of security to civilians and the IDF, but we are not satisfied with that, we have many more soldiers in the IDF who are engaged in an offensive against Hezbollah.\"\n\nIf Hezbollah launched an offensive, it would face advanced military capabilities previously unknown to the terrorist group. \"We of course have infinitely greater capabilities, of which I think the enemy is only familiar with few of them and will confront them at the right time,\" Halevi assured.\n\nAn Israeli airstrike eliminated Hamas's elite terrorist Nukhba commander, who led jihadist fighters into Israel on October 7, the IDF revealed Wednesday.

In the face of a battle of this magnitude, it knows that it must now wait for us on land, in the air, and at sea,\" Nasrallah added.\n\nIsraeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz had warned on Tuesday that a decision on an all-out war with Hezbollah was coming soon and Israel's military said \"operational plans for an offensive in Lebanon were approved and validated\".\n\nNasrallah also threatened Cyprus - the EU member state in closest proximity to Lebanon, with which it has cordial relations - accusing it of allowing Israel to use its airports and bases for military exercises.\n\n\"The Cypriot government must be warned that opening Cypriot airports and bases for the Israeli enemy to target Lebanon means that the Cypriot government has become part of the war and the resistance (Hezbollah) will deal with it as part of the war,\" Nasrallah said.\n\nCypriot President Nikos Christodoulides denied any suggestion Cyprus was taking sides in any conflict.\n\n\"It (Cyprus) is not part of the problem, it is part of the solution. That role is evident, for example, through the humanitarian (aid) corridor which has been acknowledged not only by the Arab world, but from the international community,\" he said, referring to shipments of aid from Cyprus to Gaza.\n\nCyprus is not known to offer any land or base facilities to the Israeli military, but has in the past allowed Israel to use its vast airspace - its flight information region - to occasionally conduct air drills, but never during conflict.\n\nSovereign British military bases on Cyprus have been used by Britain for operations in Syria in the past and more recently, Yemen. The Cyprus government has no say in the matter. There are two British bases in Cyprus, which was a colony until 1960.\n\nNasrallah said his group would fight with \"no rules\" and \"no ceilings\" in the event of a broader war. He was speaking at a memorial event for a commander killed in an Israeli strike last week - the most senior Hezbollah figure to be killed so far in the current conflict with Israel.\n\nHezbollah unleashed its largest volleys of drones and rockets at Israel in retaliation. U.N. officials expressed concern at the escalation, and U.S. envoy Amos Hochstein travelled to Israel and Lebanon to urge both sides not to move into a full-scale conflict.\n\nHezbollah first showed it could hit a vessel at sea by striking an Israeli warship in the Mediterranean during their 2006 war.\n\nReports by media and analysts have for years indicated that Hezbollah acquired Russian-made anti-ship Yakhont missiles in Syria, after its forces deployed there more than a decade ago to help President Bashar al-Assad fight the country's civil war.\n\n(This story has been refiled to fix the

The militant group also hinted at throwing fuel on the fire of conflict between itself and Israel, after publishing chilling footage of its drones scouting targets in the north of its enemy's territory. Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, the militant group's chief, claimed in a televised speech on Wednesday that he is in command of new weapons and intelligence capabilities that could help it target more critical positions deeper inside Israel in case of an all-out war.\n\n'We now have new weapons. But I won't say what they are,' he said in a televised address commemorating a top Hezbollah commander killed in an Israeli airstrike in southern Lebanon last week. 'When the decision is made, they will be seen on the front lines.' He said that if Israel chose to escalate a war with Lebanon, there would be wider regional consequences. He claimed Hezbollah would attack any other country in the region that assisted Israel in the war effort, citing Cyprus, which has hosted Israeli forces for training exercises. He suggested Cyprus might allow Israel to use its bases in the event of a wider war.\n\nIn response, Cypriot President Nikos Christodoulides said his island nation 'is in no way involved' in any military operations in the region. Cyprus is 'part of the solution, not part of the problem' he said, pointing out the Cyprus-Gaza maritime corridor used to deliver aid to the Palestinian territory. Nasrallah's fiery comments came as the months-long cross-border conflict simmering between Hezbollah and Israel appears to be reaching a boiling point. The nearly 10-minute-long video published on Tuesday was the clearest indication of a willingness to escalate the conflict.\n\nThe footage allegedly shows reconnaissance drones flying over Haifa, a city deep in Israel. Haifa is home to the Port of Haifa, one of Israel's three international seaports. The city also plays host to a well-developed military base, which the footage claims would be a target in an upcoming conflict. The footage, which was geolocated to the western side of the port, claims to show, among other military targets, buildings belonging to a submarine unit, logistics and support ships, Dvora-class patrol ships and German-made Sa'ar corvette warships. Nasrallah said Hezbollah has much more footage - an apparent threat it could reach sites deep in Israel.\n\nIsrael's military chief, Lieutenant General Herzi Halevi, visited Israeli air-defense soldiers near the border with Lebanon on Wednesday, saying Israel was aware of Hezbollah's capabilities demonstrated in the video and has solutions for these threats. 'We of course have infinitely greater capabilities,' he said.\n\n'I think the enemy is only familiar with a few of them and (we) will confront them at the right time.' Hezbollah, an ally of the Palestinian militant group Hamas, has been exchanging strikes with Israel almost daily since the war in Gaza erupted on Oct. 7, with the aim to pull Israeli forces away from the embattled Gaza Strip.\n\nHezbollah's attacks escalated after Israel expanded its offensive into the southern Gaza city of Rafah in May, and spiked further in June after an Israeli strike killed high-ranking Hezbollah commander Taleb Sami Abdullah, the most senior militant killed so far during the Israel-Hamas war. Also Tuesday, the Israeli army said it has 'approved and validated' plans for an offensive in Lebanon, although the decision to actually launch such an operation would have to come from the country's political leadership.\n\nThe warnings by both sides followed a visit by Joe Biden's senior adviser Amos Hochstein, who met with officials in Lebanon and Israel in his latest attempt to deescalate tensions. Hochstein told reporters in Beirut on Tuesday that it was a 'very serious situation' and that a diplomatic solution to prevent a larger war was urgent.\n\nIsrael views Hezbollah as its most direct threat, and the two fought a 34-day war in 2006 that ended in a stalemate. Hezbollah's military capabilities have grown significantly since then, and the United States and Israel estimate the group, along with other Lebanese militant factions, has about 150,000 missiles and rockets. Hezbollah also has been working on precision-guided missiles.\n\nWant more stories like this from the Daily Mail?

Most of the fatalities have been fighters but they also include more than 80 civilians and non-combatants. On the Israeli side, 16 soldiers and 11 civilians have been killed over the past eight months.\n\nThe level of threats between Israel and Hezbollah intensified following last week\u00b4s killing by Israel of Hezbollah\u00b4s most senior commander since the fighting began. Hezbollah retaliated by firing hundreds of rockets into northern Israel in retaliation.\n\nHezbollah supporters watch a speech given by Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah on a screen during a ceremony to commemorate the death of senior Hezbollah commander Taleb Sami Abdullah, 55, who was killed last week by an Israeli strike in south Lebanon, in the southern Beirut suburb of Dahiyeh, Lebanon, Wednesday, June 19, 2024. (AP Photo/Bilal Hussein)\n\nCyprus and Lebanon have had close and historic relations for decades and the island became a refuge for thousands of Lebanese who resided on the island during Lebanon\u00b4s 1975-90 civil war. Many Lebanese citizens moved again to Cyprus following the historic economic meltdown in Lebanon that started in late 2019.\n\nIn recent years, Cyprus has enjoyed increasingly tight relations with Israel and the island has hosted joint Israeli-Cypriot military exercises, but has not been involved in any military operations.\n\nNasrallah said his group has information that the Israel\u00b4s military is conducting maneuvers in Cyprus in mountainous areas similar to those of Lebanon adding that they also use Cypriot airports.\n\nHe added that Hezbollah has information that Israel believes that in case an all-out war breaks out, Hezbollah will target its airports and for that reason Israel might use \"in its war against Lebanon Cypriot airports and bases.\"\n\nNasrallah added that when Cyprus President Nikos Christodoulides visited Lebanon recently, Lebanese officials spoke with him about the matter and he denied there were such plans.\n\n\"The Cypriot government should be careful that opening the airports and bases in Cyprus for the Israeli enemy to target Lebanon, means that the Cypriot government has become part of the war,\" Nasrallah said. \"The resistance (Hezbollah) will deal with it (Cyprus) as part of the war.\"\n\nCyprus government spokesman Konstantinos Letymbiotis repeated that any suggestion that Cyprus, either through its infrastructure or territory, would be involved in any military operation in Lebanon is \"totally groundless.\"\n\nNasrallah was criticized by some Lebanese politicians who warned that his comments could harm relations with Cyprus and the European Union.\n\n\"Cyprus was a refuge and welcomed all Lebanese but Nasrallah is insisting that we have no friend left,\" legislator Elias Hankash of the Christian Kataeb Party told Al-Arabiya TV. \"The threat to Europe leaves Lebanon in complete isolation.\"\n\nPeter Stano, a spokesman for the European Union\u00b4s executive arm, said Thursday that any threat against Cyprus is a threat against the bloc\u00b4s 26 other member nations.\n\nLast year, Cyprus said it had disrupted an alleged Iranian plot to target Israeli businessmen with the arrest of two Iranian asylum-seekers who were in contact with another Iranian associated with the Revolutionary Guard.\n\n____\n\nHadjicostis reported from Nicosia, Cyprus.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily

threatens Israel after military says Lebanon offensive ready", "body": "BEIRUT, Lebanon -- Hezbollah on Wednesday said none of Israel would be spared in a war, after Israel said it had approved plans for a Lebanon offensive, stoking fears of the Gaza conflict spreading.\n\nHezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah said \"no place\" in Israel would \"be spared our rockets\", in a televised address broadcast amid spiralling tensions across the Israel-Lebanon border.\n\nNasrallah -- whose powerful Iran-backed group has exchanged near-daily fire with Israel since its ally Hamas's October 7 attack -- also threatened the nearby island nation of Cyprus if it opened its airports or bases to Israel \"to target Lebanon\".\n\nThe Mediterranean island is home to two British military bases including an airbase, but they are in sovereign British territory and not controlled by the Cypriot government.\n\nCypriot President Nikos Christodoulides denied his country's involvement in the war and said it was \"part of the solution\", pointing to its role in a maritime humanitarian corridor to Gaza \"recognised by the entire international community\".\n\nGet the latest news\n\ndelivered to your inbox Sign up for The Manila Times newsletters By signing up with an email address, I acknowledge that I have read and agree to the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy.\n\nMeanwhile, the war between Israel and Hamas raged in Gaza, with Israeli air strikes and clashes between troops and Palestinian militants.\n\nWitnesses and the civil defence agency in the Hamas-run Gaza Strip reported an Israeli bombardment in western Rafah, where medics said drone strikes and shelling killed at least seven people.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd medics at the European hospital in Khan Yunis told AFP 10 bodies were brought to the facility after an Israeli air strike killed a group of people on Salah al-Din road, east of Rafah city, as they waited for aid trucks to arrive.\n\nIslamic Jihad, a Palestinian armed group that has fought alongside Hamas, said its militants were battling troops amid Israeli shelling of western Rafah.\n\nThe war has spilled across the region, drawing in a number of Iran-backed groups saying they are acting in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza.\n\n'Greater capabilities'\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFears that Israel might launch a full-blown war in Lebanon have spiked, with the Israeli military on Tuesday announcing that \"operational plans for an offensive in Lebanon were approved and validated\".\n\nOn Wednesday, Israel said its warplanes had struck Hezbollah sites in southern Lebanon overnight, while reporting a drone had infiltrated near the border town of Metula and targeted troops in an attack claimed by Hezbollah.\n\nHezbollah, meanwhile, announced the death of four of its fighters.\n\nLebanon's official National News Agency reported Israeli strikes on several areas in south Lebanon on Wednesday morning, including on the border village of Khiam, where an AFP photographer saw a large cloud of smoke.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHezbollah later said it had fired \"dozens of Katyusha rockets and artillery rounds\" towards a barracks in Kiryat Shmona in northern Israel in retaliation for the attacks.\n\nIsrael said the Hezbollah attack caused no casualties and that its own \"artillery struck the sources of fire\".\n\nThe day before, the Islamist group released a more than nine-minute video showing aerial footage purportedly taken over northern Israel, including what it said were sensitive military, defence and energy facilities and infrastructure in the city and port of Haifa.\n\nSpeaking on a visit to troops on the northern border, Israel's military chief Lieutenant General Herzi Halevi said the video showed \"a capability that we knew about\" and that Israel was \"creating solutions to deal with\" it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"We of course have infinitely greater capabilities,\" he added.\n\n'Total war'\n\nThe Israeli army's announcement that its plans for an offensive in Lebanon had been approved, along with a warning from Foreign Minister Israel Katz of Hezbollah's destruction in a \"total war\", came as US envoy Amos Hochstein visited the region to push for de-escalation.\n\nHochstein returned to Israel on Tuesday evening for more talks with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu after a series of meetings in Lebanon, according to an Israeli official.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFormer Israeli security officials were split on the significance of the approval, with one telling AFP there would be an operation in Lebanon \"within a few weeks\" while another said the government was \"more interested in a ceasefire\".\n\nThe cross-border violence has killed at least 478 people in Lebanon, most of them fighters but also including 93 civilians, according to an AFP tally.\n\nIsraeli authorities say at least 15 soldiers and 11 civilians have been killed in the country's north.\n\nSyrian state media said an Israeli strike on military sites in the country's south killed an army officer on Wednesday. Israel has not commented on the report.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n'Drastic deterioration' in aid\n\nThe Israel-Lebanon escalation comes as more than eight months of war have led to dire humanitarian conditions in Gaza and repeated UN warnings of famine.\n\nUN deputy spokesman Farhan Haq told reporters that in recent weeks there had been \"an improvement\" in aid reaching northern Gaza \"but a drastic deterioration in the south\".\n\nThe unprecedented October 7 attack by Hamas that triggered the war resulted in the deaths of 1,194 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli official figures.\n\nThe militants also seized 251 hostages. Of these, 116 remain in Gaza, although the army says 41 are dead.\n\nIsrael's retaliatory offensive has killed at least 37,396 people in Gaza, also mostly civilians, according to the territory's health ministry.\n\nA UN report issued on Wednesday detailed six \"indiscriminate and disproportionate\" Israeli strikes that killed at least 218 people in the first two months of the war.\n\nIn a message on the Muslim holiday of Eid al-Adha, US President Joe Biden called for the implementation of a ceasefire plan he outlined last month.\n\nHochstein said the plan would ultimately lead to \"the end of the conflict in Gaza\", which would in turn quell fighting between Israel and Hezbollah.\n\nBut US, Qatari and Egyptian mediation efforts have stalled for months since a one-week truce in November.", "source": {"uri": "manilatimes.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Manila times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "agence_france_presse@manilatimes.net", "name": "Agence France-Presse", "type":

Hundreds of thousands of Israelis have been forced out of their homes in northern Israel because of the continued terror attacks from Hezbollah.\n\nThe Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said this week that it had approved plans for an offensive campaign in Lebanon to take out Hezbollah.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE DAILYWIRE+ APP\n\n\"As part of the situational assessment, operational plans for an offensive in Lebanon were approved and validated, and decisions were taken on the continuation of increasing the readiness of troops in the field,\" the statement said.\n\nIsraeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz warned Nasrallah that the IDF will completely destroy Hezbollah if it launches any kind of \"all-out war.\"\n\n\"Nasrallah boasts today about filming the ports of Haifa, operated by international companies from China and India, and threatens to attack them,\" Katz said. \"We are very close to the moment of decision to change the rules against Hezbollah and Lebanon. In an all-out war, Hezbollah will be destroyed and Lebanon will be severely hit.

By hardly recognizing this reality, Nasrallah's words lose their bite.\"\n\n\"While a war between Israel and Lebanon would undoubtedly have devastating consequences for both countries, it is important to acknowledge that Hezbollah's decision to launch an attack on Israel on October 8 was the catalyst for this precarious situation,\" he continued. \"By initiating hostilities, Hezbollah has set in motion a chain of events that could lead to catastrophic outcomes.\"", "source": {"uri": "dailywire.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Daily Wire"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hassan_Nasrallah", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hassan Nasrallah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hezbollah", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hezbollah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned_aerial_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Unmanned aerial vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebanon", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lebanon"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Lebanon"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Lebanon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Southern Lebanon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Israel Defense Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary-General_of_the_United_Nations", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Secretary-General of the United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Islamic terrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyprus", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cyprus"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Cyprus"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_District_(Israel)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Northern District (Israel)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Northern District (Israel)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Foreign_Affairs_(Israel)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Israel)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rocket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missile", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Missile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haifa", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Haifa"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Haifa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundation_for_Defense_of_Democracies", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Foundation for Defense of Democracies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding/Middle_East", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding/Middle East", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 65}], "image": "https://dw-wp-production.imgix.net/2024/06/Screen-Shot-2024-06-19-at-4.40.05-PM.png?w=1200&h=800&ixlib=react-9.3.0", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9665510", "eventUri": "eng-9665510", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-10-07", "textStart": 220, "textEnd": 229, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "date": "-10-08", "textStart": 3145, "textEnd": 3154}], "sentiment": -0.2784313725490196, "wgt": 190, "relevance": 1}

Israel has not commented on the report.\n\n- 'Drastic deterioration' in aid -\n\nThe Israel-Lebanon escalation comes as more than eight months of war have led to dire humanitarian conditions in Gaza and repeated UN warnings of famine.\n\nUN deputy spokesman Farhan Haq told reporters that in recent weeks, there had been \"an improvement\" in aid reaching northern Gaza \"but a drastic deterioration in the south\".\n\nWhile the humanitarian situation remains dire, fighting in the Gaza Strip continued.\n\nIslamic Jihad, a Palestinian armed group that has fought alongside Hamas, said its militants were battling troops amid Israeli shelling of western Rafah.\n\nThe October 7 attack that triggered the war resulted in the deaths of 1,194 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli official figures.\n\nThe militants also seized 251 hostages. Of these, 116 remain in Gaza, although the army says 41 are dead.\n\nIsrael's retaliatory offensive has killed at least 37,396 people in Gaza, also mostly civilians, according to the territory's health ministry.\n\nIn a message on the occasion of the Muslim holiday of Eid al-Adha, US President Joe Biden called for the implementation of a ceasefire plan he outlined last month.\n\nHochstein said the plan would ultimately lead to \"the end of the conflict in Gaza\", which would in turn quell fighting between Israel and Hezbollah.\n\nBut US, Qatari and Egyptian mediation efforts have stalled for months since a one-week truce in November.\n\nA UN report issued Wednesday detailed six \"indiscriminate and disproportionate\" Israeli strikes that killed at least 218 people in the first

The group has expanded its attacks on Israel since October 7, when Hamas terrorists launched an unprecedented invasion of Israel that resulted in an estimated 1,200 deaths, the abduction of about 250 people, and widespread torture, rape, and other atrocities.\n\nHezbollah has focused on attacking northern Israel, near the border with Lebanon, firing hundreds of rockets, missiles and drones into Israel. Hezbollah has also started widespread fires, forcing Israelis to evacuate.\n\nNasrallah delivered his address on Wednesday at a funeral event for Hezbollah terrorists killed in an Israeli counter-operation, emphasizing claims that Israel is lying about its progress in its war on genocidal jihadists and that Hezbollah, despite its documented losses, is putting on an \"effective\" struggle against the country.\n\n\ud83d\udea8\ud83d\udea8\ud83d\udea8 https://t.co/FhqElE41RN\n\n-- Breitbart News (@BreitbartNews) March 18, 2024\n\n\"The resistance's manpower is unprecedented. We have recruited over 100,000 fighters,\" Nasrallah reportedly claimed, according to the Iranian state propaganda outlet PressTV. \"The enemy knows well that we have prepared ourselves for the worst... and that no place... will be spared our rockets.\"\n\n\"Threatening us with war on Lebanon does not scare us, we have prepared ourselves for the most difficult of days and the enemy knows well what awaits it,\" Nasrallah said.\n\nHezbollah has increased its attack on Israel in June, launching hundreds of rockets during the Jewish holiday of Shavuot (Pentecost) and requiring the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) to place tens of thousands of soldiers on the Lebanese border. This week, the IDF announced that it had approved a plan \"for an offensive in Lebanon\" if necessary in response to continuing Hezbollah attacks.\n\nOn Tuesday, Hezbollah published menacing footage of northern Israel apparently taken by its drones, meant to signal that the terrorists had successfully flown reconnaissance aircraft over major population centers such as Haifa. Nasrallah mentioned the footage in his comments on Wednesday, claiming it was part of \"long hours of footage of Haifa, what's around it, what's before it, what's beyond it and what's even further.\"\n\nElsewhere in the remarks, according to PressTV, Nasrallah praised fellow terrorists organizations, claiming the attacks by the Iran-backed Houthis of Yemen against commercial shipping were successful.\n\n\"The United States and Britain have failed to stop Yemeni attacks. The Zionist enemy, unable to engage in other fronts, relies on US and UK support to confront Yemeni forces,\" he was quoted as saying.\n\nNasrallah also reportedly \"went on to highlight the spiritual gift of martyrdom.\" Rather than respond to the losses by focusing on the one Hezbollah front with Israel on the Lebanese border, Nasrallah threatened to expand the war to the Mediterranean Sea, explicitly threatening the nation of Cyprus.\n\n\"The enemy knows that what also awaits it in the Mediterranean Sea is very huge, seeing as all its coasts and ships will be targeted,\" Nasrallah was quoted as saying.\n\nNasrallah threatened the Cypriot government in response to its friendly relationship with the United States and growing ties to Israel.\n\n\"Opening Cypriot airports and bases to the Israeli enemy to target Lebanon would mean that the Cypriot government is part of the war,\" Nasrallah said, \"and the resistance will deal with it as part of the war.\"\n\nThe regional news outlet Middle East Eye noted, citing experts, that the threat was unprecedented against the Mediterranean nation and appeared to be in response to Cypriot Foreign Minister Constantinos Kombos meeting with American Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Monday. In a message posted to his social media account, Blinken framed the meeting as a discussion on helping \"get essential aid to Gaza,\" the Hamas-controlled territory where most of Israel's operations against the jihadists are currently ongoing.\n\nMiddle East Eye noted that Cyprus has expanded \"energy cooperation\" with Israel and welcomed \"an influx of Israeli real estate investment in recent years, ironically, along with renewed interest from Lebanese investors.\"\n\nThe Times of Israel noted in its reporting on Nasrallah's speech that Cyprus is also home to two British bases, helping the U.K. conduct military operations in the region, but \"is not known to offer any land or base facilities to the Israeli military.\"\n\nThe president of Cyprus, Nikos Christodoulides, insisted in response to Nasrallah that his country is \"part of the solution, not part of the problem\" and that Cyprus is \"in no way involved\" in military operations.", "source": {"uri": "breitbart.com",

Israel has still not achieved the two primary objectives Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu put forth at the start of the conflict:\n\nthe destruction of Hamas as a military and governing entity in Gaza the freeing of the remaining Israeli hostages held by Hamas (about 80 believed to still be alive, along with the remains of about 40 believed to be dead).\n\nWhy Hezbollah is attacking Israel now\n\nIsrael has cogent reasons for wanting to eliminate the threat from Hezbollah. Hezbollah has been launching Iranian-supplied missiles, rockets and drones across the border into northern Israel since the Gaza war began on October 8. Its stated purpose is to support Hamas by distracting the IDF from its Gaza operation.\n\nHezbollah's attacks have been relatively circumscribed - confined so far to northern Israel. But they have led to the displacement of some 60,000 residents from the border area. These people are understandably fed up and demanding Netanyahu's government takes action to force Hezbollah to withdraw from the border.\n\nThis anger has been augmented this week by Hezbollah publicising video footage of military and civilian sites in the northern Israeli city of Haifa, which had been taken by a low-flying surveillance drone.\n\nThe implication: Hezbollah was scoping the region for new targets. Haifa, a city of nearly 300,000, has not yet been subject to Hezbollah attacks.\n\nThe most far-right members of Netanyahu's cabinet, Bezalel Smotrich and Itamar Ben Gvir, have openly called for Israel to invade southern Lebanon. Even without this pressure, Netanyahu has ample reason to want to neutralise the Hezbollah threat because residents of northern Israel are strong supporters of his Likud party.\n\nUS and Iranian interests in a broader conflict\n\nThe United States is obviously concerned about the risk Israel will open a second front in its conflicts. As such, President Joe Biden has sent an envoy, Amos Hochstein, to Israel and Lebanon to try to reduce tensions on both sides.\n\nIn Lebanon, he can't publicly deal directly with the Hezbollah leader, Hassan Nasrallah, because the group is on the US list of global terrorist organisations. Instead, he met the long-serving speaker of the Lebanese parliament, Nabih Berri, who as a fellow Shia is able to talk with Nasrallah.\n\nBut Hezbollah answers to Iran - its main backer in the region. And it's doubtful if any Lebanese leader can persuade it to desist from action approved by Iran.\n\nIran's interests in the potential for an Israel-Hezbollah war at this time are mixed. It would obviously be glad to see Israel under military pressure on two fronts. But Iranian leaders see Hezbollah as insurance against an Israeli attack on its nuclear facilities.\n\nHezbollah has an estimated 150,000 missiles and rockets, including some that could reach deep into Israel. So far, Iran seems to want Hezbollah to hold back from a major escalation with Israel, which could deplete most of that arsenal.\n\nThat said, although Israel's Iron Dome defensive shield has been remarkably successful in neutralising the rocket threat from Gaza, it might not be as effective against a large-scale barrage of more sophisticated missiles.\n\nIsrael needed help from the US, Britain, France and Jordan in countering a direct attack from Iran in April that involved some 150 missiles and 170 drones.\n\nLessons from previous Israeli interventions in Lebanon\n\nThe other factor - especially for wiser heads mindful of history - is the country's previous interventions in Lebanon have been far from cost-free.\n\nIsrael's problems with Lebanon started when the late King Hussein of Jordan forced the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO), then led by Yasser Arafat, to relocate to Lebanon in 1970. He did that because the PLO had been using Jordan as a base for operations against Israel after the 1967 war, provoking Israeli retaliation.\n\nFrom the early 1970s, the PLO formed a state within a state in Lebanon. It largely acted independently from the perennially weak Lebanese government, which was divided on sectarian grounds, and in 1975, collapsed into a prolonged civil war.\n\nThe PLO used southern Lebanon to launch attacks against Israel, leading Israel to launch a limited invasion of its northern neighbour in 1978, driving Palestinian militia groups north of the Litani River.\n\nThat invasion was only partially successful. Militants soon moved back towards the border and renewed their attacks on northern Israel. In 1982, then-Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin decided to remove the PLO entirely from Lebanon, launching a major invasion of Lebanon all the way to Beirut. This eventually forced the PLO leadership and the bulk of its fighters to relocate to Tunisia.\n\nDespite this success, the two Israeli invasions had the unintended consequence of radicalising the until-then quiescent Shia population of southern Lebanon.\n\nThat enabled Iran, in its early post-revolutionary phase under Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, to work with Shia clerics in Lebanon to establish Hezbollah (Party of God in Arabic), which became a greater threat to Israel than the PLO had ever been.\n\nBolstered by Iranian support, Hezbollah has become stronger over the years, becoming a force in Lebanese politics and regularly firing missiles into Israel.\n\nIn 2006, Hezbollah was able to block an IDF advance into southern Lebanon aimed at rescuing two Israeli soldiers Hezbollah had captured. The outcome was essentially a draw, and the two soldiers remained in captivity until their bodies were exchanged for Lebanese prisoners in 2008.\n\nMany Arab observers at the time judged that by surviving an asymmetrical conflict, Hezbollah had emerged with a political and military victory.\n\nFor a while during and after that conflict, Nasrallah was one of the most popular regional leaders, despite the fact he was loathed by rulers of conservative Sunni Arab states such as Saudi Arabia.\n\nWill history repeat itself?\n\nThis is the background to discussions in Israel about launching a war against Hezbollah. And it demonstrates how the quote from Churchill is relevant.\n\nMost military experts would caution against choosing to fight a war on two fronts. Former US President George W. Bush decided to invade Iraq in 2003 when the war in Afghanistan had not concluded. The outcome was hugely costly for the US military and disastrous for both countries.\n\nThe 19th century American writer Mark Twain is reported to have said that history does not repeat itself, but it often rhymes. Will Israel's leaders listen to the echoes of the past?", "source": {"uri": "theconversation.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Conversation"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Others, including US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, have also pointed to the difficulty of destroying the Islamist group.\n\nHezbollah and Israeli forces have exchanged near-daily fire since Hamas's 7 October attack on southern Israel triggered the Gaza war, and aggression has lately escalated along with the strikes.\n\nIn a televised address, the secretary-general of Hezbollah Hassan Nasrallah said \"no place\" in Israel would \"be spared our rockets\" if war began.\n\nThe chief of the Iran-backed group also threatened the nearby island nation of Cyprus if it opened its airports or bases to Israel \"to target Lebanon\".\n\nEuropean Union member Cyprus is home to two British bases, including an airbase, but they are in sovereign British territory and not controlled by the Cypriot government.\n\nThe Cypriot government spokesman today dismissed as \"totally groundless\" any suggestion of possible involvement in a conflict related to Lebanon.\n\n\"Cyprus is not involved, nor will it become involved, in any military conflicts,\" Konstantinos Letymbiotis told state radio.\n\nWarplanes from the British airbase in Cyprus have, along with US forces, carried out reprisal strikes against Yemen's Iran-backed Houthi rebels who have for months been attacking shipping in adjacent waterways.\n\n'Urgent' de-escalation\n\nThe US military yesterday said its forces destroyed two Houthi sites in Yemen.\n\nThe Houthis and Hezbollah both say they are acting in response to Israel's actions in Gaza.\n\nOn Tuesday, Israel's military announced that \"operational plans for an offensive in Lebanon were approved and validated\".\n\nThe same day, Hezbollah published a video showing drone footage purportedly taken by the movement over northern Israel, including parts of Haifa's city and port.\n\nUS envoy Amos Hochstein has called for \"urgent\" de-escalation.\n\nThe cross-border violence has killed at least 479 people in Lebanon, most of them fighters but also 93 civilians, according to an AFP tally.\n\nIsraeli authorities say at least 15 soldiers and 11 civilians have been killed in the country's north.\n\nWeary residents of Beirut on Thursday downplayed the chances of war in Lebanon, which a political deadlock has left essentially leaderless while a five-year economic meltdown continues.\n\nIn Israel, some citizens called for action against Hezbollah, and Noam Galili, 29, said: \"I know what it is like to live close to Lebanon, but it never felt as dangerous as it does now.\"\n\nPressures\n\nThe violence has already displaced tens of thousands of people, mostly in Lebanon but also in northern Israel.\n\nIn southern Gaza, a United Nations mission found hundreds of thousands of displaced people \"suffer from poor access to shelter, health, food, water and sanitation,\" a UN report said.\n\nIn central Gaza, residents said they had turned to cooking oil to power their cars.\n\nUS President Joe Biden has called for the implementation of a ceasefire plan he outlined last month.\n\nAmos Hochstein and Washington's top diplomat, Antony Blinken, say a deal to curb fighting in Gaza would by extension help resolve the Hezbollah-Israel violence.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's far-right coalition partners strongly oppose a Gaza ceasefire.\n\nHe is also facing regular street protests by tens of thousands demanding a deal to free the hostages, and accusing him of prolonging the war.\n\nThe Israeli military spokesman, Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari, told Israel's Channel 13: \"To say that we are going to make Hamas disappear is to throw sand in people's eyes.

Israel has still not achieved the two primary objectives Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu put forth at the start of the conflict:\n\nthe destruction of Hamas as a military and governing entity in Gazathe freeing of the remaining Israeli hostages held by Hamas (about 80 believed to still be alive, along with the remains of about 40 believed to be dead). Why Hezbollah is attacking Israel now\n\nIsrael has cogent reasons for wanting to eliminate the threat from Hezbollah. Hezbollah has been launching Iranian-supplied missiles, rockets and drones across the border into northern Israel since the Gaza war began on October 8. Its stated purpose is to support Hamas by distracting the IDF from its Gaza operation.\n\nHezbollah's attacks have been relatively circumscribed - confined so far to northern Israel. But they have led to the displacement of some 60,000 residents from the border area. These people are understandably fed up and demanding Netanyahu's government takes action to force Hezbollah to withdraw from the border.\n\nThis anger has been augmented this week by Hezbollah publicising video footage of military and civilian sites in the northern Israeli city of Haifa, which had been taken by a low-flying surveillance drone.\n\nThe implication: Hezbollah was scoping the region for new targets. Haifa, a city of nearly 300,000, has not yet been subject to Hezbollah attacks.\n\nThe most far-right members of Netanyahu's cabinet, Bezalel Smotrich and Itamar Ben Gvir, have openly called for Israel to invade southern Lebanon. Even without this pressure, Netanyahu has ample reason to want to neutralise the Hezbollah threat because residents of northern Israel are strong supporters of his Likud party.\n\nUS and Iranian interests in a broader conflict\n\nThe United States is obviously concerned about the risk Israel will open a second front in its conflicts. As such, President Joe Biden has sent an envoy, Amos Hochstein, to Israel and Lebanon to try to reduce tensions on both sides.\n\nIn Lebanon, he can't publicly deal directly with the Hezbollah leader, Hassan Nasrallah, because the group is on the US list of global terrorist organisations. Instead, he met the long-serving speaker of the Lebanese parliament, Nabih Berri, who as a fellow Shia is able to talk with Nasrallah.\n\nBut Hezbollah answers to Iran - its main backer in the region. And it's doubtful if any Lebanese leader can persuade it to desist from action approved by Iran.\n\nIran's interests in the potential for an Israel-Hezbollah war at this time are mixed. It would obviously be glad to see Israel under military pressure on two fronts. But Iranian leaders see Hezbollah as insurance against an Israeli attack on its nuclear facilities.\n\nHezbollah has an estimated 150,000 missiles and rockets, including some that could reach deep into Israel. So far, Iran seems to want Hezbollah to hold back from a major escalation with Israel, which could deplete most of that arsenal.\n\nThat said, although Israel's Iron Dome defensive shield has been remarkably successful in neutralising the rocket threat from Gaza, it might not be as effective against a large-scale barrage of more sophisticated missiles.\n\nIsrael needed help from the US, Britain, France and Jordan in countering a direct attack from Iran in April that involved some 150 missiles and 170 drones.\n\nLessons from previous Israeli interventions in Lebanon\n\nThe other factor - especially for wiser heads mindful of history - is the country's previous interventions in Lebanon have been far from cost-free.\n\nIsrael's problems with Lebanon started when the late King Hussein of Jordan forced the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO), then led by Yasser Arafat, to relocate to Lebanon in 1970. He did that because the PLO had been using Jordan as a base for operations against Israel after the 1967 war, provoking Israeli retaliation.\n\nFrom the early 1970s, the PLO formed a state within a state in Lebanon. It largely acted independently from the perennially weak Lebanese government, which was divided on sectarian grounds, and in 1975, collapsed into a prolonged civil war.\n\nThe PLO used southern Lebanon to launch attacks against Israel, leading Israel to launch a limited invasion of its northern neighbour in 1978, driving Palestinian militia groups north of the Litani River.\n\nThat invasion was only partially successful. Militants soon moved back towards the border and renewed their attacks on northern Israel. In 1982, then-Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin decided to remove the PLO entirely from Lebanon, launching a major invasion of Lebanon all the way to Beirut. This eventually forced the PLO leadership and the bulk of its fighters to relocate to Tunisia.\n\nDespite this success, the two Israeli invasions had the unintended consequence of radicalising the until-then quiescent Shia population of southern Lebanon.\n\nThat enabled Iran, in its early post-revolutionary phase under Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, to work with Shia clerics in Lebanon to establish Hezbollah (Party of God in Arabic), which became a greater threat to Israel than the PLO had ever been.\n\nBolstered by Iranian support, Hezbollah has become stronger over the years, becoming a force in Lebanese politics and regularly firing missiles into Israel.\n\nIn 2006, Hezbollah was able to block an IDF advance into southern Lebanon aimed at rescuing two Israeli soldiers Hezbollah had captured. The outcome was essentially a draw, and the two soldiers remained in captivity until their bodies were exchanged for Lebanese prisoners in 2008.\n\nMany Arab observers at the time judged that by surviving an asymmetrical conflict, Hezbollah had emerged with a political and military victory.\n\nFor a while during and after that conflict, Nasrallah was one of the most popular regional leaders, despite the fact he was loathed by rulers of conservative Sunni Arab states such as Saudi Arabia.\n\nWill history repeat itself?\n\nThis is the background to discussions in Israel about launching a war against Hezbollah. And it demonstrates how the quote from Churchill is relevant.\n\nMost military experts would caution against choosing to fight a war on two fronts. Former US President George W. Bush decided to invade Iraq in 2003 when the war in Afghanistan had not concluded. The outcome was hugely costly for the US military and disastrous for both countries.\n\nThe 19th century American writer Mark Twain is reported to have said that history does not repeat itself, but it often rhymes. Will Israel's leaders listen to the echoes of the past?\n\nIan Parmeter does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organisation that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.\n\n/Courtesy of The Conversation.

Others, including US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, have also pointed to the difficulty of destroying the Islamist group.\n\nAlso read Israel hits Gaza as tensions surge on Lebanon border US wants to avoid 'greater war' along Lebanon-Israel border, envoy says US envoy in Israel in bid to calm situation with Hezbollah Fighting in Gaza's Rafah as tensions soar on Israel-Lebanon border\n\nHezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah's group and Israeli forces have exchanged near-daily fire since Hamas's October 7 attack on southern Israel triggered the Gaza war, and the bellicose talk has lately escalated along with the strikes.\n\nIn a televised address, Nasrallah said \"no place\" in Israel would \"be spared our rockets\" if war began.\n\nThe chief of the Iran-backed group also threatened the nearby island nation of Cyprus if it opened its airports or bases to Israel \"to target Lebanon\".\n\nEuropean Union member Cyprus is home to two British bases, including an airbase, but they are in sovereign British territory and not controlled by the Cypriot government.\n\nOn Thursday the Cypriot government spokesman dismissed as \"totally groundless\" any suggestion of possible involvement in a conflict related to Lebanon.\n\n\"Cyprus is not involved, nor will it become involved, in any military conflicts,\" Konstantinos Letymbiotis told state radio.\n\nWarplanes from the British airbase in Cyprus have, along with US forces, carried out reprisal strikes against Yemen's Iran-backed Huthi rebels who have for months been attacking shipping in adjacent waterways.\n\n'Urgent' de-escalation\n\nOn Wednesday the US military said its forces destroyed two Houthi sites in Yemen.\n\nThe October Hamas attack on Israel resulted in the deaths of 1,194 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli official figures.\n\nThe militants also seized hostages, 116 of whom remain in Gaza although the army says 41 are dead.\n\nIsrael's retaliatory offensive in Gaza has killed at least 37,431 people, also mostly civilians, according to the health ministry in the Hamas-ruled territory.\n\nThe latest toll on Thursday included at least 35 deaths over the previous day, the ministry said.\n\nThe Huthis and Hezbollah both say they are acting in response to Israel's actions in Gaza.\n\nOn Tuesday, Israel's military announced that \"operational plans for an offensive in Lebanon were approved and validated\".\n\nThe same day, Hezbollah published a video showing drone footage purportedly taken by the movement over northern Israel, including parts of Haifa's city and port.\n\nUS envoy Amos Hochstein has called for \"urgent\" de-escalation.\n\nThe cross-border violence has killed at least 479 people in Lebanon, most of them fighters but also 93 civilians, according to an AFP tally.\n\nIsraeli authorities say at least 15 soldiers and 11 civilians have been killed in the country's north.\n\nWeary residents of Beirut on Thursday downplayed the chances of war in Lebanon, which a political deadlock has left essentially leaderless while a five-year economic meltdown continues.\n\nIn Israel, some citizens called for action against Hezbollah, and Noam Galili, 29, said: \"I know what it is like to live close to Lebanon, but it never felt as dangerous as it does now.\"\n\nPressures\n\nThe violence has already displaced tens of thousands of people, mostly in Lebanon but also in northern Israel.\n\nIn southern Gaza, a United Nations mission found hundreds of thousands of displaced people \"suffer from poor access to shelter, health, food, water and sanitation,\" a UN report said late Wednesday.\n\nIn central Gaza, residents said they had turned to cooking oil to power their cars.\n\nUS President Joe Biden has called for the implementation of a ceasefire plan he outlined last month.\n\nHochstein and Washington's top diplomat, Blinken, say a deal to curb fighting in Gaza would by extension help resolve the Hezbollah-Israel violence.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's far-right coalition partners strongly oppose a Gaza ceasefire.\n\nHe is also facing regular street protests by tens of thousands demanding a deal to free the hostages, and accusing him of prolonging the war.\n\nThe Israeli military spokesman, Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari, on Wednesday told Israel's Channel 13: \"To say that we are going to make Hamas disappear is to throw sand in people's eyes. If we don't provide an alternative, in the end, we will have Hamas.\"\n\nHe said, \"Hamas is an ideology. We cannot eliminate an ideology.\"\n\nIsraeli government spokesman David Mencer said Thursday Hamas's \"final stronghold\" in Rafah on the border with Egypt is systematically being taken

Israel has still not achieved the two primary objectives Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu put forth at the start of the conflict:\n\nIsrael has cogent reasons for wanting to eliminate the threat from Hezbollah. Hezbollah has been launching Iranian-supplied missiles, rockets and drones across the border into northern Israel since the Gaza war began on October 8. Its stated purpose is to support Hamas by distracting the IDF from its Gaza operation.\n\nHezbollah's attacks have been relatively circumscribed - confined so far to northern Israel. But they have led to the displacement of some 60,000 residents from the border area. These people are understandably fed up and demanding Netanyahu's government takes action to force Hezbollah to withdraw from the border.\n\nThis anger has been augmented this week by Hezbollah publicising video footage of military and civilian sites in the northern Israeli city of Haifa, which had been taken by a low-flying surveillance drone.\n\nThe implication: Hezbollah was scoping the region for new targets. Haifa, a city of nearly 300,000, has not yet been subject to Hezbollah attacks.\n\nThe most far-right members of Netanyahu's cabinet, Bezalel Smotrich and Itamar Ben Gvir, have openly called for Israel to invade southern Lebanon. Even without this pressure, Netanyahu has ample reason to want to neutralise the Hezbollah threat because residents of northern Israel are strong supporters of his Likud party.\n\nThe United States is obviously concerned about the risk Israel will open a second front in its conflicts. As such, President Joe Biden has sent an envoy, Amos Hochstein, to Israel and Lebanon to try to reduce tensions on both sides.\n\nIn Lebanon, he can't publicly deal directly with the Hezbollah leader, Hassan Nasrallah, because the group is on the US list of global terrorist organisations. Instead, he met the long-serving speaker of the Lebanese parliament, Nabih Berri, who as a fellow Shia is able to talk with Nasrallah.\n\nBut Hezbollah answers to Iran - its main backer in the region. And it's doubtful if any Lebanese leader can persuade it to desist from action approved by Iran.\n\nIran's interests in the potential for an Israel-Hezbollah war at this time are mixed. It would obviously be glad to see Israel under military pressure on two fronts. But Iranian leaders see Hezbollah as insurance against an Israeli attack on its nuclear facilities.\n\nHezbollah has an estimated 150,000 missiles and rockets, including some that could reach deep into Israel. So far, Iran seems to want Hezbollah to hold back from a major escalation with Israel, which could deplete most of that arsenal.\n\nThat said, although Israel's Iron Dome defensive shield has been remarkably successful in neutralising the rocket threat from Gaza, it might not be as effective against a large-scale barrage of more sophisticated missiles.\n\nIsrael needed help from the US, Britain, France and Jordan in countering a direct attack from Iran in April that involved some 150 missiles and 170 drones.\n\nThe other factor - especially for wiser heads mindful of history - is the country's previous interventions in Lebanon have been far from cost-free.\n\nIsrael's problems with Lebanon started when the late King Hussein of Jordan forced the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO), then led by Yasser Arafat, to relocate to Lebanon in 1970. He did that because the PLO had been using Jordan as a base for operations against Israel after the 1967 war, provoking Israeli retaliation.\n\nFrom the early 1970s, the PLO formed a state within a state in Lebanon. It largely acted independently from the perennially weak Lebanese government, which was divided on sectarian grounds, and in 1975, collapsed into a prolonged civil war.\n\nThe PLO used southern Lebanon to launch attacks against Israel, leading Israel to launch a limited invasion of its northern neighbour in 1978, driving Palestinian militia groups north of the Litani River.\n\nThat invasion was only partially successful. Militants soon moved back towards the border and renewed their attacks on northern Israel. In 1982, then-Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin decided to remove the PLO entirely from Lebanon, launching a major invasion of Lebanon all the way to Beirut. This eventually forced the PLO leadership and the bulk of its fighters to relocate to Tunisia.\n\nDespite this success, the two Israeli invasions had the unintended consequence of radicalising the until-then quiescent Shia population of southern Lebanon.\n\nThat enabled Iran, in its early post-revolutionary phase under Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, to work with Shia clerics in Lebanon to establish Hezbollah (Party of God in Arabic), which became a greater threat to Israel than the PLO had ever been.\n\nBolstered by Iranian support, Hezbollah has become stronger over the years, becoming a force in Lebanese politics and regularly firing missiles into Israel.\n\nIn 2006, Hezbollah was able to block an IDF advance into southern Lebanon aimed at rescuing two Israeli soldiers Hezbollah had captured. The outcome was essentially a draw, and the two soldiers remained in captivity until their bodies were exchanged for Lebanese prisoners in 2008.\n\nMany Arab observers at the time judged that by surviving an asymmetrical conflict, Hezbollah had emerged with a political and military victory.\n\nFor a while during and after that conflict, Nasrallah was one of the most popular regional leaders, despite the fact he was loathed by rulers of conservative Sunni Arab states such as Saudi Arabia.\n\nThis is the background to discussions in Israel about launching a war against Hezbollah. And it demonstrates how the quote from Churchill is relevant.\n\nMost military experts would caution against choosing to fight a war on two fronts. Former US President George W. Bush decided to invade Iraq in 2003 when the war in Afghanistan had not concluded. The outcome was hugely costly for the US military and disastrous for both countries.\n\nThe 19th century American writer Mark Twain is reported to have said that history does not repeat itself, but it often rhymes. Will Israel's leaders listen to the echoes of the past?\n\nIan Parmeter does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organisation that would benefit from this

The Zionist enemy, unable to engage in other fronts, relies on US and UK support to confront Yemeni forces.\n\n\"Israeli officials are trying to paint a distorted picture of unfolding developments in Gaza in order to mislead the public opinion and falsely claim to have made achievements,\" Nasrallah said, according to Press TV.\n\nHe stated that Hezbollah is in possession of a large cache of advanced weapons, and that the resistance movement is manufacturing its own combat drones as well as some types of rockets.\n\n\"The resistance's manpower is unprecedented. We have recruited over 100,000 fighters,\" the Hezbollah leader said, warning that \"no place\" in the Israeli-occupied territories would be spared from the group's weapons in case of a full-blown war.\n\n\"The enemy knows well that we have prepared ourselves for the worst... and that no place... will be spared our rockets,\" Nasrallah said.\n\nIsrael must \"wait for us on land, by sea and by air,\" he added, warning that Hezbollah will fight \"without restrictions.\"\n\n\"The enemy knows that what also awaits it in the Mediterranean Sea is very huge, seeing as all its coasts and ships will be targeted,\" he went on to say.\n\n\"Threatening us with war on Lebanon does not scare us, we have prepared ourselves for the most difficult of days and the enemy knows well what awaits it,\" Nasrallah said.\n\nThe Hezbollah chief also warned the island of Cyprus if it opened its airports and bases to Israel in the event of a new war on Lebanon.\n\n\"Opening Cypriot airports and bases to the Israeli enemy to target Lebanon would mean that the Cypriot government is part of the war, and the resistance will deal with it as part of the war,\" Nasrallah stated.", "source": {"uri":

Others, including US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, have also pointed to the difficulty of destroying the Islamist group.\n\nIn a televised address, Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah said \"no place\" in Israel would \"be spared our rockets\" if war began.\n\nNasrallah's Iran-backed group has exchanged near-daily fire with Israel since Hamas's October 7 attack on southern Israel, but the fire from Hezbollah rockets, Israeli warplanes and other weapons has escalated in the past few weeks.\n\nThe Hezbollah chief also threatened the nearby island nation of Cyprus if it opened its airports or bases to Israel \"to target Lebanon\".\n\nCyprus, a European Union member, is home to two British bases, including an airbase, but they are in sovereign British territory and not controlled by the Cypriot government.\n\nCypriot President Nikos Christodoulides denied his country's involvement in the war and said it was \"part of the solution\". He pointed to its role in a maritime humanitarian corridor to Gaza.\n\nWarplanes from the British airbase in Cyprus have, along with United States forces, carried out reprisal strikes against Yemen's Iran-backed Huthi rebels who have for months been attacking shipping in nearby waterways.\n\n- Hundreds killed -\n\nOn Wednesday the US military said its forces destroyed two Huthi sites in Yemen.\n\nThe unprecedented October 7 attack by Hamas that triggered the Gaza war resulted in the deaths of 1,194 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli official figures.\n\nThe militants also seized hostages, 116 of whom remain in Gaza although the army says 41 are dead.\n\nIsrael's retaliatory offensive in Gaza has killed at least 37,396 people, also mostly civilians, according to the health ministry in the Hamas-ruled territory.\n\nThe Huthis and Hezbollah both say they are acting in response to Israel's actions in Gaza.\n\nOn Tuesday Israel's military announced that \"operational plans for an offensive in Lebanon were approved and validated\", and Foreign Minister Israel Katz warned of Hezbollah's destruction in a \"total war\".\n\nUS envoy Amos Hochstein called for \"urgent\" de-escalation.\n\nOn Tuesday Hezbollah published a more than nine-minute video showing drone footage purportedly taken by the movement over northern Israel, including parts of the city and port of Haifa.\n\nTwo former Israeli security officials were split on the prospect of wider conflict.\n\nOne told AFP there would be an operation in Lebanon \"within a few weeks\" while another said the government was \"more interested in a ceasefire\".\n\nThe cross-border violence has killed at least 478 people in Lebanon, most of them fighters but also 93 civilians, according to an AFP tally.\n\nIsraeli authorities say at least 15 soldiers and 11 civilians have been killed in the country's north.\n\n- South Gaza aid 'deterioration' -\n\nTens of thousands have been displaced on the Israeli side of the frontier, and the UN's International Organization for Migration says more than 95,000 have been uprooted in Lebanon.\n\nIn southern Gaza, a United Nations assessment mission found hundreds of thousands of displaced people \"suffer from poor access to shelter, health, food, water and sanitation,\" a UN report said late Wednesday.\n\nUN deputy spokesman Farhan Haq said there had been \"an improvement\" in aid reaching northern Gaza \"but a drastic deterioration in the south\".\n\nUS President Joe Biden has called for the implementation of a ceasefire plan he outlined last month.\n\nHochstein said the plan would ultimately lead to the end of the Gaza conflict, which would in turn quell fighting between Israel and Hezbollah.\n\nOn a Middle East tour earlier this month, Washington's top diplomat, Blinken, similarly said \"the best way\" to help resolve the Hezbollah-Israel violence was resolution of the Gaza fighting.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's far-right coalition partners strongly oppose a ceasefire.\n\nHe is also facing regular street protests by tens of thousands demanding a deal to free the hostages, and accusing him of prolonging the war.\n\nThe Israeli military spokesman, Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari, on Wednesday said that, \"To say that we are going to make Hamas disappear is to throw sand in people's eyes. If we don't provide an alternative, in the end, we will have Hamas.\"\n\nSpeaking to Israel's Channel 13, he said: \"Hamas is an ideology, we cannot eliminate an ideology.\"\n\nBlinken last month told

Others, including US secretary of state Antony Blinken, have also pointed to the difficulty of destroying the Islamist group.\n\nHezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah's group and Israeli forces have exchanged near-daily fire since Hamas's October 7 attack on southern Israel triggered the Gaza war, and the bellicose talk has lately escalated along with the strikes.\n\nIn a televised address, Nasrallah said 'no place' in Israel would 'be spared our rockets' if war began.\n\nThe chief of the Iran-backed group also threatened the nearby island nation of Cyprus if it opened its airports or bases to Israel 'to target Lebanon'.\n\nEuropean Union member Cyprus is home to two British bases, including an airbase, but they are in sovereign British territory and not controlled by the Cypriot government.\n\nOn Thursday the Cypriot government spokesman dismissed as 'totally groundless' any suggestion of possible involvement in a conflict related to Lebanon.\n\n'Cyprus is not involved, nor will it become involved, in any military conflicts,' Konstantinos Letymbiotis told state radio.\n\nWarplanes from the British airbase in Cyprus have, along with US forces, carried out reprisal strikes against Yemen's Iran-backed Huthi rebels who have for months been attacking shipping in adjacent waterways.\n\nOn Wednesday the US military said its forces destroyed two Huthi sites in Yemen.\n\nThe October Hamas attack on Israel resulted in the deaths of 1,194 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli official figures.\n\nThe militants also seized hostages, 116 of whom remain in Gaza although the army says 41 are dead.\n\nIsrael's retaliatory offensive in Gaza has killed at least 37,431 people, also mostly civilians, according to the health ministry in the Hamas-ruled territory.\n\nThe latest toll on Thursday included at least 35 deaths over the previous day, the ministry said.\n\nThe Huthis and Hezbollah both say they are acting in response to Israel's actions in Gaza.\n\nOn Tuesday, Israel's military announced that 'operational plans for an offensive in Lebanon were approved and validated'.\n\nThe same day, Hezbollah published a video showing drone footage purportedly taken by the movement over northern Israel, including parts of Haifa's city and port.\n\nUS envoy Amos Hochstein has called for 'urgent' de-escalation.\n\nThe cross-border violence has killed at least 479 people in Lebanon, most of them fighters but also 93 civilians, according to an AFP tally.\n\nIsraeli authorities say at least 15 soldiers and 11 civilians have been killed in the country's north.\n\nWeary residents of Beirut on Thursday downplayed the chances of war in Lebanon, which a political deadlock has left essentially leaderless while a five-year economic meltdown continues.\n\nIn Israel, some citizens called for action against Hezbollah, and Noam Galili, 29, said: 'I know what it is like to live close to Lebanon, but it never felt as dangerous as it does now.'\n\nThe violence has already displaced tens of thousands of people, mostly in Lebanon but also in northern Israel.\n\nIn southern Gaza, a United Nations mission found hundreds of thousands of displaced people 'suffer from poor access to shelter, health, food, water and sanitation,' a UN report said late Wednesday.\n\nIn central Gaza, residents said they had turned to cooking oil to power their cars.\n\nUS president Joe Biden has called for the implementation of a ceasefire plan he outlined last month.\n\nHochstein and Washington's top diplomat, Blinken, say a deal to curb fighting in Gaza would by extension help resolve the Hezbollah-Israel violence.\n\nIsraeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu's far-right coalition partners strongly oppose a Gaza ceasefire.\n\nHe is also facing regular street protests by tens of thousands demanding a deal to free the hostages, and accusing him of prolonging the war.\n\nThe Israeli military spokesman, Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari, on Wednesday told Israel's Channel 13: 'To say that we are going to make Hamas disappear is to throw sand in people's eyes. If we don't provide an alternative, in the end, we will have Hamas.'\n\nHe said, 'Hamas is an ideology. We cannot eliminate an ideology.'\n\nIsraeli government spokesman David Mencer said Thursday Hamas's 'final stronghold' in Rafah on the border with Egypt is systematically being taken apart.\n\n'And we will win,' he told a press briefing.\n\nBlinken last month said Washington had not seen an Israeli post-war plan and 'the trajectory Israel is on' would still leave thousands of Hamas fighters.",

The international community is desperately seeking to avoid a regional conflict.\n\nOn Tuesday, Hezbollah released a nine-minute video of drone footage from a drone that purportedly flew over Israel. The video was a thinly veiled threat as Hezbollah demonstrates its capabilities.\n\nRich Goldberg, a senior adviser for the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, told the Washington Examiner, \"Hezbollah has been testing in the last couple of weeks in particular, as they've been escalating, and to some extent, the Israeli air defense has failed,\" adding that \"it's not clear that Israel's air defenses are fully up to the job of intercepting and defeating swarm drones, and I think Hezbollah knows that.\"\n\nNasrallah claimed the group has \"greatly exceeded\" 100,000 troops.\n\nIsrael's foreign minister, Israel Katz, said in response to the video, \"We are very close to the moment of decision to change the rules against Hezbollah and Lebanon.

The Israelis ... they are everywhere. Their escalation shows that they want Lebanon engaged into war,\" he told The National.\n\nThe Israeli military and Hezbollah possess vast arsenals that would eclipse the damage from their last war in 2006.\n\nHezbollah is thought to have up to 150,000 rockets - enough to fire up to 1,500 a day, by some estimates, compared to about 15,000 in 2006.\n\nIsrael, meanwhile, has one of the largest air forces in the world, responsible for laying waste to most of Gaza, where almost 37,400 Palestinians have been killed since war began on October 7, according to local health officials.\n\nIt was sparked by Hamas-led attacks on southern Israel that killed 1,200 people.\n\nKarim El Mufti, a professor of international relations at Sciences Po Paris, said: \"The 2006 war is small compared to what this is, and what this could ignite into.\"\n\nThe month-long war that year, sparked by a Hezbollah cross-border raid, led to more than 1,200 people in Lebanon being killed and about $5 billion in damage to the country.\n\nAbout 120 Israeli soldiers and 40 civilians were killed in Israel, while nearly half a million Israelis and one million Lebanese were displaced.\n\nThe sharp rise in attacks in recent weeks has led to fears of a return to 2006, only far worse.\n\nIsrael wants to remove the security threat posed by Hezbollah so about 60,000 displaced residents can return home near the border, while the Lebanese armed movement said it will not cease its attacks until Israel ends its bombardment of the Gaza Strip.\n\nIt said it does not want a full-scale war but is prepared for one.\n\nThe Hezbollah-aligned official said that Lebanon wants Israel to abide by UN Resolution 1701, which brought to an end the 2006 war between Hezbollah and Israel - even if it has never been fully implemented in the 18 years since.\n\nWhile Lebanon and Israel are technically enemy states, and the Lebanese government has repeatedly criticised Israel's actions in Gaza, Beirut has said it does not want a war but has little control over Hezbollah.\n\nLebanon accuses Israel of regularly breaching the terms of Resolution 1701 - whether by launching attacks on Israel, infringing on the country's territory, or occupying land claimed by Beirut.\n\n\"[The Israelis] are always escalating, not only by the border,\" the official said. \"They are targeting all of Lebanon. It's clear the Israelis are looking to get Lebanon engaged with this war. Lebanon does not want this war.\"\n\nOn the other side, Israel would point to the fact that UNSC 1701 also calls for the disarmament of non-state militias - a reference to Hezbollah.\n\nIsrael has vowed to push Hezbollah north of the Litani River, which the armed group firmly opposes.\n\nThe risk of escalation has led to a diplomatic effort by foreign powers, including the US and France, to avoid war.\n\nUS envoy Amos Hochstein visited Lebanon and Israel this week. He said it was both \"achievable\" and \"urgent\" that a resolution be achieved.\n\nHe also said that the US's ceasefire proposal for Gaza \"provides an opportunity to end the conflict\" in the Israel-Lebanon border area.\n\nThe US has been pressing Israel and Hamas to formally accept the ceasefire deal approved by UN Security Council members, which would allow an initial six-week pause to fighting.\n\nHezbollah said it will not end its attacks until there is a ceasefire in Gaza.\n\nThe Hezbollah-aligned official also accused Israel of refusing to agree to the ceasefire, while repeating the accusation often levelled at Benjamin Netanyahu that the Israeli Prime Minister seeks to prolong his stay in office by attacking Lebanon.\n\nIsrael has not formally said it supports the ceasefire proposal. Hamas has made positive indications while also submitting requested changes.\n\n\"We didn't hear from Netanyahu or [Israeli Defence Minister Yoav] Gallant that they have accepted,\" said the Lebanese official.\n\n\"If you look at warfare strategy throughout modern history, this is one of the most controlled escalations ever,\" Prof El Mufti told The National.\n\n\"But the Pandora's Box is open in Gaza and unless that front is closed there's going to be a potential explosion between Hezbollah and Israel.\"\n\nWhile a ceasefire in Gaza is seen as the best chance of defusing tension on the Lebanese border, some experts have warned that the long-standing tension between Hezbollah and Israel will remain regardless.\n\nThe tens of thousands of residents on either side of the border who have been displaced from their homes might say that war has already begun.\n\nBoth sides have expanded the scope and intensity of their attacks - with Hezbollah using ever more advanced weaponry and Israel hitting as far as Lebanon's northern border with Syria on the other side of the country.\n\nThe Lebanese official aligned said that Israeli escalation showed it wanted \"Lebanon engaged into war\".\n\nUN officials in Lebanon recently said that the risk of miscalculation remained high, a view heard elsewhere in the region.\n\n\"One mistake is a rocket hitting a bus full of school kids. That's World War Three and Four all together,\" said Lior Shelef, an Israeli army reservist, who lives in Kibbutz Snir, a few kilometres from the Lebanese border.\n\n\"It's what will happen when this one mistake happens and it will happen eventually. It's just a question of when.\n\n\"When the game was in the buffer zone inside Lebanon, we could make sure that we're not making mistakes from our side. And if they're going to make mistakes, they're going to suffer the consequences.\n\n\"The problem is that today a mistake that will happen here can be severe. And the problem is that it will be very hard for us to convince people to come back and live here.\"\n\nWhile the risk of miscalculation remains high, Prof El Mufti said there were too many parameters to consider to know what \"the straw that breaks the camel's back\" would be.\n\n\"This is very new for Israel. They don't have solutions and they're unable to think outside the box,\" he added.\n\n\"They only have violent solutions that won't work in this case.\" For this reason \"the Israelis will lose it first given how Hezbollah has behaved throughout the conflict\".\n\n\"I don't see Hezbollah overreacting because they have more to lose than the Israelis,\" Prof El Mufti said.\n\nDespite losing about 300 fighters, Hezbollah has maintained a policy of restraint since October 8, when it launched its first attack on Israeli positions.\n\nMeanwhile, Israel is more likely to be a catalyst for an all-out war \"because they have nothing to lose\", Prof El Mufti said.\n\n\"They've already broken so many boundaries regarding their relationship to the US and the world's perception of them, disengaging with international law and the ICJ and ICC ... and getting away with it so far.\n\n\"They've been avoiding civilian targets, showing they abide by international law even though they are not recognised internationally as a resistance except by [its allies] and the Lebanese state.\"\n\nWith strong Iranian backing, Hezbollah is also eager to re-establish deterrence. On Tuesday the group released drone footage deep in Israeli territory, over the port city of Haifa and nearby cities.\n\nThe drone had filmed Israeli military and civilian locations, sending a powerful reminder that the group is capable of doing much more damage in Israel than it did in 2006 - but that it has thus far restrained itself.", "source": {"uri": "thenationalnews.com", "dataType":

purportedly recorded over northern Israel, including parts of Haifa's city and port.\n\nUS envoy Amos Hochstein has called for \"urgent\" de-escalation, while the UN special coordinator for Lebanon Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert said there was \"no inevitability to conflict\" as she visited UN peacekeepers in south Lebanon.\n\nThe cross-border violence has killed at least 479 people in Lebanon, most of them fighters but also 93 civilians, according to an AFP tally.\n\nIsraeli authorities say at least 15 soldiers and 11 civilians have been killed in the country's north.\n\nWeary residents of Beirut on Thursday downplayed the chances of war in Lebanon, which a political deadlock has left essentially leaderless while a five-year economic meltdown continues.\n\nIn Israel, some citizens called for action against Hezbollah, and Noam Galili, 29, said: \"I know what it is like to live close to Lebanon, but it never felt as dangerous as it does now.\"\n\nThe violence has already displaced tens of thousands of people, mostly in Lebanon but also in northern Israel.\n\nIn southern Gaza, a United Nations mission found hundreds of thousands of displaced people \"suffer from poor access to shelter, health, food, water and sanitation,\" a UN report said late Wednesday.\n\nIn central Gaza, residents said they had turned to cooking oil to power their cars.\n\nUS President Joe Biden has called for the implementation of a ceasefire plan he outlined last month.\n\nHochstein and Washington's top diplomat, Blinken, say a deal to curb fighting in Gaza would by extension help resolve the Hezbollah-Israel violence.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's far-right coalition partners strongly oppose a Gaza ceasefire.\n\nHe is also facing regular street protests by tens of thousands demanding a deal to free the hostages, and accusing him of prolonging the war.\n\n\"We will not leave the Gaza Strip until all of the hostages return,\" Netanyahu on Thursday told relatives of hostages killed in the territory.\n\n\"We do not have the option of giving up.\"\n\nIn a separate statement on Thursday he called the war a battle for Israel's existence.\n\n\"I am prepared to suffer personal attacks provided that Israel receives the ammunition from the US that it needs in the war for its existence,\" he said.\n\nHis statement came after he angered Washington with a video statement accusing it of \"withholding weapons and ammunitions to Israel\".\n\nThe White House on Thursday called Netanyahu's video statement \"vexing\".\n\nIsraeli military spokesman Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari told Israel's Channel 13 on Wednesday: \"To say that we are going to make Hamas disappear is to throw sand in people's eyes. If we don't provide an alternative, in the end, we will have Hamas.\"\n\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken last month said Washington had not seen an Israeli post-war plan and \"the trajectory Israel is on\" would still leave thousands of Hamas fighters.\n\nIsraeli government spokesman David Mencer said Thursday that Hamas's \"final stronghold\" in Rafah on the border with Egypt is systematically being taken apart.", "source": {"uri": "hindustantimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hindustan Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

He pointed to its role in a maritime humanitarian corridor to Gaza.\n\nWarplanes from the British airbase in Cyprus have, along with United States forces, carried out reprisal strikes against Yemen's Iran-backed Houthi rebels who have for months been attacking shipping in nearby waterways.\n\n- Hundreds killed -\n\nOn Wednesday the U.S. military said its forces destroyed two Houthi sites in Yemen.\n\nThe unprecedented October 7 attack by Hamas that triggered the Gaza war resulted in the deaths of 1,194 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli official figures.\n\nThe militants also seized hostages, 116 of whom remain in Gaza although the army says 41 are dead.\n\nIsrael's retaliatory offensive in Gaza has killed at least 37,396 people, also mostly civilians, according to the health ministry in the Hamas-ruled territory.\n\nThe Houthis and Hezbollah both say they are acting in response to Israel's actions in Gaza.\n\nOn Tuesday Israel's military announced that \"operational plans for an offensive in Lebanon were approved and validated\", and Foreign Minister Israel Katz warned of Hezbollah's destruction in a \"total war\".\n\nU.S. envoy Amos Hochstein called for \"urgent\" de-escalation.\n\nOn Tuesday Hezbollah published a more than nine-minute video showing drone footage purportedly taken by the movement over northern Israel, including parts of the city and port of Haifa.\n\nTwo former Israeli security officials were split on the prospect of wider conflict.\n\nOne told AFP there would be an operation in Lebanon \"within a few weeks\" while another said the government was \"more interested in a ceasefire\".\n\nThe cross-border violence has killed at least 478 people in Lebanon, most of them fighters but also 93 civilians, according to an AFP tally.\n\nIsraeli authorities say at least 15 soldiers and 11 civilians have been killed in the country's north.\n\n- South Gaza aid 'deterioration' -\n\nTens of thousands have been displaced on the Israeli side of the frontier, and the U.N.'s International Organization for Migration says more than 95,000 have been uprooted in Lebanon.\n\nIn southern Gaza, a United Nations assessment mission found hundreds of thousands of displaced people \"suffer from poor access to shelter, health, food, water and sanitation,\" a U.N. report said late Wednesday.\n\nU.N. deputy spokesman Farhan Haq said there had been \"an improvement\" in aid reaching northern Gaza \"but a drastic deterioration in the south\".\n\nU.S. President Joe Biden has called for the implementation of a ceasefire plan he outlined last month.\n\nHochstein said the plan would ultimately lead to the end of the Gaza conflict, which would in turn quell fighting between Israel and Hezbollah.\n\nOn a Middle East tour earlier this month, Washington's top diplomat, Blinken, similarly said \"the best way\" to help resolve the Hezbollah-Israel violence was resolution of the Gaza fighting.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's far-right coalition partners strongly oppose a ceasefire.\n\nHe is also facing regular street protests by tens of thousands demanding a deal to free the hostages, and accusing him of prolonging the war.\n\nThe Israeli military spokesman, Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari, on Wednesday said that, \"To say that we are going to make Hamas disappear is to throw sand in people's eyes. If we don't provide an alternative, in the end, we will have Hamas.\"\n\nSpeaking to Israel's Channel 13, he said: \"Hamas is an ideology, we cannot eliminate an ideology.\"\n\nBlinken last month told U.S. TV that the United States had not seen an Israeli post-war plan and \"the trajectory Israel is on\" would still leave thousands of Hamas fighters.", "source": {"uri": "naharnet.com", "dataType":

He also threatened to attack Cyprus if the neighboring island were to help Israel in any future offensive against his terrorist group.\n\nEarlier this week, Hezbollah released a video that it said was footage from one of its surveillance drones flying over Haifa, a city in northern Israel that is relatively far from the border with Lebanon. The footage showed one of Israel's most important naval ports which includes sensitive military targets.\n\nNasrallah's threats were made as the American envoy Amos Hochstein was in the region, in one of his many shuttle-diplomacy attempts to mediate a solution between Israel and Hezbollah. Hezbollah joined Hamas' war on Israel just hours after the Gaza-based terrorist organization launched a surprise attack on Israel on October 7 of last year. Nasrallah vowed to help the Palestinian war against the Jewish state and immediately began firing rockets and using explosive drones aimed at northern Israel. He has repeatedly said his organization will not hold its fire until the war in Gaza is over.\n\nThere is a Gordian knot between the war in Gaza and the conflict in the North\n\n\"There is a Gordian knot between the war in Gaza and the conflict in the North and Nasrallah's recent threats are meant to remind Israel that it should not think of detaching the two arenas,\" said Danny Citrinovitch, a research fellow at the Institute for National Security Studies' Iran Program. \"His messages were meant to make clear he is willing to use all of the means at his disposal, but also to prepare the Lebanese people for a possible escalation.\"\n\nIn 2006, Israel and Hezbollah fought a monthlong war which resulted in massive damage in Lebanon. Israel's current leadership has vowed an even stronger offensive this time around.\n\nHezbollah aimed to reduce the number of Israeli forces available to fight against Hamas in southern Israel by entangling the military in the North. The Israeli government also decided to evacuate tens of thousands of residents from the North, leaving the area largely deserted with currently no forecast for their return. This has created a de-facto buffer zone within Israel that has shrunk the country and has major ramifications for the future of the area.\n\nFrance has also been part of the efforts to mediate a solution to the conflict.\n\nThe two sides have engaged in a contained conflict, each carefully escalating gradually. But, in recent weeks, since Israel began its operation in the southern Gaza city of Rafah, the fire on the Israel-Lebanon border has also increased. Israel's Rafah offensive was largely anticipated and was a turning point in its war on Gaza, with the large concentration of Palestinian civilian population in the city. Earlier this month, Israel assassinated a senior Hezbollah commander. The targeted killing prompted a sharp spike in Hezbollah rocket fire toward Israel and brought both sides to the brink -- each threatening an all-out war should events escalate further.\n\nAny deviation from the unwritten rules of engagement that both sides have adopted would result in major civilian casualties or the attack of targets deeper inside both territories could lead to the eruption of a major war, one that has the potential of engulfing the whole Middle East in flames. The escalation in recent days makes it look like such a scenario is closer than ever before.\n\nHezbollah is considered a far more formidable enemy than Hamas, hence Israel's caution. Backed by Iran, the Lebanese terrorist group is believed to have an arsenal of over 100,000 missiles, many of them precision-guided and with a range that can reach much of Israel. Hezbollah's soldiers are well-trained in ground operations, after years of participating in the Syrian civil war helping President Bashar Assad quell his enemies.\n\nBoth sides are playing with fire in an area filled with petrol fumes\n\n\"Both sides are playing with fire in an area filled with petrol fumes,\" said Amatzia Baram, a professor emeritus at the University of Haifa and an expert in Middle Eastern politics. \"When you play with fire, you cannot guarantee control. If one side decides to escalate and the other cannot ignore, this could deteriorate into a greater conflict.\"\n\nAccording to Baram, the chances of a further escalation are slim, with proof of eight months in which both sides \"largely controlled the situation.\"\n\nThe threats against Cyprus are new and are likely an attempt to boast of Hezbollah's capabilities to reach elsewhere. Cyprus and Israel share a warm relationship, which includes bilateral military drills involving Israeli special forces training on Cypriot soil, and security and energy cooperation. Cyprus is a leading tourist destination for Israelis. Baram points to a high number of Hezbollah covert operatives on the island, which have likely reported to Nasrallah on Israel-Cypriot cooperation. On two occasions last year, Cypriot officials confirmed that plots by Iranian nationals to attack Israelis in Cyprus had been foiled.\n\nHe is warning Cyprus to stay out of the conflict\n\n\"He is warning Cyprus to stay out of the conflict,\" Baram said. \"He will not hesitate to attack if he will know for sure that Cyprus is giving Israel direct military assistance.\"\n\nIn response to Nasrallah's threats, Cyprus' President Nikos Christodoulides said late Wednesday that his country is \"part of the solution and not part of the problem.\" Christodoulides denied any involvement in the war.\n\n\"This is a surprising development,\" Citrinovitch told The Media Line. \"This may mean Nasrallah estimates a war is closer than ever and wants to deter both Israel and Cyprus.\"\n\nOver the past eight months, Israel has struck at many Hezbollah targets in southern Lebanon including military posts, weapons depots, and the targeting killing of senior operatives. Hezbollah has acknowledged the death of at least 300 of its operatives. On the Israeli side, 29 people have been killed in a variety of incidents. The return of the tens of thousands of evacuated residents of the North of Israel does not seem close. This has created a public outcry in Israel with criticism of the government's handling of the crisis. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is also under pressure from hard-line elements of his government to wage a full war against Hezbollah.\n\n\"Without reaching a cease-fire in Gaza, the likelihood of an all-out war with Hezbollah increases, be it because of internal pressure or the dynamic of the conflict,\" Citrinovitch said. \"In the end, the rope could and will tear, and once it does, it will be an escalation that cannot be stopped.\"", "source": {"uri": "themedialine.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Media Line"}, "authors": [{"uri": "keren_setton@themedialine.org",

Fire exchanges have intensified since an Israeli airstrike last week killed a senior Hezbollah commander, Taleb Sami Abdullah, along with three other group operatives.\n\nIn a televised speech at the official's memorial service on Wednesday, Hezbollah Secretary General Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah said: \"Israel knows very well that no place will be safe from our missiles and drones\" in the event of a war between the neighboring states, according to comments carried by the Hezbollah-aligned al-Manar TV news outlet.\n\nHe added that Hezbollah has now \"obtained new weapons,\" but did not share any more details. The group often uses rockets, anti-tank missiles and Burkan heavy warhead rockets, which are modeled off the Iranian Ababil drones, according to Seth Frantzman, adjunct fellow at the U.S.-based Foundation for Defense of Democracies think tank.\n\nNasrallah declared that Hezbollah's numbers have now \"far exceeded 100,000 fighters,\" after first saying they'd hit that threshold in 2021, according to the Associated Press. The secretive nature of the group -- which wields considerable political, military and social influence in Lebanon -- makes it challenging to verify the figures. Lebanon's formal military forces are estimated to have around 80,000 personnel, according to data portal IndexMundi.\n\nThe Hezbollah leader also threatened war against the Mediterranean island of Cyprus, if the European Union member permits Israel to launch military operations from its territory. Nasrallah accused Israel of \"conducting maneuvers in preparation for the Lebanon war\" in Cyprus, without disclosing his sources.\n\n\"I say that the Cypriot government must be careful because opening airports for the enemy to attack Lebanon means that Cyprus is part of the war and we will deal with it as part of the war,\" al-Manar quoted Nasrallah as saying, according to a Google translation.\n\nCyprus has denied the accusations, but it has stepped up defense cooperation and participated in joint military exercises with Israel as recently as May 2023.\n\nIn response to Nasrallah, Cyprus' President Nikos Christodoulides on Wednesday stressed that his country is not involved in the conflict and is, in fact, part of the solution, according to the Cyprus News Agency.\n\nCNBC has reached out to the Cypriot Ministry of Foreign Affairs for comment on whether Cypriot sites are used for Israeli military activity.", "source": {"uri": "cnbc.com", "dataType":

Others, including US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, have also pointed to the difficulty of destroying the Islamist group.\n\nIn a televised address, Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah said \"no place\" in Israel would \"be spared our rockets\" if war began.\n\nNasrallah's Iran-backed group has exchanged near-daily fire with Israel since Hamas's October 7 attack on southern Israel, but the fire from Hezbollah rockets, Israeli warplanes and other weapons has escalated in the past few weeks.\n\nThe Hezbollah chief also threatened the nearby island nation of Cyprus if it opened its airports or bases to Israel \"to target Lebanon\".\n\nCyprus, a European Union member, is home to two British bases, including an airbase, but they are in sovereign British territory and not controlled by the Cypriot government.\n\nCypriot President Nikos Christodoulides denied his country's involvement in the war and said it was \"part of the solution\".

If we don't provide an alternative, in the end, we will have Hamas.\"\n\nSpeaking to Israel's Channel 13, he said: \"Hamas is an ideology, we cannot eliminate an ideology.\"\n\nBlinken last month told

(Representational)\n\nBeirut:\n\nHezbollah said it fired \"dozens\" of rockets into northern Israel on Thursday in retaliation for a deadly strike in south Lebanon, a day after a fiery speech from the group's leader.\n\nIsrael and Hezbollah, a powerful Lebanese movement allied with Hamas, have traded near-daily cross-border fire since the Palestinian group's October 7 attack on Israel which triggered war in the Gaza Strip.\n\nFears of a regional war surged after Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah warned on Wednesday that \"no place\" in Israel would be spared in the event of all-out war against his group, and threatened the nearby island nation of Cyprus if it opened its airports to Israel.\n\nHezbollah on Thursday said that \"in response to the assassination that the Israeli enemy carried out in the village of Deir Kifa\", fighters targeted an Israeli barracks \"with dozens of Katyusha rockets\".\n\nLebanon's official National News Agency (NNA) had reported one dead after an \"enemy drone\" struck a vehicle in south Lebanon's Deir Kifa area.\n\nHezbollah announced that one of its fighters was killed. A source close to the group, requesting anonymity, told AFP he was killed in the Deir Kifa strike.\n\nThe Israeli military said an air strike \"eliminated\" a Hezbollah operative in the Deir Kifa area, saying he was \"responsible for planning and carrying out terror attacks against Israel and commanding Hezbollah ground forces\" in south Lebanon's Jouaiyya area.\n\nElsewhere, Israeli fighter jets struck \"a Hezbollah surface-to-air missile launcher that posed a threat to aircraft operating over Lebanon\", the army statement added.\n\nHezbollah claimed several other attacks on Israeli troops and positions on Thursday, while the NNA reported further Israeli strikes in south Lebanon.\n\n'Stop the firing'\n\nThe exchanges between the foes, which last went to war in 2006, have escalated in recent weeks, and the Israeli military said Tuesday that \"operational plans for an offensive in Lebanon were approved and validated\".\n\nAfter the Hezbollah leader's threats against Cyprus, Lebanon's foreign ministry said on Thursday that \"relations between Lebanon and Cyprus are based on a rich history of diplomatic cooperation\".\n\nContacts and consultations continue between the two countries \"at the highest levels\", a foreign ministry statement said, without making specific reference to Nasrallah's remarks.\n\nIn a conversation with his Cyprus counterpart, Foreign Minister Abdallah Bou Habib expressed \"Lebanon's constant reliance on the positive role that Cyprus plays in supporting regional stability\", the NNA reported.\n\nLebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati and British Foreign Secretary David Cameron discussed bilateral relations \"and the situation in Lebanon and the region\" in a telephone call, the premier's office said in a statement.\n\nAlso on Thursday, the United Nations special coordinator for Lebanon Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert said there was \"no inevitability to conflict\" as she visited UN peacekeepers deployed in the Lebanese border town of Naqura.\n\n\"It is crucial for all sides to stop the firing and for the parties to commit to sustainable solutions in line with Security Council Resolution 1701,\" she said in a statement.\n\nThe resolution ended the 2006 war between Israel and Hezbollah and called for the Lebanese army and UN peacekeepers to be the only armed forces deployed in the country's south.\n\nThe cross-border violence since October has killed at least 479 people in Lebanon, most of them fighters but also including 93 civilians, according to an AFP tally.\n\nPromotedListen to the latest songs,

Israeli defense officials traveled to northern Israel for an assessment and key discussions about the situation.\n\nThe Iranian-backed Lebanese terrorist group Hezbollah released drone footage on June 18 that was taken over the coast of Israel. The footage depicted several sites along the coast, including an area housing Rafael Advanced Defense Systems, one of Israel's largest defense companies, and the port of Haifa, home to an Israeli naval base. The Hezbollah footage, which was edited and marked with locations by Hezbollah, claimed to show locations of air defense systems and other sites within the Rafael property.\n\nOn June 19, Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah gave a speech in which he threatened Cyprus against letting Israel use its airbases. \"Opening Cypriot airports and bases to the Israeli enemy to target Lebanon would mean that the Cypriot government is part of the war, and the resistance will deal with it as part of the war,\" Nasrallah said.\n\nNasrallah's speech came a week after the IDF killed Sami Taleb Abdullah, the commander of Hezbollah's Nasr unit, in an airstrike. Hezbollah has fired more than 5,000 rockets, missiles, and drones at Israel since Hezbollah chose to support Hamas after the latter group's October 7 attack on Israel. Hezbollah increased its attacks in May and June, especially the use of precision kamikaze drone attacks.\n\nAfter the killing of Abdullah, Hezbollah greatly increased its attacks, firing at least 215 projectiles at Israel. There was a lull as US envoy Amos Hochstein visited Israel on June 17, but the attacks resumed after Hochstein left the country.\n\nNow, Israel and Hezbollah are upping the rhetoric about a possible war.\n\n\"Nasrallah boasts today about filming the ports of Haifa, operated by international companies from China and India, and threatens to attack them,\" Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz said on June 18. \"We are very close to the moment of decision to change the rules against Hezbollah and Lebanon. In an all-out war, Hezbollah will be destroyed, and Lebanon will be severely hit.\"\n\nDefense Minister Yoav Gallant, IDF Chief of Staff Lieutenant General Herzi Halevi, and the head of the Israeli Air Force, Major General Tomer Bar, met on June 19 about the situation in the north. They convened a discussion and assessment with the head of Israel's Northern Command, Major General Ori Gordin. The head of Israel's Home Front Command, Major General Rafi Milo, was also present.\n\nIn addition, Halevi, Bar, and Brigadier General Gilad Biran, the head of Israel's air defenses, visited an air defense battery and spoke with soldiers manning the site. \"Our test is to see that today we defend, tomorrow we win, and the day after tomorrow we return the residents to a much safer reality, and with them, we also build and restore and make this beautiful area stronger than it was before the war,\" Halevi said.\n\nThe northern meetings came a day after Gordin approved operational plans and held a joint situational assessment in the Northern Command.\n\n\"As part of the situational assessment, operational plans for an offensive in Lebanon were approved and validated, and decisions were taken on the continuation of increasing the readiness of troops in the field,\" the IDF said on June 18. The feverish pace of the meetings illustrates the rising concerns in Israel about a further escalation in the north.\n\nOn June 19, sirens sounded throughout Israeli communities in Galilee, beginning in the morning and continuing throughout the day. The first alarms at 7:34 am were due to a drone threat, and the UAV fell near the northern Israeli border community of Metula. It was not clear if it was shot down by Israeli air defenses.\n\nSome alarms were false, however. At least eighteen communities, from the city of Kiryat Shmona in the Huleh Valley to the community of Shlomi near the Mediterranean, were affected by the warnings. Fifteen rockets were fired at Kiryat Shmona, and Israel responded with artillery fire directed at the source of the attack.\n\nThe IDF also carried out overnight airstrikes in Lebanon between June 18 and June 19. Warplanes struck a Hezbollah storage facility near Yaroun and a launch post in the area of Ayta ash Shab. Ayta ash Shab has been a frequent IDF target due to Hezbollah's presence in the village, which is very close to the Israeli border.", "source": {"uri": "fdd.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "FDD"},

Most of the fatalities have been fighters but they also include more than 80 civilians and non-combatants. On the Israeli side, 16 soldiers and 11 civilians have been killed over the past eight months.\n\nThe level of threats between Israel and Hezbollah intensified following last week's killing by Israel of Hezbollah's most senior commander since the fighting began. Hezbollah retaliated by firing hundreds of rockets into northern Israel in retaliation.\n\nCyprus and Lebanon have had close and historic relations for decades and the island became a refuge for thousands of Lebanese who resided on the island during Lebanon's 1975-90 civil war. Many Lebanese citizens moved again to Cyprus following the historic economic meltdown in Lebanon that started in late 2019.\n\nIn recent years, Cyprus has enjoyed increasingly tight relations with Israel and the island has hosted joint Israeli-Cypriot military exercises, but has not been involved in any military operations.\n\nNasrallah said his group has information that the Israel's military is conducting maneuvers in Cyprus in mountainous areas similar to those of Lebanon adding that they also use Cypriot airports.\n\nHe added that Hezbollah has information that Israel believes that in case an all-out war breaks out, Hezbollah will target its airports and for that reason Israel might use \"in its war against Lebanon Cypriot airports and bases.\"\n\nNasrallah added that when Cyprus President Nikos Christodoulides visited Lebanon recently, Lebanese officials spoke with him about the matter and he denied there were such plans.\n\n\"The Cypriot government should be careful that opening the airports and bases in Cyprus for the Israeli enemy to target Lebanon, means that the Cypriot government has become part of the war,\" Nasrallah said. \"The resistance (Hezbollah) will deal with it (Cyprus) as part of the war.\"\n\nCyprus government spokesman Konstantinos Letymbiotis repeated that any suggestion that Cyprus, either through its infrastructure or territory, would be

Others, including US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, have also pointed to the difficulty of destroying the Islamist group.\n\nHezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah's group and Israeli forces have exchanged near-daily fire since Hamas's October 7 attack on southern Israel triggered the Gaza war, and the bellicose talk has lately escalated along with the strikes.\n\nIn a televised address, Nasrallah said \"no place\" in Israel would \"be spared our rockets\" if war began.\n\nThe chief of the Iran-backed group also threatened the nearby island nation of Cyprus if it opened its airports or bases to Israel \"to target Lebanon\".\n\nEuropean Union member Cyprus is home to two British bases, including an airbase, but they are in sovereign British territory and not controlled by the Cypriot government.\n\nOn Thursday the Cypriot government spokesman dismissed as \"totally groundless\" any suggestion of possible involvement in a conflict related to Lebanon.\n\n\"Cyprus is not involved, nor will it become involved, in any military conflicts,\" Konstantinos Letymbiotis told state radio.\n\nWarplanes from the British airbase in Cyprus have, along with US forces, carried out reprisal strikes against Yemen's Iran-backed Huthi rebels who have for months been attacking shipping in adjacent waterways.\n\n- 'Urgent' de-escalation -\n\nOn Wednesday the US military said its forces destroyed two Huthi sites in Yemen.\n\nThe October Hamas attack on Israel resulted in the deaths of 1,194 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli official figures.\n\nThe Hamas also seized hostages, 116 of whom remain in Gaza although the army says 41 are dead.\n\nIsrael's retaliatory offensive in Gaza has killed at least 37,431 people, also mostly civilians, according to the health ministry in the Hamas-ruled territory.\n\nThe latest toll on Thursday included at least 35 deaths over the previous day, the ministry said.\n\nThe Huthis and Hezbollah both say they are acting in response to Israel's actions in Gaza.\n\nOn Tuesday, Israel's military announced that \"operational plans for an offensive in Lebanon were approved and validated\".\n\nThe same day, Hezbollah published a video showing drone footage purportedly taken by the movement over northern Israel, including parts of Haifa's city and port.\n\nUS envoy Amos Hochstein has called for \"urgent\" de-escalation.\n\nThe cross-border violence has killed at least 479 people in Lebanon, most of them fighters but also 93 civilians, according to an AFP tally.\n\nIsraeli authorities say at least 15 soldiers and 11 civilians have been killed in the country's north.\n\nWeary residents of Beirut on Thursday downplayed the chances of war in Lebanon, which a political deadlock has left essentially leaderless while a five-year economic meltdown continues.\n\nIn Israel, some citizens called for action against Hezbollah, and Noam Galili, 29, said: \"I know what it is like to live close to Lebanon, but it never felt as dangerous as it does now.\"\n\n- Pressures -\n\nThe violence has already displaced tens of thousands of people, mostly in Lebanon but also in northern Israel.\n\nIn southern Gaza, a United Nations mission found hundreds of thousands of displaced people \"suffer from poor access to shelter, health, food, water and sanitation,\" a UN report said late Wednesday.\n\nIn central Gaza, residents said they had turned to cooking oil to power their cars.\n\nUS President Joe Biden has called for the implementation of a ceasefire plan he outlined last month.\n\nHochstein and Washington's top diplomat, Blinken, say a deal to curb fighting in Gaza would by extension help resolve the Hezbollah-Israel violence.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's far-right coalition partners strongly oppose a Gaza ceasefire.\n\nHe is also facing regular street protests by tens of thousands demanding a deal to free the hostages, and accusing him of prolonging the war.\n\nThe Israeli military spokesman, Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari, on Wednesday told Israel's Channel 13: \"To say that we are going to make Hamas disappear is to throw sand in people's eyes. If we don't provide an alternative, in the end, we will have Hamas.\"\n\nHe said, \"Hamas is an ideology. We cannot eliminate an ideology.\"\n\nIsraeli government spokesman David Mencer said Thursday Hamas's \"final stronghold\" in Rafah on the border with Egypt is systematically being taken apart.\n\n\"And we will win,\" he told a press briefing.\n\nBlinken last month said Washington had not seen an Israeli post-war plan and \"the trajectory Israel is on\" would still leave thousands of

Others, including US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, have also pointed to the difficulty of destroying the militant group.\n\nIn a televised address, Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah said \"no place\" in Israel would \"be spared our rockets\" if war began.\n\nNasrallah's Iran-backed group has exchanged near-daily fire with Israel since October 7, but the fire from Hezbollah rockets, Israeli warplanes and other weapons has escalated in the past few weeks.\n\nThe Hezbollah chief also threatened the nearby island nation of Cyprus if it opened its airports or bases to Israel \"to target Lebanon\".\n\nCyprus, a European Union member, is home to two British bases, including an airbase, but they are in sovereign British territory and not controlled by the Cypriot government.\n\nCypriot President Nikos Christodoulides denied his country's involvement in the war and said it was \"part of the solution\". He pointed to its role in a maritime humanitarian corridor to Gaza.\n\nWarplanes from the British airbase in Cyprus have, along with United States forces, carried out reprisal strikes against Yemen's Iran-backed Houthi rebels who have for months been attacking shipping in nearby waterways.\n\nOn Wednesday the US military said its forces destroyed two Houthi sites in Yemen.\n\nThe Houthis and Hezbollah both say they are acting in response to the Israeli war on Gaza.\n\nOn Tuesday Israel's military announced that \"operational plans for an offensive in Lebanon were approved and validated\", and Foreign Minister Israel Katz warned of Hezbollah's destruction in a \"total war\".\n\nUS envoy Amos Hochstein called for \"urgent\" de-escalation.\n\nOn Tuesday Hezbollah published a more than nine-minute video showing drone footage purportedly taken by the movement over northern Israel, including parts of the city and port of Haifa.\n\nTwo former Israeli security officials were split on the prospect of wider conflict.\n\nOne told AFP there would be an operation in Lebanon \"within a few weeks\" while another said the government was \"more interested in a ceasefire\".\n\nThe cross-border violence has killed at least 478 people in Lebanon, most of them fighters but also 93 civilians, according to an AFP tally.\n\nIsraeli authorities say at least 15 soldiers and 11 civilians have been killed in the country's north.\n\nTens of thousands have been displaced on the Israeli side of the frontier, and the UN's International Organization for Migration says more than 95,000 have been uprooted in Lebanon.\n\nIn southern Gaza, a United Nations assessment mission found hundreds of thousands of displaced people \"suffer from poor access to shelter, health, food, water and sanitation,\" a UN report said late Wednesday.\n\nUN deputy spokesman Farhan Haq said there had been \"an improvement\" in aid reaching northern Gaza \"but a drastic deterioration in the south\".\n\nUS President Joe Biden has called for implementing a ceasefire plan he outlined last month.\n\nHochstein said the plan would ultimately lead to the end of the Gaza conflict, which would in turn quell fighting between Israel and Hezbollah.\n\nOn a Middle East tour earlier this month, Washington's top diplomat, Blinken, similarly said \"the best way\" to help resolve the Hezbollah-Israel violence was a resolution of the Gaza fighting.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's far-right coalition partners strongly oppose a ceasefire.\n\nHe is also facing regular street protests by tens of thousands demanding a deal to free the hostages, and accusing him of prolonging the war.\n\nThe Israeli military spokesman, Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari, on Wednesday said, \"To say that we are going to make Hamas disappear is to throw sand in people's eyes. If we don't provide an alternative, in the end, we will have Hamas.\"\n\nSpeaking to Israel's Channel 13, he said: \"Hamas is an ideology, we cannot eliminate an ideology.\"\n\nBlinken last month told US TV that the United States had not seen an Israeli post-war plan and \"the trajectory Israel is on\" would still leave thousands of Hamas fighters.", "source": {"uri": "english.ahram.org.eg",

Meanwhile, Hezbollah's Secretary-General warned that they would not show restraint under these circumstances. This situation has led to varying estimates of the capabilities the Lebanese group might display in case of an all-out war with Israel.\n\nSince October 8, Hezbollah has launched daily operations against Israeli military targets and settlements, using drones, missiles, and rockets to inflict significant damage. On day 250, the resistance group published an infographic detailing 2,125 military operations, including artillery, surface-to-surface missiles, sniper rifles, machine guns, air defense weapons, drone attacks, guided missiles, \"direct weapons,\" and engineering corps operations.\n\nAn Israeli report conducted over three years and published by Reichman University's Institute for Counter-Terrorism outlines the potential outcome of a future war with Lebanon. The report states:\n\nAfter about three weeks of fire and blood, the unprecedented scale of damage in Lebanon and Israel will lead to the end of the conflict in a stalemate, amid pressure from the international community.\"\n\nThe 130-page report, involving over 100 Israeli senior and military officials, detailed Hezbollah's weapons capabilities based on open-source information. The report indicates that Israel's air defense systems would be overwhelmed, with Hezbollah expected to fire around 3,000 munitions daily. It also states that Hezbollah possesses around 150,000 missiles, drones, and rockets.\n\nDespite the report's damning conclusions, it likely underestimates Hezbollah's true power. The group's Secretary General, Seyyed Hassan Nasrallah, previously stated that his armed wing had over 100,000 fighters. In his latest speech on June 19, he claimed he had previously underplayed these statistics, asserting the current number is much higher. Nasrallah added that groups from around the region volunteered tens of thousands of fighters, but Hezbollah already has more than enough, even in the event of all-out war.\n\nIsrael's assessment that Hezbollah has around 150,000 munitions has been challenged by recent comments from an official of the Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC)'s Quds Force. The official suggested that Hezbollah actually possesses over 1 million drones, missiles, and rockets.\n\nAddressing Israeli surprise at the number of drones used by the group in recent skirmishes along the Lebanese border, Hassan Nasrallah stated that Hezbollah produces drones locally and that there \"are too many to count.\" The Israeli report's idea that 3,000 projectiles would be fired daily for 21 days and consume around 40% of Hezbollah's arsenal is considered highly unlikely by other experts.\n\nUsing this understanding of Hezbollah's weapons arsenal, if a war were to last for months, as stated by Nitzan Nuriel, Israel's former Counter Terrorism Bureau director, the Lebanese group would deplete or significantly reduce its weapons stores, according to the Israeli report. However, this seems unlikely given Hezbollah's capabilities, which surpass those of Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) in Gaza.\n\nThese groups have managed to surprise Israel and continue to launch rockets almost daily. Additionally, Israel's understanding of the number of Palestinian fighters, weapons capabilities, and tunnel systems in Gaza is notably lacking.\n\nCommenting for the first time on the details of Hezbollah's military operations since October, Seyyed Hassan Nasrallah said on Wednesday that the early months of their activities had deprived the Israeli military in the north of both its \"eyes\" and \"ears.\" This, he noted, allowed Hezbollah greater freedom to attack targets.\n\nNasrallah also discussed the Burkan missiles fired at Israeli military bases, stating that these missiles possess 500-pound and sometimes 1,000-pound warheads. He further remarked that in the event of war, every part of Israeli-controlled territory would come under attack from precision missiles.\n\nHe further remarked that in the event of war, every part of Israeli-controlled territory would come under attack from precision missiles. Nasrallah noted that his group would also target significant sites in the Mediterranean Sea, hinting at a repeat of the ongoing Ansarallah-imposed blockade in the Red Sea. Additionally, he stated that if Israel used Cyprus to launch its fighter jets, the government of Cyprus would be treated as a party to the war.\n\nAnother element not currently being discussed in the public domain is the ongoing psychological warfare being waged by Hezbollah and its allies against Israel. This effort would likely seek a limited war if Israel launches a military operation against Lebanon.\n\nAccording to two anonymous sources who spoke to MintPress News on the condition of anonymity, all members of the regional \"Axis of Resistance\" now agree that a war with Israel would be in their favor. They also suggest it could provide enough pressure to extract concessions for the Syrian government.\n\nThis intelligence chatter is evident in discussions in Syria and Lebanon. It has caused confusion among Israelis, who their leaders lead to believe that a war with Lebanon can remain limited. Meanwhile, Seyyed Hassan Nasrallah warns that Hezbollah will not act with restraint should Israel invade.\n\nFeature photo | A Hezbollah fighter stands at a watchtower at the site where clashes erupted between Hezbollah and al-Qaida-linked fighters in Wadi al-Kheil or al-Kheil Valley on the Lebanon-Syria border, July 29, 2017.

The Secretary-General of Hezbollah also mentioned Cyprus for the first time, saying Hezbollah could consider it \"a part of the war\" if it continued to allow Israel to use its airports and bases for military exercises.\n\nThe Shiite leader said that the group does not want \"total war\" but only operates in support of Hamas, adding that Israel can only talk about waging such a war but is not capable of conducting it.\n\nCommenting on the escalating conflict on the southern borders, Nasrallah said that thanks to Hezbollah's continuous attacks, the Israeli army had been forced to divert resources from Gaza. He said that Israel has suffered huge economic losses as a result of the evacuation of towns on the northern border and the halt of agricultural and industrial activities in the area.", "source": {"uri": "shafaq.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "\u0627\u0644\u062e\u0627\u0631\u062c\u064a\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0645\u0631\u064a\u0643\u064a\u0629 \u0644\u0634\u0641\u0642 \u0646\u064a\u0648\u0632: \u0645\u062c\u0627\u0645\u064a\u0639 \u0645\u062f\u0639\u0648\u0645\u0629 \u0625\u064a\u0631\u0627\u0646\u064a\u0627\u064b \u062a\u0634\u0643\u0644 \u062e\u0637\u0631\u0627\u064b \u0639\u0644\u0649 4 \u0648\u062a\u0631\u062f\u0639 \u0627\u0633\u062a\u062b\u0645\u0627\u0631\u0627\u064b \u0641\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0627\u0642"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hassan_Nasrallah", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hassan Nasrallah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hezbollah", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hezbollah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six-Day_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Six-Day War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebanon", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lebanon"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Lebanon"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary-General_of_Hezbollah", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Secretary-General of Hezbollah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdullah_of_Saudi_Arabia", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Abdullah of Saudi Arabia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Lebanon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Southern Lebanon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediterranean_Sea", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mediterranean Sea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airstrike", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Airstrike"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyprus", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cyprus"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Cyprus"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Israel Defense Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia_Islam", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shia Islam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History", "label": "dmoz/Society/History", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Genealogy/Military", "label": "dmoz/Society/Genealogy/Military", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Strength_Sports/Tug-of-War", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Strength Sports/Tug-of-War", "wgt": 16}], "image": "https://media.shafaq.com/media/arcella/1718813178526.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9665510", "eventUri": "eng-9665510", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3490196078431372, "wgt": 176, "relevance": 1}

Israeli defense officials traveled to northern Israel for an assessment and key discussions about the situation.\n\nThe Iranian-backed Lebanese terrorist group Hezbollah released drone footage on June 18 that was taken over the coast of Israel. The footage depicted several sites along the coast, including an area housing Rafael Advanced Defense Systems, one of Israel's largest defense companies, and the port of Haifa, home to an Israeli naval base. The Hezbollah footage, which was edited and marked with locations by Hezbollah, claimed to show locations of air defense systems and other sites within the Rafael property.\n\nOn June 19, Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah gave a speech in which he threatened Cyprus against letting Israel use its airbases. \"Opening Cypriot airports and bases to the Israeli enemy to target Lebanon would mean that the Cypriot government is part of the war, and the resistance will deal with it as part of the war,\" Nasrallah said.\n\nNasrallah's speech came a week after the IDF killed Sami Taleb Abdullah, the commander of Hezbollah's Nasr unit, in an airstrike. Hezbollah has fired more than 5,000 rockets, missiles, and drones at Israel since Hezbollah chose to support Hamas after the latter group's October 7 attack on Israel. Hezbollah increased its attacks in May and June, especially the use of precision kamikaze drone attacks.\n\nAfter the killing of Abdullah, Hezbollah greatly increased its attacks, firing at least 215 projectiles at Israel. There was a lull as US envoy Amos Hochstein visited Israel on June 17, but the attacks resumed after Hochstein left the country.\n\nNow, Israel and Hezbollah are upping the rhetoric about a possible war.\n\n\"Nasrallah boasts today about filming the ports of Haifa, operated by international companies from China and India, and threatens to attack them,\" Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz said on June 18. \"We are very close to the moment of decision to change the rules against Hezbollah and Lebanon. In an all-out war, Hezbollah will be destroyed, and Lebanon will be severely hit.\"\n\nDefense Minister Yoav Gallant, IDF Chief of Staff Lieutenant General Herzi Halevi, and the head of the Israeli Air Force, Major General Tomer Bar, met on June 19 about the situation in the north. They convened a discussion and assessment with the head of Israel's Northern Command, Major General Ori Gordin. The head of Israel's Home Front Command, Major General Rafi Milo, was also present.\n\nIn addition, Halevi, Bar, and Brigadier General Gilad Biran, the head of Israel's air defenses, visited an air defense battery and spoke with soldiers manning the site. \"Our test is to see that today we defend, tomorrow we win, and the day after tomorrow we return the residents to a much safer reality, and with them, we also build and restore and make this beautiful area stronger than it was before the war,\" Halevi said.\n\nThe northern meetings came a day after Gordin approved operational plans and held a joint situational assessment in the Northern Command.\n\n\"As part of the situational assessment, operational plans for an offensive in Lebanon were approved and validated, and decisions were taken on the continuation of increasing the readiness of troops in the field,\" the IDF said on June 18. The feverish pace of the meetings illustrates the rising concerns in Israel about a further escalation in the north.\n\nOn June 19, sirens sounded throughout Israeli communities in Galilee, beginning in the morning and continuing throughout the day. The first alarms at 7:34 am were due to a drone threat, and the UAV fell near the northern Israeli border community of Metula. It was not clear if it was shot down by Israeli air defenses.\n\nSome alarms were false, however. At least eighteen communities, from the city of Kiryat Shmona in the Huleh Valley to the community of Shlomi near the Mediterranean, were affected by the warnings. Fifteen rockets were fired at Kiryat Shmona, and Israel responded with artillery fire directed at the source of the attack.\n\nThe IDF also carried out overnight airstrikes in Lebanon between June 18 and June 19. Warplanes struck a Hezbollah storage facility near Yaroun and a launch post in the area of Ayta ash Shab. Ayta ash Shab has been a frequent IDF target due to Hezbollah's presence in the village, which is very close to the Israeli border.\n\nReporting from Israel, Seth J.

Hezbollah said it fired \"dozens\" of rockets into northern Israel Thursday in retaliation for a deadly strike in south Lebanon, a day after a fiery speech from the group's leader.\n\nIsrael and Hezbollah, a powerful Lebanese movement allied with Hamas, have traded near-daily cross-border fire since the Palestinian militant group's October 7 attack on Israel which triggered war in the Gaza Strip.\n\nFears of a regional war rose after Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah warned Wednesday \"no place\" in Israel would be spared in case of all-out war against his group, and threatened the nearby island nation of Cyprus if it opened its airports to Israel.\n\nHezbollah on Thursday said that \"in response to the assassination that the Israeli enemy carried out in the village of Deir Kifa\", fighters targeted an Israeli barracks \"with dozens of Katyusha rockets\".\n\nLebanon's official National News Agency had reported one dead after an \"enemy drone\" struck a vehicle in south Lebanon's Deir Kifa area.\n\nHezbollah announced that one of its fighters had been killed. A source close to the group, requesting anonymity, told AFP he was killed in the Deir Kifa strike.\n\nThe Israeli military said an air strike \"eliminated\" a Hezbollah operative in the Deir Kifa area, saying he was \"responsible for planning and carrying out terror attacks against Israel and commanding Hezbollah ground forces\" in south Lebanon's Jouaiyya area.\n\nElsewhere, Israeli fighter jets struck \"a Hezbollah surface-to-air missile launcher that posed a threat to aircraft operating over Lebanon\", the army statement added.\n\nThe exchanges between the foes, which last went to war in 2006, have escalated in recent weeks, and the Israeli military said Tuesday that \"operational plans for an offensive in Lebanon were approved and validated\".\n\nAfter the Hezbollah leader's threats against Cyprus, Lebanon's foreign ministry said Thursday that \"relations between Lebanon and Cyprus are based on a rich history of diplomatic cooperation\".\n\nContacts and consultations continue between the two countries \"at the highest levels\", a foreign ministry statement said, without making specific reference to Nasrallah's remarks.\n\nThe cross-border violence has killed at least 479 people in Lebanon, most of them fighters but also including 93 civilians, according to an AFP tally.\n\nIsraeli authorities say at least 15 soldiers and 11 civilians have been killed in the country's north.", "source": {"uri": "thecitizen.co.tz", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Citizen"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hezbollah", "type": "org",

He is the special presidential coordinator for global infrastructure and energy security, and was successful in brokering a maritime border deal between Israel and Lebanon in 2022, but on this trip he is attempting to make a deal to avoid war between Israel and the Lebanese resistance group, Hezbollah.\n\nAfter the October 7 attack on Israel, the conflict in Gaza began. Hezbollah began strikes on October 8 in solidarity with the Palestinian resistance, and call for the end of Israeli military occupation.\n\nThe south of Lebanon was occupied by the Israeli military from 1985 to 2000. Israel had ruled the Lebanese with an iron fist, imprisoning hundreds of Lebanese in the infamous Khaim prison, including women and children. Hezbollah successfully brought about the Israeli withdrawal from Lebanon.\n\nOn the latest leg of Hochstein's regional de-escalation tour, he met with caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati at noon, after a morning meeting with both Parliamentary Speaker Nabih Berri, and Lebanese Army head Joseph Aoun.\n\nHochstein was in Israel yesterday, where he met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has dissolved his war cabinet after key members had resigned. Netanyahu is shackled by the extreme right-wing Jewish fanatics who prop-up his government, and refuses to consider any ceasefire in Gaza. Their only goal is the total extermination of the Palestinians in Gaza.\n\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken said during a tour of the Middle East that a cease-fire in Gaza was the best way to end the violence between Hezbollah and Israel, and President Biden has pushed for a ceasefire proposal to end the suffering in Gaza.\n\nUN officials have warned of a possible 'miscalculation' along Israel-Lebanon border that could erupt into a full-blown war between Lebanon and Israel, and likely opening a wider regional conflict that could be the end of Israel.\n\nIsraeli defense minister Gallant complained to Hochstein about Hezbollah's almost daily attacks on Israel's northern towns.\n\nIsrael has conducted targeted assassinations of top Hezbollah commanders in air raids across southern Lebanon and on Baalbek in the east. The continuing Israeli attacks on Lebanon have killed civilians as well, and caused many communities to leave their homes.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported that Hochstein is holding indirect talks with Hezbollah through Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri, who is the leader of another Lebanese resistance group, Amal, which is allied with Hezbollah.\n\nBerri is a dual Lebanese-American citizen and has been the Speaker of the Lebanese Parliament for the past three decades. He and Hochstein are discussing a possible agreement to end hostilities between Israel and Hezbollah.\n\nHezbollah has stated a ceasefire in Gaza would bring a halt to attacks on the north of Israel. However, Israel's refusal of the ceasefire proposal supported by Biden has kept the conflict ongoing.\n\nUS President Joe Biden stressed on Monday that he does not want to see escalation at the Lebanon-Israel border and suggested that the US is advancing a proposal to avert a large-scale conflict.\n\nWhile Hezbollah has attacked mainly military targets, Israel responded by bombing villages across southern Lebanon and targeting Hezbollah positions.\n\nIsraeli officials have promised to push Hezbollah back from their country's northern borders, after about 5,000 rockets have fell across the north and driven Israelis from their homes.", "source": {"uri": "opednews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "OpEdNews"}, "authors": [{"uri": "steven_sahiounie@opednews.com", "name": "Steven

He pointed to its role in a maritime humanitarian corridor to Gaza.\n\nWarplanes from the British airbase in Cyprus have, along with United States forces, carried out reprisal strikes against Yemen's Iran-backed Huthi rebels who have for months been attacking shipping in nearby waterways.\n\n- Hundreds killed -\n\nOn Wednesday the US military said its forces destroyed two Huthi sites in Yemen.\n\nThe unprecedented October 7 attack by Hamas that triggered the Gaza war resulted in the deaths of 1,194 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli official figures.\n\nThe militants also seized hostages, 116 of whom remain in Gaza although the army says 41 are dead.\n\nIsrael's retaliatory offensive in Gaza has killed at least 37,396 people, also mostly civilians, according to the health ministry in the Hamas-ruled territory.\n\nThe Huthis and Hezbollah both say they are acting in response to Israel's actions in Gaza.\n\nOn Tuesday Israel's military announced that \"operational plans for an offensive in Lebanon were approved and validated\", and Foreign Minister Israel Katz warned of Hezbollah's destruction in a \"total war\".\n\nUS envoy Amos Hochstein called for \"urgent\" de-escalation.\n\nOn Tuesday Hezbollah published a more than nine-minute video showing drone footage purportedly taken by the movement over northern Israel, including parts of the city and port of Haifa.\n\nTwo former Israeli security officials were split on the prospect of wider conflict.\n\nOne told AFP there would be an operation in Lebanon \"within a few weeks\" while another said the government was \"more interested in a ceasefire\".\n\nThe cross-border violence has killed at least 478 people in Lebanon, most of them fighters but also 93 civilians, according to an AFP tally.\n\nIsraeli authorities say at least 15 soldiers and 11 civilians have been killed in the country's north.\n\n- South Gaza aid 'deterioration' -\n\nTens of thousands have been displaced on the Israeli side of the frontier, and the UN's International Organization for Migration says more than 95,000 have been uprooted in Lebanon.\n\nIn southern Gaza, a United Nations assessment mission found hundreds of thousands of displaced people \"suffer from poor access to shelter, health, food, water and sanitation,\" a UN report said late Wednesday.\n\nUN deputy spokesman Farhan Haq said there had been \"an improvement\" in aid reaching northern Gaza \"but a drastic deterioration in the south\".\n\nUS President Joe Biden has called for the implementation of a ceasefire plan he outlined last month.\n\nHochstein said the plan would ultimately lead to the end of the Gaza conflict, which would in turn quell fighting between Israel and Hezbollah.\n\nOn a Middle East tour earlier this month, Washington's top diplomat, Blinken, similarly said \"the best way\" to help resolve the Hezbollah-Israel violence was resolution of the Gaza fighting.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's far-right coalition partners strongly oppose a ceasefire.\n\nHe is also facing regular street protests by tens of thousands demanding a deal to free the hostages, and accusing him of prolonging the war.\n\nThe Israeli military spokesman, Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari, on Wednesday said that, \"To say that we are going to make Hamas disappear is to throw sand in people's eyes. If we don't provide an alternative, in the end, we will have Hamas.\"\n\nSpeaking to Israel's Channel 13, he said: \"Hamas is an ideology, we cannot eliminate an ideology.\"\n\nBlinken last month told US TV that the United States had not seen an Israeli post-war plan and \"the trajectory Israel is on\" would still leave thousands of Hamas fighters.\n\nburs-it/dv\n\nMore from this section\n\nBlack Chamber of Arizona to Host 2024 Juneteenth Vision Forward Celebration presented by Cox Communications\n\nMeet a Scientologist Cultivates a Growing Interest in Constructing Greenhouses With Ray Pound\n\nOver 75 million people in the US are under heat alerts.

Here's all you need to know:\n\nCyprus has traditionally allowed Israel to use its airspace for air drills, but never during active conflict - and it doesn't look like Cyprus will start now.\n\nAfter Nasrallah's threat, Cyprus announced that it would remain neutral and not get involved in any war.\n\nHowever, the United Kingdom has bases in Cyprus, which it uses to conduct military operations in the region.\n\nThe UK allegedly used those bases to launch attacks against the Houthis in Yemen. The bases have also reportedly been used to arm Israel in its war against Gaza and south Lebanon.\n\n\"Cyprus's declaration of neutrality can be viewed as a strategic win for Hezbollah,\" said Imad Salamey, a political scientist at the Lebanese American University.\n\n\"This response ... suggests an indirect message from the EU that there is no appetite for backing an Israeli military campaign.\n\n\"It reinforces Hezbollah's deterrent position and contributes to a broader international refrain from supporting potential Israeli military actions,\" Salamey said.\n\nFor one, it could do exactly what it threatened to do: Hit Israeli targets in Cyprus.\n\nOr at least, that's the possibility Amal Saad-Ghorayeb, author of Hizbu'llah: Politics and Religion, described to Al Jazeera.\n\nAn attack \"would ... be devastating for Cyprus economically\" according to Saad-Ghorayeb.\n\n\"There have - I think - been protests about this in the past from opposition politicians in Cyprus about how dangerous this policy [allowing its territory to be used in a conflict] is for its economy and security,\" Saad-Ghorayeb added.\n\nOther analysts are less convinced that Hezbollah would actually hit Cyprus due to the regional implications.\n\n\"I'm not sure what they can do honestly beyond disruption and covert operation. [Hezbollah] understands that targeting Cyprus will bring in the EU and NATO,\" said Maha Yahya, the director of Malcolm H Kerr Carnegie Middle East Center, a think-tank.\n\nNasrallah's fiery speech could serve a purpose, even if Hezbollah doesn't follow through on its threats against Cyprus.\n\n\"[T]his speech is part of a psychological war and aims to send a clear message to Hezbollah's adversaries that any Israeli attempt to widen the scope of the war and attack Lebanon would have major repercussions on all western allies of Israel - particularly regional allies,\" said Karim Emile Bitar, an associate professor of international relations at Saint Joseph University in Beirut.\n\nSalamey added that Hezbollah's psychological warfare could lead the EU to pressure Israel not to expand the scope of the fighting against Lebanon.\n\n\"The hesitation of Israel's allies, as indicated by Cyprus's stance, might lead Israel to reconsider the risks and consequences of a broader war,\" Salamey said.\n\n\"This international isolation and the lack of coherent objectives for military engagement in Lebanon highlight Israel's fragility.\"\n\nEven if Cyprus isn't dragged into any conflict, a possible influx of refugees - Lebanese and Syrians in Lebanon - to its territory would be worrying to the country's government.\n\nIn April, Cypriot President Nikos Christodoulides said that he was concerned about the rise of Syrian refugees arriving to the island's shores from Lebanon seeking asylum.\n\nThe concern over refugees is shared by the European Union, which recently announced that it would give Lebanon more than $1bn in financial assistance. Most of the funds are stipulated to go towards combating irregular migration.\n\nBitar, from St Joseph University, said that there is a \"possibility\" that Hezbollah could ease control over its external borders in order to encourage refugees to flee to Cyprus. However, he added that the major worry for Cyprus - and the region - is that Hezbollah and Israel could spiral the region into war - even if they didn't mean to.\n\n\"We are living in a world where emotions are running extremely high and actors - on both sides of the border - are not necessarily [acting] rational,\" he said.\n\nThis is why I'm worried that both parties - even if they have not made the decision explicitly to go to war - any miscalculation could open the doors of hell.\"", "source": {"uri": "aljazeera.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Al Jazeera Online"}, "authors":

They're strategising on what to do about Hezbollah and Iran.\"\n\nA peace agreement between Israel and Hezbollah looks increasingly unlikely.\n\nOn Monday (17 June), Netanyahu dissolved his war cabinet following the departure of centrist political veteran Benny Gantz - who spoke vehemently against escalated conflict with Hezbollah or Iran.\n\nGantz' departure also leaves no end in sight to Israel's offensive in Gaza, which has so far killed more than 37,000 Palestinians and 1,300 Israelis.\n\nLippman is firmly against a ceasefire, and believes Netanyahu and the other high-ranking Israeli officials think the same: \"[If you] have a ceasefire, release the hostages and let Hamas survive, as most people want, I think that would be an incredible disaster. I am making a prediction it will lead to a bigger war, more Palestinian civilians being killed, and more Israelis.\"\n\nHezbollah, which controls Lebanon's Shiite-majority areas, including parts of the capital Beirut, southern Lebanon and the eastern Bekaa Valley region, is backed by Iran. Alongside Hamas and Yemen's Houthis, Hezbollah forms part of Iran's 'Axis of Resistance' against Israeli and US influence in the Middle East.\n\nSupplied largely by Tehran via Syria or Iraq, Hezbollah's weapons capabilities are considerable.\n\nThe group boasts upwards of 150,000 missiles and rockets, according to the World Factbook of the US Central Intelligence Agency. Ranges vary, but its projectiles are more than capable of reaching all parts of neighbouring Israel.\n\nHezbollah's arsenal is lined with precision missiles, drones, anti-ship, anti-aircraft and anti-tank missiles, notably including the Russian-made Kornet.\n\nThe group, which also possesses armoured combat vehicles, light and heavy machine guns, mortars, landmines and artillery aplenty, is a secondary benefactor in the illicit arms trade between US-sanctioned nations including uneasy bedfellows Iran and Russia.\n\nDespite a vast weapons arsenal, Hezbollah uses a cover and concealment strategy against larger, more organised militaries like the IDF.\n\nTunnels on the Lebanese-Israeli border are a primary conduit of Hezbollah warfare, which Israel targeted with 'Operation North Shield' in 2019.\n\nSome tunnels remain intact and are still used by the militia's approximately 30,000 active fighters and 20,000 reserves, predominantly made up of light infantry, trained on stealth and mobility.\n\nHezbollah employs what the US calls 'mission command' - a strategy of empowering subordinates to make independent battlefield decisions based on a commander's intent. This force design allows Hezbollah troops to \"operate effectively under conditions of overwhelming Israeli firepower\", according to the Centre for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS).\n\nCampaigns fighting for Bashar al-Assad in Syria over the last decade has given Hezbollah access to T-72, T-54, T-55 and T-62 main battle tanks (MBTs).\n\nThe militia has also learnt manoeuvres typical of conventional armies, coordinating larger forces and employing suppressive artillery, although Hezbollah's capacity to deploy MBTs in Lebanon itself is limited by Israeli targeting with fighter aircraft, artillery and drones.\n\nAll eyes now turn to the intensity of Hezbollah's aerial assaults into Israel - and any potential escalation into Cyprus.", "source": {"uri":

Thursday four missiles at a car in the Tyre district town of Deir Kifa and a missile on another car in the southern town of Houmine al-Fawqa, reportedly killing two people.\n\nAn Israeli airstrike meanwhile targeted the Bir Kallab area in Iqlim al-Tuffah's heights, deep in south Lebanon, as artillery shelling hit Khiam, Kfarkela and al-Ezziyeh.\n\nAl-Mayadeen television meanwhile reported a volley of rockets from south Lebanon at Israel's Western Galilee region, as alert sirens wailed in several Israeli areas in the north.\n\nIsrael has ramped up in past weeks its targeting of Hezbollah fighters and allied militants in cars and on motorbikes in south Lebanon, while Hezbollah used more advanced weaponry, including drones capable of firing missiles, explosive drones and a small type of guided missile known as Almas, or Diamond, that was used to attack a base controlling a surveillance balloon.\n\nThe group has also recently published a more than nine-minute video showing drone footage over northern Israel, including parts of the city and port of Haifa.\n\n- 'Greater capabilities' -\n\nFears that Israel might launch a full-blown war in Lebanon have spiked, with the Israeli military on Tuesday announcing that \"operational plans for an offensive in Lebanon were approved and validated\".\n\nOn Wednesday, Israel said its warplanes had struck Hezbollah sites in southern Lebanon overnight, while reporting a drone had infiltrated near the border town of Metula and targeted troops in an attack claimed by Hezbollah.\n\nHezbollah, meanwhile, announced the death of four of its fighters.\n\nLebanon's official National News Agency reported Israeli strikes on several areas in south Lebanon on Wednesday morning, including on the border village of Khiam, where an AFP photographer saw a large cloud of smoke.\n\nHezbollah later said it had fired \"dozens of Katyusha rockets and artillery rounds\" towards a barracks in Kiryat Shmona in northern Israel in retaliation for the attacks.\n\nIsrael said the Hezbollah attack caused no casualties and that its own \"artillery struck the sources of fire.\"\n\nThe day before, Hezbollah released a more than nine-minute video showing aerial footage purportedly taken over northern Israel, including what it said were sensitive military, defense and energy facilities and infrastructure in the city and port of Haifa.\n\nSpeaking on a visit to troops on the northern border, Israel's military chief Lieutenant General Herzi Halevi said the video showed \"a capability that we knew about\" and that Israel was \"creating solutions to deal with\" it.\n\n\"We of course have infinitely greater capabilities,\" he added.\n\n- 'Total war' -\n\nThe Israeli army's announcement that its plans for an offensive in Lebanon had been approved, along with a warning from Foreign Minister Israel Katz of Hezbollah's destruction in a \"total war\", came as U.S. envoy Amos Hochstein visited the region to push for de-escalation.\n\nHochstein returned to Israel on Tuesday evening for more talks with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu after a series of meetings in Lebanon, according to an Israeli official.\n\nFormer Israeli security officials were split on the significance of the approval, with one telling AFP there would be an operation in Lebanon \"within a few weeks\" while another said the government was \"more interested in a ceasefire.\"\n\nThe cross-border violence has killed at least 478 people in Lebanon, most of them fighters but also including 93 civilians, according to an AFP tally.\n\nIsraeli authorities say at least 15 soldiers and 11 civilians have been killed in Israel's north.", "source": {"uri": "naharnet.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Naharnet"}, "authors": [],

In this sense, the Cypriot president, Nikos Christodoulides, highlighted his role as a humanitarian facilitator, which is \"recognised globally and particularly in the Arab world\".\n\nIn addition to this message to Nicosia, Nasrallah once again used his traditional warmongering rhetoric towards Israel, assuring that no part of the Hebrew state \"will be spared\" from Hezbollah's rockets in the event of an open war.\n\n\"The enemy knows well that we have prepared for the worst,\" Nasrallah said in his televised speech during a ceremony dedicated to Taleb Abdullah, a senior Shi'ite militia commander who was recently eliminated by Israel. Abdullah is the most senior Hezbollah official Israel has taken out since the start of hostilities in October.\n\nRespecting the escalating conflict, Nasrallah admitted that his militia is not seeking \"all-out war\" and is only acting in support of Hamas. \"We will continue to support Gaza and we are ready for anything. We are not afraid. Our demand is clear: a complete and permanent ceasefire in Gaza,\" stressed Nasrallah, who rejected the truce plan recently proposed by US President Joe Biden, as it does not stipulate that the cessation of fighting should be permanent.\n\nIn the event of open war, a scenario that seems increasingly likely, Nasrallah said Hezbollah would fight \"without rules\". \"Israel knows that what awaits it in the Mediterranean is also very big,\" Nasrallah added, without elaborating. This warning, according to The Times of Israel, could refer to attacks by the militia on Israeli offshore gas platforms.\n\nIn his speech, Nasrallah also highlighted Hezbollah's military capabilities, referring to a video recently released by the Lebanese militia showing civilian and military infrastructure near Haifa.\n\nThe video, filmed during the day by a drone, shows residential neighbourhoods and a military complex near Haifa, as well as the city's port. Haifa's mayor, Yona Yahav, called the video \"psychological terror\", demanding a protection plan for his city, something also demanded by local authorities in northern Israel.\n\nAccording to Nasrallah, Hizbollah has \"hours\" of such footage and information on military targets inside Israel, including some that are not in the north of the country.\n\nFor his part, IDF Chief of Staff Lieutenant General Herzi Halevi downplayed the significance of Hezbollah's publication of the images, stressing that the army is \"preparing and building solutions to deal with such capabilities\". He added that the IDF possesses \"infinitely more powerful capabilities\" that Hizbollah is unaware of. Moreover, Israeli military authorities have approved an \"operational plan\" for the offensive in Lebanon.\n\nIn an effort to reduce tension and avoid an escalation of war, US Special Envoy Amos Hochstein visited Israel and Lebanon this week, where he met with Lebanese army commander Joseph Aoun in the presence of US Ambassador to Beirut Lisa Johnson.\n\nHochstein also held a meeting with Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri and the country's interim prime minister, Najib Mikati, who stressed that Lebanon does not seek an escalation on the border, calling for an end to \"continued Israeli aggression and the return of calm and stability on the southern border,\" according to the National News Agency.\n\nFurthermore, according to The Wall Street Journal, Hochstein has engaged in indirect talks with Hezbollah with Berri as an intermediary. Washington is seeking a deal involving the withdrawal of the Iranian-backed militia from the border area, relocating some 30 kilometres north of the border with Israel. Hezbollah has rejected this, maintaining its offensive against Israel until a Gaza truce is established on its terms.", "source": {"uri": "atalayar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Atalayar"},

Cyprus remains uninvolved in any military conflict, and positions itself as part of the solution -- not as a problem,\" the Cyprus Mail reported.\n\nChristodoulidis added that \"our humanitarian corridor is evidence of our commitment to peace and stability,\" in an apparent reference to humanitarian aid shipments to the Gaza Strip via a Mediterranean Sea route established in recent months, with the vessels departing from the Port of Larnaca.\n\nNasrallah warned that Israel, not Hezbollah, should be fearful and that nowhere in Israel would be safe in the case of a wider war, which he said that Hezbollah is not seeking, with the terror army fighting with \"no rules\" and \"no ceilings.\"\n\nThe terror group has been pounding northern Israeli communities since joining the war in support of Hamas just one day after the Oct. 7 terrorist attacks. Tens of thousands of Israelis have been evacuated from border communities, and the Hezbollah rockets and drones have resulted in dozens of deaths and injuries, in addition to widespread physical destruction and of late, major fires, on the Israeli side.\n\nIsrael has responded with airstrikes on Hezbollah terror targets and operatives throughout Lebanon. However, the conflict has not blown into a full-scale war.\n\n\"An invasion of the Galilee remains on the table if the confrontation escalates,\" Nasrallah proclaimed.\n\nHe added that the terror group would continue to support Gaza until a \"complete and permanent ceasefire\" is in place.\n\n'Preparing for every scenario'\n\nMeanwhile, Defense Minister Yoav Gallant and IDF Chief of the General Staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi held an operational situation assessment with IDF's Northern Command together with the head of the Northern Command and commander of the Israeli Air Force.\n\nAccording to a statement by the Defense Ministry, they addressed developments in the northern arena, Gallant emphasizing thwarting the threat from drone attacks and efforts to eliminate senior Hezbollah officials.\n\n\"We are achieving readiness on land and in the air, strengthening our intelligence systems and preparing for every scenario,\" Gallant said.\n\nHe also reminded that \"we must all remember that Hezbollah started a war against us on Oct. 8\" -- a day after Hamas infiltrated the Gaza border and assaulted communities in southern Israel, murdering 1,200 people and kidnapping as many as 250. \"We have an obligation to change the situation in the north and to ensure the safe return of our citizens to their homes, and we will find a way to achieve this.\"", "source": {"uri": "tjvnews.com", "dataType":

The IDF statement said it is preparing to \"accelerate readiness in the field.\"\n\n\"Storming the Galilee is a possibility that remains present within the framework of any war that the occupation may launch against Lebanon,\" Hezbollah's Secretary-General continued.\n\nAnd that's when he for the first time of the conflict which began in wake of Oct.7 issued a warning against Cyprus, given that the Greek-speaking island-nation currently has a bilateral defense cooperation agreement with Israel.\n\n\"Opening Cypriot airports and bases to the Israeli enemy to target Lebanon would mean that the Cypriot government is part of the war, and the resistance will deal with it as part of the war,\" Nasrallah said.\n\nHe further warned that targets in the Mediterranean would also come under attack. In 2006 the Israeli Navy's INS Hanit warship suffered a direct hit from a Hezbollah anti-ship missile (likely made by Iran), killing four soldiers.\n\nHis fresh words are also being interpreted by Israeli media to say gas fields in the Mediterranean and energy platforms could also be attacked:\n\nIsrael \"knows that what also awaits it in the Mediterranean is very big,\" Nasrallah added, without elaborating, possibly insinuating the group could attack its offshore gas rigs.\n\nWhile Israel is not known to have any bases or ports in Cyprus, it has on occasion conducted joint military drills with Cypriot forces.\n\nMore likely is a scenario where Israeli jets would take off from Cypriot bases - or else one of the two British bases maintained on Cyprus. Any bigger Israeli anti-Hezbollah operation in Lebanon would without doubt involve a ratcheting air war over southern Lebanon.\n\nNasrallah in his Tuesday statement warned further, \"We developed some of our weapons and used new weapons that we had not used previously.\" Israeli leaders are concerned about recent drone image Hezbollah was able to capture over Haifa, which is Israel's third largest city.", "source": {"uri": "zerohedge.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Zero Hedge"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hezbollah", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hezbollah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebanon", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lebanon"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Lebanon"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyprus", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cyprus"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Cyprus"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hassan_Nasrallah", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hassan Nasrallah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Israel Defense Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galilee", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Galilee"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediterranean_Sea", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mediterranean Sea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia_Islam", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shia Islam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramilitary", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paramilitary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INS_Hanit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "INS Hanit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_Navy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Israeli Navy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary-General_of_the_United_Nations", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Secretary-General of the United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-ship_missile", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anti-ship missile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Lebanon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Southern Lebanon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned_aerial_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Unmanned aerial vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haifa", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Haifa"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Haifa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Iran"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History", "label": "dmoz/Society/History", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Strength_Sports/Tug-of-War", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Strength Sports/Tug-of-War", "wgt": 16}], "image": "https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/styles/16_9_max_700/public/2024-06/hanit.jpg?itok=kA3HVQsR", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9665510", "eventUri": "eng-9665510", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.4666666666666667, "wgt": 171, "relevance": 1}

We are moving into a time of global war, and the death and destruction that we will witness will be off the charts. World War I was supposed to be \"the war to end all wars\", and it resulted in approximately 20 million deaths. It was a truly nightmarish conflict, and those living at the time thought that we would never see anything like it again.\n\nBut then World War II erupted, and it resulted in approximately 75 million deaths. Sadly, global leaders seem to have forgotten the lessons of World War II, because now the stage is being set for the biggest war in human history so far. During World War III, billions of people could die. Unfortunately, it appears that there will be no turning back now.\n\nIt is my personal opinion that the war in the Middle East will be the first conflict to rise to an apocalyptic level.\n\nOn Wednesday, Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant warned the media that he feels that there is \"an obligation to change the situation in the north\"\n\nIsraeli officials on Wednesday escalated threats against Lebanon's Hezbollah amidst escalating cross-border exchanges of fire between the two sides.\n\n\"We are completing the land and air preparedness, strengthening the intelligence systems, and preparing for any possibility,\" Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant told the press before meeting with military chief Herzi Halevi and senior commanders in the Northern Command headquarters in the city of Safed.\n\n\"We have an obligation to change the situation in the north,\" he stressed.\n\nIn other words, Gallant fully intends to push Hezbollah back so that approximately 100,000 Israeli citizens can safely return to their homes in northern Israel.\n\nAnother Israeli official has issued an even more ominous warning...\n\nMeanwhile, the Israeli Ynet news site reported that an anonymous \"senior Israeli government official\" told the news outlet that \"if Hezbollah continues to attack Israel, southern Lebanon will look like Gaza. Beirut will not be immune.\"\n\nThose are very strong words.\n\nThis week the Biden administration has been trying desperately to find a diplomatic solution that will satisfy both sides, but that endeavor was never going to succeed.\n\nMeanwhile, Israeli officials have been making preparations for a ground invasion of southern Lebanon, and it is being reported that \"operational plans for an offensive in Lebanon\" have been officially approved...\n\nThe Israel Defense Forces (IDF) on Tuesday announced that plans to launch an offensive in Lebanon against Hezbollah have been formally approved.\n\nThe IDF statement further said it is preparing to \"accelerate readiness in the field\" at a moment the situation is deteriorating, given the Lebanese paramilitary group backed by Iran has in the last days sent hundreds of drones and missiles into northern Israel. The statement spelled out that \"operational plans for an offensive in Lebanon were approved.\"\n\nI was stunned when I read that. I knew that this was coming, but I didn't think it was coming quite so quickly.\n\nWhen the IDF enters southern Lebanon, it will mean all-out war.\n\nOn Wednesday, the leader of Hezbollah warned vaguely of \"new weapons and intelligence capabilities\" that his organization now possesses...\n\nLebanon's Hezbollah has new weapons and intelligence capabilities that could help it target more critical positions deeper inside Israel in case of an all-out war, the militant group's leader warned on Wednesday.\n\nHassan Nasrallah's comments came as the monthslong cross-border conflict simmering between Hezbollah and Israel appears to be reaching a boiling point and a day after a top U.S. envoy met Lebanese officials in his latest attempt to ease tensions.\n\nAnd this week Hezbollah also released some very alarming footage...\n\nThe Hezbollah terror group published footage on Tuesday from what it said was one of its reconnaissance drones flying over northern Israel, including the Haifa port, as Israel said it struck down more suspected drones over the Western Galilee.\n\nIt was unclear when the roughly 10 minutes of footage released by Hezbollah were captured, and the Israel Defense Forces did not immediately comment on the video.\n\nIran has provided Hezbollah with a vast arsenal of very sophisticated missiles, and once an all-out war erupts tens of thousands of those missiles will rain down on Israeli cities.\n\nThere will not be a single city in all of Israel that will be out of range.\n\nThe Kremlin now says that the next formal proposal on the horizon will be a document of the Ukrainian government's surrender. This was stated by Russia's chief delegate to the Vienna talks on military security and arms control, Konstantin Gavrilov, in a Rossiya-24 television interview.\n\n\"There are points of no return. The next thing that Russia will have to offer will be the document about [the Kiev government's] surrender,\" he said. He called last week's proposals by Putin \"realistic\" and said they could end the war if they were embraced.\n\nThe Russians are steadily gaining ground, and so they feel like they have all the leverage that they need.\n\nBut western leaders are absolutely obsessed with winning this conflict, and they insist that they will keep ramping up their efforts for as long as it takes.", "source":

This site does not give financial, investment or medical advice.\n\nSteven Sahiounie, journalist and political commentator\n\nUS special envoy Amos Hochstein arrived in Beirut on Tuesday morning with a packed schedule of meetings. He is the special presidential coordinator for global infrastructure and energy security, and was successful in brokering a maritime border deal between Israel and Lebanon in 2022, but on this trip he is attempting to make a deal to avoid war between Israel and the Lebanese resistance group, Hezbollah.\n\nAfter the October 7 attack on Israel, the conflict in Gaza began. Hezbollah began strikes on October 8 in solidarity with the Palestinian resistance, and call for the end of Israeli military occupation.\n\nThe south of Lebanon was occupied by the Israeli military from 1985 to 2000. Israel had ruled the Lebanese with an iron fist, imprisoning hundreds of Lebanese in the infamous Khaim prison, including women and children. Hezbollah successfully brought about the Israeli withdrawal from Lebanon.\n\nOn the latest leg of Hochstein's regional de-escalation tour, he met with caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati at noon, after a morning meeting with both Parliamentary Speaker Nabih Berri, and Lebanese Army head Joseph Aoun.\n\nHochstein was in Israel yesterday, where he met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has dissolved his war cabinet after key members had resigned. Netanyahu is shackled by the extreme right-wing Jewish fanatics who prop-up his government, and refuse to consider any ceasefire in Gaza. Their only goal is the total extermination of the Palestinians in Gaza.\n\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken said during a tour of the Middle East that a cease-fire in Gaza was the best way to end the violence between Hezbollah and Israel, and President Biden has pushed for a ceasefire proposal to end the suffering in Gaza.\n\nUN officials have warned of a possible 'miscalculation' along Israel-Lebanon border which could erupt into a full-blown war between Lebanon and Israel, and likely opening a wider regional conflict which could be the end of Israel.\n\nIsraeli defense minister Gallant complained to Hochstein about Hezbollah's almost daily attacks on Israel's northern towns.\n\nIsrael has conducted targeted assassinations of top Hezbollah commanders in air raids across southern Lebanon and on Baalbek in the east. The continuing Israeli attacks on Lebanon have killed civilians as well, and caused many communities to leave their homes.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported that Hochstein is holding indirect talks with Hezbollah through Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri, who is the leader of another Lebanese resistance group, Amal, which is allied with Hezbollah.\n\nBerri is a dual Lebanese-American citizen and has been the Speaker of the Lebanese Parliament for the past three decades. He and Hochstein are discussing a possible agreement to end hostilities between Israel and Hezbollah.\n\nHezbollah has stated a ceasefire in Gaza would bring a halt to attacks on the north of Israel. However, Israel's refusal of the ceasefire proposal supported by Biden has kept the conflict ongoing.\n\nUS President Joe Biden stressed on Monday that he does not want to see escalation at the Lebanon-Israel border and suggested that the US is advancing a proposal to avert a large-scale conflict.\n\nWhile Hezbollah has attacked mainly military targets, Israel responded by bombing villages across southern Lebanon and targeting Hezbollah positions.\n\nIsraeli officials have promised to push Hezbollah back from their country's northern borders, after about 5,000 rockets have fell across the north and driven Israelis from their homes.\n\nSome Israeli officials have been calling for a more forceful response to Hezbollah's attacks and some have called for the destruction of the airport and port in Beirut. The Lebanese public are split over the support of Hezbollah, with a small minority against the resistance group, and aligned with the US and France.\n\nLast week, Gallant rejected a French proposal for Israel, France and the US to form a working group to help avoid war at the Lebanese border. Gallant represents those who support the total annihilation of the Palestinians in Gaza as the only goal.\n\nGlobal protests against the genocide in Gaza have had a massive effect on mobilizing the call for the end of the occupation of Palestine, and a demand for the UN resolution calling for a two-state solution to the conflict lasting 70 years.\n\nHowever, Biden had continued to send weapons and cash to Israel in direct conflict with the US State Department regulations preventing US weapons being sent to countries likely to break humanitarian laws. The UN and others have accused Israel of apartheid, war crimes, and genocide.\n\nBiden has proposed a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas; however, the extremists in the Netanyahu government have rejected the ceasefire. It appears that the Jewish feel they can defy and disappoint the White House without any repercussions.\n\nSteven Sahiounie is a two-time award-winning journalist\n\nfrom

At the time, Israel was tiny, weak, and without strong allies. As a result, the \"Old Man,\" as the prime minister was known, decided that Israel needed to always fight its wars within enemy territory and never inside Israel. The reason was simple: Israel is a country with narrow borders and lacks strategic depth.\n\nThis vulnerability was starkly illustrated on October 7, when Hamas invaded Israel. Within minutes, terrorists were inside Israeli communities, slaughtering and abducting civilians.\n\nBen-Gurion's principle has been consistently violated since October 7 in Israel's north, where nearly 100,000 people have been evacuated from their homes, and the IDF has created a buffer zone to prevent casualties from daily Hezbollah rocket and anti-tank missile attacks.\n\nThis marks a sharp break from the past. For example, in the Gaza Strip, Israel controlled the territory militarily from 1967 until its unilateral withdrawal in 2005. In the years since, up until October 7, all operations were conducted within Gaza, never inside Israel.\n\nIn the north, a similar strategy was in place until eight months ago. In 1982, Israel launched an offensive in Lebanon to eliminate Palestinian terrorists. As the war wound down, the IDF created a \"security zone\" in southern Lebanon, which it held for 18 years until 2000. And in 2006, when Hezbollah infiltrated Israel and abducted two IDF reservists, the Israeli government embarked on a 34-day war aimed at weakening and deterring the terrorist group.\n\nToday though, this security zone is within Israel, as Hezbollah continues to unleash on northern Israel daily barrages rockets, anti-tank missiles, and suicide drones.\n\nAfter eight months of this unprecedented attack from Lebanon and facing a sharp increase in rocket fire over the last few weeks, Israelis are increasingly frustrated with the situation in the north.\n\nIn Gaza, the IDF is actively conquering territory and degrading Hamas capabilities, providing Israeli residents of the south with a horizon for returning home. On the other hand, in the north, no assurances exist.\n\nWhile the IDF has killed nearly 350 Hezbollah operatives and attacked some of the group's infrastructure in southern Lebanon, this is just a drop in the bucket compared to what the Iranian proxy is believed to possess. IDF intelligence claims Hezbollah has more than 150,000 rockets, many capable of striking deep inside Israel, and in a future war, the Iranian proxy could fire up to 5,000 rockets a day.\n\nAll of this presents Israel with a daunting dilemma. One school of thought advocates for containing the threat from Lebanon rather than initiating a wider war. This approach is based on three reasons.\n\nFirst, American and Israeli intelligence both believe Hezbollah does not want a wider war but aims to continue attacking Israel in the north as a show of solidarity with Hamas in Gaza. If Hezbollah desired a larger conflict, this thinking goes, it could easily provoke one by firing rockets into Tel Aviv or Haifa, forcing Israel to retaliate against Beirut.\n\nSecond, Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah has stated that he would cease attacks on Israel once the war in Gaza ends. If Israel is heading in that direction anyway, why initiate a northern war now?\n\nThird, unlike Hamas, Hezbollah is seen as capable of reaching a diplomatic deal to end the hostilities due to its deep entrenchment in Lebanese governance and politics, and its fear that a war leading to Lebanon's devastation could turn the Lebanese people against it.\n\nOn the other hand, the philosophical argument is straightforward. If October 7 taught Israel anything, it is that a policy of containment does not work. When a strong enemy on your border is attacking and threatening you, the obligation is to take it seriously. Israel told itself for years that Hamas was deterred, but that illusion shattered at 6:29 am on October 7 when thousands of Hamas fighters breached the border and ravaged southern Israel.\n\nHezbollah should not be viewed differently. This terrorist group was created to deter, weaken, and even attempt to destroy Israel. It has partially succeeded; Israel has evacuated the north and is largely deterred from war, as evidenced by its limited attacks until now against Hezbollah.\n\nThe challenge remains: How does Israel get its residents to return to their homes? If Hezbollah remains on the other side of the border and there is no extensive operation to remove it, why would anyone return home? There are potential solutions, such as deploying large forces on the border and within each borderline community, but these might not be sustainable in the long term.\n\nNeither option is a good one, but only one provides a future that Israelis deserve: The threat from the north needs to be removed, and if it cannot be done via diplomacy, the IDF will need to act.\n\nBen-Gurion understood in the 1950s the potential threats that Israelis are experiencing more than 70 years later. The choices Israel makes now will not only shape its immediate future but will also define its security posture in the wider Middle East for decades to come.\n\nYaakov Katz is a senior fellow at JPPI,

Hamas and Hezbollah both benefit from Iranian patronage and the Lebanese group says it stands in solidarity with the plight of the Palestinian people, more than 37,000 of whom have been killed since the start of the offensive, according to figures from the local Health Ministry.\n\nHostilities intensified after the IDF reported last week that an Israeli strike in the southern Lebanese village of Jouaiyya killed a senior Hezbollah commander, Sami Taleb Abdullah, and three other members of the group. As recently as Wednesday morning, the Hezbollah-aligned al-Manar TV news channel reported that the group had launched a missile attack targeting Israeli soldiers' positions in Metula in Israel, according to a Google translation. CNBC could not independently confirm the report.\n\nThe IDF's announcement comes after Hezbollah released a nine-minute video of what it claims to be aerial footage captured by surveillance drones. The Lebanese group said the area revealed in the clips spans 6.5 square kilometers (2.5 square miles) of Israel and is located 24 kilometers (nearly 15 miles) from Lebanon's border with the Palestinian territories, claiming that it includes the port and military base of Haifa. and the Rafael military complex. CNBC was unable to verify this footage and contacted the Israeli military to verify its authenticity.\n\nThe video sparked fear and fury in Israel, where Haifa Mayor Yona Yahav compared it to \"psychological terror against the people of Haifa and the north,\" according to Reuters.\n\nForeign Minister Israel Katz said in a social media update that his country is now \"very close to the moment of the decision to change the rules against Hezbollah and Lebanon.\" In an all-out war, Hezbollah will be destroyed and Lebanon will be seriously affected. \"\n\nKatz acknowledged the likely toll on Israel, which is strained by the simultaneous fight against Hamas in the Gaza enclave, and faces growing international pressure to limit Palestinian civilian casualties.\n\n\"The State of Israel will pay a price on the front and on the home front, but with a strong, united nation and the full might of the IDF, we will restore security to the people of the north,\" the foreign minister said .\n\n\"I remind you that, according to the United Nations, there is no territorial dispute between Lebanon and Israel,\" Israeli government spokesperson David Mencer said at a press briefing on Tuesday. \"Whether diplomatically or militarily, one way or another we will guarantee the safe and secure return of Israelis to their homes in northern Israel. This is not up for negotiation.\"\n\nSecurity concerns have pushed thousands of Lebanese and Israeli civilians to flee their border settlements.\n\n\"A Greater War\"\n\nThe two neighboring states have been in a theoretical U.N.-brokered ceasefire since a 34-day war in 2006. The United States, which views Israel's ties with Lebanon as closely linked to the chances of a truce in the Gaza Strip, attempted to defuse the hostilities. US envoy Amos Hochstein met with Israeli and Lebanese leaders earlier this week.\n\n\"Let's be clear: the conflict along the Blue Line [of demarcation] between Israel and Hezbollah has not lasted long enough,\" Hochstein said at a press briefing Tuesday, during a visit to Beirut.\n\nHe highlighted the White House's ambitions to avoid the conflict spilling over into a broader war, noting: \"The conversations I had here today in Beirut and those I had yesterday in Israel are being conducted because the situation is serious, we have experienced an escalation in recent weeks, and what [U.S.] President [Joe] Biden wants to avoid further escalation towards a bigger war. That's the effort here.\"\n\nLebanon has since sought to distance itself from the hostilities.\n\n\"Lebanon does not seek escalation, and what is needed is to end the ongoing Israeli aggression against Lebanon and return to calm and stability on the southern border,\" said the Prime Minister.

Unfortunately, it appears that there will be no turning back now.\n\nIt is my personal opinion that the war in the Middle East will be the first conflict to rise to an apocalyptic level.\n\nOn Wednesday, Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant warned the media that he feels that there is \"an obligation to change the situation in the north\"...\n\nIsraeli officials on Wednesday escalated threats against Lebanon's Hezbollah amidst escalating cross-border exchanges of fire between the two sides.\n\n\"We are completing the land and air preparedness, strengthening the intelligence systems, and preparing for any possibility,\" Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant told the press before meeting with military chief Herzi Halevi and senior commanders in the Northern Command headquarters in the city of Safed.\n\n\"We have an obligation to change the situation in the north,\" he stressed.\n\nIn other words, Gallant fully intends to push Hezbollah back so that approximately 100,000 Israeli citizens can safely return to their homes in northern Israel.\n\nAnother Israeli official has issued an even more ominous warning...\n\nMeanwhile, the Israeli Ynet news site reported that an anonymous \"senior Israeli government official\" told the news outlet that \"if Hezbollah continues to attack Israel, southern Lebanon will look like Gaza. Beirut will not be immune.\"\n\nThose are very strong words.\n\nThis week the Biden administration has been trying desperately to find a diplomatic solution that will satisfy both sides, but that endeavor was never going to succeed.\n\nMeanwhile, Israeli officials have been making preparations for a ground invasion of southern Lebanon, and it is being reported that \"operational plans for an offensive in Lebanon\" have been officially approved...\n\nThe Israel Defense Forces (IDF) on Tuesday announced that plans to launch an offensive in Lebanon against Hezbollah have been formally approved.\n\nThe IDF statement further said it is preparing to \"accelerate readiness in the field\" at a moment the situation is deteriorating, given the Lebanese paramilitary group backed by Iran has in the last days sent hundreds of drones and missiles into northern Israel. The statement spelled out that \"operational plans for an offensive in Lebanon were approved.\"\n\nI was stunned when I read that.\n\nI knew that this was coming, but I didn't think it was coming quite so quickly.\n\nWhen the IDF enters southern Lebanon, it will mean all-out war.\n\nOn Wednesday, the leader of Hezbollah warned vaguely of \"new weapons and intelligence capabilities\" that his organization now possesses...\n\nLebanon's Hezbollah has new weapons and intelligence capabilities that could help it target more critical positions deeper inside Israel in case of an all-out war, the militant group's leader warned on Wednesday.\n\nHassan Nasrallah's comments came as the monthslong cross-border conflict simmering between Hezbollah and Israel appears to be reaching a boiling point and a day after a top U.S. envoy met Lebanese officials in his latest attempt to ease tensions.\n\nAnd this week Hezbollah also released some very alarming footage...\n\nThe Hezbollah terror group published footage on Tuesday from what it said was one of its reconnaissance drones flying over northern Israel, including the Haifa port, as Israel said it struck down more suspected drones over the Western Galilee.\n\nIt was unclear when the roughly 10 minutes of footage released by Hezbollah were captured, and the Israel Defense Forces did not immediately comment on the video.\n\nIran has provided Hezbollah with a vast arsenal of very sophisticated missiles, and once an all-out war erupts tens of thousands of those missiles will rain down on Israeli cities.\n\nThere will not be a single city in all of Israel that will be out of range.\n\nHow do you think Israel might choose to respond in such a scenario?\n\nYou might want to start thinking about that.\n\nElsewhere, it looks like any chance for peace in Ukraine is gone.\n\nApparently the Russians are now saying that the next proposal that they will offer to Ukraine will be an offer to surrender...\n\nThe Kremlin now says that the next formal proposal on the horizon will be a document of the Ukrainian government's surrender. This was stated by Russia's chief delegate to the Vienna talks on military security and arms control, Konstantin Gavrilov, in a Rossiya-24 television interview.\n\n\"There are points of no return. The next thing that Russia will have to offer will be the document about [the Kiev government's] surrender,\" he said. He called last week's proposals by Putin \"realistic\" and said they could end the war if they were embraced.\n\nThe Russians are steadily gaining ground, and so they feel like they have all the leverage that they need.\n\nBut western leaders are absolutely obsessed with winning this conflict, and they insist that they will keep ramping up their efforts for as long as it takes.\n\nIn the end, it appears that both sides are willing to keep escalating matters until someone pushes things a little bit too far.\n\nLet us hope that day does not arrive any time soon.\n\nUnfortunately, when we do find ourselves in a direct war with Russia we could also find ourselves in a direct war with North Korea at the same time because those two nations just signed a mutual defense pact...\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un signed a new pact Wednesday that includes a pledge of mutual defense if either is attacked.\n\nThe agreement was sealed at a summit in Pyongyang during a rare visit by Putin to the reclusive nuclear-armed state as both countries face growing confrontations with the West.\n\nThis is really big news.\n\nI don't know why it isn't getting more coverage by the western media.\n\nThe Russians have been making all sorts of unusual moves lately. For example, it is being reported that Vladimir Putin just picked his niece to be Deputy Minister of Defense of the Russian Federation...\n\nPutin's niece Anna Tsivileva has been appointed as Deputy Minister of Defense of the Russian Federation, as stated in the official decree published on Russia's legal acts portal. Pavel Fradkov, the youngest son of Mikhail Fradkov, Director of the Russian Institute for Strategic Studies and former Prime Minister and chief of foreign intelligence, has also been appointed as Deputy Minister of Defense.\n\nAnna Tsivileva is married to Sergey Tsivilyev, Russia's Minister of Energy, who assumed office in May after leading the Kemerovo Region. Tsivileva, formerly Anna Putina, has been previously reported by Agentstvo to be President Putin's second cousin.\n\nEven for Putin, I thought that this was a rather bizarre thing to do.\n\nBut I guess they do things differently over there.\n\nBefore I close this article, I also wanted to discuss a couple of new developments regarding China.\n\nA new weapons package for Taiwan that is worth approximately 360 million dollars has been approved, and this isn't going to make the Chinese happy at all...\n\nThe US State Department has approved a new weapons sale to Taiwan involving hundreds of armed drones and missiles worth $360 million, the Pentagon's Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) has said.\n\nUnder the deal that was concluded on Tuesday, Taiwan will receive Altius-600M systems, which are unmanned aerial vehicles equipped with warheads, and related equipment at an estimated cost of $300 million, the agency said.\n\nOf course the Chinese have been preparing for war as well, and those preparations have included expanding the size of their nuclear arsenal faster than anyone else...\n\nChina is expanding its nuclear arsenal faster than any other major superpower, and is in command of 500, a top European think tank has warned.\n\nThe Stockholm International Peace Research Institute wrote in a report published on Monday that Xi Xinping has increased his nation's nuclear stockpile from 410 to 500 in a single year.\n\nThe increase in nuclear weapons meant 'China is expanding its nuclear arsenal faster than any other country' in absolute terms, WMD expert Hans M Kristensen told Insider.\n\nMost people don't like to think about nuclear war, because it will mean the end of our society as we know it today.\n\nSomeday when the U.S. finds itself in such a conflict, it will be relying on an ICBM fleet that first went into service many decades ago and that is constantly needing to be repaired. The following is a brief excerpt from an excellent Time Magazine article...\n\nIf a piece of equipment breaks inside Captain Kaz \"Dexter\" Moffett's underground command center at the Alpha-01 Missile Alert Facility, it's marked with a paper tag that reads either \"warning\" or \"danger.\" A few of those are hanging in this cramped capsule buried about 70 ft. below the high plains of eastern Wyoming. One is stuck to the shut-off valves that control water flow in the event of an emergency. There's another one on a ventilation hatch. The entire command capsule itself is jury-rigged on top of steel stilts because the shock-absorber system, which was first installed in 1963 to survive a thermonuclear blast, is now inoperative. So there's a tag for Air Force maintenance teams to fix that too.\n\nThen there are malfunctions that aren't marked. Moffett's computer monitor -- the one that enables him to keep watch on a fleet of 10 nuclear-tipped intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) -- has a flashing glitch on the bottom of the screen. His classified phone line has such a weak connection that he can barely hear fellow Air Force officers who are commanding more than 100 other nuclear missiles spread across 9,600 sq. mi. \"You can hear them pretty clearly if you stand on an angle, on one leg, and jump up and down,\" Moffett says, smiling. \"It's all part of the job. We spend a lot of time saying to ourselves, 'Hey, how are we going to make this work today?'\"\n\nMost Americans don't realize that our strategic nuclear forces are in horrendous shape.\n\nIn many cases, those running the system are forced to use rotary phones and 8 inch floppy disks.\n\nMeanwhile, the Russians have introduced a new line of ultra-advanced intercontinental ballistic missiles, and the S-500 is the best anti-missile system on the entire planet by a very wide margin.\n\nI have written about all of this a lot, but I don't think that it is sinking in for most people.\n\nOver the past decade or so, the balance of power has shifted dramatically.\n\nI would highly recommend that our leaders pursue peace while they still can, because we are simply not prepared for the type of war that is now staring us in the face.", "source": {"uri": "sonsoflibertymedia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sons of Liberty Media"}, "authors": [{"uri":

The Israeli military announced Tuesday that it has approved \"operational plans\" for an offensive against the Lebanese armed group Hezbollah. Photo: Xinhua\n\nThe Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said on Wednesday that plans for an attack in southern Lebanon had been approved and steps had been taken to accelerate \"readiness of troops in the field.\"\n\nSince the onset of the Gaza conflict on October 7, Israel and Hezbollah militants have been locked in ongoing hostilities, with the rhetoric intensifying recently. Last week, Hezbollah launched rockets and drones at Israeli military sites following an Israeli strike that killed its most senior commander. The group has also hinted at potential attacks on Israel's third-largest city - Haifa, according to media reports.\n\nOn Tuesday, Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz issued a warning on X, stating, \"We are very close to the moment of decision to change the rules against Hezbollah and Lebanon. In an all-out war, Hezbollah will be destroyed, and Lebanon will be severely hit.\"\n\nFrom a historical perspective, there has long been a possibility of escalation of conflict between Israel and Hezbollah as there is a deep-seated enmity between the two sides and there have been numerous clashes over the years, Liu Zhongmin, a professor at the Middle East Studies Institute of Shanghai International Studies University, told the Global Times on Wednesday.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether the conflict between the two sides will escalate into a sustained conflict similar to that in Gaza, said Liu.\n\nThe latest round of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict has spilled over in several spots, including forces like the Houthi militants targeting Israel and the US on the Red Sea, and Iraqi militant groups launching drones and rockets.

escalate", "body": "Israel has evacuated another town along the Lebanese frontier as cross-border clashes with Hezbollah intensify, amid fears of a wider war between the two sides.\n\nResidents of the Upper Galilee town of Jish, a few kilometres from the Lebanese border and 13km north of the city of Safed, have been asked to leave their homes due to the escalation.\n\nJish is a Palestinian town in northern Israel made up of a Maronite Christian majority, as well as Melkite Christians and Sunni Muslims.\n\nTens of thousands of Israelis have already been evacuated from towns and settlements in the north since fighting with Hezbollah broke out in October, in parallel with Israel's war on Gaza.\n\nAn estimated 120,000 have been evacuated in total from the north and southern areas near the Gaza Strip, according to the Israeli Channel 12.\n\nOn the Lebanese side of the border, around 100,000 residents have been forced to leave their homes due to the Israeli strikes.\n\nIsraeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said Wednesday evening the situation in northern Israel will change either through a political settlement or wider military operation.\n\n\"I said at the end of the assessment of the situation in the Northern Command with the Chief of Staff, the Commander of the Northern Command, and the Commander of the Air Force that the IDF forces... continue to prepare against every threat that comes our way, both in defence and attack,\" Gallant wrote on X.\n\n\"The situation in the north will change with a political settlement or an extensive military operation, and we have a duty to return citizens safely to their homes.\"\n\nIsrael has repeatedly threatened to storm southern Lebanon to push Hezbollah back from the border and create a buffer zone with some Israeli ministers calling for the annihilation of the Iran-backed movement and destruction of Beirut.\n\nHezbollah says its open front with Israel is in support of the Palestinians and has refused to halt its operations until a ceasefire in Gaza is reached, where at least 37,431 Palestinians have been killed.\n\nThe US and France are trying to reach a ceasefire between Lebanon and Israel which would see the enemy states end their border dispute and possibly achieve a more lasting truce, but intense cross-border attacks in recent weeks have complicated the situation.\n\nHezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah reiterated his warnings to Israel during a speech on Wednesday, saying his group was ready for any worst-case scenario.\n\nEitan Davidi, chairman of the Israeli border settlement of Margaliot, fears that nowhere will be safe in Israel in an all-out war with Hezbollah.\n\n\"We are disturbed by the laxity and weakness of the Israeli government on the northern front,\" he said.\n\n\"The Israeli government has lost its ability to deter [Hezbollah].\"\n\nDavidi had earlier called for the Israeli military to withdraw from Margaliot to prevent the town from being a target of Hezbollah.", "source": {"uri": "newarab.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New Arab"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hezbollah", "type": "org", "score": 5,

Since, this battle may escalate into an all-out war, the Resistance group finds it necessary to determine all the aspects of the field in order to achieve better outcomes.\n\nThe Resistance Leader warned the Cypriot government against involvement in any Israeli war on Lebanon, affirming that Cyprus has been hosting Zionist military drills which simulate such hostile schemes.\n\n\"Opening Cypriot airports and bases to the Israeli enemy to target Lebanon would mean that the Cypriot government is part of the war, and the resistance will deal with it as part of the war,\" the Hezbollah chief said.\n\nNikos Christodoulides, the island's president, responded on Wednesday evening: \"Cyprus remains uninvolved in any military conflicts and positions itself as part of the solution rather the problem.\"\n\nDespite this denial, facts prove that the small island hosted Israeli military drills which simulate a war on Lebanon. Among numerous proofs, what follows is a clear Zionist source which highlight the issue.\n\nOn June 2, 2022, The Times of Israel posted an article titled, \"In Cyprus, IDF runs drills for potential war with Hezbollah, Lebanon ground assault\".\n\n\"The Mediterranean island was chosen both for its Lebanon-like terrain -- mountainous along a coastal plain -- and its proximity to Israel,\" the report mentioned.\n\nThe following video was posted by the Israeli website i24News on Youtube shows drills with the title, \"Israel Defense Forces carries out drills on Cyprus simulating war on Lebanon,\"\n\nThe denial of the Cypriot president may be diplomatically necessary; however, it cannot refute the veracity of Hezbollah Secretary General's remarks.

We are awaiting the official response,\" Korneliou told Israeli daily Yedioth Ahronoth.\n\nKorneliou also said the Greek Cypriot administration is \"trying to play a modest role in facilitating the transfer of humanitarian aid to Gaza in close coordination with Israel.\"\n\n\"I am certain that all of this is unwelcome by Hezbollah,\" he added.\n\nTalib Sami Abdullah, 55, was killed along with three other members. His death followed Wissam Al-Tawil, another top Hezbollah fighter who was assassinated by Israel in January.\n\nAbdullah was the commander of the Al Nasr Unit responsible for the group's operations between the Bint Jbeil area and the Shebaa Farms.\n\nHezbollah's media broadcast images of Abdullah in military attire with the late Iranian Quds Force commander Qasem Soleimani.\n\nTensions have risen along Lebanon's border with Israel amid cross-border attacks between Hezbollah and Israeli forces as Tel Aviv presses ahead with its deadly offensive on the Gaza Strip, which has killed nearly

border.\n\nNasrallah -- whose powerful Iran-backed group has exchanged near-daily fire with Israel since its ally Hamas's Oct. 7 attack -- also threatened the nearby island nation of Cyprus if it opened its airports or bases to Israel \"to target Lebanon.\"\n\nThe Mediterranean island is home to two British military bases including an airbase, but they are in sovereign British territory and not controlled by the Cypriot government.\n\nCypriot President Nikos Christodoulides denied his country's involvement in the war and said it was \"part of the solution,\" pointing to its role in a maritime humanitarian corridor to Gaza \"recognized by the entire international community.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the war between Israel and Hamas raged in Gaza, with Israeli air strikes and clashes between troops and Palestinian militants.\n\nWitnesses and the civil defense agency in the Hamas-run Gaza Strip reported an Israeli bombardment in western Rafah, where medics said drone strikes and shelling killed at least seven people.\n\nAnd medics at the European hospital in Khan Yunis told AFP 10 bodies were brought to the facility after an Israeli air strike killed a group of people on Salah al-Din road, east of Rafah city, as they waited for aid trucks to arrive.\n\nIslamic Jihad, a Palestinian armed group that has fought alongside Hamas, said its militants were battling troops amid Israeli shelling of western Rafah.\n\nThe war has spilled across the region, drawing in a number of Iran-backed groups saying they are acting in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza.", "source": {"uri":

We are moving into a time of global war, and the death and destruction that we will witness will be off the charts. World War I was supposed to be \"the war to end all wars\", and it resulted in approximately 20 million deaths. It was a truly nightmarish conflict, and those living at the time thought that we would never see anything like it again. But then World War II erupted, and it resulted in approximately 75 million deaths. Sadly, global leaders seem to have forgotten the lessons of World War II, because now the stage is being set for the biggest war in human history so far. During World War III, billions of people could die. Unfortunately, it appears that there will be no turning back now.\n\nIt is my personal opinion that the war in the Middle East will be the first conflict to rise to an apocalyptic level.\n\nOn Wednesday, Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant warned the media that he feels that there is \"an obligation to change the situation in the north\"...\n\nBuy All-American!

Beirut will not be immune.\"\n\nThose are very strong words.\n\nThis week the Biden administration has been trying desperately to find a diplomatic solution that will satisfy both sides, but that endeavor was never going to succeed.\n\nMeanwhile, Israeli officials have been making preparations for a ground invasion of southern Lebanon, and it is being reported that \"operational plans for an offensive in Lebanon\" have been officially approved...\n\nThe Israel Defense Forces (IDF) on Tuesday announced that plans to launch an offensive in Lebanon against Hezbollah have been formally approved.\n\nThe IDF statement further said it is preparing to \"accelerate readiness in the field\" at a moment the situation is deteriorating, given the Lebanese paramilitary group backed by Iran has in the last days sent hundreds of drones and missiles into northern Israel. The statement spelled out that \"operational plans for an offensive in Lebanon were approved.\"\n\nI was stunned when I read that.\n\nI knew that this was coming, but I didn't think it was coming quite so quickly.\n\nWhen the IDF enters southern Lebanon, it will mean all-out war.\n\nOn Wednesday, the leader of Hezbollah warned vaguely of \"new weapons and intelligence capabilities\" that his organization now possesses...\n\nLebanon's Hezbollah has new weapons and intelligence capabilities that could help it target more critical positions deeper inside Israel in case of an all-out war, the militant group's leader warned on Wednesday.\n\nHassan Nasrallah's comments came as the monthslong cross-border conflict simmering between Hezbollah and Israel appears to be reaching a boiling point and a day after a top U.S. envoy met Lebanese officials in his latest attempt to ease tensions.\n\nAnd this week Hezbollah also released some very alarming footage...\n\nThe Hezbollah terror group published footage on Tuesday from what it said was one of its reconnaissance drones flying over northern Israel, including the Haifa port, as Israel said it struck down more suspected drones over the Western Galilee.\n\nIt was unclear when the roughly 10 minutes of footage released by Hezbollah were captured, and the Israel Defense Forces did not immediately comment on the video.\n\nIran has provided Hezbollah with a vast arsenal of very sophisticated missiles, and once an all-out war erupts tens of thousands of those missiles will rain down on Israeli cities.\n\nThere will not be a single city in all of Israel that will be out of range.\n\nHow do you think Israel might choose to respond in such a scenario?\n\nYou might want to start thinking about that.\n\nElsewhere, it looks like any chance for peace in Ukraine is gone.\n\nApparently the Russians are now saying that the next proposal that they will offer to Ukraine will be an offer to surrender...\n\nThe Kremlin now says that the next formal proposal on the horizon will be a document of the Ukrainian government's surrender. This was stated by Russia's chief delegate to the Vienna talks on military security and arms control, Konstantin Gavrilov, in a Rossiya-24 television interview.\n\n\"There are points of no return. The next thing that Russia will have to offer will be the document about [the Kiev government's] surrender,\" he said. He called last week's proposals by Putin \"realistic\" and said they could end the war if they were embraced.\n\nThe Russians are steadily gaining ground, and so they feel like they have all the leverage that they need.\n\nBut western leaders are absolutely obsessed with winning this conflict, and they insist that they will keep ramping up their efforts for as long as it takes.\n\nIn the end, it appears that both sides are willing to keep escalating matters until someone pushes things a little bit too far.\n\nLet us hope that day does not arrive any time soon.\n\nUnfortunately, when we do find ourselves in a direct war with Russia we could also find ourselves in a direct war with North Korea at the same time because those two nations just signed a mutual defense pact...\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un signed a new pact Wednesday that includes a pledge of mutual defense if either is attacked.\n\nThe agreement was sealed at a summit in Pyongyang during a rare visit by Putin to the reclusive nuclear-armed state as both countries face growing confrontations with the West.\n\nThis is really big news.\n\nI don't know why it isn't getting more coverage by the western media.\n\nThe Russians have been making all sorts of unusual moves lately. For example, it is being reported that Vladimir Putin just picked his niece to be Deputy Minister of Defense of the Russian Federation...\n\nPutin's niece Anna Tsivileva has been appointed as Deputy Minister of Defense of the Russian Federation, as stated in the official decree published on Russia's legal acts portal. Pavel Fradkov, the youngest son of Mikhail Fradkov, Director of the Russian Institute for Strategic Studies and former Prime Minister and chief of foreign intelligence, has also been appointed as Deputy Minister of Defense.\n\nAnna Tsivileva is married to Sergey Tsivilyev, Russia's Minister of Energy, who assumed office in May after leading the Kemerovo Region. Tsivileva, formerly Anna Putina, has been previously reported by Agentstvo to be President Putin's second cousin.\n\nEven for Putin, I thought that this was a rather bizarre thing to do.\n\nBut I guess they do things differently over there.\n\nBefore I close this article, I also wanted to discuss a couple of new developments regarding China.\n\nA new weapons package for Taiwan that is worth approximately 360 million dollars has been approved, and this isn't going to make the Chinese happy at all...\n\nThe US State Department has approved a new weapons sale to Taiwan involving hundreds of armed drones and missiles worth $360 million, the Pentagon's Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) has said.\n\nUnder the deal that was concluded on Tuesday, Taiwan will receive Altius-600M systems, which are unmanned aerial vehicles equipped with warheads, and related equipment at an estimated cost of $300 million, the agency said.\n\nOf course the Chinese have been preparing for war as well, and those preparations have included expanding the size of their nuclear arsenal faster than anyone else...\n\nChina is expanding its nuclear arsenal faster than any other major superpower, and is in command of 500, a top European think tank has warned.\n\nThe Stockholm International Peace Research Institute wrote in a report published on Monday that Xi Xinping has increased his nation's nuclear stockpile from 410 to 500 in a single year.\n\nThe increase in nuclear weapons meant 'China is expanding its nuclear arsenal faster than any other country' in absolute terms, WMD expert Hans M Kristensen told Insider.\n\nMost people don't like to think about nuclear war, because it will mean the end of our society as we know it today.\n\nSomeday when the U.S. finds itself in such a conflict, it will be relying on an ICBM fleet that first went into service many decades ago and that is constantly needing to be repaired. The following is a brief excerpt from an excellent Time Magazine article...\n\nIf a piece of equipment breaks inside Captain Kaz \"Dexter\" Moffett's underground command center at the Alpha-01 Missile Alert Facility, it's marked with a paper tag that reads either \"warning\" or \"danger.\" A few of those are hanging in this cramped capsule buried about 70 ft. below the high plains of eastern Wyoming. One is stuck to the shut-off valves that control water flow in the event of an emergency. There's another one on a ventilation hatch. The entire command capsule itself is jury-rigged on top of steel stilts because the shock-absorber system, which was first installed in 1963 to survive a thermonuclear blast, is now inoperative. So there's a tag for Air Force maintenance teams to fix that too.\n\nThen there are malfunctions that aren't marked. Moffett's computer monitor -- the one that enables him to keep watch on a fleet of 10 nuclear-tipped intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) -- has a flashing glitch on the bottom of the screen. His classified phone line has such a weak connection that he can barely hear fellow Air Force officers who are commanding more than 100 other nuclear missiles spread across 9,600 sq. mi. \"You can hear them pretty clearly if you stand on an angle, on one leg, and jump up and down,\" Moffett says, smiling. \"It's all part of the job. We spend a lot of time saying to ourselves, 'Hey, how are we going to make this work today?'\"\n\nMost Americans don't realize that our strategic nuclear forces are in horrendous shape.\n\nIn many cases, those running the system are forced to use rotary phones and 8 inch floppy disks.\n\nMeanwhile, the Russians have introduced a new line of ultra-advanced intercontinental ballistic missiles, and the S-500 is the best anti-missile system on the entire planet by a very wide margin.\n\nI have written about all of this a lot, but I don't think that it is sinking in for most people.\n\nOver the past decade or so, the balance of power has shifted dramatically.\n\nI would highly recommend that our leaders pursue peace while they still can, because we are simply not prepared for the type of war that is now staring us in the face.\n\nArticle posted with permission from Michael Snyder\n\nTim Brown Tim Brown is a Christian and lover of liberty, a husband to his \"more precious than rubies\" wife, father of 10 \"mighty arrows\" and jack of all trades.

The intensifying war of words, punctuated by aerial ordinance exchanges, reached a peak recently when Hezbollah made public drone footage of Haifa, the Israeli city closest to Lebanon, itemizing various military and industrial locations. Hezbollah, in effect, announced it had clear knowledge of strategic zones, intended to strike them, and is able to fly a reconnaissance drone above the city unhindered. And this as Israel has completed a plan to invade Lebanon to quell Hezbollah. The next step seems inevitable after months of hostilities. According to CNN, \"Hezbollah has fired more than 5,000 rockets, missiles and drones at northern Israel since October 7... For its part, Israel has carried out hundreds of strikes in Lebanon and evacuated approximately 60,000 residents from the northern border. More than 90,000 Lebanese have also fled their homes in the area.\"\n\nYou'd be forgiven for thinking that a war by any other name already exists. But an Israeli ground campaign constitutes a quantum step further. The US and its allies have warned both sides against it, especially Hezbollah with allied threats of intervention on the side of Israel. What would that mean and what are the prospective geostrategic scenarios?\n\nFirst a little history. The last such war in 2006 resulted in much destruction on the Lebanese end and Israel lost 55 Merkava tanks, which surprised the Israelis. It had unexpected repercussions. For example, when I covered the 2008 Russian invasion of Georgia for the Wall Street Journal, the then President of Georgia told me that anti aircraft missiles sold by Israel to Georgia could not be used against Russian planes because Putin had warned Israel he would resupply Hezbollah if Israel helped Georgia. In other words, a localized war between Israel and Hezbollah doesn't stay localized. Putin became more influential in Israel subsequently with the carrot added to the stick - a lot of Russian oligarchs took dual Israeli citizenship and Russian money flowed into Israel. Let us not forget that, when Barack Obama was elected President, Putin made a show of pointedly visiting Israel before him, to illustrate Moscow's closer relations.\n\nThings are different now. Putin was forced to pick sides between Iran and Israel because Moscow is dependent on Iran for weapons and drones in Ukraine. And Iran is Hezbollah's chief backer. So expect Russian support for Hezbollah via Iran. Relevant contacts in Israel suggested to me that stealth technology for the drone flying undetected above Haifa possibly came from Russia. But also expect a massive online troll and bot campaign globally against Israel once the border is crossed. Comparable to Gaza. Only Moscow has the global disinformation network to take it to the Western world's streets and colleges as happened with Gaza.\n\nThe effect is global in the sense that it puts any leader up for election in a quandary - or any leader sensitive to popular sentiment on the street. In Turkey, for example, Erdogan was forced to make a public show of disinvesting from Israel. But the quandary effect will be felt by leaders far and wide, even in the US - supporting genocide or not supporting Israel enough. The point here is that the calculation was always global, with the disinformation machine fully prepared, even before October 7 lit the fuse (see my November 13 column citing stats that some 25% of social media commentary within two days were false accounts).\n\nPutin's message since his latest invasion of Ukraine was always that he would bring the war home to countries against him or not sufficiently on his side. In short, he would destabilize the world if he didn't win in Ukraine. Seen from that perspective, the actions of Hamas and Hezbollah become provocations in a much bigger geostrategic picture. There's no doubt that an Israeli ground campaign that involves invading Lebanese territory will generate ample scenes, true or false, of civilian slaughter thereby putting pressure on Western leaders, dividing the world and their own populations against them. Any Arab or Muslim country sitting on the fence will face huge internal pressure too.\n\nAnd, all this, is also why Western leaders have tried to lean on Netanyahu to limit the damage or widening of the war. They are aware that it plays into Moscow's game plan of upheaving the status quo sufficiently to affect their own elections. And currently the West is facing some critical elections - in the US, UK and France. Iran is willing to sacrifice plenty of victims for this game, as is the Kremlin.", "source": {"uri": "forbes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Forbes"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Such an escalation would almost certainly undermine future peace talks.\n\nIsrael and Hezbollah have traded tit-for-tat strikes around the border region on a near-daily basis since the war with Hamas broke out last October, with IDF raids pushing deeper into Lebanese territory in recent weeks. Tens of thousands of people have been displaced on both sides of the border due to the ongoing fighting.\n\nWhile Hochstein traveled to Lebanon in a bid to quell the hostilities with Israel, Tel Aviv has all but confirmed that it intends to go ahead with an attack regardless. On Tuesday, the IDF announced that it had approved \"operational plans\" for a larger offensive in Lebanon, but shared few other details.\n\nDuring a speech on Wednesday, Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah issued a stark warning against an Israeli offensive, saying the move would trigger a war \"without rules or ceilings.\"\n\n\"We have more than 100,000 fighters, and even more, even in the worst-case scenario. We have prepared for the worst-case scenario and Israel knows it,\" he said, adding that \"no place... will be spared our rockets.\"\n\nNasrallah also went on to stress that he does not seek \"total war\" with Israel, however, and questioned whether the IDF even has the capability to invade Lebanon after more than eight months of fighting in Gaza.", "source": {"uri": "news.antiwar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News From Antiwar.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hezbollah", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hezbollah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tel_Aviv", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tel Aviv"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tel Aviv"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebanon", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lebanon"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Lebanon"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Lebanon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of Lebanon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arabs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East_Eye", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Middle East Eye"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Najib_Mikati", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Najib Mikati"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nabih_Berri", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nabih Berri"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Israel Defense Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beirut", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Beirut"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beirut"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Lebanon"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceasefire", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ceasefire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hassan_Nasrallah", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hassan Nasrallah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rocket"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History", "label": "dmoz/Society/History", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 58}], "image": "https://news.antiwar.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/awc_logo_for-circle-profile_600sq-01.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9665510", "eventUri": "eng-9665510", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 151, "relevance": 1}

As tensions rise, Lebanese locals are left dealing with difficult choices.\n\nWhen the most recent round of fighting between Israel and the Lebanon-based militant group, Hezbollah, began, Malak Daher hoped it would only last a few days.\n\n\"It's so hard to be so far from your life,\" said the 30-year-old woman who was displaced from the southern town of Mais al-Jabal, located almost directly at the Lebanese-Israeli border where fighting is centered. \"You feel like your life is on hold. Like, life is going on elsewhere, but your own time has stopped.\"\n\nBut the fighting between the Lebanese militant group, Hezbollah, and the Israeli military did not end. In fact, over the past few weeks, it seems to have ramped up.\n\nDaher survived the 2006 war in southern Lebanon between Israel and Hezbollah but said that felt like nothing compared to the current exchange of blows.\n\nThis week, Israel put troops on high alert after Hezbollah published a surveillance video that purports to have taken over various Israeli military infrastructure and civilian installations, including some in the Israeli port city of Haifa. Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz warned the Hezbollah militants that they faced \"destruction\" amid \"all-out war\" at the Israel-Lebanon border.\n\nEarlier this month, human rights groups reported that Israel fired white phosphorous munitions over Lebanese towns in violation of international humanitarian law. Last week, Hezbollah fired more than 160 rockets into Israel in retaliation for Israel's assassination of two of their commanders.\n\nEver since the October 7, 2023, attack on southern Israel by the militant Gaza-based Hamas group, which led to the deaths of around 1,200 people, the situation on the Israel-Lebanon border has been tense.\n\nHezbollah, a powerful Lebanese group that plays a dominant part in Lebanese political and social life, considers Hamas an ally and the state of Israel an enemy.\n\nAfter two inconclusive wars in 1996 and 2006, Israeli forces and Hezbollah have preferred tit-for-tat attacks in each others' territories, without huge casualty counts.\n\nHowever, since October 7, these sorts of attacks have expanded from both sides, both in size and range.\n\nThis has raised concerns that unrest at the border will turn into a full-scale war. Because of this, concerns are growing that unrest at the border will turn into a full-scale war. Several extremist Israeli politicians have said that Israel should attack Hezbollah now. A survey this month also indicated that a majority of Israeli citizens think starting a war with Hezbollah is a good idea.\n\n\"The October 7 attacks dramatically increased Israeli insecurity,\" a March briefing by the Washington-based think tank, the Center for Strategic and International Studies, explained. \"If Hamas, less well-armed and trained than Hezbollah, can brutally kill over 1,100 Israelis, what might the more formidable Hezbollah do?\"\n\nIt is unclear whether a wider war will break out. Current international diplomatic efforts are dedicated to preventing this, and most experts argue it would be strategically unwise for Israel to open another front as it continues its military operations in Gaza. They also point out that Hezbollah is a far better armed and more powerful adversary than Hamas in Gaza.\n\nAs for Lebanon, the country has been mired in economic and political crises for years now. Even if the population sympathizes with Palestinians, more than 37,000 of whom have been killed in Gaza in the past eight months, Lebanese locals -- struggling with inflation, unemployment and political uncertainty -- are unlikely to support Hezbollah dragging them towards war.\n\nLebanese authorities say there have been more than 375 fatalities in Lebanon since October 2023, including 88 civilians, due to Israeli strikes. Israel's military has counted 18 soldiers and 10 civilians killed by Hezbollah fire.\n\nTens of thousands of civilians -- around 100,000 Lebanese and more than 60,000 Israeli -- living on both sides of the border have also been displaced by fighting.\n\nLocals told DW that those who left southern Lebanon were reluctant to return unless they absolutely need to. Some went back to check on property whenever things seemed calmer, or to attend a funeral, for example. But most shops and supermarkets in the area were closed, and it was hard to find supplies, they said.\n\nWhen Daher first fled to Beirut after border skirmishes began in late 2023, the trained nurse was unemployed. So, she said she decided to go back to work at a hospital in southeastern Bint Jbeil, also near Lebanon's border with Israel. Now, she stays there for three days, works her shifts, then returns to Beirut, where she and her mother are staying with relatives.\n\nAt one point, Daher so desperately wanted to return to Mais al-Jabal that she and her 60-year-old mother, who used to make a living growing olives and tobacco in the border village, journeyed back. But it was a nightmare, Daher told DW. They couldn't sleep because of missiles and rockets coming in all night long and simply hid in the corridor.\n\n\"I thought we were going to die together,\" recounted Daher, whose husband works in Kuwait. As soon as the sun came up, the pair returned to Beirut. Now Daher only comes back to work, even though she is well aware of how dangerous it is. In late May, an Israeli strike nearly hit the hospital where she works.\n\n\"They haven't just taken my time,\" Daher said of the Israeli military. \"They've stolen my ambitions and my peace. I have become an angry, anxious woman who waits for aid. Before this, I was an independent woman.\"\n\nA handful of people in southern Lebanon have refused to leave, despite the ongoing fighting and growing threat of war. One of them is Issam Alawieh, 44 and a father of seven. He has stayed in his home in the border village of Maroun el-Ras along with his wife and two of his sons. The family has survived three Israeli air strikes so far.\n\n\"You hear only the crash. It's like a volcano coming from beneath you,\" said Alawieh, who lost his hearing for a week after one attack.\n\nAlawieh has continued working in a bakery in nearby Bint Jbeil.\n\n\"Even though the income is not good and sales have decreased [by] 95%, I have to continue to provide food for my children,\" he told DW.\n\nLiving in such dangerous conditions was better than being displaced and forced to accept aid elsewhere, Alawieh argued. Neighbors who fled town called him crazy, he said, but he believes his family has adapted. The children were getting used to the sound of bombing.\n\n\"If I go and leave everything here, I will be humiliated, and I don't want that,\" he explained. But there's more to it than that, he added: This is his home.\n\n\"I cannot live away from south Lebanon. This land is like my mother,\" he argued. \"I cannot survive without her, and we will win as long as we are steadfast in our land.\"", "source": {"uri": "dw.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Cypriot President Nikos Christodoulides said that Nasrallah's inflammatory comments \"don't in any way reflect what's being attempted, which is to present a picture that Cyprus is involved in military operations.\"\n\nChristodoulides added that his country \"is not part of the problem, it is part of the solution\" -- a reference to a maritime aid corridor running from Larnarca to Gaza .\n\n\"After a series of Iranian-orchestrated assassination plots in Cyprus were foiled, an Iranian-backed terrorist group is now directly threatening to attack an EU member state. This cannot be allowed to pass. We already have indications that Tehran has used the Turkish-occupied north of Cyprus as a staging ground for such subversion. Might Ankara, whose energy and other geostrategic interests stand to gain from driving a wedge between Cyprus and Israel, have a hand in this new menace?\" -- Mark Dubowitz, FDD CEO\n\n\"Hezbollah's belligerence towards Cyprus is not a new phenomenon. Hezbollah and Iran's IRGC have previously targeted Israelis on Cypriot soil and been thwarted in these attempts. Cyprus has played a critical role in helping to establish a maritime corridor to provide humanitarian aid to Gaza. Nasrallah wants nothing more than to undermine the positive role Cyprus is playing in the region. These threats underscore the need to help Cyprus defend itself against terror threats by lifting all restrictions on weapon sales to the island nation.\" -- Tyler Stapleton, Director of Congressional

This comes amid reports from Israeli media and military actions on both sides.\n\nIsraeli Channel 12 reported that the Defense Minister stated, \"Hezbollah started the war and we must change the situation.\"\n\nAccording to Edioth Ahronoth, a senior political official warned, \"If Hezbollah continues to attack us, the south of Lebanon will look like Gaza, and there will be no immunity for Beirut.\"\n\nHezbollah has claimed responsibility for multiple attacks on Israeli positions. They reported targeting Israeli soldiers at Al-Baghdadi's position with a drone, causing direct hits.\n\nFurther assaults included targeting movements of Israeli soldiers at the Raheb site and bombarding the Israeli site of Jal al-Alam with artillery shells, resulting in confirmed casualties.\n\nIn his televised speech, Hasan Nasrallah declared, \"Our martyrdom is a victory, not a defeat. The battle on its Lebanese front has inflicted significant material, moral, and psychological losses on the enemy. If what is happening is normal on the southern front, why seek to stop it, and why shout, intimidate, wail, and threaten?\"\n\nNasrallah emphasized that storming Galilee remains an option if the confrontation escalates. He continued, \"The enemy hides its losses on the northern front but cannot conceal the number of evacuated settlements.\n\nSince the beginning of the Al-Aqsa flood, a global media effort has aimed to belittle the resistance fronts' actions in Gaza. Forty-two colonies were completely evacuated, and life was disrupted in many others.\"\n\nHe also highlighted the broader strategic impact, stating, \"Pressure from the Lebanon front and the steadfastness in Gaza influence negotiations.\n\nThe Yemen front reveals American-British failure and Israel's inability to fight effectively. They couldn't protect Israeli ships, a colossal failure for the world's leading naval fleets.\"\n\nNasrallah underscored Hezbollah's preparedness and intelligence capabilities: \"The Israeli enemy knows its positions will be targeted, and we have comprehensive information about their fortifications and equipment. We have fought with part of our arsenal so far and have obtained new weapons. The enemy's threats do not scare us; we are prepared for the worst days.\"\n\nNasrallah concluded with a stark warning to Cyprus: \"Opening your airports and bases to the enemy to target Lebanon means you have become part of the war.\"\n\nNotably, Israeli Channel 13 noted that Nasrallah's threats indicate that no settlement or Biden envoy has succeeded in imposing any terms, and if the war in Gaza continues, so will the escalation in the north.", "source": {"uri": "albawaba.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Al Bawaba"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hassan_Nasrallah", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hassan Nasrallah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hezbollah", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hezbollah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebanon", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lebanon"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Lebanon"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyprus", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cyprus"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Cyprus"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Israel Defense Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Defense_(Israel)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Defense (Israel)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Bawaba", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Al Bawaba"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_City", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gaza City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary-General_of_the_United_Nations", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Secretary-General of the United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beirut", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Beirut"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beirut"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Lebanon"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_(projectile)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shell (projectile)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galilee", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Galilee"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martyr", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Martyr"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned_aerial_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Unmanned aerial vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channel_13_(Israel)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Channel 13 (Israel)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temple_Mount", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Temple Mount"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_settlement", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Israeli settlement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colony", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Colony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yemen", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Yemen"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Yemen"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History", "label": "dmoz/Society/History", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Strength_Sports/Tug-of-War", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Strength Sports/Tug-of-War", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 82}], "image": "https://www.albawaba.com/sites/default/files/styles/default/public/2024-06/Hasan%20Narallah.jpg?itok=2ZU8u6sW", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9665510", "eventUri": "eng-9665510", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.388235294117647, "wgt": 148, "relevance": 1}

Leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah highlighted their expanded military capabilities, which now include advanced missiles, drones, and anti-tank weaponry. The new additions raise concerns of escalating conflict with Israel, an adversary since their last major clash in 2006.\n\nLebanon's Hezbollah has drawn on an expanded arsenal in ongoing hostilities with Israel, with leader Sayyed Hassan Nasdallah saying in a speech on Wednesday the Iran-backed group had obtained new weapons.\n\nHe did not identify the new weapons, but said they would \"emerge in the field\". Hezbollah's latest conflict with Israel, which has raged in parallel with the Gaza war, has raised concerns of further escalation between the regional enemies, which last fought a major war in 2006.\n\nHere is a snapshot of Hezbollah's arsenal: AN OVERVIEW\n\nHezbollah's military strength is underpinned by upwards of 150,000 missiles and rockets of various types and ranges, according to the World Factbook of the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency. Hezbollah says it has rockets that can hit all areas of Israel. Many of them are unguided, but it also has precision missiles, drones and anti-tank, anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles.\n\nHezbollah's main supporter and weapons supplier is Iran. Analysts say Tehran sends arms to the group by land via Iraq and Syria, both Middle Eastern countries where Iran has close ties and influence. Many of the Shi'ite Muslim group's weapons are Iranian, Russian or Chinese models. Nasrallah said in 2021 the group has 100,000 fighters. The CIA World Factbook says it was estimated in 2022 to have up to 45,000 fighters, split between roughly 20,000 full-time and 25,000 reserve personnel.\n\nANTI-TANK MISSILES Hezbollah used guided anti-tank missiles extensively in the 2006 war. It has deployed guided rockets again in the latest hostilities. These include the Russian-made Kornet.\n\nHezbollah has also used an Iranian-made guided missile known as \"al-Mas\", according to a report by the pro-Iran Arabic broadcaster al-Mayadeen. A report by Israel's Alma Research and Education Center published in April described the al-Mas as an anti-tank weapon that can hit targets beyond the line of sight following an arched trajectory, enabling it to strike from above.\n\nThe missile is part of a family of weapons made by Iran through reverse engineering based on the Israeli Spike missile family, the report said. It said the missile was a \"flagship product\" of Iran's defence industry in Hezbollah's possession. ANTI-AIRCRAFT MISSILES\n\nHezbollah said on June 6 it had fired at an Israeli warplane. A source familiar with its arsenal said it was the first time the group had done so, calling it a milestone, while declining to identify the weapon used. Hezbollah has also shot down Israeli drones during this conflict using surface-to-air missiles.\n\nThe first such incident was on Oct. 29 when Hezbollah for the first time said it had used anti-aircraft weaponry it had long been thought to have. Hezbollah has used such missiles several times since, downing Israeli Hermes 450 and Hermes 900 drones.\n\nDRONES Hezbollah has repeatedly launched explosive one-way drones, including in some of its more complicated attacks. It launched some to distract Israeli air defences, while explosives-laden drones were flown at targets.\n\nMore recently, the group has announced attacks that use drones that drop bombs and return to Lebanon, rather than just flying at their targets. Hezbollah's drones include what it says are the locally-assembled Ayoub and Mersad models, which analysts say are cheap and relatively easy to produce.\n\nLAND-ATTACK ROCKETS AND MISSILES Unguided rockets comprised the bulk of Hezbollah's missile arsenal in the last war with Israel in 2006, when the group fired about 4,000 of them into Israel - mostly Russian-made Katyusha-style missiles with a range of up to 30 km (19 miles).\n\nNasrallah has said the biggest change in Hezbollah's arsenal since 2006 is the expansion of its precision guidance systems. In 2022, he said Hezbollah had the ability within Lebanon to retrofit thousands of rockets with guidance systems to make them precision missiles.\n\nHezbollah has Iranian models, such as Raad (Arabic for Thunder), Fajr (Dawn) and Zilzal (Earthquake) rockets, which have a more powerful payload and longer range than Katyushas. Rockets fired by Hezbollah at Israel during the Gaza conflict since October have included Katyushas and Burkan (volcano) missiles with an explosive payload of 300-500 kg.\n\nIts Iranian-made Falaq 2 rockets it used for the first time on June 8, could carry a bigger warhead than the Falaq 1 used in the past. Hinting at the damage it could do, Nasrallah in 2016 made a veiled threat that Hezbollah could hit ammonia storage tanks in the northern Israeli port city of Haifa, saying the result would be \"like a nuclear bomb\".\n\nANTI-SHIP MISSILES Hezbollah first proved it had anti-ship missiles in 2006, when it hit an Israeli warship 16 km (10 miles) off the coast, killing four Israeli personnel and damaging the vessel.\n\nSince the 2006 war, Hezbollah has acquired the Russian-made Yakhont anti-ship missile with a range of 300 km (186 miles), sources familiar with its arsenal say. Hezbollah has not confirmed it has the weapon. Hezbollah has also broadcast videos that it says show more of the same type of anti-ship missile used in 2006.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a

The consequences of any escalation are severe, with the potential for mass casualties on all sides.\n\nThough conflict has remained at a low level, more than 400 people have been killed in Lebanon and 30 have been killed in Israel. An estimated 150,000 have been displaced on both sides of the border.\n\nThough the events of October 7 and their aftermath have affected the situation, Hezbollah and Israel have been embroiled in low-level conflict since Hezbollah was formed in 1982.\n\nThe 2006 war was the most significant moment in this history. This began after Hezbollah kidnapped two Israeli soldiers from close to the border in an attempted prisoner swap. In response, Israel embarked on a destructive war designed to eliminate Hezbollah.\n\nAt the time, the war was sold by Israel both domestically and internationally with a similar objective to that found in the current war against Hamas.\n\nThe memories of the war almost two decades ago linger. The war in 2006 had a devastating impact on Lebanon. Reconstruction cost over $10bn and was funded largely by Saudi Arabia, Iran and others.\n\nSince then, the geopolitical landscape has shifted. It would be far harder to finance any rebuilding projects. Meanwhile, the loss of life is likely to be catastrophic -- particularly in Lebanon's crowded urban areas.\n\nResidents of Haifa in the north of Israel fear Hezbollah attacks, while people living in south Lebanon fear IDF attacks. Though attacks have largely been restricted to military targets, the repercussions have affected civilians across south Lebanon, destroying farmland and forcing many people to leave their homes. This has made an already precarious socioeconomic situation in Lebanon a great deal worse.\n\nRecent reports have suggested Hezbollah has a sophisticated armoury, much of it supplied by Iran and Russia, which includes more than a million rockets of various types, along with anti-tank weaponry, suicide drones and a range of missiles.\n\nWhile Israel's arsenal of missiles is far larger, along with the infrastructure that supports it, the IDF remains beset by political, strategic, theological and economic challenges and Israel's public and politicians are far from united about how to deal with the threat.\n\nThe recent resignation of Benny Gantz from the war cabinet -- which has since been disbanded -- shows how precarious the situation is for Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, who is under pressure to resign and call an election.\n\nHow well prepared is Israel to fight a war on two fronts -- perhaps even three, as violence is also increasing in the West Bank?\n\nThere are serious doubts as to whether Israel can engage in significant conflicts on two fronts. Rising violence in the West Bank poses an additional challenge for Israel's security apparatus. Its security infrastructure has come under fire for \"missing\" Hamas' brutal attack, while its military is also facing increased pressure due to its actions in Gaza, where close to 40,000 have been killed, millions displaced, and where life has been decimated.\n\nThe occupied West Bank is home to about three million Palestinians, and while the Palestinian Authority exerts a degree of control, Israel is the final arbiter of all matters pertaining to security.\n\nThe situation is made more challenging by the presence of close to 700,000 Israeli settlers, whose presence is deemed illegal under international law. These settlers routinely engage in acts of violence against the Palestinian population and largely depend on the IDF to keep them safe and maintain the security architecture that separates the two communities and regulates access to Israel.\n\nAny shift in the security landscape would pose serious challenges to the IDF, to the Palestinian Authority -- which is under growing pressure from Palestinians and Arab states more broadly -- and exacerbate schisms in Israel's domestic politics.\n\nHow much international support can Israel count on if it launches a major offensive against Hezbollah?\n\nBenjamin Netanyahu has long framed Iran as an existential threat to Israel and has been supported in this by successive US administrations. Yet despite steadfast initial support from the Biden White House, this support has begun to wane as a result of growing popular dismay in the US and globally at the way Israel is conducting operations in Gaza.\n\nIsraeli officials have repeatedly said they can -- and will -- operate alone if the situation calls for it. But with international bodies becoming increasingly critical of the catastrophic war in Gaza and the devastating death toll, allies are beginning to waver in their support. Votes in the UN have suggested growing anger at Israel's conduct, while international bodies have explored legal avenues to end the suffering of Palestinians.\n\nMuch like Hamas, Hezbollah is a deeply unpopular organisation. Its relationship with Iran worries policymakers in Washington, London and elsewhere and it has been proscribed as a terrorist organisation by a number of western states.\n\nYet it occupies a central role in Lebanon's politics and economy. So any conflict with Israel would potentially worsen Lebanon's delicate power-sharing agreement, putting more strain on the economic situation, and destroying urban and rural landscapes.\n\nThe situation is bleak and this is undeniably a precarious moment. Yet there is little appetite for another conflict in the Middle East, particularly one that has both the potential for further catastrophic loss of life and wider escalation.", "source": {"uri":

Lebanese media reports showed photos of a burning car\n\nIsraeli fighter jets also struck a Hezbollah surface-to-air missile launcher in the southern Lebanese village of Rihan.\n\nIn response, Hezbollah fired dozens of Katyusha rockets at Moshav Zarit in the Upper Galilee.\n\nEarlier in the day, 10 rocket launches crossing from Lebanon were detected. No casualties were reported.\n\nThe attacks came as US special envoy Amos Hochstein conceded that his shuttle diplomacy hit a dead end. After Hochstein left Beirut, Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah threatened all-out war with Israel, adding that the Iran-backed terror group would even attack Cyprus.\n\nAround 60,000 Israelis living in northern communities were forced to evacuate in October when the Hezbollah terror organisation began daily rocket and drone attacks. Leaders of the Iran-backed terror group have said they will continue the attacks to prevent Israelis from returning to their homes. Since October 7, the Hezbollah attacks have killed 10 civilians and 15 soldiers.\n\nIsraeli officials have been calling for Hezbollah to be disarmed and removed from Southern Lebanon in accordance with UN Security Council resolution 1701, which ended the 2006 Second Lebanon War.

Nasrallah reiterated that Hizbollah's condition for a cessation of hostilities on the Lebanon-Israel border was peace in the besieged Palestinian enclave of Gaza.\n\n\"A ceasefire in Lebanon, Iraq and Yemen requires one thing: an end to the war in Gaza,\" Nasrallah said, referring to the regional hostilities that erupted after Hamas' deadly October 7 attack and Israel's retaliatory offensive in Gaza. \"We will continue to support Gaza and we are ready for anything.\"\n\nThe comments come a day after Israel's military said senior officers had approved \"operational plans for an offensive in Lebanon\".\n\nDespite the intensifying exchanges, which have displaced tens of thousands of people on both sides of the border and caused casualties in Lebanon and Israel, the two sides have not so far been drawn into all-out war. The US is leading a diplomatic push to de-escalate the situation, with White House adviser Amos Hochstein visiting both countries this week.\n\nHowever, Israeli officials have repeatedly said they are prepared to take military action in the absence of a diplomatic resolution. The military on Tuesday said that as well as approving plans for an offensive, officers had taken decisions on \"increasing the readiness of troops in the field\".\n\nThat announcement came after Hizbollah, one of the world's most heavily armed non-state actors, on Tuesday released a nine-minute video of what it said was footage gathered by its surveillance drones of parts of Israel, including the port in the northern city of Haifa.\n\nIn addition to views of the port, which lies about 30km from Lebanon's border, the undated footage included what Hizbollah said were images of other military infrastructure.\n\nHizbollah, which controls southern Lebanon, is the country's most potent political and military force.\n\nIn his speech on Wednesday, Nasrallah said the drone footage was \"proof that we have the capabilities\" to target anywhere in Israel, adding that his group had gathered hours of surveillance footage and had \"many more drones\" flying.\n\nThe video drew a furious response from Israel on Tuesday. Foreign minister Israel Katz warned that his government was \"very close to the moment of decision to change the rules against Hizbollah and Lebanon\".\n\n\"In an all-out war, Hizbollah will be destroyed and Lebanon will be severely hit,\" he wrote on the social media platform X.", "source": {"uri": "ft.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Financial Times News"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

Fadel Ibrahim, who commanded Hezbollah operations in the southern Lebanese village of Jouaiyya, was working to improve the capabilities of Hezbollah's ground forces. Ibrahim was killed in the area of Deir Kifa. Lebanese media reports showed photos of a burning car\n\nIsraeli fighter jets also struck a Hezbollah surface-to-air missile launcher in the southern Lebanese village of Rihan. In response, Hezbollah fired dozens of Katyusha rockets at Moshav Zarit in the Upper Galilee.\n\nEarlier in the day, 10 rocket launches crossing from Lebanon were detected. No casualties were reported. The attacks came as US special envoy Amos Hochstein conceded that his shuttle diplomacy hit a dead end. After Hochstein left Beirut, Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah threatened all-out war with Israel, adding that the Iran-backed terror group would even attack Cyprus.\n\nAround 60,000 Israelis living in northern communities were forced to evacuate in October when the Hezbollah terror organisation began daily rocket and drone attacks. Leaders of the Iran-backed terror group have said they will continue the attacks to prevent Israelis from returning to their homes. Since October 7, the Hezbollah attacks have killed 10 civilians and 15 soldiers. Israeli officials have been calling for Hezbollah to be disarmed and removed from Southern Lebanon in accordance with UN Security Council resolution 1701, which ended the 2006 Second Lebanon War.

Many of them are unguided, but it also has precision missiles, drones and anti-tank, anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles.\n\nHezbollah's main supporter and weapons supplier is Iran. Analysts say Tehran sends arms to the group by land via Iraq and Syria, both Middle Eastern countries where Iran has close ties and influence. Many of the Shi'ite Muslim group's weapons are Iranian, Russian or Chinese models.\n\nNasrallah said in 2021 the group has 100,000 fighters. The CIA World Factbook says it was estimated in 2022 to have up to 45,000 fighters, split between roughly 20,000 full-time and 25,000 reserve personnel.\n\nANTI-TANK MISSILES\n\nHezbollah used guided anti-tank missiles extensively in the 2006 war. It has deployed guided rockets again in the latest hostilities. These include the Russian-made Kornet.\n\nHezbollah has also used an Iranian-made guided missile known as \"al-Mas\", according to a report by the pro-Iran Arabic broadcaster al-Mayadeen.\n\nA report by Israel's Alma Research and Education Center published in April described the al-Mas as an anti-tank weapon that can hit targets beyond the line of sight following an arched trajectory, enabling it to strike from above.\n\nThe missile is part of a family of weapons made by Iran through reverse engineering based on the Israeli Spike missile family, the report said. It said the missile was a \"flagship product\" of Iran's defence industry in Hezbollah's possession.\n\nANTI-AIRCRAFT MISSILES\n\nHezbollah said on June 6 it had fired at an Israeli warplane. A source familiar with its arsenal said it was the first time the group had done so, calling it a milestone, while declining to identify the weapon used.\n\nHezbollah has also shot down Israeli drones during this conflict using surface-to-air missiles.\n\nThe first such incident was on Oct. 29 when Hezbollah for the first time said it had used anti-aircraft weaponry it had long been thought to have.\n\nHezbollah has used such missiles several times since, downing Israeli Hermes 450 and Hermes 900 drones.\n\nDRONES\n\nHezbollah has repeatedly launched explosive one-way drones, including in some of its more complicated attacks. It launched some to distract Israeli air defences, while explosives-laden drones were flown at targets.\n\nMore recently, the group has announced attacks that use drones that drop bombs and return to Lebanon, rather than just flying at their targets.\n\nHezbollah's drones include what it says are the locally-assembled Ayoub and Mersad models, which analysts say are cheap and relatively easy to produce.\n\nLAND-ATTACK ROCKETS AND MISSILES\n\nUnguided rockets comprised the bulk of Hezbollah's missile arsenal in the last war with Israel in 2006, when the group fired about 4,000 of them into Israel - mostly Russian-made Katyusha-style missiles with a range of up to 30 km (19 miles).\n\nNasrallah has said the biggest change in Hezbollah's arsenal since 2006 is the expansion of its precision guidance systems.\n\nIn 2022, he said Hezbollah had the ability within Lebanon to retrofit thousands of rockets with guidance systems to make them precision missiles.\n\nHezbollah has Iranian models, such as Raad (Arabic for Thunder), Fajr (Dawn) and Zilzal (Earthquake) rockets, which have a more powerful payload and longer range than Katyushas.\n\nRockets fired by Hezbollah at Israel during the Gaza conflict since October have included Katyushas and Burkan (volcano) missiles with an explosive payload of 300-500 kg.\n\nIts Iranian-made Falaq 2 rockets it used for the first time on June 8, could carry a bigger warhead than the Falaq 1 used in the past.\n\nHinting at the damage it could do, Nasrallah in 2016 made a veiled threat that Hezbollah could hit ammonia storage tanks in the northern Israeli port city of Haifa, saying the result would be \"like a nuclear bomb\".\n\nANTI-SHIP MISSILES\n\nHezbollah first proved it had anti-ship missiles in 2006, when it hit an Israeli warship 16 km (10 miles) off the coast, killing four Israeli personnel and damaging the vessel.\n\nSince the 2006 war, Hezbollah has acquired the Russian-made Yakhont anti-ship missile with a range of 300 km (186 miles), sources familiar with its arsenal say. Hezbollah has not confirmed it has the weapon.\n\nHezbollah has also broadcast videos that it says show more of the same type of anti-ship missile used in 2006.\n\n(Reporting by Maya Gebeily, Timour

Source: File Image / Reuters\n\nThe leader of the Lebanese militant group, Hezbollah, Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, issued a warning to Cyprus if the European island nation allowed Israel to use its territory to attack Lebanon. In a recent message, the militant group's leader warned that there would be a war \"without rules or ceilings\" in the event of a full-scale Israeli offensive against the militia.\n\nAmid the brewing tensions in the Middle East, Cyprus and Israel have a bilateral defence cooperation agreement which has seen both the countries performing joint military exercises in the region.\n\n\"Opening Cypriot airports and bases to the Israeli enemy to target Lebanon would mean that the Cypriot government is part of the war, and the resistance will deal with it as part of the war,\" Nasrallah said in a televised message on Wednesday.\n\nThis is the first time the Hezbollah leader has threatened Cyprus. What makes matters complicated is the fact that Cyprus is a member of the European Union and any conflict with the island nation could drag the regional body into the war.\n\nCyprus reacts\n\nShortly after the warning was given, Cyprus' President Nikos Christodoulides, gave a stern response on the matter. \"Cyprus remains uninvolved in any military conflicts and positions itself as part of the solution rather than the problem,\" Christodoulides averred.\n\nHe also pointed to the humanitarian role his country had played in the Middle East, facilitating the opening of a sea corridor to transport desperately needed aid to Gaza. \"Our humanitarian corridor is a testament to our commitment to peace and stability,\" he told reporters at a University of Cyprus graduation ceremony, The Guardian reported.\n\n\"Such statements are not pleasant, but they do not reflect reality. Cyprus is not participating in any military engagements,\" he added. The Cyprus president maintained that the threat would be raised through diplomatic channels.\n\nIsrael-Hezbollah tensions\n\nNasrallah's remarks came a day after Israeli generals said they are planning to launch a wider offensive against the Lebanese militant group. Israel's Foreign Minister Israel Katz suggested the country was on the brink of deciding whether to expand the war.\n\nA day before Nasrallah's warning statement, Hezbollah flaunted a 9-minute video filmed by a drone showing civilian and military locations in and around one of Israel's largest cities, Haifa.\n\nIn his statement, the militia chief boasted about his group's ability to gather intelligence. \"The enemy knows that no place in the entire (state) is safe from our missiles, and it won't be arbitrary. Everything will be deliberately targeted,\" Nasrallah said in his speech.\n\n\"We have long hours of footage of Haifa, of the outskirts of Haifa, and what comes after Haifa, and after after Haifa,\" he added, referencing the group's slogan when it hit a rocket in the Israeli city for the first time in 2006.\n\nMeanwhile, the mayor of Haifa, Yona Yahav, has described the video as \"psychological terror\" and demanded a protection plan for his city. He went on to slam the IDF commanders for not visiting Haifa since the October 7 attack by Hamas.\n\n\"I demand that the government present a plan for the massive defence of Haifa and find a military solution to eliminate the threat posed from the north,\" Yahav told Israeli radio station Reshet Bet.", "source": {"uri": "firstpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Firstpost"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hassan_Nasrallah", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hassan Nasrallah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hezbollah", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hezbollah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebanon", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lebanon"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Lebanon"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyprus", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cyprus"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Cyprus"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Island_country", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Island country"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Middle East"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikos_Christodoulides", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nikos Christodoulides"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_exercise", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Military exercise"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarian_aid", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Humanitarian aid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Militia", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Militia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Guardian", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Guardian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haifa", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Haifa"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Haifa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Katz", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Israel Katz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yona_Yahav", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Yona Yahav"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Foreign_Affairs_(Israel)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Israel)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Israel Defense Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rocket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned_aerial_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Unmanned aerial vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missile", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Missile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding/Middle_East", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding/Middle East", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 48}], "image": "https://images.firstpost.com/uploads/2024/06/f430b196-6318-4560-9d25-1fe9bf6c7f79-2024-06-235e5429fbb8988194edcb8d812c9744.jpg?im=FitAndFill=(1200,675)", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9665510", "eventUri": "eng-9665510", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-10-07", "textStart": 3181, "textEnd": 3190}], "sentiment": -0.388235294117647, "wgt": 141, "relevance": 1}

Israeli fighter jets also struck a Hezbollah surface-to-air missile launcher in the southern Lebanese village of Rihan.\n\nTel Aviv [Israel], June 20 (ANI/TPS): Israel confirmed the killing of a senior Hezbollah commander in an airstrike on Thursday as the Lebanese terror group fired rockets at the Upper Galilee.\n\nFadel Ibrahim, who commanded Hezbollah operations in the southern Lebanese village of Jouaiyya, was working to improve the capabilities of Hezbollah's ground forces. Ibrahim was killed in the area of Deir Kifa. Lebanese media reports showed photos of a burning car\n\nAlso Read | As Polio Cases Rise in Pakistan, is There a Way Out?.\n\nIsraeli fighter jets also struck a Hezbollah surface-to-air missile launcher in the southern Lebanese village of Rihan.\n\nIn response, Hezbollah fired dozens of Katyusha rockets at Moshav Zarit in the Upper Galilee.\n\nAlso Read | Germany's Habeck Navigates Delicate China Mission.\n\nEarlier in the day, 10 rocket launches crossing from Lebanon were detected. No casualties were reported.\n\nThe attacks came as US special envoy Amos Hochstein conceded that his shuttle diplomacy hit a dead end. After Hochstein left Beirut, Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah threatened all-out war with Israel, adding that the Iran-backed terror group would even attack Cyprus.\n\nAround 60,000 Israelis living in northern communities were forced to evacuate in October when the Hezbollah terror organisation began daily rocket and drone attacks. Leaders of the Iran-backed terror group have said they will continue the attacks to prevent Israelis from returning to their homes. Since October 7, the Hezbollah attacks have killed 10 civilians and 15 soldiers.\n\nIsraeli officials have been calling for Hezbollah to be disarmed and removed from Southern Lebanon in accordance with UN Security Council resolution 1701, which ended the 2006 Second Lebanon War.

Many of them are unguided, but it also has precision missiles, drones and anti-tank, anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles.\n\nHezbollah's main supporter and weapons supplier is Iran. Analysts say Tehran sends arms to the group by land via Iraq and Syria, both Middle Eastern countries where Iran has close ties and influence. Many of the Shi'ite Muslim group's weapons are Iranian, Russian or Chinese models.\n\nNasrallah said in 2021 the group has 100,000 fighters. The CIA World Factbook says it was estimated in 2022 to have up to 45,000 fighters, split between roughly 20,000 full-time and 25,000 reserve personnel.\n\nHezbollah used guided anti-tank missiles extensively in the 2006 war. It has deployed guided rockets again in the latest hostilities. These include the Russian-made Kornet.\n\nHezbollah has also used an Iranian-made guided missile known as \"al-Mas\", according to a report by the pro-Iran Arabic broadcaster al-Mayadeen.\n\nA report by Israel's Alma Research and Education Center published in April described the al-Mas as an anti-tank weapon that can hit targets beyond the line of sight following an arched trajectory, enabling it to strike from above.\n\nThe missile is part of a family of weapons made by Iran through reverse engineering based on the Israeli Spike missile family, the report said. It said the missile was a \"flagship product\" of Iran's defence industry in Hezbollah's possession.\n\nHezbollah said on June 6 it had fired at an Israeli warplane. A source familiar with its arsenal said it was the first time the group had done so, calling it a milestone, while declining to identify the weapon used.\n\nHezbollah has also shot down Israeli drones during this conflict using surface-to-air missiles.\n\nThe first such incident was on Oct. 29 when Hezbollah for the first time said it had used anti-aircraft weaponry it had long been thought to have.\n\nHezbollah has used such missiles several times since, downing Israeli Hermes 450 and Hermes 900 drones.\n\nHezbollah has repeatedly launched explosive one-way drones, including in some of its more complicated attacks. It launched some to distract Israeli air defences, while explosives-laden drones were flown at targets.\n\nMore recently, the group has announced attacks that use drones that drop bombs and return to Lebanon, rather than just flying at their targets.\n\nHezbollah's drones include what it says are the locally-assembled Ayoub and Mersad models, which analysts say are cheap and relatively easy to produce.\n\nUnguided rockets comprised the bulk of Hezbollah's missile arsenal in the last war with Israel in 2006, when the group fired about 4,000 of them into Israel - mostly Russian-made Katyusha-style missiles with a range of up to 30 km (19 miles).\n\nNasrallah has said the biggest change in Hezbollah's arsenal since 2006 is the expansion of its precision guidance systems.\n\nIn 2022, he said Hezbollah had the ability within Lebanon to retrofit thousands of rockets with guidance systems to make them precision missiles.\n\nHezbollah has Iranian models, such as Raad (Arabic for Thunder), Fajr (Dawn) and Zilzal (Earthquake) rockets, which have a more powerful payload and longer range than Katyushas.\n\nRockets fired by Hezbollah at Israel during the Gaza conflict since October have included Katyushas and Burkan (volcano) missiles with an explosive payload of 300-500 kg.\n\nIts Iranian-made Falaq 2 rockets it used for the first time on June 8, could carry a bigger warhead than the Falaq 1 used in the past.\n\nHinting at the damage it could do, Nasrallah in 2016 made a veiled threat that Hezbollah could hit ammonia storage tanks in the northern Israeli port city of Haifa, saying the result would be \"like a nuclear bomb\".\n\nHezbollah first proved it had anti-ship missiles in 2006, when it hit an Israeli warship 16 km (10 miles) off the coast, killing four Israeli personnel and damaging the vessel.\n\nSince the 2006 war, Hezbollah has acquired the Russian-made Yakhont anti-ship missile with a range of 300 km (186 miles), sources familiar with its arsenal say. Hezbollah has not confirmed it has the weapon.\n\nHezbollah has also broadcast videos that it says show more of the same type of anti-ship missile used in 2006.\n\n(Reporting by Maya Gebeily, Timour

Even more worryingly, as large sections of the international community appear to have run out of answers to the continuing Gaza conflict, similar indecision has greeted the Israeli military build-up in the north. Despite the presence of an American-led, UN Security Council-backed ceasefire plan for Gaza, Israel's political and military establishment remains on a war footing, with some members of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government openly calling for a war against Hezbollah. Meanwhile, Hezbollah seems to have almost entirely hijacked the decision-making over war in Lebanon.\n\nThosewho regard the Lebanese militia as source of \"resistance\" to Israel's impunity in Gaza would be mistaken. Hezbollah's main priority remains its own survival as well as maintaining its powerful position in Lebanon as a state within a state. Hezbollah seems not to have deterred Israeli forces from devastating Gaza and killing tens of thousands of Palestinian civilians. Instead, its actions have displaced thousands of Israeli non-combatants.\n\nAs with Hamas, the effects on civilians of crossing swords with the Israeli army - displacement, fear and trauma - is part of a cold military calculation. The people on whose behalf the radicals purport to fight are treated as a rhetorical abstraction, not individuals with families who did not ask to be dragged into another violent conflict. Hezbollah's leaders and backers risk taking a fragile country with a caretaker government to war. Even if the group does not want to escalate beyond the current exchanges, persisting with attacks risks events spiralling out of control.\n\nThe consequences for Lebanon's people, beyond those who have already lost their homes and livelihoods, would be severe. Many Lebanese do not need to be reminded about wars with Israel: the 15-year Israeli occupation of southern Lebanon came complete with massacres and sharpened existing sectarian divisions.\n\nInto this precarious situation steps US mediator Amos Hochstein. On Monday, the American envoy arrived in Israel to discuss the situation at the border before travelling for meetings in Beirut. Mr Hochstein has valuable experience in this arena, having helped to broker a 2022 agreement between Israel and Lebanon - two states that are still technically at war and without diplomatic ties. That agreement demarcated the maritime boundary between the countries for the first time, enabling both to develop offshore gas fields and other natural resources.\n\nSpeaking in Lebanon after a meeting with political and military figures on Tuesday, Mr Hochstein said the conflict between Israel and Hezbollah \"has gone on for long enough\" adding that it was \"in everyone's interests to resolve it quickly and diplomatically\". He's right, but the US can and should be doing more to restrain its ally before another front in this war opens up. Indeed, to avoid an additional conflict will require just as much political and diplomatic focus as that which has gone into Gaza, which remains unresolved.\n\nThere is nothing for anyone to gain by exchanging one war for another. Both Israel and Lebanon have much to lose from a full-blown war and nothing to gain in the long term. It's time for both protagonists to take a step back.", "source": {"uri": "thenationalnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The National"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The move highlights yet another failure of the occupying forces in confronting the resistance front amidst the escalating crises in the occupied territories. Concurrently, the number of protesters against Netanyahu's policies is increasing day in and day out, with calls for early elections and moving past Netanyahu becoming their primary focus.\n\n- Israel carrying out 'extermination' campaign in Gaza: UN\n\nA new independent report presented to the United Nations' Human Rights Council on Wednesday concluded that Israeli forces have been carrying out several crimes against humanity on the civilian population in Gaza, including a campaign of \"extermination\" that has ramped-up since the current military offensive began more than eight months ago. The Israeli military's \"deliberate\" use of heavy weapons in the Gaza Strip has been an \"intentional and direct attack on the civilian population\", the new report by a United Nations-backed independent commission has found.\n\n- Russia, North Korea sign mutual defense pact\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un signed a new pact Wednesday that includes a pledge of mutual defense if either is attacked. The agreement was sealed at a summit in Pyongyang during Putin's first visit to North Korea in 24 years as both countries face growing confrontations with the West. In a news conference after the summit, Putin said the agreement, which he called \"a truly breakthrough document,\" reflected the two countries' shared desire to raise relations to a new level -- covering security, trade, investment, and cultural and humanitarian ties.\n\n** TEHRAN TIMES\n\n- Nasrallah: Over one hundred thousand Hezbollah fighters ready to join war\n\nHezbollah Secretary General Seyyed Hassan Nasrallah has played down Israel's threats of waging a full-scale war against the Lebanese resistance group. Speaking at a ceremony to commemorate senior Hezbollah commander Taleb Abdullah as well as three other resistance fighters who were martyred in a recent Israeli airstrikes on Lebanon over a week ago, the Hezbollah leader said Israel can only talk about waging such a war but is incapable of conducting it.\n\n- Candidates hit the road for votes\n\nWith less than ten days remaining before the June 28th presidential election, candidates have hit the road in a last-minute push for votes. Presidential hopefuls departed Tehran on Tuesday and Wednesday, embarking on trips to multiple Iranian provinces as part of their campaigns.\n\n- Tourism ministry reveals special content aimed to boost arrivals\n\nOn Wednesday, the Ministry of Cultural Heritage, Tourism, and Handicrafts held a ceremony to unveil innovative tourism content aimed at attracting more foreign visitors. Speaking at the event, Moslem Shojaei, who presides over the office of the Foreign Tourism Marketing and Development, provided detailed insights into the ministry's latest offerings and answered questions asked by the attendees. The first product unveiled was a multimedia tourism guide, comprising nine booklets and 108 PDF files in 13 foreign languages, all available in various formats.\n\n** KAYHAN INTERNATIONAL\n\n- Nasrallah: No bounds in case of broader war\n\nHezbollah chief Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah warned on Wednesday that the Lebanese resistance would fight with \"no rules\" and \"no ceilings\" in case a broader war with Israel erupted, and that nowhere in occupied territories would be safe from Hezbollah's attacks. In a televised address, Nasrallah said that the possible targets would include those in the Mediterranean Sea. Nasrallah also warned Cyprus for the first time, saying Hezbollah could consider it \"a part of the war\" if it continued to allow Israel to use its airports and bases for military exercises.\n\n- Palestinians fiercely fight Zionist troops in Gaza\n\nIsraeli airstrikes and clashes between Zionist troops and Palestinian resistance fighters rocked Gaza on Wednesday, despite a \"pause\" announced by the occupying regime. Witnesses and the civil defense agency in the Gaza Strip reported Israeli bombardment in western Rafah, where medics said drone strikes and shelling martyred at least seven people.\n\n- Volleyballers down US at VNL\n\nIran defeated the US 3-2 (26-28, 25-23, 25-18, 26-28, 15-13) in the 2024 Volleyball Nations League (VNL) Week 3 on Wednesday. Pouriya Hussein Khanzadeh collected 22 points for Team Melli, while Torey Defalco scored 32 points for the US.\n\n1483**4399", "source": {"uri": "en.irna.ir", "dataType": "news", "title": "IRNA

Israel has now publicly stated that it has approved military plans to move to a war footing against Hezbollah. Lebanon is on Israel's border and the two countries have a long history of conflict and tension, which has been intensifying in recent months.\n\nIsrael's escalation would be a significant blow to Biden ahead of the US presidential election. The Israel-Palestine conflict is already eroding Democrat support and Biden has repeatedly been accused from all sides of mishandling the situation. If further violence ramps up in the region, this will put even greater pressure on Biden, in ways he doesn't need, just before the US goes to the ballot box.\n\nAny further weakening of support for Biden is of concern to other national leaders who want to avoid a Trump presidency, and, potentially, its fallout for the Ukraine war. Biden has already had to navigate a complex situation of wanting to bring peace in the Middle East, while also respecting a longstanding expectation that the US will always stand by Israel. Biden has faced political pressure to arm Israel and public condemnation of the way he has dealt with protests on university campuses. There has been further pressure on him after allegations that Israel was committing genocide were filed with the International Court of Justice. In short, it's the sort of situation that no president wants.\n\nAl Jazeera English Video added by IC: \"Israel's military advantage over Hezbollah and Hamas no longer the same: Analysis\"\n\nThe tension between Israel and Hezbollah will not be seen as an isolated incident but will play into deeper concerns about Israeli foreign policy and where the US should stand. The situation will inevitably be considered part of a wider US debate on the Israel-Palestine conflict, with all the emotions and political difficulties that come with this, and is likely to be a source of contention at the upcoming presidential debate on June 27.\n\nThe US is already working to maintain peace between Israel and Hezbollah and to bring about a diplomatic solution in the form of a ceasefire proposal. Critics who want increased US support for Israel will be upset with peace negotiations which they say favour Hezbollah - and, with it, Iran. But if Biden goes beyond trying for a peace deal - for example, by providing more military aid to Israel - he can forget the votes of those who would prefer a more hardline American stance towards the Netanyahu government. Even if Biden gets a peace deal, or Israel doesn't move to all-out war, the situation will still undermine Biden's electoral chances, because it can't be separated from the wider disputes around Israel that are already losing him support in some quarters.\n\nBiden's response will also be extremely difficult for his relations with the Democratic party. The party is already deeply divided over Israel and this new threat will only exacerbate that division. The last thing candidates need before an election is to not have the full support of their party. The Israel-Hezbollah conflict has the potential to inflame internal political disputes between the Democrats even further and Biden will be going into the election with one hand tied behind his back.\n\nThis isn't just a domestic question, however, but an international one. Israel is one of the most important issues on the international political agenda right now. The criticisms against Biden don't just come from US voters but from other states. If Biden can't win those states over to whatever he does next in relation to Israel and Hezbollah, he will look incompetent and unreliable. And if he can't convince other national leaders that he is up to the job, he won't convince US voters either.\n\nThe problems that Biden now has to address over Hezbollah will also be problematic for his electoral competition with Donald Trump. The Republican party is also split on Israel. But the situation would hurt Trump in the election to a lesser degree. In fact, it may even be a win for Trump.\n\nTrump has been a strong backer of Israel - and this has often appealed to his supporters and pro-Israeli voters. Yet this is going to be less about issues and more about image. Trump's vocal (and occasionally critical) stance can make him look like an effective leader. His position on Israel may attract condemnation from some, but you can't deny that he at least looks like he knows what he wants. To many he will appear more presidential in comparison to Biden - who is in a difficult position on Israel and has been frequently accused of not having what it takes to be president.\n\nThe tension between Israel and Hezbollah is another chance for Trump to make himself look dynamic and attack his opponent. While the politics of the situation will alone be enough to sway some voters, it's also the case that this represents another opportunity for Trump's supporters to call Biden weak. If Biden think the criticism of him now is bad, it's about to get much worse.", "source": {"uri": "juancole.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Informed Comment"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Israel has now publicly stated that it has approved military plans to move to a war footing against Hezbollah. Lebanon is on Israel's border and the two countries have a long history of conflict and tension, which has been intensifying in recent months.\n\nIsrael's escalation would be a significant blow to Biden ahead of the US presidential election. The Israel-Palestine conflict is already eroding Democrat support and Biden has repeatedly been accused from all sides of mishandling the situation. If further violence ramps up in the region, this will put even greater pressure on Biden, in ways he doesn't need, just before the US goes to the ballot box.\n\nAny further weakening of support for Biden is of concern to other national leaders who want to avoid a Trump presidency, and, potentially, its fallout for the Ukraine war. Biden has already had to navigate a complex situation of wanting to bring peace in the Middle East, while also respecting a longstanding expectation that the US will always stand by Israel. Biden has faced political pressure to arm Israel and public condemnation of the way he has dealt with protests on university campuses. There has been further pressure on him after allegations that Israel was committing genocide were filed with the International Court of Justice. In short, it's the sort of situation that no president wants.\n\nTension in the Middle East along Israel's border with Lebanon.\n\nThe tension between Israel and Hezbollah will not be seen as an isolated incident but will play into deeper concerns about Israeli foreign policy and where the US should stand. The situation will inevitably be considered part of a wider US debate on the Israel-Palestine conflict, with all the emotions and political difficulties that come with this, and is likely to be a source of contention at the upcoming presidential debate on June 27.\n\nThe US is already working to maintain peace between Israel and Hezbollah and to bring about a diplomatic solution in the form of a ceasefire proposal. Critics who want increased US support for Israel will be upset with peace negotiations which they say favour Hezbollah - and, with it, Iran. But if Biden goes beyond trying for a peace deal - for example, by providing more military aid to Israel - he can forget the votes of those who would prefer a more hardline American stance towards the Netanyahu government. Even if Biden gets a peace deal, or Israel doesn't move to all-out war, the situation will still undermine Biden's electoral chances, because it can't be separated from the wider disputes around Israel that are already losing him support in some quarters.\n\nDamaged relationships\n\nBiden's response will also be extremely difficult for his relations with the Democratic party. The party is already deeply divided over Israel and this new threat will only exacerbate that division. The last thing candidates need before an election is to not have the full support of their party. The Israel-Hezbollah conflict has the potential to inflame internal political disputes between the Democrats even further and Biden will be going into the election with one hand tied behind his back.\n\nThis isn't just a domestic question, however, but an international one. Israel is one of the most important issues on the international political agenda right now. The criticisms against Biden don't just come from US voters but from other states. If Biden can't win those states over to whatever he does next in relation to Israel and Hezbollah, he will look incompetent and unreliable. And if he can't convince other national leaders that he is up to the job, he won't convince US voters either.\n\nThe problems that Biden now has to address over Hezbollah will also be problematic for his electoral competition with Donald Trump. The Republican party is also split on Israel. But the situation would hurt Trump in the election to a lesser degree. In fact, it may even be a win for Trump.\n\nTrump has been a strong backer of Israel - and this has often appealed to his supporters and pro-Israeli voters. Yet this is going to be less about issues and more about image. Trump's vocal (and occasionally critical) stance can make him look like an effective leader. His position on Israel may attract condemnation from some, but you can't deny that he at least looks like he knows what he wants. To many he will appear more presidential in comparison to Biden - who is in a difficult position on Israel and has been frequently accused of not having what it takes to be president.\n\nThe tension between Israel and Hezbollah is another chance for Trump to make himself look dynamic and attack his opponent. While the politics of the situation will alone be enough to sway some voters, it's also the case that this represents another opportunity for Trump's supporters to call Biden weak. If Biden think the criticism of him now is bad, it's about to get much worse.", "source": {"uri": "econotimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "EconoTimes"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hezbollah", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hezbollah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebanon", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lebanon"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Lebanon"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli\u2013Palestinian_conflict", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Middle East"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2024 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Donald_Trump", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned_aerial_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Unmanned aerial vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_party", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Political party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haifa", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Haifa"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Haifa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceasefire", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ceasefire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Court_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "International Court of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Foreign policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Netanyahu", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Benjamin Netanyahu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genocide", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Genocide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Iran"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Peace", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Peace", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://f1.econotimes.com/2024/06/uzit360gyr_th_1024x0.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9665510", "eventUri": "eng-9665510", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-27", "textStart": 2312, "textEnd": 2319}], "sentiment": -0.2, "wgt": 134, "relevance": 1}

He provided specific figures on evacuations, stressing that \"42 settlements have been completely evacuated, and life has been disrupted in several others.\"\n\nMoreover, he stated that the Israeli military and security image was deteriorating. \"The deterrent military-security image of the enemy is collapsing in front of its people, its society, and the world,\" he concluded.\n\n\"They failed to protect Israeli ships, which is a huge failure for the two most important naval fleets in the world, primarily the American fleet,\" the Hezbollah chief stressed.\n\nSayyed Nasrallah drew two conclusions from the Yemeni front: \"First, the American-British failure, and second, the Israeli inability to fight on that front.\"\n\nHe criticized the Israeli occupation's pursuit of false victories, stating, \"The enemy is panting after a false and fabricated victory that has no basis in reality, just to present it to its audience as a victory.\"\n\nThe Hezbollah chief highlighted significant losses inflicted on the Israeli occupation by Gaza and the West Bank, as well as from Lebanon, Yemen, and Iraq.\n\n\"The enemy understood since October 8 that its positions would be targeted and that we have enough information about them, their fortifications, their equipment, and their numbers,\" he said. \"We are continuing to strike enemy positions within a certain and specific schedule,\" he declared.\n\nSayyed Nasrallah detailed the Resistance's strategy to \"blind\" and \"deafen\" the Israeli occupation. \"The resistance followed a strategy of blinding the enemy and deafening its ears by targeting technical equipment, radars, balloons, and more,\" he explained.\n\n\"We have a very, very, very large amount of information, and yesterday's release is selected from many hours over Haifa,\" he stressed about the Military Media of the Islamic Resistance in Lebanon - Hezbollah releasing Tuesday footage showing its reconnaissance drones flying over swathes of occupied Palestinian land, including Kiryat Shmona, Nahariya, Safad, Karmiel, Afula, all the way to Haifa and its port.\n\nIn detail, the video first shows Hezbollah's drones flying over a military-industrial complex belonging to Rafael Advanced Defense Systems, which includes numerous factories, warehouses, and testing fields in which components of air defense systems are manufactured and assembled, especially the Iron Dome and David's Sling.\n\nIron Dome and David's Sling platforms, rocket engine test tunnel and storage, air defense missile storage, missile component manufacturing facilities, control and guidance systems factories, company administrative buildings, and missile testing radars, all appeared in the video.\n\n\"We have long hours of footage of Haifa and its surroundings, covering what is north of Haifa, what is beyond Haifa, and what is beyond, beyond Haifa,\" Sayyed Nasrallah said.\n\n\"We have developed our weapons, used new ones, and are keeping other weapons for the coming days to defend our land, our people, and Lebanon's sovereignty,\" he asserted. \"We have fought only with part of our weaponry until now, and we have obtained new weapons which we will not disclose; this will become evident on the battlefield.\"\n\nSayyed Nasrallah also underlined that the Resistance yielded unprecedented manpower.\n\nHe addressed the Israeli occupation's actions in Syria, claiming their failure. \"The enemy conducted a battle amidst war in Syria and was met with failure. Everything that was supposed to reach Lebanon has arrived,\" he noted.\n\n\"The enemy knows well that we have prepared ourselves for the worst days and knows what awaits it, which is why it has been deterred for the past 8-9 months,\" Sayyed Nasrallah said. He emphasized that no location within occupied Palestine was safe from Hezbollah's missiles and drones. \"The enemy knows that there will be no place safe from our missiles and drones, and [our attacks] will not consist of random bombing.\"\n\nNasrallah claimed that Hezbollah possessed a comprehensive and real target bank with the capability to reach all targets, destabilizing the foundation of the Israeli occupation. He also warned that \"the enemy knows that what awaits it in the Mediterranean Sea is also very significant.\"\n\n\"The enemy knows it must expect us on land, in the air, and at sea, and if war is imposed, the resistance will fight without constraints, rules, or limits,\" he declared.\n\nIn a stark statement, he warned the Cypriot government about allowing its airports and bases to be used by the Israeli occupation. \"The Cypriot government should be warned that opening its airports and bases to the enemy to target Lebanon means it has become part of the war.\"\n\nSayyed Nasrallah described the ongoing confrontation as the greatest battle since 1948 with a clear and bright horizon that will change the face of the region and shape its future.\n\nHe concluded by reaffirming Hezbollah's steadfastness and readiness to engage in this historic battle until victory. \"We affirm the solidity of our position and our readiness to continue this historic, humanitarian, and moral

The fatalities include 248, who have been killed in ground battles.\n\nNasrallah, however, asserted, \"The number of its dead is very large and much greater than [what has been] announced,\" adding, \"We announce our martyrs on live broadcasts, but the enemy hides its dead, and this has an impact on the Israeli army.\"\n\nThe Hezbollah leader noted that \"on the northern front, there is extreme secrecy about the losses in terms of [Israeli] soldiers, military vehicles, and others.\"\n\nLebanon's al-Mayadeen television network reported recently that the Palestinian resistance's operations against the Israeli forces in the northern Gaza Strip had confirmed the presence and strength of the resistance, and refuted the Israeli claims of imposing control over northern Gaza.\n\n\"After five months, the Israeli army has a shortage of personnel and wants to recruit 14,500 officers and soldiers and even wants to recruit the Haredim (ultra-Orthodox Israelis),\" Nasrallah noted.\n\nHe also pointed to a pledge by Tel Aviv to invade the southern Gaza city of Rafah, where the majority of the coastal territory's 2.4-million-strong population has taken refuge from the ravages of the war.\n\nThe regime claims that by conducting the invasion, it will have realized its ambition of \"eliminating\" the Gaza-based resistance movement of Hamas.\n\nNasrallah, however, radically rejected the claim.\n\n\"Today, in the sixth month [of the war], [Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin] Netanyahu stands up to say that if we do not go to Rafah, we will lose the war,\" the Hezbollah leader said.\n\n\"We say to Netanyahu that even if you go to Rafah, you have lost the war and you cannot eliminate Hamas or the resistance, despite all the massacres,\" he added.\n\n\"One of the signs of defeat for the enemy is that the occupation is negotiating with Hamas in the sixth month of the war,\" Nasrallah stated, adding, \"Hamas is negotiating today on behalf of the resistance and not from a position of weakness, and it sets the conditions.\"\n\nHe reminded that resistance fronts all across the region, namely in Lebanon, Iraq, and Yemen, were performing their duty towards lending support to their fellow resistance fighters in Gaza.\n\n\"We affirm our stand with the Palestinian resistance factions, especially with the leadership of Hamas...and we continue on the support fronts,\" the Hezbollah leader said.\n\nThe pro-Palestinian operations staged by the regional resistance movements have seen them firing numerous missiles, drones, and rockets against Israeli targets or those belonging to the occupying regime's supporters.\n\nYemeni forces have been targeting Israeli vessels or those heading toward the occupied territories' ports, while Iraq's Islamic Resistance has been firing numerous missiles and drones toward the occupied territories.\n\nThe resistance fronts have also been striking American targets in protest at the United States' all-out political, military, and intelligence support for the war.\n\n\"The Islamic Resistance in Iraq and its sending of marches and missiles to the entity is ongoing and ongoing,\" Nasrallah noted, commending the Arab country's resistance movements' pro-Gaza operations.\n\n\"The support fronts are completing their work and we praise the Yemen front and its effects and blessings are very great, especially on the enemy's economy,\" he stated.\n\n\"Neither the Americans nor the British nor the Europeans who followed them were able to prevent the Yemeni brothers from striking ships heading to occupied Palestine,\" Nasrallah said.\n\nHe was referring to anti-Yemeni strikes by the United States or those of its allies in the UK and Europe that have been launched in a failed attempt to stop Yemen's pro-Palestinian operations.\n\nNasrallah, meanwhile, noted that the United States could easily end the ongoing aggression against Gaza and the simultaneous attacks that the Israeli regime has been staging against Lebanon.\n\n\"With the stroke of a pen, U.S. President Joe Biden can stop the aggression in Gaza and Lebanon.\"\n\nEarlier in the month, however, Biden alleged in an interview with The New Yorker that the Israeli war machine still had to be given \"a little bit of time.\"", "source": {"uri": "tehrantimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Tehran Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Fears of escalation have disrupted her personal life, including plans for a civil marriage in Cyprus. Many Lebanese are reluctantly preparing for conflict amidst ongoing instability.\n\nLebanese product designer Tara Tabet does not want to see her country pulled into a full-scale war with Israel, but like many of her compatriots is bracing for possible conflict after new threats by armed group Hezbollah against both Israel and Cyprus. Hezbollah chief Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah surprised many on Wednesday when he said Cyprus - the EU member state closest to Lebanon - could be drawn into the group's conflict with Israel, raging in parallel with the Gaza war. Cyprus has denied taking sides in any war.\n\nThe warning by Nasrallah, who also threatened Israel with widespread precision strikes, left many Lebanese resigned to preparing for a possible escalation. \"Of course we don't want to go into a war with them - but if that's in solidarity with the people in Gaza, then so be it,\" Tabet, 32, told Reuters in Beirut on Thursday.\n\nAsked if the threat to Cyprus had worried her, Tabet said it could derail her plans for a civil marriage. In Lebanon, personal status laws are governed by the courts of each religion - pushing many couples from different religious backgrounds to travel 40 minutes by plane to Cyprus to be married in court. She said it was \"stressful\" to live with so much uncertainty, but that she had been trying to carry on \"as if there's nothing - all of Beirut is like that\".\n\nMany Lebanese see Hezbollah's eight-month conflict with Israel as the latest episode in a string of recent setbacks - from COVID-19 lockdowns to the 2020 Beirut blast and an economic crisis that crushed the local lira and wiped out bank savings. PASSPORTS AND FOOD STOCKS READY\n\nSami Masri, a 38-year-old businessman from the south who runs a coffeeshop in Beirut, said Israeli strikes had kept him from taking his family to the rolling hills of southern Lebanon for weekends, as they usually did in summer. That meant spending more to access private beaches closer to Beirut - and even there, Masri said, he could not have fun.\n\n\"You're not happy because, you don't know, at any point - we have our passports ready, we have a suitcase ready, we have some food stocks ready,\" he told Reuters. Already, some 90,000 Lebanese have fled their homes in the south. Some left Lebanon, others are staying with relatives and the most vulnerable are in collective shelters, including in the port city of Sidon.\n\nBana Baalbaki, a Sidon resident who spoke to Reuters in the city's market quarter, put on a brave face. \"No, I am not afraid because we are not better than the people of Gaza, nor the people of the south who were displaced,\" she told Reuters.\n\nBut others - like shopkeeper Qassem Qarram - were more worried. \"Of course everyone is afraid, and those who tell you they are not afraid will be lying to themselves,\" he said.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hezbollah", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hezbollah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebanon", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lebanon"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Lebanon"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyprus", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cyprus"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Cyprus"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hassan_Nasrallah", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hassan Nasrallah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_marriage", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Civil marriage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beirut", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Beirut"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beirut"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Lebanon"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_in_Iraq_(2013\u20132017)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "War in Iraq (2013\u20132017)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli\u2013Palestinian_conflict", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_state_of_the_European_Union", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Member state of the European Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Religion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_lockdowns", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "COVID-19 lockdowns"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Lebanon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Southern Lebanon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_crisis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Financial crisis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internally_displaced_person", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Internally displaced person"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Port"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_lira", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Turkish lira"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidon", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sidon"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sidon"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Lebanon"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History", "label": "dmoz/Society/History", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding/Middle_East", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding/Middle East", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Strength_Sports/Tug-of-War", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Strength Sports/Tug-of-War", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 73}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/imagegallery/03_03_2020_19_04_32_3060217.jpg?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9665510", "eventUri": "eng-9665510", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.5529411764705883, "wgt": 126, "relevance": 1}

himself.\n\nYedioth Ahronoth further detailed Hezbollah's long-standing belief that \"Israel\" has refrained from directly targeting Nasrallah despite his three-decade leadership of the Lebanese Shia

such information leaks originate in Tel Aviv to sow discord within Hezbollah's leadership ranks.\n\nAlso Read: Israeli Occupation assassinates Hezbollah official in southern Lebanon\n\nMoreover, the

In an all-out war, Hezbollah will be destroyed and Lebanon will be severely hit. The State of Israel will pay a price on the front and home fronts, but with a strong and united nation, and the full power of the IDF, we will restore security to the residents of the north,\" Fatz continues.\n\nMaronite Archbishop Charbel Abdallah of Tyre told the Aid to the Church in Need (ACN), \"we find ourselves in a state of war.\"\n\nHe told the Vatican-backed charity most people who had fled his region - which is near the border - and went to Beirut or further north \"have now returned home because they were short of money and the little houses of their relatives who took them in did not have the capacity to accommodate so many people.\"\n\nAs a result of the war in Gaza, daily rocket fire is taking place in southern Lebanon. Areas near the Israeli border are particularly affected.\n\nIn the ten parishes near the Israeli border, which make up almost the whole of the Maronite Archdiocese of Tyre, 70 percent of Church members have now returned.\n\n\"The parishes of Alma el Chaeb and Quzah are, however, still nearly empty, because they lie entirely in the areas of the air strikes; a large proportion of the houses there have been completely destroyed,\" Abdallah said.\n\nACN and the local Church are helping the local population, which is still suffering from a terrible financial crisis that took place in 2019.\n\n\"The eyes of the world are on the war in Gaza, but something that the media rarely reports is the fact that this has resulted in an armed conflict taking place in southern Lebanon,\" said Marielle Boutros, Project Coordinator of ACN in Lebanon.\n\n\"As with the people in Gaza, this is not the first war which the people in southern Lebanon have had to experience. They can't cope with the noise of the rockets anymore and are traumatized. They really need our prayers,\" she said.\n\nAbdallah said he visits the parishes affected by the war, although twice already during his visits, bombs have landed nearby.\n\n\"We try to keep the spiritual life of the parishes going by celebrating all the usual festivals, whether the festivals of the liturgical year, the festivals of patron saints or First Communion,\" the archbishop said.\n\n\"After the celebrations we listen to the people to see what needs they have and to help them with our modest means,\" he said.\n\nAbdallah said these visits \"encourage the people enormously; they sense that they have not been left in the lurch by the Church.\"\n\nBoutros said she is deeply impressed by the courage and faithfulness of the many project partners of ACN in southern Lebanon.\n\n\"None of them - whether bishops, priests, religious brothers or nuns - have left the region in the face of the constant danger. They feel responsible for staying with the people in their need and offering them support and comfort,\" she said.\n\nShe noted even the priests of the two parishes Alma el Chaeb and Quzah - which are often near the airstrikes - are still in place.", "source": {"uri": "cruxnow.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Crux"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hezbollah",

He provided specific figures on evacuations, stressing that \"42 settlements have been completely evacuated, and life has been disrupted in several others.\"\n\nMoreover, he stated that the Israeli military and security image was deteriorating. \"The deterrent military-security image of the enemy is collapsing in front of its people, its society, and the world,\" he concluded.\n\n\"They failed to protect Israeli ships, which is a huge failure for the two most important naval fleets in the world, primarily the American fleet,\" the Hezbollah chief stressed.\n\nSayyed Nasrallah drew two conclusions from the Yemeni front: \"First, the American-British failure, and second, the Israeli inability to fight on that front.\"\n\nHe criticized the Israeli occupation's pursuit of false victories, stating, \"The enemy is panting after a false and fabricated victory that has no basis in reality, just to present it to its audience as a victory.\"\n\nThe Hezbollah chief highlighted significant losses inflicted on the Israeli occupation by Gaza and the West Bank, as well as from Lebanon, Yemen, and Iraq.\n\n\"The enemy understood since October 8 that its positions would be targeted and that we have enough information about them, their fortifications, their equipment, and their numbers,\" he said. \"We are continuing to strike enemy positions within a certain and specific schedule,\" he declared.\n\nSayyed Nasrallah detailed the Resistance's strategy to \"blind\" and \"deafen\" the Israeli occupation. \"The resistance followed a strategy of blinding the enemy and deafening its ears by targeting technical equipment, radars, balloons, and more,\" he explained.\n\n\"We have a very, very, very large amount of information, and yesterday's release is selected from many hours over Haifa,\" he stressed about the Military Media of the Islamic Resistance in Lebanon - Hezbollah releasing Tuesday footage showing its reconnaissance drones flying over swathes of occupied Palestinian land, including Kiryat Shmona, Nahariya, Safad, Karmiel, Afula, all the way to Haifa and its port.\n\nIn detail, the video first shows Hezbollah's drones flying over a military-industrial complex belonging to Rafael Advanced Defense Systems, which includes numerous factories, warehouses, and testing fields in which components of air defense systems are manufactured and assembled, especially the Iron Dome and David's Sling.\n\nIron Dome and David's Sling platforms, rocket engine test tunnel and storage, air defense missile storage, missile component manufacturing facilities, control and guidance systems factories, company administrative buildings, and missile testing radars, all appeared in the video.\n\nFor more, read: Undetected, Hezbollah Hoopoe mission exposes sensitive Israeli sites\n\n\"We have long hours of footage of Haifa and its surroundings, covering what is north of Haifa, what is beyond Haifa, and what is beyond, beyond Haifa,\" Sayyed Nasrallah said.\n\n\"We have developed our weapons, used new ones, and are keeping other weapons for the coming days to defend our land, our people, and Lebanon's sovereignty,\" he asserted. \"We have fought only with part of our weaponry until now, and we have obtained new weapons which we will not disclose; this will become evident on the battlefield.\"\n\nSayyed Nasrallah also underlined that the Resistance yielded unprecedented manpower.\n\nHe addressed the Israeli occupation's actions in Syria, claiming their failure. \"The enemy conducted a battle amidst war in Syria and was met with failure. Everything that was supposed to reach Lebanon has arrived,\" he noted.\n\n\"The enemy knows well that we have prepared ourselves for the worst days and knows what awaits it, which is why it has been deterred for the past 8-9 months,\" Sayyed Nasrallah said. He emphasized that no location within occupied Palestine was safe from Hezbollah's missiles and drones. \"The enemy knows that there will be no place safe from our missiles and drones, and [our attacks] will not consist of random bombing.\"\n\nNasrallah claimed that Hezbollah possessed a comprehensive and real target bank with the capability to reach all targets, destabilizing the foundation of the Israeli occupation. He also warned that \"the enemy knows that what awaits it in the Mediterranean Sea is also very significant.\"\n\n\"The enemy knows it must expect us on land, in the air, and at sea, and if war is imposed, the resistance will fight without constraints, rules, or limits,\" he declared.\n\nIn a stark statement, he warned the Cypriot government about allowing its airports and bases to be used by the Israeli occupation. \"The Cypriot government should be warned that opening its airports and bases to the enemy to target Lebanon means it has become part of the war.\"\n\nSayyed Nasrallah described the ongoing confrontation as the greatest battle since 1948 with a clear and bright horizon that will change the face of the region and shape its future.", "source": {"uri":

In the video, Hezbollah identified potential targets. According to an analysis by the Alma Research and Education Center, the video seems to have been filmed between early April and mid-June, and while Hezbollah wishes to give the impression that it was filmed during one sortie, it may have been filmed during several, one in the previous 72 hours. The analysis states that Hezbollah is attempting to sow fear among Israelis and presumably wishes to show Israeli decision-makers that it is monitoring sensitive sites and could strike them if war broke out. Alma also notes that Hezbollah plans to publish additional videos, which the group claims will contain footage of locations deeper inside Israel.\n\nIDF Chief of Staff: Military Is at 'A Very High Level of Readiness': On Wednesday, IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi, during a visit to an air defense battery in northern Israel, stated: \"Today we targeted several Hezbollah terrorists, and yesterday Hezbollah released a video showcasing a capability that we knew about ... We of course have infinitely greater capabilities, of which I think the enemy is only familiar with few ... and will confront them at the right time.\" On Wednesday evening, Defense Minister Yoav Gallant held a situation assessment on Lebanon with Halevi, Northern Command head Maj. Gen. Ori Gordin, Israel Air Force commander Maj. Gen. Tomer Bar, and other officers. Gallant stated that the generals should \"be fully prepared for all possibilities,\" adding: \"We have an obligation to change the situation in the north and return the citizens safely to their homes.\" Halevi commented that the military is \"today at a very high level of readiness.\"\n\nHassan Nasrallah: Storming the Galilee an Option if Confrontation Develops: Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, in a speech on Wednesday for a ceremony commemorating senior Hezbollah commander Sami Taleb Abdullah, who was killed last week in an Israeli airstrike, spoke of the possibility of a \"major war,\" stating that \"storming the Galilee is an option that remains on the table if the confrontation develops.\" According to Nasrallah, \"There is no doubt that the loss of Abu Taleb is significant, but we console ourselves that he died as a martyr and achieved the highest aspirations.\" He added: \"We are more determined [than ever] to continue the battle against Israel.\" The Hezbollah leader also spoke about reconnaissance drone footage released by his group on Tuesday, saying: \"We have a significantly large amount of information, and what we published yesterday was only a few minutes from many hours filmed over Haifa ... Our drones provide us with important information to help us strike important targets in Israel.\"\n\nIDF Drone Strike Kills Hamas Nukhba Force Commander Who Participated in October 7 Attacks: The IDF on Thursday announced the death of Ahmed Hassan Salameh a-Swarkeh in a drone strike in Beit Hanoun in northern Gaza. The IDF says that a-Swarkeh, a Hamas Nukhba Force commander who took part in the October 7 attacks, also led and directed sniper attacks in the Beit Hanoun area and took part in terror activity against IDF forces. After lengthy surveillance, troops from the 414th Combat Intelligence Collection Unit identified him. According to the IDF, before launching the drone strike that killed him, it took actions to avoid harming civilians, none of whom were injured. The announcement includes footage of the drone strike.", "source": {"uri": "fdd.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "FDD"}, "authors": [{"uri": "david_may@fdd.org", "name": "David May", "type":

Cyprus has denied taking sides in any war.\n\nThe warning by Nasrallah, who also threatened Israel with widespread precision strikes, left many Lebanese resigned to preparing for a possible escalation.\n\n\"Of course we don't want to go into a war with them - but if that's in solidarity with the people in Gaza, then so be it,\" Tabet, 32, told Reuters in Beirut on Thursday.\n\nAsked if the threat to Cyprus had worried her, Tabet said it could derail her plans for a civil marriage. In Lebanon, personal status laws are governed by the courts of each religion - pushing many couples from different religious backgrounds to travel 40 minutes by plane to Cyprus to be married in court.\n\nShe said it was \"stressful\" to live with so much uncertainty, but that she had been trying to carry on \"as if there's nothing - all of Beirut is like that\".\n\nMany Lebanese see Hezbollah's eight-month conflict with Israel as the latest episode in a string of recent setbacks - from COVID-19 lockdowns to the 2020 Beirut blast and an economic crisis that crushed the local lira and wiped out bank savings.\n\nSami Masri, a 38-year-old businessman from the south who runs a coffeeshop in Beirut, said Israeli strikes had kept him from taking his family to the rolling hills of southern Lebanon for weekends, as they usually did in summer.\n\nThat meant spending more to access private beaches closer to Beirut - and even there, Masri said, he could not have fun.\n\n\"You're not happy because, you don't know, at any point - we have our passports ready, we have a suitcase ready, we have some food stocks ready,\" he told Reuters.\n\nAlready, some 90,000 Lebanese have fled their homes in the south. Some left Lebanon, others are staying with relatives and the most vulnerable are in collective shelters, including in the port city of Sidon.\n\nBana Baalbaki, a Sidon resident who spoke to Reuters in the city's market quarter, put on a brave face.\n\n\"No, I am not afraid because we are not better than the people of Gaza, nor the people of the south who were displaced,\" she told Reuters.\n\nBut others - like shopkeeper Qassem Qarram - were more worried. \"Of course everyone is afraid, and those who tell you they are not afraid will be lying to themselves,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "theglobeandmail.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Globe and Mail"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hezbollah", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hezbollah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beirut", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Beirut"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beirut"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Lebanon"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebanon", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lebanon"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Lebanon"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyprus", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cyprus"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Cyprus"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hassan_Nasrallah", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hassan Nasrallah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_in_Iraq_(2013\u20132017)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "War in Iraq (2013\u20132017)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli\u2013Palestinian_conflict", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_state_of_the_European_Union", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Member state of the European Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_lockdowns", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "COVID-19 lockdowns"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_marriage", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Civil marriage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_crisis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Financial crisis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Religion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Lebanon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Southern Lebanon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internally_displaced_person", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Internally displaced person"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Port"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_lira", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Turkish lira"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidon", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sidon"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sidon"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Lebanon"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History", "label": "dmoz/Society/History", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding/Middle_East", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding/Middle East", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Strength_Sports/Tug-of-War", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Strength Sports/Tug-of-War", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 73}], "image": "https://www.theglobeandmail.com/resizer/v2/363LQEDQYBFR5IYTIP7C4N7UD4.JPG?auth=03faff10fb9fcb895c97ebbcc3ea05e28792190e597f5207f96d21fd6c9a0e97&width=560&quality=80", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9665510", "eventUri": "eng-9665510", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.4745098039215686, "wgt": 119, "relevance": 1}

With conflict between Israel and Hezbollah in the north ratcheting up, Defence Minister Gallant and IDF Chief of Staff Halevi yesterday held an operational situation assessment at the IDF's Northern Command, together with the Head of the Northern Command and Commander of the Israeli Air Force. In public remarks, Gallant said \"We are achieving readiness on land and in the air, strengthening our intelligence systems and preparing for every scenario. We must all remember that Hezbollah started a war against us on October 8th, a day after Hamas [attacked Israel], and since then, it has not stopped [attacking Israel]. We have an obligation to change the situation in the north, and to ensure the safe return of our citizens to their homes, and we will find a way to achieve this.\" Visiting a northern aerial defence array, Halevi said \"We of course have infinitely greater capabilities\" than Hezbollah, \"of which I think the enemy is only familiar with a few of them and will confront them at the right time... our test is to see that today we defend, tomorrow we win, the day after tomorrow we return the residents to a much safer reality, and with them, we also build and restore and make this beautiful area stronger than it was before the war.\"\n\nSecurity - Gaza: IDF Spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari yesterday gave a statement appearing to contradict the official Israeli war aim of the total defeat of Hamas.\n\n\"To tell the public that there won't be any terrorism in Gaza\" after an Israeli victory, he said, \"that there won't be military operatives, that there won't be a [single] rocket, that there won't be a [single] armed man -- is a lie. There will be terrorism in Gaza. Hamas is an idea. To replace the people who are dealing with civilian services, the people who are distributing food or stealing the food, something else needs to be created that might grow. That is a decision for the political leadership, and the military will enact.\" The IDF continues operations in all parts of the Strip, with particular emphasis on Rafah, where \"precise operations\" continue to target the remaining two Hamas battalions in the city. Hagari's comments indicate the IDF's concurrence with the demand from Israel's allies that it give urgent consideration to the question of the 'day after' the war, and to a non-Hamas civilian administration able to both combat Hamas's return and provide for the needs of the civilian population. The US continues to push for a reformed Palestinian Authority playing a significant role in Gaza, though Netanyahu has continued to insist that Israel will not substitute 'Hamastan' for 'Fatahstan'. Meanwhile, based on its successes in degrading Hamas capabilities, the IDF has decided to lift restrictions on Israeli communities in the Gaza periphery. Schools, businesses and factories, agricultural activity and public events, concerts and cultural activity and tourism will all return to something like normal.\n\nDiplomatic - Israel-US: The fallout continues from Netanyahu's public comments earlier this week accusing the US of withholding vital military aid from Israel.\n\nThe White House responded with incredulity, saying that aside from one shipment of 2,000-pound bombs which had been suspended due to concerns over the weapons' use in Rafah, it \"genuinely [did] not know what he's talking about.\" The US then cancelled a high-level meeting set to cover both Iran and Israel's operation in Rafah, leaving Minister Ron Dermer, a close Netanyahu confidante, and National Security Council Director Tzahi Hanegbi to travel to Washington without the most important element of their trip taking place. Israeli media reports today that Netanyahu's broadside reflected a split between him and Dermer, on the one hand, and Gallant and Halevi on the other. The prime minister and Dermer seemingly concluded that the best way to extract greater support from Washington was by means of a public demand.\n\nPolitical - domestic turmoil: Following the pulling from the Knesset of the so-called 'Rabbis' Bill' on Tuesday, Prime Minister Netanyahu's ultra-Orthodox coalition partners Shas and United Torah Judaism (UTJ) are now said to be pushing for early elections.\n\nThe Constitution, Law and Justice Committee and the Knesset plenum had been set to debate the bill, which provides for the creation of hundreds of jobs for municipal rabbis, and is seen as a personal priority of Shas leader Aryeh Deri. However, the bill faced significant opposition from within Netanyahu's own Likud party. On Tuesday, Likud MKs Tally Gotliv and Moshe Saada were removed from the committee on the prime minister's orders. There then followed an intervention from a number of Likud mayors opposed to the bill. Seeing the levels of Likud opposition to the bill, Netanyahu shelved its parliamentary debate. Meanwhile, Netanyahu yesterday traded blows with his National Security Minister, Itamar Ben Gvir, whom he accused of leaking state secrets. Netanyahu released a video in which he said \"I demand of all the coalition partners -- get a hold of yourselves. Rise to the enormity of the occasion. Now isn't the time for petty politics. Now isn't the time for legislation that jeopardises the coalition that is fighting for victory over our enemies.\" The failure to progress the Rabbis' Bill has seemingly persuaded the ultra-Orthodox parties that this government is incapable of achieving its grand prize of a bill to formalise the exemption of ultra-Orthodox men from being drafted into the IDF. The rebellion of Gotliv and Saada, together with the successful interventions of the Likud mayors, illustrates that Netanyahu no longer enjoys the command of his own party for which he has always been renowned. Economy Minister Nir Barkat, thought likely to challenge Netanyahu for the Likud leadership in the near future, has also sought to challenge the prime minister by announcing his opposition to the military draft bill as currently formulated. The Rabbis' bill had first been shelved earlier in the year due to opposition from Benny Gantz and Gideon Saar. It was re-introduced after first Saar and then Gantz left the government. The Supreme Court blocked Deri's appointment as a minister early in the tenure of the current government, on the grounds of his previous criminal convictions and an agreement he made as part of plea bargains not to seek high office again. He has since been included in the government as an observer, and continued to wield significant influence. Ben Gvir has long sought inclusion in the highest circles of decision-making on the war in Gaza. Before Netanyahu announced the dissolution of the war cabinet last week, the Jewish Power leader had pushed for a seat at the table.\n\nLooking ahead: US envoy Amos Hochstein remains in the region to try to achieve a diplomatic resolution to increasingly intense cross-border fighting the US fears might develop into an all-out regional war.\n\nUS and French efforts over the last eight months have so far failed to produce a breakthrough. 80,000 northern Israelis remain displaced, and Israel insists it will be forced to proceed with further operations, possibly including a ground invasion, to resecure the northern front. The Knesset's summer session is set to end on July 24th, until which time Netanyahu will seek to maintain his coalition. Early next week, Gallant and Defence Ministry Director General Maj. Gen. (res.) Eyal Zamir are scheduled to travel to the US for talks on military aid Read Previous", "source": {"uri": "bicom.org.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "BICOM"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Daily rocket fire is taking place in southern Lebanon. Areas near the Israeli border are particularly affected.\n\nTen Catholic parishes close to the Israeli border, and which make up almost the whole of the Maronite Archdiocese of Tyre, saw an exodus of people as the conflict in Gaza escalated. Now, about 70 per cent of parishioners have returned.\n\nMaronite Archbishop Charbel Abdallah of Tyre told Aid to the Church in Need (CAN) that most of the people who fled and went to Beirut or further north \"have now returned home because they were short of money and the little houses of their relatives who took them in did not have the capacity to accommodate so many people\".\n\nHe noted, however, that the parishes of Alma el Chaeb and Quzah remain \"nearly empty, because they lie entirely in the areas of the air strikes; a large proportion of the houses there have been completely destroyed.\"\n\nHe added: \"We find ourselves in a state of war.\"\n\nACN and the local Church are helping the affected population, which is still suffering from a terrible financial crisis that took place in 2019.\n\n\"The eyes of the world are on the war in Gaza, but something that the media rarely reports is the fact that this has resulted in an armed conflict taking place in southern Lebanon,\" said Marielle Boutros, Project Coordinator of ACN in Lebanon.\n\n\"As with the people in Gaza, this is not the first war which the people in southern Lebanon have had to experience. They can't cope with the noise of the rockets anymore and are traumatised. They really need our prayers,\" she said.\n\nAbdallah said he visits the parishes affected by the war, although twice already during his visits, bombs have landed nearby.\n\n\"We try to keep the spiritual life of the parishes going by celebrating all the usual festivals, whether the festivals of the liturgical year, the festivals of patron saints or First Communion,\" the archbishop said.\n\n\"After the celebrations we listen to the people to see what needs they have and to help them with our modest means.\"\n\nAbdallah said these visits \"encourage the people enormously; they sense that they have not been left in the lurch by the Church\".\n\nBoutros said she is deeply impressed by the courage and faithfulness of the many project partners of ACN in southern Lebanon.\n\n\"None of them - whether bishops, priests, religious brothers or nuns - have left the region in the face of the constant danger. They feel responsible for staying with the people in their need and offering them support and comfort,\" she said.\n\nShe noted even the priests of the two parishes Alma el Chaeb and Quzah - which are often near the airstrikes - are still in place.\n\nEarlier this week, Hezbollah released a nine-minute drone footage of the Israeli port city of Haifa filmed in daytime, showed civilian and military areas it could attack.\n\nIn response, Israel's Foreign Minister Israel Katz responded with a post on X, stating that Isreal will not tolerate any such attack.\n\n\"[Hezbollah] boasts today about filming the ports of Haifa, operated by international companies from China and India, and threatens to attack them,\" Katz wrote.\n\n\"We are very close to the moment of decision to change the rules against Hezbollah and Lebanon. In an all-out war, Hezbollah will be destroyed and Lebanon will be severely hit.\"\n\nPhoto: A smoke plume rises over the southern Lebanese village of Kfar Kila during an Israeli bombardment, amid ongoing cross-border clashes between Israeli troops and Hezbollah fighters; 16 May 2024.

Cyprus has denied taking sides in any war.\n\nThe warning by Nasrallah, who also threatened Israel with widespread precision strikes, left many Lebanese resigned to preparing for a possible escalation.\n\n\"Of course we don't want to go into a war with them - but if that's in solidarity with the people in Gaza, then so be it,\" Tabet, 32, told Reuters in Beirut on Thursday.\n\nAsked if the threat to Cyprus had worried her, Tabet said it could derail her plans for a civil marriage. In Lebanon, personal status laws are governed by the courts of each religion - pushing many couples from different religious backgrounds to travel 40 minutes by plane to Cyprus to be married in court.\n\nShe said it was \"stressful\" to live with so much uncertainty, but that she had been trying to carry on \"as if there's nothing - all of Beirut is like that\".\n\nMany Lebanese see Hezbollah's eight-month conflict with Israel as the latest episode in a string of recent setbacks - from COVID-19 lockdowns to the 2020 Beirut blast and an economic crisis that crushed the local lira and wiped out bank savings.\n\nPASSPORTS AND FOOD STOCKS READY\n\nSami Masri, a 38-year-old businessman from the south who runs a coffeeshop in Beirut, said Israeli strikes had kept him from taking his family to the rolling hills of southern Lebanon for weekends, as they usually did in summer.\n\nThat meant spending more to access private beaches closer to Beirut - and even there, Masri said, he could not have fun.\n\n\"You're not happy because, you don't know, at any point - we have our passports ready, we have a suitcase ready, we have some food stocks ready,\" he told Reuters.\n\nAlready, some 90,000 Lebanese have fled their homes in the south. Some left Lebanon, others are staying with relatives and the most vulnerable are in collective shelters, including in the port city of Sidon.\n\nBana Baalbaki, a Sidon resident who spoke to Reuters in the city's market quarter, put on a brave face.\n\n\"No, I am not afraid because we are not better than the people of Gaza, nor the people of the south who were displaced,\" she told Reuters.\n\nBut others - like shopkeeper Qassem Qarram - were more worried. \"Of course everyone is afraid, and those who tell you they are not afraid will be lying to themselves,\" he said.\n\n(Reporting by Emilie Madi in Beirut; Aziz Taher and Hassan Hankir in Sidon; Writing by Maya Gebeily; Editing by Alex Richardson)", "source": {"uri": "usnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "U.S. News & World Report"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hezbollah", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hezbollah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beirut", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Beirut"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beirut"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Lebanon"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebanon", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lebanon"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Lebanon"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyprus", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cyprus"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Cyprus"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hassan_Nasrallah", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hassan Nasrallah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_in_Iraq_(2013\u20132017)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "War in Iraq (2013\u20132017)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli\u2013Palestinian_conflict", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_state_of_the_European_Union", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Member state of the European Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidon", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sidon"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sidon"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Lebanon"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_lockdowns", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "COVID-19 lockdowns"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_crisis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Financial crisis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passport", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Passport"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_lira", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Turkish lira"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Religion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Lebanon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Southern Lebanon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internally_displaced_person", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Internally displaced person"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Port"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial_Disputes", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial Disputes", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding/Middle_East", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding/Middle East", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Strength_Sports/Tug-of-War", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Strength Sports/Tug-of-War", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 70}], "image": "https://www.usnews.com/dims4/USNEWS/7e4b337/2147483647/thumbnail/970x647/quality/85/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.usnews.com%2Fcmsmedia%2Fc3%2F5e5b28910457007f2c3fd9122ee307%2Ftag%3Areuters.com%2C2024%3Anewsml_LYNXMPEK5J0MY%3A12024-06-20T164241Z_1_LYNXMPEK5J0MY_RTROPTP_3_ISRAEL-PALESTINIANS-LEBANON-MOOD.JPG", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9665510", "eventUri": "eng-9665510", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.584313725490196, "wgt": 109, "relevance": 1}

The U.S. had publicly announced it was holding up one aid package last month, but it's unclear what exactly prompted Netanyahu to issue the rebuke to Israel's most important ally this week.\n\nU.S. officials quickly shot down Netanyahu's claims, and on Thursday, National Security Council coordinator John Kirby had choice words for the Israeli leader.\n\nNetanyahu's video \"was perplexing to say the least, certainly disappointing especially given that no other country is doing more to help Israel defend itself against the threat by Hamas, and quite frankly, other threats that they're facing in the region than the United States,\" Kirby said.\n\n\"I think we've made it abundantly clear to our Israeli counterparts through various vehicles our deep disappointment in the statements expressed in that video and our concerns over the accuracy in the statements made,\" he added.\n\nNetanyahu's office issued a response to Kirby's remarks on X, saying the prime minister is \"willing to absorb personal attacks if that is what it takes for Israel to get the arms and ammunition it needs in its war for survival.\"\n\nThe U.S. has provided Israel with billions of dollars of military aid since Hamas's Oct. 7 terrorist attack that prompted the current unrest in the Middle East. The Department of Defense quickly deployed resources to the Middle East to deter Israeli adversaries from acting following the attack that left roughly 1,200 people dead and about 250 taken hostage.\n\nU.S. officials maintain they don't want to see a wider war and believe the situation between Israel and Hezbollah can still be worked out diplomatically.\n\nNetanyahu and Biden have repeatedly butted heads over the course of the war, oftentimes when one of them would be playing to their domestic base, but the U.S. has remained supportive of Israel's war objectives.\n\nThis current back-and-forth comes as Israel and Hezbollah have escalated their rhetoric about a potential all-out conflict. Hezbollah began firing rockets and missiles over Israel's border into the northern part of the country, forcing Israel to evacuate tens of thousands of civilians who live in that area. That part of the country remains abandoned.\n\nHezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah warned on Wednesday that a full-scale conflict with Israel would be \"without rules or ceilings\" and that \"no place\" would be safe in such a conflict.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nA day earlier, Hezbollah released a nine-minute-long video of drone footage from an unmanned aerial vehicle that purportedly flew over Israel -- including areas not near the Lebanese border -- highlighting the terrorist group's capabilities and potential Israeli vulnerabilities.\n\nIsraeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz said in response to the video, \"We are very close to the moment of decision to change the rules against Hezbollah and Lebanon. In an all-out war, Hezbollah will be destroyed and Lebanon will be severely hit.\"", "source": {"uri": "washingtonexaminer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Examiner"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mike_brest@washingtonexaminer.com", "name": "Mike Brest", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Netanyahu", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Benjamin Netanyahu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hezbollah", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hezbollah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Kirby_(admiral)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "John Kirby (admiral)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_National_Security_Council", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States National Security Council"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Middle East"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tel_Aviv", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tel Aviv"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tel Aviv"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Defense", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Defense"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prime minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebanon", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lebanon"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Lebanon"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Katz", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Israel Katz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hassan_Nasrallah", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hassan Nasrallah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Foreign_Affairs_(Israel)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Israel)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli\u2013Palestinian_conflict", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned_aerial_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Unmanned aerial vehicle"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Strength_Sports/Tug-of-War", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Strength Sports/Tug-of-War", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Benjamin-Netanyahu-ceremony-Nahalat-Yitshak-Cemetery.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9665510", "eventUri": "eng-9665510", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-10-07", "textStart": 1514, "textEnd": 1520}], "sentiment": -0.2235294117647059, "wgt": 456612617, "relevance": 2}

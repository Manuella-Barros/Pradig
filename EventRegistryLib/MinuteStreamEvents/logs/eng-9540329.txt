She was hysterical, crying on the phone. She told me that Chris had [fallen] into the lake, and he had been underwater for 20 minutes or so.\"\n\nGeorge said her son - an aspiring medical doctor - was rescued and taken to a nearby hospital. She added: \"The doctor called us in and told me that at that time, he was brain-dead, pretty much, and the rest of his organs were starting to fail, and that we had 72 hours on\" life support, though Gilbert later regained consciousness and the ability to eat on his own.\n\nAn attorney for Gilbert's family, Claudia Payne, told KSLA that the friend group initially told police that he had fallen into the lake. But further investigation, he said, found that a female friend had pushed him into the water.\n\n\"She actually admitted to [Gilbert's] mom - as well as the police officers - that she pushed him into the lake,\" Payne said. \"In the legal field, we categorize things the way we see fit, so of course they are saying horseplay. We are saying that it was a criminal intentional push into the lake.\"\n\nShe added that one of the friends from the group attempted to pull Gilbert out, but it was ultimately a restaurant customer who rescued him.\n\nDescribing her reaction upon seeing her son for the first time at the hospital, George said: \"I was devastated. I felt like my life had ended in that moment.\n\n\"My son is aspiring to be a medical doctor - my son is going to be a medical doctor. He got his master's last year in biological science. He's preparing for medical school so for this to have happened to him ... I was just devastated.\"\n\nGeorge recalled the conversation she had with the friend who pushed Gilbert into the lake. She remembered asking, \"Why would you push my son in the lake, knowing he couldn't swim?\"\n\nIn response, the friend reportedly said: \"Well ma'am, I didn't know that man couldn't swim.\"\n\nGilbert replied: \"Who is 'that man?' This is supposed to be amongst a group of friends. Who is 'that man?' Chris? Everybody knows he can't swim.\n\n\"Even when we went to the restaurant, the owner of the restaurant even stated, 'Everybody knows Chris can't swim.' He's been coming here for two years. He's always joking about it.\"\n\nAccording to Payne, Gilbert's family wants police to arrest the person who allegedly pushed him into the lake. They are also seeking for the restaurant owner to be held liable for not keeping Chris safe as a patron of the establishment.\n\nA change.org supporting the Gilbert family's wishes had collected more than 2,600 signatures as of Sunday.\n\nGilbert had woken up as of Friday, was able to eat on his own and had been temporarily taken off life support, KNOE reported.", "source": {"uri": "uk.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News UK"}, "authors": [{"uri": "maya_yang@uk.news.yahoo.com", "name": "Maya Yang", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain_damage", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Brain damage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KSLA", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "KSLA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Physician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_D'Arbonne", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lake D'Arbonne"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farmerville,_Louisiana", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Farmerville, Louisiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Farmerville, Louisiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_support", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Life support"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain_death", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brain death"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consciousness", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Consciousness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_school", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Medical school"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Change.org", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Change.org"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Biology"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Water_Sports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Water Sports", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Water_Sports/Swimming_and_Diving", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Water Sports/Swimming and Diving", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Friendship", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Friendship", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Large_Families", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Large Families", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Family_Resources_and_Support", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Family Resources and Support", "wgt": 11}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/theguardian_763/a731b073d177c218076d87d309576007", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9540329", "eventUri": "eng-9540329", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-14", "textStart": 265, "textEnd": 273}], "sentiment": 0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 212, "relevance": 1}

We are saying that it was a criminal intentional push into the lake.'\n\nChristopher Gilbert, 26, had graduated with a masters degree from Louisiana State University\n\nVideo from the incident shows Gilbert's friends casually peering into the water as he fought for up to 20 minutes to save himself at the lake in Farmerville, Louisiana\n\nHis heart and breathing had stopped by the time an onlooker hauled him from the 15ft water\n\nGilbert's mother, Yolanda George, said she was alerted when one of the friends rang her at home.\n\n'She told me that Chris had fallen into the lake and he had been underwater for 20 minutes or so,' George told Fox8.\n\n'And I was like, 20 minutes? Why was he underwater for 20 minutes?\n\n'And she was just crying hysterically and he was being airlifted to Shreveport.\n\n'And initially when my son got there the doctor called us in and told me that at this time he was brain 'dead pretty much, and the rest of his organs were starting to fail.'\n\nGeorge raced to the center where she found her son clinging to life.\n\n'I was devastated, I felt like my life had ended in a moment,' she said. 'My son is aspiring to be a medical doctor, he got his masters last year. My son is so sweet, the most selfless being you'll ever meet, I was in a terrible state.'\n\nOutside she found some of the group in the hospital waiting room.\n\nThe young scientist from Shreveport planned to enroll in medical school to become a doctor\n\nHis father and grandfather proudly watched as he qualified from LSU\n\nThree weeks on he remains on life support at Ochsner LSU Health\n\nMother Yolanda (center) and lawyer Claudia Payne (right) told KSLA they want justice\n\n'The friend group came to the hospital still telling me the same fabricated story that he fell,' she said.\n\n'I learned at that moment in the ER, the sheriff called me and he said 'are you familiar with what happened?\n\n'And 'yes he was at the lake and he fell', and he was like 'no, one of the young ladies pushed him'\n\n'And I was like 'who pushed him?' And I started looking around the room, 'which one of you all pushed him?\n\n'The young lady like 'I did', and I was 'Why would you push my son in the lake knowing he couldn't swim?\n\n'She said, 'Well ma'am I didn't know that man couldn't swim', and I was like 'who is 'that man'?\n\n'This is supposed to among a group of friends. 'Who is that man?' Chris.\n\n'Everyone knows he can't swim. He jokes about not being able to swim, even when we went to the restaurant the owner of the restaurant stated everybody knows Chris can't swim, he's been coming here for two years he's always joking about it.'\n\nThe video shows that at one point a woman in a black bikini followed Gilbert into the water but without returning with the drowning man.\n\nSgt Ashley Rhodes of the Union Parish Sheriff's Office arrived at the lake to find restaurant patron Dawson Foust desperately trying to save Gilbert's life.\n\nIn his incident report he noted his conversation with the group of friends.\n\n'They advised they thought he was playing a prank by not coming up immediately,' he wrote.\n\n'Some members of the group did not realize Gilbert could not swim.\n\n'It was later discovered the group was horse playing and one of the females in the group pushed Gilbert in the water, not knowing he could not swim.\n\n'Foust advised me it was approximately 15 feet deep at the location he found Gilbert.'\n\nUnion Sheriff Dusty Gates gave a different account when he was interviewed about the April 14 incident.\n\n'The party he was with began panicking or screaming and an individual within the restaurant saw what was going on and he came out and dove in and retrieved the victim,' he said.\n\n'We don't know if it may turn worse again because at one point, he was off the ventilator but then they put him back on two days later' his mother said\n\n'It was a joint effort by a lot of people to make this happen, and that's what we try to work for here in Union Parish, to work together to make it a better place.'\n\nGilbert remains on life-support in hospital as doctors try to establish whether he will ever recover.\n\n'It's still a battle because we don't know what to expect,' his mother said.\n\n'We don't know if it may turn worse again because at one point, he was off the ventilator but then they put him back on two days later.'", "source": {"uri":

She told me that Chris has fell into the lake and he had been underwater for 10 minutes or so.\"\n\nGeorge says that the time her son spent underwater did signifcant damage to his entire body.\n\n\"The doctor called us in and told me that at that time, he was brain dead and the rest of his organs were starting to fail. That we had 72 hours on the ECMO machine. It's sort of like dialysis for the lungs and they had to put him on a ventilator.\"\n\nThankfully, a WBNG report states that after two weeks, Gilbert has finally been taken off life support and is making a miraculous recovery. He will likely be released from the hospital soon. Additionally, the friends initially told police that the 26-year-old fell into the water. Following an investigation, detectives found out that he was pushed into the water by a female in the friend group. At this point no arrests have been made and the family along with local activists are demanding justice.\n\nWe will follow this story and update it as we receive new information.", "source": {"uri": "bossip.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Bossip"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Black people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KSLA", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "KSLA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hate_crime", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hate crime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_D'Arbonne", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lake D'Arbonne"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanging", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hanging"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shreveport,_Louisiana", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shreveport, Louisiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Shreveport, Louisiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farmerville,_Louisiana", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Farmerville, Louisiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Farmerville, Louisiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney_dialysis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kidney dialysis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventilator", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ventilator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extracorporeal_membrane_oxygenation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_support", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Life support"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain_death", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brain death"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lung"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://bossip.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2024/05/17150238580842.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9540329", "eventUri": "eng-9540329", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 151, "relevance": 1}

Shockingly, they stood by as he struggled in the water, captured in a chilling video circulating on social media, the New York Post reported.\n\nDespite their initial indifference, a ray of hope emerged when a nearby diner intervened, rescuing Gilbert just moments before it was too late. Yet, the damage was done. Upon arrival at the hospital, the 26-year-old was declared brain dead, his organs already failing, leaving his distraught mother, Yolanda George, reeling in anguish.\n\nGilbert, driven by his aspirations to become a doctor, had already made significant strides in his academic journey, holding a master's degree in biological science. His mother's devastation was palpable, shattered by the senseless tragedy that befell her son.\n\nInvestigations revealed the callousness of Gilbert's companions, who callously dismissed the incident as mere \"horseplay,\" even lying to his mother about the gravity of the situation. The fact that they knowingly endangered Gilbert's life by pushing him into the water, despite being aware of his inability to swim, is a bitter pill for the grieving family to swallow.\n\nAmidst their grief, the family seeks justice, demanding accountability for the actions of those responsible. Their lawyer echoed this sentiment, condemning the friends' criminal intent and highlighting the absence of any attempt to rescue Gilbert by the very individuals who endangered him.\n\nWhile Gilbert shows signs of responding to treatment, his recovery is marred by the grim reality of his condition. Though he remains on life support, his ability to communicate has been stripped away, his lungs struggling at a mere 20 per cent capacity.", "source": {"uri": "news9live.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News9live"}, "authors": [{"uri": "adan_khan@news9live.com", "name": "Adan Khan", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batoidea", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Batoidea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Post", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain_death", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brain death"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master's_degree", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Master's degree"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tragedy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Biology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gravity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_support", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Life support"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swallow", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Swallow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endangered_species", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Endangered species"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lung"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/End-of-Life", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/End-of-Life", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://images.news9live.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/WhatsApp-Image-2024-05-05-at-7.25.20-PM.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9540329", "eventUri": "eng-9540329", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2941176470588235, "wgt": 148, "relevance": 1}

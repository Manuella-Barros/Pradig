The school will be located in Demopolis but would take in students from around the state. The proposal is aimed at trying to address a shortage of healthcare workers in the state.\n\nThe Alabama Senate voted 28-3 for the bill, which now goes to Gov. Kay Ivey for her signature. Ivey had championed the proposal in her State of the State address at the start of the legislative session.\n\n\"Students from all over Alabama will soon benefit from an education at this specialty high school and then go on to bolster our healthcare workforce,\" Ivey said in a statement Thursday.\n\nThere are three existing residential public high schools that draw students from across the state: the Alabama School of Fine Arts in Birmingham; the Alabama School of Math and Science in Mobile; and Alabama School of Cyber Technology and Engineering in Huntsville.\n\n\"This is going to be another jewel for the state of Alabama to brag on,\" Senate Minority Leader Bobby Singleton said after the vote.\n\nSen. Larry Stutts, who is a doctor, cast one of the three no votes against the bill. Stutts said he thought the state could help more students by funding smaller programs across the state instead of creating a new residential high school.\n\nThe proposed education budget for next fiscal year includes a $15 million appropriation for the school.\n\nTags Wire Alabama Legislaturee Medical Technology Politics Education Schools U.s.

Additionally, Ivey proclaimed May as World Trade Month in Alabama.\n\n\"Last year, Alabama exports went to 190 countries, showing the power of our 'Made in Alabama' brand across the globe,\" Ivey said. \"The high-performing companies we're honoring today are finding success on a global stage, and I want to ensure they are showcased as role models within the state's business community.\n\n\"They prove that Alabama companies can grow and thrive at home, while also competing with the best the world has to offer,\" she said.\n\nThe following companies were honored:\n\nIn addition, Ivey presented Nisa Miranda, who served as director of the University of Alabama Center for Economic Development from 1995 until her retirement in March, with the Trade Advocate of the Year Award for her longstanding support of the state export support system.\n\nRead about the 2023 winners.\n\nAlabama's exports have been surging in recent years, increasing 43% in value since 2020.

The eight individuals below are described in a quote from leaders speaking to their impact, effectiveness, and upward trajectory. They are each well on their way to running the state.\n\nPreston Roberts\n\n\"Preston Roberts from Alfa has distinguished himself as a leader in agriculture and public policy through passionate advocacy for Alabama Farmers Federation members and unshakable integrity. He has excelled professionally while simultaneously earning a juris doctor and being a loving, engaged husband and father. Preston is guided by deep faith and driven by a commitment to give his best in every endeavor. We are proud Yellowhammer has recognized Preston's servant leadership and are confident he will continue using his influence to benefit Federation members, his colleagues, and the state of Alabama.\"\n\n- Paul Pinyan, Executive Director of the Alabama Farmers Federation\n\n\"With a resume that includes service in the Governor's Office, the Alabama Department of Revenue, and now the Lieutenant Governor's Office, Catherine Gayle has earned her reputation as an expert on analyzing, understanding, and solving complex public policy issues. She is recognized by everyone on my staff as the 'brains' in the office, which is obvious as she works on her doctorate after already earning Masters and undergraduate degrees in political science. I am confident Catherine Gayle will help shape state policy in Alabama for many years to come, and we are fortunate she is devoting her God-given talents and abilities to our initiatives.\"\n\n\"Part of the Ivey Administration since my first day as governor, Gina Maiola has proven herself as an invaluable asset, enhancing our engagement through responsible communication with both the media and Alabamians alike. Her dedication and exceptional skillset were evident from her earliest days and now have been mastered in her senior staff role as my communications director. With strategic acumen and a commitment to transparency, she has not only supported my administration's promises and goals but has significantly contributed to the betterment of Alabama. I have every bit of confidence that her influence will continue to grow, bringing fresh ideas and strong leadership that will greatly impact our state's progress.\"\n\n\"There's not a brighter, young star in Alabama politics than Rob Green. A lot of people work hard. He works harder. He works smarter. He doesn't draw attention to himself, but people are figuring out in a hurry that he's extremely capable and has the ear and the confidence of people all over state government. What's also certain about Rob Green is that he is marrying well.\"\n\n- Steve Windom, Founder of Windom, Galliher & Associates\n\nHarrison Proctor\n\n\"Since transitioning from Washington DC to our headquarters in Birmingham, Harrison has combined his advocacy, legal and business knowledge and experience to effectively represent Protective both in the legislature and in our trade groups. He has the right combination of substantive and strategic expertise for this role and we are confident in his abilities to advocate on behalf of our company, our employees and our policyholders.\"\n\n\"William has a resume that an operative twice his age would dream of having. He has worked with some of the biggest names in politics, government, and business and is just getting started. While his relationships in Alabama are impressive to say the least, he maintains a cool and humble demeanor at all times -- a feat that I'd guess is challenging when you're as skilled as William. I've never seen him break a sweat. He operates at one consistent speed and consistently achieves outstanding results, gives great advice, and works very, very hard.\"\n\n\"From the moment he walked in the door, I could tell Jack had the tools to be successful in this business: natural political instincts and, more importantly, a killer work ethic. Jack effortlessly connects with clients and clearly sees the political landscape. At his young age, he has already become a great asset. My firm and I are proud that Yellowhammer has recognized Jack, and we know that we will see him on lists like this for years to come.\"\n\n- Raymond Bell, Maynard Nexsen Government Solutions Practice Shareholder\n\nCaroline Franklin\n\n\"Caroline Franklin, above all, is wonderful. She has proven herself effective at every turn, from the halls of power at the State House in Montgomery to the U.S. Capitol in Washington. As Executive Director of BCA's ProgressPAC, Caroline will leverage her influence and discernment to the victory and gain of pro-business candidates in every corner of Alabama in the 2026 election cycle and beyond. Her winning personality, along with her unmatched drive and commitment to the people who make our collective voice stronger than ever, is second to none. Caroline Franklin will be fun to watch.\"\n\n- Helena Duncan, Business Council of Alabama President & CEO\n\nLuke Kiszla\n\n\"Luke Kizla has been extraordinarily effective and successful in his role as Chief of Staff for the Alabama House Office of the Minority Leader. His keen and thorough knowledge of the law and the legislative process has been instrumental in our ability to pass meaningful legislation to improve the lives of our constituents. Most importantly, Luke understands the importance of building and maintaining professional partnerships. Whether it's working with subject matter experts on a complex issue or crafting an amendment for a bill, Luke brings a rare combination of expertise, creativity, and positive energy to his work.

The legislation received letters of support from the Alabama Retail Association, Alabama Society of CPAs, the Alabama National Federation of Independent Business, and small business owners across Alabama.\n\n\"Simplifying the requirements put on small businesses, especially when an error in compliance could result in the loss of a business's registration, is a worthwhile cause,\" said Secretary Allen.\n\nSecretary Allen thanks bill sponsor Representative Margie Wilcox, co-sponsor Representative Bubba Underwood, and Senator David Sessions for presenting HB 230 in the Senate.

The passage of HB 230 makes operating a business in Alabama more manageable for business owners.\"", "source": {"uri": "alreporter.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Alabama Political Reporter"}, "authors": [{"uri": "patrick_darrington@alreporter.com", "name": "Patrick Darrington", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_tape", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Red tape"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_business", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Small business"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alabama", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alabama"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Alabama"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wes_Allen_(politician)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wes Allen (politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary_of_State_of_Alabama", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Secretary of State of Alabama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_State", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Secretary of State"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Federation_of_Independent_Business", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Federation of Independent Business"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revenue", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Revenue"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Sessions", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "David Sessions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accountant", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Accountant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilcox_County,_Alabama", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wilcox County, Alabama"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wilcox County, Alabama"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Organizations/Advocacy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Organizations/Advocacy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Biotechnology_and_Pharmaceuticals/Associations", "label": "dmoz/Business/Biotechnology and Pharmaceuticals/Associations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Occupational_Health_and_Safety/Lasers", "label": "dmoz/Health/Occupational Health and Safety/Lasers", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Government_Contracting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Government Contracting", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 75}], "image": "https://www.alreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/wes-allen-1024x576.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9548105", "eventUri": "eng-9548105", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 160, "relevance": 1}

(In case of rain May 9, volunteers should note the event will be cancelled for that day.)\n\nAn estimated 1,000 students with disabilities from Alabaster and Pelham city schools and Shelby and Jefferson County school systems will descend on the park during the three-day event.

They are our state's chief election officials and this bill protects them as much as the folks at the city and county levels.\"\n\nThe Alabama Secretary of State's Office was not immediately available for comment late Wednesday.\n\nThe Alabama Senate passed HB100 unanimously on Wednesday. The vote came 14 days after the Senate Judiciary Committee, on a 4-4-3 vote, seemingly killed the legislation amid concerns about potentially levying harsh punishments on angry voters engaged in verbal spats with poll workers.\n\nThe concerns expressed by Republicans during the committee meeting focused on punishing angry voters with a \"crime of moral turpitude\" if they are convicted of an assault for relatively minor offense such as aggressively pointing their finger in a poll worker's chest. In Alabama, a crime of \"moral turpitude\" that disqualifies an individual from voting includes some of the most serious offense including murder, rape, kidnapping, sexual abuse and torture, human trafficking, terrorism, child sex abuse, etc.\n\nSen. Will Barfoot, R-Pike Road, opted to keep the legislation alive following the April 24 committee meeting in order to give lawmakers more time to review it. He also emphasized the legislation was not meant to create a new penalty under Alabama state law. Sen. Vivian Figures, D-Mobile, also urged her GOP colleagues to reconsider the bill by saying they \"know this is something that is needed.\"\n\nClarke said over the past two weeks, she along with Mike Jones, general counsel within the Secretary of State's Office and a former member of the Alabama House, met with senators to discuss the bill.\n\n\"It was a matter of explaining the bill to them,\" Clarke said.\n\nUnder HB100, if a felony is committed against the election official, which is motivated by an individual's role as an election official, then they would be disqualified from voting.\n\nThe offense was added to a list of crimes that are part of the Felony Voter Disqualification Act.\n\nThe legislation, amended in the Alabama House last month, also added a few more felonies to that list: Aggravated stalking, domestic violence in the first and second degree, domestic violence by strangulation, compelling street gang membership, and elder abuse.\n\nIt was voted out of the Alabama House with a 95-0 vote on April 16.\n\nThe legislation, if signed by Gov. Kay Ivey, will be effective on Oct. 1, and before the Nov. 5 general election.\n\n\"This sends a message,\" Clarke said. \"We have to make sure just like we want our election safe and secure in Alabama, we want our election officials safe and secure for the work they do in our state.\"\n\nThe passage of HB100 in Alabama comes as threats about poll worker safety intensifies ahead of the presidential election. Much of the threats have occurred in presidential \"swing\" states like Arizona where former President Donald Trump, the current GOP presidential nominee, and his supporters have aimed baseless claims about voter fraud during the 2020 elections. Following the 2020 election, more than 60 lawsuits brought by Trump and his allies were all thrown out of court.\n\nPresident Joe Biden, on Wednesday, said Trump will not accept the election result in November if he loses, calling it \"dangerous\" behavior from his opponent.\n\nPolling shows that threats and harassments are a concern among election workers. One-quarter of those polled in an Election & Voting Information Center survey in 2022 said they had experienced abuse, harassment, threats as part of their jobs as election workers. An overwhelming majority of the threats are politically-based.\n\nThirteen states have enacted election worker protection laws since 2021, and a handful of others are weighing proposals this year to create felonies meant to protect election workers.\n\nThere have been no known incidents of violence directed at a poll worker in Alabama in recent years.\n\nBut the threats occurring elsewhere are hampering Alabama officials from recruiting enough poll workers on Election Day. Probate judges who administer elections on the county level say they are concerned over the lack of interest in working the election.\n\nMobile County Probate Judge Don Davis said in March that the county is experiencing difficulty in recruiting residents to work at the polls. The main reasoning for that, he and others have said, was fear of potential violence based on what someone is seeing in the media on TV or the Internet in other areas of the country.", "source":

According to ESPN's Jeremy Fowler, Boyd is signing a one-year deal with the Tennessee Titans. The deal is reportedly worth up to $4.5 million.\n\nDuring his time with the Bengals, Boyd, 29, compiled 513 receptions, 6,000 receiving yards and 31 touchdowns. The University of Pittsburgh product etched his name into Cincinnati's history books, as he has the fourth-most receptions and seventh-most touchdowns in franchise history.\n\nA reunion with Brian Callahan\n\nNow, Boyd will continue his career in Tennessee, where he will reunite with Brian Callahan, who took over as head coach of the Titans this year after spending the past several seasons as the offensive coordinator in Cincinnati. Given their time together, Callahan probably has some good ideas about how to maximize Boyd's skill set.\n\nWith the Titans, Boyd will likely slot in as the No. 3 receiver alongside Calvin Ridley and De'Andre Hopkins to form an extremely talented trio. Boyd's experience playing as a third receiver in Cincinnati with Ja'Marr Chase and Tee Higgins should help him in his new role.\n\nWith the additions of Ridley and now Boyd this offseason, the Titans have done a good job of surrounding second-year quarterback Will Levis with some legitimate weapons.

Now, it's official. According to ESPN's Jeremy Fowler, Boyd is signing a one-year deal worth up to $4.5 million with the Tennessee Titans.\n\nAs Fowler notes, he reunites with Brian Callahan, his long-time offensive coordinator in Cincinnati hired by the Titans earlier in the offseason.\n\nMoney was reportedly a sticking point between the Steelers and Boyd though his deal, with incentives, seems to be relatively cheap. Some of that reporting was disputed with Fowler at one point noting the Steelers never made a \"hard offer.\" But after Pittsburgh drafted Roman Wilson, who primarily played in the slot at Michigan, there was little need to sign a slot receiver like Boyd.\n\nA Pittsburgh native, Boyd's fit made sense early in free agency. Pittsburgh released veteran slot receiver Allen Robinson and needed receiver help. Boyd could've finished out his career in his hometown. But the two sides weren't able to come to an agreement. Boyd turned to the Los Angeles Chargers and Titans, choosing to sign with the latter.\n\nA Bengal his entire career until today, Boyd has appeared in 120 games. He's caught 513 passes for exactly 6,000 yards and 31 touchdowns. In 2023, he posted 67 receptions for 667 yards and a pair of scores. Now, he'll look to boost a Titans' offense with a solid top-three at receiver, joining Calvin Ridley and DeAndre Hopkins.\n\nIn 14 career regular season games versus the Steelers, Boyd caught 51 passes for 576 yards and five touchdowns. His top performance came in a 2019 loss, hauling in five receptions for 101 yards and one score. In two games against Pittsburgh last season, he caught eight passes for 82 yards and zero touchdowns.\n\nThe Steelers aren't scheduled to play the Titans this season meaning the only way Pittsburgh sees Tyler Boyd is if Pittsburgh and Tennessee square off in the playoffs.\n\nRelated Items:Jeremy Fowler, Tennessee Titans, Tyler Boyd Recommended for you Fowler: Steelers Believed Troy Fautanu Could Go 10th, Amarius Mims Was 'On Their Radar' Rapoport: Free Agent WR Zay Jones Visiting Titans The Athletic's Mark Kaboly Puts Steelers Chances Of Signing Tyler Boyd At '1%'", "source": {"uri": "steelersdepot.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Steelers Depot"}, "authors": [{"uri": "alex_kozora@steelersdepot.com", "name": "Alex Kozora", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennessee_Titans", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tennessee Titans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyler_Boyd_(American_football)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tyler Boyd (American football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Steelers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh Steelers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offensive_coordinator", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Offensive coordinator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Chargers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Chargers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reception_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Reception (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Athletic", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Athletic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFL_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NFL playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DeAndre_Hopkins", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "DeAndre Hopkins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calvin_Ridley", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Calvin Ridley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennessee", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tennessee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tennessee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zay_Jones", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Zay Jones"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://steelersdepot.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/StockTylerBoyd2.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546992", "eventUri": "eng-9546992", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1529411764705881, "wgt": 210, "relevance": 1}

He was still very reliable, catching 74 percent of his targets, but averaged just 10.0 yards per catch, totaling 667 yards.

Boyd surpassed 1,000 yards in 2018 and 2019 but took over more of a third-option role as the Bengals added talents like Ja'Marr Chase and Tee Higgins.

The Titans signed Ridley to the biggest contract of any free agent receiver this offseason, signing him away from the rival Jacksonville Jaguars after a 1,000-yard season in his first campaign back from suspension. Hopkins was the only receiver on the Titans' roster last year who'd even had a 600-yard season in his career; now, between Boyd, Hopkins and Ridley the Titans have 21 such seasons, and 11 1,000-yard years.\n\nIn addition to the receiver talent, the Titans have also added running back Tony Pollard, center Lloyd Cushenberry III and guard Saahdiq Charles to their offense via free agency, as well as first-round pick JC Latham at left tackle. The Titans' losses on offense include running back Derrick Henry, quarterback Ryan Tannehill and offensive linemen Aaron Brewer and Andre Dillard, the latter of whom was cut.\n\nBoyd is the second former Bengals player to reunite with the Callahan on the Titans this offseason.

(AP) -- The Tennessee Titans have bolstered their wide receiving group by reuniting first-year coach Brian Callahan with someone he knows very well in Tyler Boyd, a person familiar with the deal told The Associated Press on Tuesday.\n\nTennessee agreed to a one-year deal worth up to $4.5 million Tuesday, the person told the AP on condition of anonymity because the agreement has not been announced.\n\nThe Titans declined to comment when asked about the agreement. Boyd tweeted \"Titan up\" on Tuesday afternoon.\n\nESPN.com first reported the deal.\n\nBoyd, 29, spent his first eight seasons in the NFL with Cincinnati, including the past five with Callahan as the Bengals' offensive coordinator. Boyd visited Tennessee last week only to leave without agreeing to a deal.\n\nThe 55th pick overall in the 2016 draft out of Pittsburgh, Boyd has started 77 of his 120 games played with 513 catches for 6,000 yards and 31 touchdowns. He had 67 catches for 667 yards and two TDs last season, which would have ranked Boyd second only to DeAndre Hopkins in Tennessee.\n\nThe Titans also signed Calvin Ridley in March to add competition to a receivers group where Treylon Burks, the 18th pick overall in 2022, has only one TD catch with his first two seasons plagued by injuries.\n\nTight end Chig Okonkwo ranked second for Tennessee with 54 receptions for 528 yards.\n\nAdding Boyd gives Callahan another option as he revamps an offense that ranked 29th in the NFL, averaging a mere 180.4 yards per game.\n\nAs for the Bengals, the team's receiving corps still features Ja'Marr Chase at No. 1, franchise-tagged Tee Higgins at No. 2 (though he has requested a trade). They added Alabama's Jermaine Burton in the NFL Draft, who is likely to see plenty of time on the field with Boyd gone. They also still have Trenton Irwin and Andrei Iosivas on the depth chart.\n\n___\n\nAP NFL coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/NFL\n\nMore Bengals news: Joe Burrow injury update: QB throws in workouts, not yet cleared for contact", "source": {"uri": "wcpo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WCPO"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennessee_Titans", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tennessee Titans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nashville,_Tennessee", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nashville, Tennessee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nashville, Tennessee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennessee", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tennessee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tennessee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reception_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Reception (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyler_Boyd_(American_football)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tyler Boyd (American football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DeAndre_Hopkins", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "DeAndre Hopkins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN.com", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ESPN.com"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offensive_coordinator", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Offensive coordinator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati_Bengals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati Bengals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calvin_Ridley", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Calvin Ridley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrei_Iosivas", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Andrei Iosivas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treylon_Burks", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Treylon Burks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ja'Marr_Chase", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ja'Marr Chase"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Burrow", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Burrow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tee_Higgins", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tee Higgins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFL_on_CBS", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NFL on CBS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alabama", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alabama"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Alabama"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://ewscripps.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/855000f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/640x336+0+72/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmediaassets.wcpo.com%2Fphoto%2F2018%2F10%2F04%2FGettyImages-1043739350_sized_1538686688613_99482028_ver1.0_640_480.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546992", "eventUri": "eng-9546992", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nashville, Tennessee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 199, "relevance": 1}

Boyd wrote \"Titan up\" on social media Tuesday afternoon.\n\nESPN.com first reported the deal.\n\nBoyd, 29, spent his first eight seasons in the NFL with Cincinnati, including the past five with Callahan as the Bengals' offensive coordinator. Boyd visited Tennessee last week only to leave without agreeing to a deal.\n\nThe 55th pick overall in the 2016 draft out of Pittsburgh, Boyd has started 77 of his 120 games played with 513 catches for 6,000 yards and 31 touchdowns.

The veteran has been with the Bengals since 2016, helping the offense transition from the Andy Dalton to the Joe Burrow era.\n\nNow, Boyd is a Tennessee Titan, as he signed a one-year deal Tuesday, via The 33rd Team's Ari Meirov. The move reunites him with head coach Brian Callahan, who served as the Bengals' offensive coordinator from 2019 to 2023.\n\nThe contract is worth up to $4.5 million, via ESPN's Jeremy Fowler.\n\nBoyd now joins a receiving core that includes Deandre Hopkins, Calvin Ridley, and 2022 first-round pick Treylon Burks. How will the Pitt alum fit into the puzzle?\n\nTyler Boyd should be able to do damage as a slot maven with the Titans\n\nBoyd has put together a solid NFL career, totaling 513 catches for exactly 6,000 yards and 31 touchdowns. He's averaged 750 yards a season, and he helped Cincinnati develop the likes of Tee Higgins and Jamar Chase. Boyd ranks sixth in franchise history in receiving yards, fourth in catches, and 31st in touchdowns. The 29-year-old also led the Bengals in total receptions from 2018 to 2020.\n\nNow, Boyd will compete to be the third receiver behind Hopkins and Ridley. His main competitors will be Burks and Nick Westbrook-Ikinhe, neither of whom has been as effective at the NFL level thus far. Burks has 665 yards and one touchdown after two seasons, while Westbrook-Ikinhe has totaled 1,276 yards and 10 scores across four years.\n\nThe latter two players have youth on their side, as they're aged 24 and 27, respectively. However, Boyd will have the upper hand based on skill and seniority.\n\nWith the departure of star running back Derrick Henry this offseason, the Titans may be inclined to transition to a more pass-heavy offense going forward. 24-year-old signal-caller Will Levis showed promising signs in his rookie campaign last year, and it could help his development to turn him loose completely.\n\nIn that case, Boyd would see plenty of targets come his way. The 2016 second-round pick could use a rebound after his subpar year last season, when he totaled 67 receptions for 667 yards and two touchdowns. The yardage and touchdown totals were both his lowest since 2017, and he only had one 100-yard game all season.\n\nWhile Tennessee did sign former Cowboys tailback Tony Pollard to replace Henry, it's hard to imagine the club running its offense through him in the same way. Pollard is a quality player, but Henry's been dominant, putting together 1,000-yard rushing seasons in nearly every year since 2018. The only exception was in 2021, when he totaled 937 yards on the ground due to getting hurt.\n\nIf Boyd can garner north of 100 targets, he should be able to get back to his regular form. He garnered triple-digit targets in his prime stretch from 2018-2020 but hasn't gotten back to that level of production since.

[affiliatewidget_smgtolocal]\n\nBoyd, the owner of 513 career receptions, will shore up Tennessee's slot position with a more reliable option than the Titans had on their roster.\n\nWhat grade does this move deserve? Let's break it down.\n\nI wrote about Boyd being a potential target for the Titans last week because the connection here was obvious. Boyd spent the previous five seasons playing under Titans head coach Brian Callahan and saw great success.\n\nOver those five years, Boyd racked up 4,144 yards and 21 touchdowns and proved to be a reliable security blanket for quarterbacks such as Andy Dalton and Joe Burrow.\n\nIn his most recent season of work, Boyd recorded 667 yards on 67 catches, adding two scores. He would've been the second-most productive receiver on the Titans last year after DeAndre Hopkins.\n\nBoyd projects to be the Titans' No. 3 receiver behind Calvin Ridley and the aforementioned Hopkins, and this move adds to the excellent job the Titans have done surrounding Will Levis with proven veteran talent this offseason.\n\nOverall, this was an excellent signing by Ran Carthon and Co. Tennessee had a need in the slot and addressed it. The $4.5 million dollar deal has serious bargain potential.\n\nGrade: A-\n\nTitans agree to terms with DL Marlon Davidson Titans 53-man roster projection post-NFL draft Tennessee Titans slated to be free agents in 2025 Titans, WR Tyler Boyd set for free-agent visit, per report 3 free agents Titans should sign post-draft", "source": {"uri": "titanswire.usatoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Titans Wire"}, "authors": [{"uri": "matthew_curry@titanswire.usatoday.com", "name": "Matthew Curry", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennessee_Titans", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tennessee Titans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennessee", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tennessee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tennessee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reception_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Reception (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyler_Boyd_(American_football)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tyler Boyd (American football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Burrow", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Burrow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Dalton", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Andy Dalton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lineman_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lineman (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Davidson_College", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Davidson College"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DeAndre_Hopkins", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "DeAndre Hopkins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calvin_Ridley", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Calvin Ridley"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Folklore/Products_and_Services", "label": "dmoz/Society/Folklore/Products and Services", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Youth", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Youth", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://titanswire.usatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2024/05/USATSI_22117211.jpg?w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546992", "eventUri": "eng-9546992", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1607843137254903, "wgt": 194, "relevance": 1}

They doubled down on the pass-catching makeover Tuesday, signing former Cincinnati Bengals veteran Tyler Boyd to a one-year contract, as ESPN reported.\n\nBoyd's deal is worth up to $4.5 million, per ESPN, and comes a week after the longtime wideout visited Tennessee. It also comes just a day after the Titans reportedly hosted fellow free agent receiver Zay Jones, who was recently released by Jacksonville. Boyd had also repeatedly been linked to the Pittsburgh Steelers.\n\nThe 29-year-old Pittsburgh product spent the last eight seasons with the Bengals, entering the NFL as a second-round draft pick in 2016. He's topped 600 receiving yards in all but one of his pro campaigns, eclipsing 1,000 yards in back-to-back seasons from 2018-2019. Long heralded for his reliability out of the slot, Boyd became a free agent in March, with Cincinnati using the franchise tag to retain fellow wideout Tee Higgins.\n\nReunited with former Bengals offensive coordinator Brian Callahan, who was hired as Titans head coach this offseason, Boyd will likely compete for the No. 3 receiving job behind Ridley and former Pro Bowler DeAndre Hopkins, who led Tennessee with 1,057 yards in 2023, his first year with the club.

He was a second-round pick for the team out of Pittsburgh in 2016. In his professional career, Boyd has had two 1,000+ receiving-yard seasons. Over the last five years, Cincinnati added younger talent to their WR room with Ja'Marr Chase and Tee Higgins. That left Boyd playing a WR3 role.\n\nThe 29-year-old is a free agent this offseason and news broke today about where he'll be playing in 2024. After eight years, Boyd is parting ways with the Bengals and is joining the Tennesee Titans. Boyd reunites with head coach Bill Callahan who was previously an assistant in Cincinnati. It's a one-year deal for Boyd and he'll be joining a talented WR room once again.\n\nTennessee's offense is going to look drastically different in 2024. This offseason, they lost All-Pro RB Derrick Henry to the Baltimore Ravens. Now, Tony Pollard and Tajee Spears are the top RBs on their roster. While the RB room has taken a hit, there have been some upgrades at WR. The Titans' newest addition is veteran WR Tyler Boyd. He's heading south to play in Tennesee after eight seasons with the Cincinnati Bengals. For his career, Boyd has 513 receptions for 6,000 yards, and 31 receiving touchdowns. His most productive season was in 2018 with 76 receptions for 1,028 yards, and a career-high seven receiving touchdowns.\n\nIn 2024, Tyler Boyd's quality of QB production will take a step back. For his last four seasons in Cincinnati, Boyd played with Pro Bowl QB Joe Burrow. With the Titans, his QB will be Will Levis. As a rookie in 2023, Levis played and started nine games for the Tiatns, going 3-6in those starts. Another WR joining Tennesse's offense this offseason is Calvin Ridley. He's coming off a season where he had 76 catches, 1,016 receiving yards, and eight receiving touchdowns. It was just the second time in Ridley's career that he played in every regular season game.\n\nAlong with Boyd and Ridley, the Titans also had a veteran All-Pro WR in DeAndre Hopkins. The 31-year-old had his first 1,000+ yard receiving season since 2020. Ridley and Hopkins are two players who are going to want to see the ball a lot. Where does Tyler Boyd fit into the equation? Boyd is still a quality receiver who's played WR3 over the last few seasons. That might be his role again in Tennessee with Ridley and Hopkins as legitimate WR threats.", "source": {"uri": "sportslens.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportslens.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "zach_wolpin@sportslens.com", "name": "Zach Wolpin", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati_Bengals", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati Bengals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyler_Boyd_(American_football)", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tyler Boyd (American football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennessee_Titans", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tennessee Titans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ja'Marr_Chase", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ja'Marr Chase"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tee_Higgins", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tee Higgins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reception_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Reception (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Pollard_(American_football)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tony Pollard (American football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore_Ravens", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Baltimore Ravens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derrick_Henry", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Derrick Henry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-Pro", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "All-Pro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennessee", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tennessee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tennessee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Burrow", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Burrow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DeAndre_Hopkins", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "DeAndre Hopkins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennessee_Volunteers_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tennessee Volunteers football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pro Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calvin_Ridley", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Calvin Ridley"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://sportslens.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Tyler-Boyd-Bengals-pic.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546992", "eventUri": "eng-9546992", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1529411764705881, "wgt": 190, "relevance": 1}

Boyd's familiarity with head coach Brian Callahan's scheme makes him an ideal slot receiver for Will Levis. The Titans have heavily upgraded their offense around Levis, giving them a chance to compete right away if he plays well.\n\nThe Tennessee Titans are implementing a new offense this offseason, and have brought in someone they can count on being in the right place at the right time for quarterback Will Levis.\n\nOn Tuesday afternoon, ESPN's Jeremy Fowler reported the Titans have inked wide receiver Tyler Boyd to a one-year deal worth up to $4.5 million. The signing reunites the former Cincinnati Bengals weapon with Tennessee head coach Brian Callahan, who served as Boyd's offensive coordinator from 2019-23 before taking his new post in Nashville.\n\nBoyd, a second-round pick (No. 55 overall) in 2016, spent eight seasons in Cincinnati before entering free agency for the first time this year. He eclipsed 1,000 yards in the final two years of his rookie contract (2018 & 2019) as the Bengals' de facto No. 1 receiver in place of a hobbled A.J. Green, but settled in as their No. 3 wideout behind Ja'Marr Chase and Tee Higgins after the former was selected in 2021.\n\nRelated How the Tennessee Titans Turned Their CB Room Around This Offseason The Titans were a middle-of-the-pack team against the pass last year, but that could change with L'Jarius Sneed and Chidobe Awuzie in the fold. Boyd Is Reliable and Consistent He's the perfect slot option for Will Levis\n\nBoyd's production the past three seasons hasn't blown anyone away, and likely won't in 2024 either. However, he is the perfect complimentary slot option to the newly-signed Calvin Ridley and regularly-rumored trade candidate DeAndre Hopkins.\n\nBoth of those men, like Chase and Higgins in Cincinnati, thrive on the outside. Their presence and immense big-play ability will create space in the short-to-intermediate areas for Boyd, who played the second-most slot snaps in the league last year, to operate.\n\nTitans' New Receiving Corps - 2023 Usage\n\nReceiver (2023 Team)\n\nTargets\n\nADOT\n\nYards Per Reception\n\nDeAndre Hopkins (TEN)\n\n137\n\n14.1\n\n14.1\n\nCalvin Ridley (JAX)\n\n136\n\n13.2\n\n13.4\n\nTyler Boyd (CIN)\n\n98\n\n6.5\n\n10.0\n\nBoyd's average depth of target, yards per reception, and drop percentage (5.1%) were all career-worsts in 2023, but factors outside his control -- Joe Burrow's atypical play due to injuries and Jake Browning's eventual insertion as starter, most notably -- likely contributed to those numbers in some fashion.\n\nThe exact degree to which they did is anyone's guess, but Callahan would presumably have the best idea.\n\nGIVEMESPORT Key Stat : Before Ja'Marr Chase's arrival in Cincinnati, Pro Football Focus graded Tyler Boyd as a top-40 receiver (12th, 40th, 35th) for three consecutive years (2018-20). He slipped slightly the next two seasons beside Chase, ranking 48th in 2021 and 42nd in 2022. However, his overall grade never dipped below 70. In 2023, Boyd was PFF's 91st-ranked receiver (59.5 overall grade).\n\nTennessee has, on paper, upgraded second-year quarterback Will Levis' supporting cast in a big way. In two months, the Titans replaced their No. 2 and No. 3 receivers, as well as the left tackle and center from PFF's lowest-rated offensive line, giving OL guru Bill Callahan a great crop of talent to work with throughout the offseason.\n\nChanging The Guard: Tennessee's New Starters\n\nPosition\n\n2023 Starter\n\nProjected 2024 Starter\n\nWR\n\nNick Westbrook-Ikhine\n\nCalvin Ridley\n\nWR\n\nTreylon Burks\n\nTyler Boyd\n\nLT\n\nAndre Dillard\n\nJC Latham\n\nC\n\nAaron Brewer\n\nLloyd Cushenberry III\n\nThe new foundation should give Levis much safer ground to stand on as he tries to prove he's the team's franchise quarterback next season.

The former Cincinnati Bengals player gives the Titans a bona fide third option in their receiver room alongside DeAndre Hopkins and Calvin Ridley, as well as a player who has proven he's comfortable running routes from the slot, an area the Titans were severely lacking in experience.\n\nBoyd's signing doesn't magically transform the offense into a top-five unit. Rather, it's another incremental step forward for an offense that barely had any starting-caliber skill players three months ago. It's an investment in quarterback Will Levis' immediate development over the team's future stability; Boyd and Hopkins are on one-year deals for 2024, so the Titans might have to reinvent in 2025.\n\nBut if the goal is to surround Levis with consistent, steadying presences who make it easier for him to live up to his potential, Boyd is about as textbook of a fit for that criteria as possible.\n\nTHE BIG MAN: Is T'Vondre Sweat too heavy? 3 of biggest D-linemen in NFL history discuss Titans 2nd-rounder\n\nHere are three more takeaways from the Boyd signing.\n\nTyler Boyd, DeAndre Hopkins and Calvin Ridley: Does age matter?\n\nBoyd turns 30 in November. Ridley turns 30 in December. Hopkins will be 32 in June. There were only 13 receivers age 29 or older who amassed 600-plus receiving yards last season -- now the Titans have three of them.\n\nIf the plan is to thrive in the short term, age shouldn't really matter. Production isn't an issue when the Titans' new big three caught 218 passes last season. Health isn't much of a concern, either; Ridley, Hopkins and Boyd have been put on injured reserve a combined three times in 24 pro seasons. And the age cliff for receivers comes markedly later than running backs. There were twice as many 30-year-old receivers with 1,000 yards last season as there were 30-year-old running backs with even 100 yards.\n\nThe moral of the story: There aren't that many older receivers built to thrive. The fact that the Titans have three of them isn't a great sign for sustained success, but these players' individual track records are enough to say with confidence that they're all capable of producing in 2024 at least.\n\nWhere do Titans receivers rank among NFL's best trios?\n\nIn ESPN analyst Mike Clay's statistical forecast for the 2024 season, there are only eight teams that have three receivers projected to put up more yards than Boyd had (667) in 2023. Four of those eight teams include a rookie in their big three, making them less safe projections.\n\nRidley, Hopkins and Boyd combined for 2,740 yards last season. Clay projects only five teams to have three receivers combine for that level of production: Houston, Miami, the Los Angeles Rams, Cincinnati and Seattle.\n\nTHE 99th PERCENTER: Numbers don't lie: Titans first-round pick JC Latham is unlike anyone football has seen\n\nThere's an obvious connection between receiver production and quarterback success, so Levis is going to have to prove he can play at an above-average level for the trio to justify the hype. But based on these projections and the track records of the three receivers, there's no reason the Titans can't have a top-10 trio, bordering on top five.\n\nWhat does this mean for Treylon Burks?\n\nShort answer: It's not a great sign. Burks' first two pro seasons have been derailed by injuries, and he hasn't been particularly productive when he has been on the field. New Titans coach Brian Callahan raved during a radio interview after the NFL draft about how impressed he has been with Burks. But adding Boyd certainly puts a dent in Burks' share of reps.\n\nBurks has two more years plus a fifth-year option on his rookie contract. With Boyd and Hopkins on short-term deals, there's value in keeping Burks around and trying to develop him. Maybe taking the pressure of having to be a No. 1 or No. 2 receiver off Burks allows him to flash his first-round potential. Maybe some improved injury luck allows him to emerge organically.\n\nBut the realistic conclusion is the Titans signed Boyd because they believed they needed immediate, proven consistency from their No. 3 receiver. Burks isn't that. He'll have an uphill climb to earn reps in base, three-receiver sets and factor into the Titans' offensive plans in any meaningful way.\n\nIMMEDIATE DIFFERENCE MAKERS: Ranking Tennessee Titans rookies who can make immediate difference after 2024 NFL Draft", "source": {"uri": "tennessean.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Tennessean"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_Levis", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Will Levis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyler_Boyd_(American_football)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tyler Boyd (American football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennessee_Titans", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tennessee Titans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DeAndre_Hopkins", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "DeAndre Hopkins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calvin_Ridley", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Calvin Ridley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treylon_Burks", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Treylon Burks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tennessean", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Tennessean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati_Bengals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati Bengals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Rams", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Rams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Signage", "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Signage", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Cash_Flow", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Cash Flow", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Roads_and_Highways/Signs_and_Signals", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Roads and Highways/Signs and Signals", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Senior_Health/Sexuality", "label": "dmoz/Health/Senior Health/Sexuality", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Tile_Games/Spectrangle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Tile Games/Spectrangle", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/authoring/authoring-images/2023/10/01/PNAS/71027056007-titans-cin-100123-an-048.jpg?auto=webp&crop=4499,2531,x0,y234&format=pjpg&width=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546992", "eventUri": "eng-9546992", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 182, "relevance": 1}

Many of their moves have been to potentially make life easier for their young quarterback, Will Levis, who had a less-than-stellar rookie campaign. The Titans have been bringing in plenty of veterans who will hopefully help in Levis' development. The most recent addition is Tyler Boyd. Boyd's deal is reportedly worth $4.5 million. The veteran wideout will be reunited with Brian Callahan, the Titans new head coach. It should also be noted that Callahan was Cincinnati's offensive coordinator for several years. Boyd, who had been with the Bengals since 2016, will bring veteran leadership to a wide receiver room that has undergone a makeover this offseason.\n\nBoyd is a veteran wideout who can be a dependable third option on almost any offense. He was with the Bengals during the A.J. Green and Andy Dalton era and even helped usher in the current era with Joe Burrow, Ja'Marr Chase, and Tee Higgins. Throughout his career, Boyd has logged 513 receptions for 6,000 receiving yards, 11.7 receiving yards per reception, 4.3 receptions per game, 50.0 receiving yards per game, and 31 career touchdowns.\n\nHis best year came during the 2019 campaign where he recorded 90 catches for 1,046 yards, five touchdowns, 11.6 receiving yards per reception, and 5.6 receptions per game. Boyd's numbers have steadily decreased ever since then, but much of that could be attributed to the emergence of Tee Higgins and Ja'Marr Chase. Considering all of this, the Tennessee Titans are getting a savvy and reliable wide receiver to bolster their already talented receiver room.\n\nTennessee's Talented Receiver Room\n\nThe Titans have one of the best receiver rooms on paper after this offseason. They still have Deandre Hopkins who is getting older, but still showed flashes of his greatness last year. Not to mention, they signed Calvin Ridley. A player who proved he still has some gas left in the tank after a year with the Jacksonville Jaguars. Now, Tyler Boyd will add even more veteran savviness to the locker room and could possibly give Will Levis another security blanket.\n\nThis trio of receivers is certainly not the youngest. However, they are also some of the better receivers the Titans have had in years. It will be hard to gauge whether they truly assist in Levis' development considering they are pass-catchers. Tennessee also has slot specialist, Treylon Burks. With all of this in mind, it is safe to say the Titans have had an underappreciated offseason.", "source": {"uri": "thesportsdaily.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Sports Daily"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mathew_huff@thesportsdaily.com", "name": "Mathew Huff", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyler_Boyd_(American_football)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tyler Boyd (American football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennessee_Titans", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tennessee Titans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati_Bengals", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati Bengals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_Levis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Will Levis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ja'Marr_Chase", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ja'Marr Chase"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tee_Higgins", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tee Higgins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offensive_coordinator", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Offensive coordinator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Burrow", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Burrow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Dalton", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Andy Dalton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A._J._Green", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "A.

Boyd originally visited with the Titans last week, so it looks like the team wanted to meet with Jones before making a decision.\n\nBoyd comes to Nashville after eight seasons with the Cincinnati Bengals. Since 2017, Boyd has had at least 55 catches and 660 yards in each season. Boyd eclipsed the 1000-yard mark in both 2017 and 2018. The former Bengal is not a burner, but he's a reliable route-runner with sure hands.\n\nThe Titans made their first notable addition to the WR room by signing Calvin Ridley shortly after the beginning of free agency. Boyd and Ridley join DeAndre Hopkins, Nick Westbrook-Ikhine, and Treylon Burks, among others, in a revamped receiver room.\n\nWith these new additions, let's take a look at the current Titans wide receiver depth chart.\n\nThis group is much improved over the 2023 iteration. In fact, this could be the most talented wide receiver group the Titans have ever fielded.\n\nHopkins and Ridley are a perfect complement to one another. Hopkins is one of the best contested-catch receivers in the league and Ridley is a burner who can be a weapon on deep balls. Boyd adds another distinct element as a possession receiver who is a savvy route-runner.\n\nBehind that top three, the Titans have to be hoping for former first-round pick Treylon Burks to finally play up to his draft pedigree. The addition of Boyd could be seen as insurance in case Burks continues to struggle. I believe Burks will get one season with the new staff before any decisions are made about his future.\n\nNick Westbrook-Ikhine was brought back this offseason and should make the team as a reliable depth option. The team also rosters several speedy receivers who will battle for the return job in Mason Kinsey, Kearis Jackson, and 2024 draft pick, Jha'Quan Jackson.\n\nUltimately, I believed the final depth chart will look something like this:\n\nI have the rookie Jackson making the team for now, but a sixth-round pick is not guaranteed a spot. Kearis Jackson impressed before getting injured in 2023, so either he or Philips could realistically win the final roster spot over the Tulane product.\n\nThis is a much more competitive group than it was a year ago. It will be fascinating to watch these guys battle for spots this summer.", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennessee_Titans", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tennessee Titans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treylon_Burks", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Treylon Burks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyler_Boyd_(American_football)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tyler Boyd (American football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nashville,_Tennessee", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nashville, Tennessee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nashville, Tennessee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati_Bengals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati Bengals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zay_Jones", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Zay Jones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Westbrook-Ikhine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nick Westbrook-Ikhine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DeAndre_Hopkins", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "DeAndre Hopkins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calvin_Ridley", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Calvin Ridley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kearis_Jackson", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kearis Jackson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulane_Green_Wave_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tulane Green Wave football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mason,_Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mason, Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mason, Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackson,_Mississippi", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jackson, Mississippi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jackson, Mississippi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Free_Services", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Free Services", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/Fp5XpXeAVWto6gnWsc0jUQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/tennessee_titans_wire_usa_today_sports_articles_954/0bb7bc119ef3b052e3378a2e912f3c18", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546992", "eventUri": "eng-9546992", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2, "wgt": 172, "relevance": 1}

The Titans signed former Cincinnati Bengals wide receiver Tyler Boyd to a one-year deal worth up to $4.5 million. Moreover, Miami Dolphins receiver Tyreek Hill took notice of the signing and posted a hyped social media reaction.\n\nThe Dolphins star took to X to react to the Titans' depth-bolstering move:\n\n\"Titans WR core nasty oooo,\" Hill posted alongside a smiling-faced tear emoji.\n\nTyreek Hill would know an impressive receiving core, considering he leads one himself. The Dolphins star is coming off his fourth All-Pro-worthy season in 2023-24. Tyler Boyd has not reached such heights yet, but his presence should help take Tennesee to the next level.\n\nBoyd started his career with the Bengals in 2016 after the team selected him with the 55th pick in the second round of the draft. He showed great promise during his rookie year, totaling 603 yards and one touchdown in 16 games. Boyd's production dropped the following season after he played just 10 games, but he made a giant leap during the 2018-19 season.\n\nThe former Pittsburgh Panther amassed 1,046 yards and a career-high seven TDs in 14 games. Boyd continued his momentum into 2019-20 with a career-best 1046 yards along with five TDs. He was a reliable offensive presence for the Bengals for the next few seasons. Most notably, Boyd garnered 828 yards and five TDs in 2021-22, the same season Cincy was the Super Bowl 56 runner-up.\n\nBoyd comes off a 2023-24 season of 667 yards and two TDs. His experience playing alongside Joe Burrow will be a great asset as he looks to develop relationships with Will Levis and Ryan Tannehill.\n\nCincinnati's move for Tyler Boyd reunites him with head coach Brian Callahan, who served as the Bengals' offensive coordinator from 2019 to 2023. Furthermore, Boyd will join the talented receiving core Tyreek Hill alluded to.\n\nBengals get massive offensive boost for 2024-25\n\nCincinnati's receiving core includes Deandre Hopkins, Calvin Ridley, and 2022 first-round pick Treylon Burks. Hopkins comes off a stout bounce-back year after only playing nine games with the Arizona Cardinals in 2022-23. The Pro Bowler hauled in 1,057 yards and seven TDs in 2023-24.\n\nMeanwhile, Calvin Ridley had nearly identical production with the Jacksonville Jaguars. He garnered 1,016 yards and seven TDs and played all 17 regular season games.\n\nTreylon Burks has not experienced the jump some Titans fans hoped for, but he has a great foundation to build on. Burks totaled 444 yards and a TD during his rookie year. He comes off a season of 221 yards and one TD.\n\nThe Titans' talented receiving core looks to help the team make a jump in 2024-25. Tennesee is coming off a 6-11 season that placed them last in the AFC South. The team took a notable free agency hit with the departure of star running back Derek Henry.\n\nHenry signed with the Baltimore Ravens after a historical eight-year tenure with the Titans.

Boyd wrote \"Titan up\" on social media Tuesday afternoon.\n\nESPN.com first reported the deal.\n\nBoyd, 29, spent his first eight seasons in the NFL with Cincinnati, including the past five with Callahan as the Bengals' offensive coordinator. Boyd visited Tennessee last week only to leave without agreeing to a deal.\n\nThe 55th pick overall in the 2016 draft out of Pittsburgh, Boyd has started 77 of his 120 games played with 513 catches for 6,000 yards and 31 touchdowns. He had 67 catches for 667 yards and two TDs last season, which would have ranked Boyd second only to DeAndre Hopkins in Tennessee.\n\nTags Dcc Wire Lee-national Be the first to know\n\nGet local news

Boyd inked a new one-year deal with Tennessee for just $4.5 million. While the price was right to sign an experienced veteran receiver, his fit with Pittsburgh would not have been.\n\nThere's no question that the Steelers need to add another wide receiver. Even if Roman Wilson plays a big role as a rookie in 2024, that only gives Pittsburgh one receiver not named George Pickens they can count on.\n\nSo why not Tyler Boyd?\n\nI don't doubt that Boyd is better than most of the receiving options on the Steelers roster, but a move for Boyd wouldn't have made much sense before the NFL Draft, and it would have made even less sense afterward.\n\nTyler Boyd isn't the type of WR the Steelers need\n\nBoyd is a slot receiver by trade. Last year, the veteran logged 672 snaps from the slot and just 151 out wide. Pittsburgh already has a trio of slot receivers in Roman Wilson, Calvin Austin III, and Quez Watkins. Because of the redundancy that already exists at the position, neither Watkins nor Austin is guaranteed to make the 53-man roster.\n\nAdditionally, veteran Van Jefferson has inside-out versatility. He played 226 snaps from the slot in 2023 and 394 outside. Jefferson is coming off a down season, but he does much of his damage while manning slot duties.\n\nMeanwhile, Boyd has been primarily a slot receiver his whole career, and that's not about to change as he enters Year 9 in the NFL.\n\nAnother reason it didn't make sense for the Steelers to sign a player like Tyler Boyd is because of the lack of explosive plays. Entering the NFL in 2016, Boyd ran a 4.58 40-yard dash at the NFL Combine, and there's no question he has lost a step or two since then.\n\nIf the Steelers are to add a receiver, it needs to be a player who would be a notable upgrade on the outside next to George Pickens. Pittsburgh can only play so many slot WRs at one time, and Boyd averaged an unspectacular 6.8 yards per target and 10.0 yards per reception last season. Even his career average of 11.7 yards per reception is nothing to write home about.\n\nI know that local Steelers fans have a soft spot for Tyler Boyd because he played his college ball at Pitt, but that was ages ago. Boyd turns 30 years old during the 2024 season and doesn't offer enough on the boundary as an explosive playmaker for Pittsburgh to have made a move for him in free agency. Omar Khan did the right thing by passing on Boyd.", "source": {"uri": "stillcurtain.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Still Curtain"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tommy_jaggi@stillcurtain.com", "name": "Tommy Jaggi", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyler_Boyd_(American_football)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tyler Boyd (American football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Pickens", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "George Pickens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennessee_Titans", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tennessee Titans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Steelers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh Steelers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati_Bengals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati Bengals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennessee", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tennessee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tennessee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calvin_Austin", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Calvin Austin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_Jefferson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Van Jefferson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Jefferson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Thomas Jefferson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austin,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Austin, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Austin, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Panthers_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh Panthers football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFL_Scouting_Combine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NFL Scouting Combine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "College football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/40-yard_dash", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "40-yard dash"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Signage", "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Signage", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Online_Writing/Drama", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Online Writing/Drama", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Theme_Merchandise", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Theme Merchandise", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Collecting/Slot_Machines", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Collecting/Slot Machines", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Slots", "label": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Slots", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_5513,h_3101,x_0,y_0/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/GettyImages/mmsport/58/01hxc5tene1atnpw0y9d.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546992", "eventUri": "eng-9546992", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 164, "relevance": 1}

Boyd originally visited with the Titans last week, so it looks like the team wanted to meet with Jones before making a decision.\n\nBoyd comes to Nashville after eight seasons with the Cincinnati Bengals. Since 2017, Boyd has had at least 55 catches and 660 yards in each season. Boyd eclipsed the 1000-yard mark in both 2017 and 2018. The former Bengal is not a burner, but he's a reliable route-runner with sure hands. [affiliatewidget_smgtolocal]\n\nThe Titans made their first notable addition to the WR room by signing Calvin Ridley shortly after the beginning of free agency. Boyd and Ridley join DeAndre Hopkins, Nick Westbrook-Ikhine, and Treylon Burks, among others, in a revamped receiver room.\n\nWith these new additions, let's take a look at the current Titans wide receiver depth chart.\n\nPosition Starter Backup Backup Backup WR1 DeAndre Hopkins Treylon Burks Colton Dowell Tre'Shaun Harrison WR2 Calvin Ridley Nick Westbrook-Ikhine Kearis Jackson Mason Kinsey WR3 Tyler Boyd Kyle Philips Jha'Quan Jackson\n\nThis group is much improved over the 2023 iteration. In fact, this could be the most talented wide receiver group the Titans have ever fielded.\n\nHopkins and Ridley are a perfect complement to one another. Hopkins is one of the best contested-catch receivers in the league and Ridley is a burner who can be a weapon on deep balls. Boyd adds another distinct element as a possession receiver who is a savvy route-runner.\n\nBehind that top three, the Titans have to be hoping for former first-round pick Treylon Burks to finally play up to his draft pedigree. The addition of Boyd could be seen as insurance in case Burks continues to struggle. I believe Burks will get one season with the new staff before any decisions are made about his future.\n\nNick Westbrook-Ikhine was brought back this offseason and should make the team as a reliable depth option. The team also rosters several speedy receivers who will battle for the return job in Mason Kinsey, Kearis Jackson, and 2024 draft pick, Jha'Quan Jackson.\n\nUltimately, I believed the final depth chart will look something like this:\n\nPosition Starter Backup WR1 DeAndre Hopkins Treylon Burks WR2 Calvin Ridley Nick Westbrook-Ikhine WR3 Tyler Boyd Jha'Quan Jackson\n\nI have the rookie Jackson making the team for now, but a sixth-round pick is not guaranteed a spot. Kearis Jackson impressed before getting injured in 2023, so either he or Philips could realistically win the final roster spot over the Tulane product.\n\nThis is a much more competitive group than it was a year ago. It will be fascinating to watch these guys battle for spots this summer.\n\nTitans DL T'Vondre Sweat 'wasn't falling' past second round Titans draft pick Jaylen Harrell: What scouting reports say Titans 53-man roster projection post-NFL draft Ranking Titans draft picks based on potential impact 2 Titans selections crack top-100 draft picks list", "source": {"uri": "titanswire.usatoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Titans Wire"}, "authors": [{"uri": "bryce_lazenby@titanswire.usatoday.com", "name": "Bryce Lazenby", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennessee_Titans", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tennessee Titans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Westbrook-Ikhine", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Nick Westbrook-Ikhine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treylon_Burks", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Treylon Burks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyler_Boyd_(American_football)", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tyler Boyd (American football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DeAndre_Hopkins", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "DeAndre Hopkins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calvin_Ridley", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Calvin Ridley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kearis_Jackson", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kearis Jackson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reception_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Reception (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nashville,_Tennessee", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nashville, Tennessee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nashville, Tennessee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati_Bengals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati Bengals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackson,_Mississippi", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jackson, Mississippi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jackson, Mississippi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zay_Jones", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Zay Jones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mason,_Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mason, Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mason, Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lineman_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lineman (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulane_Green_Wave_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tulane Green Wave football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Theme_Merchandise", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Theme Merchandise", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://titanswire.usatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2024/05/USATSI_22117227.jpg?w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546992", "eventUri": "eng-9546992", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2, "wgt": 155, "relevance": 1}

So this isn't necessarily the Titans' long-term look. But if Tennessee can figure out protection for Levis, it should have a recipe to return to competitiveness and gain a lot of information on the viability of Levis as a franchise quarterback.\n\nBoyd had 67 catches for 667 yards and two touchdowns last season. The 2016 second-round pick out of the University of Pittsburgh had 513 grabs for 6,000 yards and 31 scores in eight seasons in Cincinnati, including 1,000-yard seasons in 2018 and 2019. He played all but three regular-season games in the past five seasons, combining with Ja'Marr Chase and Tee Higgins for the past three seasons to form one of the most productive and feared receiving trios in the league.\n\nHis arrival continues general manager Ran Carthon's quest to improve the Titans at the position, after predecessor Jon Robinson traded away star wideout A.J. Brown during the 2022 draft, getting the No. 18 pick in return. Brown has flourished with the Philadelphia Eagles, while Robinson's drafted replacement for him, Treylon Burks, has struggled to make an impact in two seasons.\n\nThis pushes Burks down the depth chart, though the Titans hope he can find health and a spark in his third season and entrench himself as a piece of this offense's future. He has 49 catches for 665 yards and one touchdown in two seasons, missing 12 of the 34 games due to injury.\n\nThe Boyd signing may be more of a commentary on another receiver taken in that 2022 draft, fifth-round pick Kyle Philips. Philips also has endured multiple injuries and has 23 catches for 259 yards in 13 games in two NFL seasons. He fell out of favor as a returner in each of the past two seasons after muffing punts, and his ability as a returner was a key part of the Titans selecting him. Carthon took Tulane receiver Jha'Quan Jackson -- a slot receiver and returner -- in the sixth round of the NFL Draft last month.\n\nThe Titans will again have the services of reliable, play-anywhere receiver Nick Westbrook-Ikhine, who has 94 catches for 1,276 yards and 10 touchdowns since signing with the Titans as an undrafted free agent out of Indiana in 2020.", "source": {"uri": "theathletic.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Athletic"}, "authors": [{"uri": "joe_rexrode@theathletic.com", "name": "Joe Rexrode", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennessee_Titans", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tennessee Titans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Pittsburgh", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "University of Pittsburgh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offensive_coordinator", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Offensive coordinator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennessee", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tennessee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tennessee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_Bears_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brown Bears football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treylon_Burks", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Treylon Burks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ja'Marr_Chase", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ja'Marr Chase"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A._J._Brown", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "A.

He hopes to be fully ready to go by training camp.\n\n\"I felt good the last couple of days,\" the 27-year-old Burrow said. \"I don't ever know how it's going to feel until I wake up the next morning, but I was encouraged by the last couple of days for sure.\"\n\nBurrow was lost for the season when he suffered a torn ligament in his right wrist in the 10th game, a loss to Baltimore on Nov. 16 that dropped the Bengals' record to 5-5. He had surgery on his wrist Nov. 27.\n\nBackup Jake Browning led Cincinnati to a 4-3 record the rest of the way and the team missed the playoffs for the first time in three seasons. The Bengals finished 9-8, last in the AFC North.\n\nPeople are also reading...

I'm happy with where I'm at, and I'm going to continue to get better.\"\n\nBurrow knows the drill when it comes to rehab. In his rookie year in 2020, he tore up his knee while being sacked in Week 11 against Washington. He finished rehab just in time for the start of the 2021 season.\n\nAppendicitis caused him to miss all of training camp in 2022. On the second day of camp in 2023, Burrow strained a calf muscle. He didn't miss any games, but the injury limited his mobility in the early part of the season.\n\nAP source: Titans sign Boyd\n\nNASHVILLE, Tenn. -- The Tennessee Titans have bolstered their wide receiving group by reuniting first-year coach Brian Callahan with someone he knows very well in Tyler Boyd, a person familiar with the deal told The Associated Press on Tuesday.\n\nTennessee agreed to a one-year deal worth up to $4.5 million Tuesday, the person told the AP on condition of anonymity because the agreement has not been announced.\n\nThe Titans declined to comment when asked about the agreement. Boyd wrote \"Titan up\" on social media Tuesday afternoon.\n\nESPN.com first reported the deal.\n\nBoyd, 29, spent his first eight seasons in the NFL with Cincinnati, including the past five with Callahan as the Bengals' offensive coordinator. Boyd visited Tennessee last week only to leave without agreeing to a deal.\n\nThe 55th pick overall in the 2016 draft out of Pittsburgh, Boyd has started 77 of his 120 games played with 513 catches for 6,000 yards and 31 touchdowns. He had 67 catches for 667 yards and two TDs last season, which would have ranked Boyd second only to DeAndre Hopkins in Tennessee.\n\nTags Dcc Wire Lee-national Be the first to know\n\nGet local news

He hopes to be fully ready to go by training camp.\n\n\"I felt good the last couple of days,\" the 27-year-old Burrow said. \"I don't ever know how it's going to feel until I wake up the next morning, but I was encouraged by the last couple of days for sure.\"\n\nBurrow was lost for the season when he suffered a torn ligament in his right wrist in the 10th game, a loss to Baltimore on Nov. 16 that dropped the Bengals' record to 5-5. He had surgery on his wrist Nov. 27.\n\nBackup Jake Browning led Cincinnati to a 4-3 record the rest of the way and the team missed the playoffs for the first time in three seasons. The Bengals finished 9-8, last in the AFC North.\n\nPeople are also reading...

WJBC mourns loss of former radio host Scott Laughlin\n\nBurrow said uncertainty has been the most difficult part of rehab.\n\n\"Whenever you have an injury to your throwing side, you're never quite sure how it's going to turn out at the end,\" he said.\n\n\"But I'm in a good spot. I'm happy with where I'm at, and I'm going to continue to get better.\"\n\nBurrow knows the drill when it comes to rehab. In his rookie year in 2020, he tore up his knee while being sacked in Week 11 against Washington. He finished rehab just in time for the start of the 2021 season.\n\nAppendicitis caused him to miss all of training camp in 2022. On the second day of camp in 2023, Burrow strained a calf muscle. He didn't miss any games, but the injury limited his mobility in the early part of the season.\n\nAP source: Titans sign Boyd\n\nNASHVILLE, Tenn. -- The Tennessee Titans have bolstered their wide receiving group by reuniting first-year coach Brian Callahan with someone he knows very well in Tyler Boyd, a person familiar with the deal told The Associated Press on Tuesday.\n\nTennessee agreed to a oneyear deal worth up to $4.5 million Tuesday, the person told the AP on condition of anonymity because the agreement has not been announced.\n\nThe Titans declined to comment when asked about the agreement. Boyd wrote \"Titan up\" on social media Tuesday afternoon.\n\nESPN.com first reported the deal.\n\nBoyd, 29, spent his first eight seasons in the NFL with Cincinnati, including the past five with Callahan as the Bengals' offensive coordinator. Boyd visited Tennessee last week only to leave without agreeing to a deal.\n\nThe 55th pick overall in the 2016 draft out of Pittsburgh, Boyd has started 77 of his 120 games played with 513 catches for 6,000 yards and 31 touchdowns. He had 67 catches for 667 yards and two TDs last season, which would have ranked Boyd second only to DeAndre Hopkins in Tennessee.\n\nReports say Chiefs' Rice suspected of assault\n\nDALLAS -- Kansas City Chiefs receiver Rashee Rice is suspected of assault in Dallas a little over a month after he was one of the speeding drivers in a chain-reaction crash that led to multiple charges, according to a newspaper report Tuesday.\n\nLaw enforcement officials told The Dallas Morning News that Rice was suspected of assaulting a person at a downtown nightclub early Monday, and that the person went to a hospital after the encounter.\n\nDallas police did not name Rice as the suspect in detailing a report of the incident to The Associated Press. Officers were dispatched to the nightclub about 2:30 a.m. Monday over a report of an assault, and the victim self-transported to a hospital with non-life-threatening injuries, police said.\n\nRice's attorney, Texas state Sen. Royce West, didn't respond to a message from The Associated Press seeking comment. The Chiefs and the NFL declined to comment.\n\nRice reported to the Chiefs for voluntary workouts last month, when Chiefs coach Andy Reid said he had spoken to the receiver and the team was letting the legal process play out.\n\nBRIEFLY\n\nOBIT: Joe Collier, the former Buffalo Bills head coach and architect of the Denver Broncos' famed \"Orange Crush\" defense, has died. He was 91. The Broncos said Collier's family confirmed that he died at his Littleton, Colorado, home on Monday night. Collier was coach of the Bills from 1966 to 1968 and compiled a 1316-1 record. He spent two decades in Denver and was defensive coordinator during the franchise's first Super Bowl trip after the 1977 season, powered by the \"Orange Crush\" defense.\n\nLove 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0

The eight-year veteran signed a one-year contract with the Tennessee Titans earlier this week after spending months on the open market. But the reality is the Steelers realized early that he was never a viable candidate for them.\n\n\"Tyler Boyd wasn't an option for the past couple of months, to be honest with you\", The Athletic's Mark Kaboly insisted during an interview with Joe Starkey on 93.7 The Fan on Wednesday. This is notable because Kaboly previously pushed the Steelers as an option for him. \"They weren't interested in him. They had initial interest to see where it was, but they didn't want to pay him. Tyler wanted more than one year\".\n\nA former second-round pick, Tyler Boyd spent the entirety of his first eight seasons with the Cincinnati Bengals. Over that time, he caught 513 passes for 6,000 yards and 31 touchdowns. He also added another 21 catches for 199 yards and one touchdown in seven postseason games.\n\nLast season saw his least productive year of his career, however, partly due to QB Joe Burrow's health. He only caught 67 passes for 667 yards and just two touchdowns. Between the 2018-2022 seasons, Boyd caught 370 passes for 4,505 yards and 26 touchdowns.\n\nMany believe the Steelers will still add a significant wide receiver before the start of the regular season. They were heavily connected to trade rumors for receivers like Brandon Aiyuk and Courtland Sutton. While we can't completely rule out the possibility of such a trade occurring, it feels increasingly unlikely at this point. Even with a dwindling free agency market at wide receiver, Boyd didn't seem like a fit after the Steelers drafted Roman Wilson in the third round.\n\n\"Obviously, they don't have interest in him after the draft. That's obvious there because of the Roman Wilson thing\", Kaboly said of Tyler Boyd. \"But they never really were all in on him. They checked in on him. They tried to get him to sign for lesser money. But, hey, they just didn't view him as a guy that was a high priority right now\".\n\nGiven that Boyd only signed a one-year contract worth \"up to\" $4.5 million should tell you how the rest of the league viewed him as well. I'm guessing that he didn't leave much money on the table. Entering his age-30 season, he's past his prime at this juncture, and not much better than what the Steelers already have.\n\nPittsburgh has already explored other teams' unwanted pieces. They've signed two wide receivers who played under new offensive coordinator Arthur Smith in 2023, for example. They added Van Jefferson early and are also reportedly adding Scotty Miller now. In between, they also signed former Eagle Quez Watkins as a deep threat.\n\nGeorge Pickens is at the top of the Steelers' depth chart, and they also have Wilson and Calvin Austin III. The rest of the players on the roster are just names right now, even if you might recognize some of them. How much would Tyler Boyd really stand out from them at this point in his career?

Pittsburgh can still trade for the WR of their choosing, and Boyd is back with the offensive coordinator that he knows very well.\n\nBut a storybook ending where Boyd completes his career in the city in which he was born, donning the black and gold and playing against his former team had a better ring to it.", "source": {"uri": "atozsports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "A to Z Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennessee_Titans", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tennessee Titans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Steelers", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh Steelers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyler_Boyd_(American_football)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tyler Boyd (American football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diontae_Johnson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Diontae Johnson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Panthers_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh Panthers football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nashville,_Tennessee", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nashville, Tennessee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nashville, Tennessee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offensive_coordinator", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Offensive coordinator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day_Trading", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day Trading", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Commodities_and_Futures", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Commodities and Futures", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Trading", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Trading", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Employment/Careers", "label": "dmoz/Business/Employment/Careers", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Derivatives", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Derivatives", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://atozsports.com/.image/ar_16:9%2Cc_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_xy_center%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620%2Cx_3420%2Cy_666/MjA2MjczNDEwNTA5MDU1NzYz/img_2175.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546992", "eventUri": "eng-9546992", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.223529411764706, "wgt": 133, "relevance": 1}

However, the situation escalated when it was discovered that Boyd was driving on a suspended license.\n\nBoyd sped away from the initial traffic stop, leading deputies on a dangerous pursuit. At one point, dashcam footage captured Boyd overtaking a school bus over a double yellow line, narrowly avoiding a collision with an oncoming car and a semi-truck. Deputies report that Boyd reached speeds exceeding 100 mph.\n\nEfforts to stop Boyd using a PIT maneuver were initially unsuccessful, as he swerved into oncoming traffic to avoid the maneuver. The chase came to a temporary halt when Boyd was apprehended at gunpoint. Deputies attempted to secure him in the back of a patrol car, but within moments, the suspect had maneuvered his handcuffs to the front, climbed into the driver's seat, and drove off.\n\nDeputies were then forced into the unusual position of pursuing one of their own vehicles. They successfully executed a PIT maneuver against the stolen patrol car, but the chase didn't end there. Boyd jumped from the vehicle and attempted to run away until a deputy used a Taser to subdue and recapture him.\n\nBoyd now faces a multitude of charges, predominantly felonies. According to deputies, had Boyd complied originally, he might have been released within an hour for his suspended license. However, he now also faces charges related to a collision during the chase involving the patrol car, which resulted in minor injuries to an 82-year-old woman.\n\nThe Georgia State Patrol is currently investigating the traffic accident that occurred during the chase.\n\nBoyd was booked into the Coweta County Jail on charges of three counts of aggravated assault, two counts of fleeing to elude, driving while license suspended or revoked, reckless driving, following too closely, passing in a no passing zone, criminal interference with government property, willful obstruction of law enforcement officers, escape, and hit-and-run.", "source": {"uri": "fox5atlanta.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "FOX 5 Atlanta"}, "authors": [{"uri": "doug_evans@fox5atlanta.com", "name": "Doug Evans", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheriff", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sheriff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_car", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Police car"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coweta_County,_Georgia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Coweta County, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Coweta County, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handcuffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Handcuffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PIT_maneuver", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "PIT maneuver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dashcam", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dashcam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car_chase", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Car chase"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic_stop", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Traffic stop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School_bus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "School bus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_State_Patrol", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Georgia State Patrol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reckless_driving", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reckless driving"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taser", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Taser"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Felony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic_collision", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Traffic collision"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assault", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assault"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Classifieds/Automotive", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Classifieds/Automotive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Driving_and_Safety", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Driving and Safety", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Restoration", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Restoration", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 52}], "image": "https://images.foxtv.com/static.fox5atlanta.com/www.fox5atlanta.com/content/uploads/2024/05/1280/720/My-project-860-frame-at-2m2s-copy2.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546992", "eventUri": "eng-9546992", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Coweta County, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3411764705882353, "wgt": 116, "relevance": 1}

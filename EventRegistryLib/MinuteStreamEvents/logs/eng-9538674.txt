That has been a question long asked by Jewish Americans, especially immigrants and those of the second generation, scarred by memories of the Holocaust, when assessing the policies of the U.S. government and the pledges of political candidates.\n\nMost of them, most of the time since Franklin Roosevelt first ran for president in 1932, have voted for the Democrat at the top of the ticket.\n\nFast forward 92 years. More Jews have been voting Republican in recent elections, while many younger and left-leaning Jewish voters no longer see unequivocal support for Israel as a litmus test.\n\nInstead, rising antisemitism is reforging a sense of Jewish self-identity - especially among those who consider themselves fully assimilated and accepted in the American mainstream culture.\n\nAntisemitism \"comes from all sides,' said Rachel Sass, antisemitic incident specialist at the Anti-Defamation League's Center on Extremism. 'There are right-wing extremists, left-wing extremists, anti-Israel protesters. There isn't necessarily a clear political or ideological bent, just antisemitism.\"\n\nThere has been a 900% increase in the number of antisemitic incidents in the past decade, with a spike since the Israel-Hamas conflict blew up last year, according to the ADL.\n\nJewish Americans are further alarmed by chants on college campuses - in reaction to Israel's retaliatory strikes on Gaza following the October 7 Hamas terror attack - of 'from the river to sea' and 'go back to Poland,\" along with some physical assaults on Jewish students.\n\n'I've seen people respond with a level of fear, being afraid to reveal their Jewish identity. I've seen other people who have even leaned more into pride in their Jewish identity, wanting to be even more open because they feel that it's very important,' said Sass.\n\nPro-Palestinian protesters camp out in tents at Columbia University, April 27, 2024, in New York. Some Jewish students say campus protests against the war in Gaza have veered into antisemitism and made them afraid.\n\nBestselling novelist Allison Winn Scotch said on the social media platform Threads, 'Every day, as a Jewish American, I get increasingly nervous that we can't come back from the brink of this. I don't know where my family could go though, and I don't know how we would stay safe when we got there anyway.'\n\nShe continued, 'Your Jewish friends are living with a blooming seed of dread in the pits of our stomachs.'\n\nAmerica provided a refuge for Eastern European Jews escaping 19th-century pogroms, who followed the emigration from the more established and prosperous German Jewish community.\n\nMany Jews in the United States, however, did not feel totally accepted into broader American culture until the civil rights movement. Changes not only benefited Blacks but also removed remaining barriers to Jews - such as housing covenants and restricted country club memberships, as well as hiring discrimination at prestigious law firms and entry quotas at the Ivy League universities that such attorneys were drawn from.\n\nThe contemporary surge in antisemitism is not institutional.\n\n'It's children being targeted at school with antisemitic bullying, synagogues being targeted with threats of bombs or shootings, people even being assaulted on the street because they are visibly Jewish or Orthodox,' according to Sass at the ADL.\n\nAmerican Jews, as is the case with other ethnic or minority groups, do not wholly cast votes based on a single issue.\n\n'We swing with the rest of the country around economic issues, war and peace and all kinds of issues,' Mark Mellman, president of the Democratic Majority for Israel, told VOA.\n\nThe Republican Jewish Coalition's political and communications director, Sam Markstein, said, 'I think this will be the first time for a lot of Jewish voters who've never even considered voting Republican in their lives seriously making that consideration this year because of the dereliction of leadership by the Biden administration on these issues.'\n\nDonald Trump, hoping for a second term as president but defeated by Joe Biden four years ago, received somewhere between one-fourth and one-third of the Jewish vote in 2020, according to several polls and Jewish organizations.\n\n'Anybody who knows anything about Donald Trump knows that his alliances are based on people's commitment to him personally, not to a set of values, not to a set of strategic interests,' said Mellman.\n\nRepublicans have done a better job than Democrats in condemning politicians in their respective parties who make antisemitic remarks, Markstein contended, pointing out the RJC supports primary challengers to Republicans in Congress who make such discriminatory comments.\n\n'Unfortunately, there are too many on the Democratic side that don't seem to want to follow that path and want to either run and hide or issue mealy-mouthed responses that piss everybody off,' Markstein told VOA.\n\nAlthough Jews constitute only 2.4% of the U.S. adult population, they are more likely to vote than the general registered voting population and to make political donations.\n\n'The Jewish vote in those [swing] states is going to be the decisive [factor],' Markstein predicted.\n\nThe Republicans tend to draw most of their Jewish strength from the religious Orthodox, the fastest-growing but still smallest Jewish community among the three largest denominations. Most Orthodox Jews strongly support Israel.\n\n'Day after day, the administration's response gets less and less supportive of Israel,' Markstein contended.\n\nA majority of Conservative and Reform Jews tend to vote for Democrats and are more open-minded about a two-state solution in the Middle East that would create a sovereign Palestine.\n\n'To retain Jewish support, Biden's campaign needs to keep doing exactly what they're doing - standing strong with Israel, against antisemitism and behind the American Jewish community,' Mellman said. 'That's exactly what I think American Jews are looking for at this very difficult time. It's exactly what the president is doing.'\n\nVOA White House Bureau Chief Patsy Widakuswara contributed to this report.", "source": {"uri": "northernirelandnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Northern Ireland News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Defamation_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Anti-Defamation League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Jews", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "American Jews"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Antisemitism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jews"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_identity", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jewish identity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left-wing_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Left-wing politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Holocaust", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Holocaust"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Zionism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anti-Zionism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_assimilation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cultural assimilation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franklin_D._Roosevelt", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Franklin D.

They do not feel safe. We know because they are telling us. Believing them isn't hard.\n\nWe believe members of the Black community who say they feel unsafe when law enforcement pulls them over. We believe Muslim Americans who say they feel unsafe when a mosque is vandalized. We believe members of the Asian American and Pacific Islander community who say they feel unsafe when scapegoated for the spread of COVID-19. We believe members of the LGBTQ+ community who say they feel unsafe when bigots attack their dance clubs.\n\nSimply put, when members of our greater community tell us they feel, and are, unsafe, we defend them. We show up at their places of worship and pray with them; we march with them in pride parades; we patronize their businesses; we listen to them and hear what they are experiencing and give them the support they say will be meaningful to them. All the while, we don't relent in allowing for other people's right to hate and their right to express that hatred in ways that do not threaten anyone's safety.\n\nJewish kids have been telling us for months they do not feel safe. Jewish Chicago Public Schools students were fearful for their safety during anti-Israel walkouts earlier this year. Protesters yelled antisemitic slurs during a recent City Council meeting. And 73% of Jewish college students said they experienced or witnessed some form of antisemitism during the first three months of the 2023-24 school year alone - a number we should assume is exponentially higher five months later.\n\nEncampments up the antisemitism ante. Encampments on college and university campuses are not peaceful protests against war. They are platforms for antisemitism, and administrators who do not act aggressively to shut them down risk becoming complicit.\n\nWhen protesters at the encampment at Northwestern University chanted, \"Long live the intifada\" and \"We don't want no Zionists here,\" and posters at the University of Chicago encampment on Monday read, \"Globalize the intifada,\" Jewish students know these messages are calling for the killing of Jews everywhere. When protesters at the encampment at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign chanted this weekend, \"From the river to the sea,\" Jewish students know they are calling for the eradication of Israel, the only true haven for Jews located in our ancestral homeland.\n\nThis is also the Jewish experience at the University of Chicago, the University of Illinois at Chicago, DePaul University and at Roosevelt University and Columbia College downtown. Protesters in recent months have regularly yelled in Jewish students' faces, harassed and vandalized Jewish institutions, and celebrated Hamas, a terrorist group whose charter calls for the murder of Jews anywhere in the world.\n\nLet's be clear: Encampments on college campuses are not First Amendment-protected protests, and the actions of the students and agitators participating in them are not speech. \"Oct. 7 will happen to American Jewish students 10,000 times over\" is not protected speech. Yet it is tolerated on campus. We should be outraged that human chains are formed to prevent Jewish students from getting to class, rabbis and universities must tell Jewish students they cannot guarantee their safety on campus, and graduation ceremonies are canceled because of antisemitic protesters. This is hate with a clear intent to intimidate Jewish students. Yet it's allowed.\n\nUniversity leaders can start to reverse the trend by enforcing their own codes of conduct and campus policies to restore calm and safety for all students. Specifically:\n\nto join the Northwestern encampment and similar actions at U. of I.'s flagship campus\n\nThe environment on college campuses is a natural extension of record levels of antisemitism in America and a growing tolerance of hate against Jews. But that's not an excuse.\n\nWe rightly believe other targeted communities when they say they are unsafe. So, are Jewish students just not believable? Or is antisemitism that baked into the collegiate DNA that no one sees it, even when it's camping right in front of you?\n\nDavid Goldenberg is the Evelyn R.

Brandeis Center for Human Rights Under Law, and the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations -- decided to withdraw from the presentation just minutes before its scheduled 10 a.m. meeting was supposed to begin.\n\nThe groups claimed that the Biden Administration informed them that several \"left-wing groups not usually included in White House convenings\" would be joining the meeting just 20 minutes before it began.\n\nAs a result, Cardona was forced to give the presentation two separate times.\n\nAccording to an email obtained by Jewish Insider, the groups wanted to \"discuss concrete actions the Department can take to support the restoration of order, compliance with civil rights laws, and the protection of Jewish students.\"\n\nSome of the groups reportedly raised the need for giving more rights to Jewish students and protecting them from harassing pro-terrorism agitators.", "source": {"uri": "townhall.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Townhall"},

We need to stand up and never give up. There is no difference between anti-Zionism and antisemitism; it is the same,\" said Israel Bachar, the Jewish state's consul general to the Pacific Southwest.\n\n\"The Jewish state cannot be taken for granted. Every Jewish community around the world must help the State of Israel to remain a safe home and one that will welcome every Jew who wishes to move [there],\" he added.\n\nPro-Hamas campus protests have led to arrests at multiple U.S. universities, including Columbia University, Yale University, New York University, the University of Texas at Austin, the University of Southern California and The Ohio State University.\n\nLast week, police broke down the makeshift tent encampment anti-Israel students set up on the University of California, Los Angeles campus and arrested more than 200 people.\n\n\"It was obvious we could come to a boiling point\"\n\nBachar told JNS that after many months of lawlessness and Jewish students being targeted by agitators, pro-Palestinian and radical groups, violence was inevitable.\n\n\"It was obvious that we would come to a boiling point where we would see violence and disruption to students' ability to study at UCLA,\" he said.\n\nBachar noted that while the administration failed to show leadership at the appropriate time and on a proper scale, they seem to finally understand the need to take action.\n\n\"After months, the administration decided to involve the police. It should have happened a long time ago. They were late in their response,\" he said.\n\n\"It's unfortunate that Jewish students need to be intimidated for this to happen. People were finally arrested and the encampment dismantled. Why did we have to wait for so long?\" he added.\n\n\"They just want to be students\"\n\nBachar, who spent the second Passover Seder with UCLA students on campus, said many of them had reconsidered their decision to study there.\n\n\"The Jewish students are afraid. They don't want to go back to study at UCLA. I am saddened to hear it because in a way, it feels that we've let radical groups win the day,\" he told JNS.\n\n\"I understand their desire to study in a safe place. They did not enroll in UCLA or any other university to engage in combat. They just want to be students. I feel for them,\" he added.\n\nNor is it only the students who are reconsidering, he explained.\n\nThe American Jewish community is becoming more mobilized and finally understands the imminent threat to their children on campus, he said.\n\n\"That's a very big change. Until now, the Jewish community did not feel threatened to send Jewish children to schools around the country. Now, they are faced with a new reality and are rethinking their choice of educational institutions,\" he added.\n\nStarting to fight back\n\nThe Jewish community has also started taking tangible actions to curb the surge of antisemitism on campus.\n\n\"On a legal basis, we are starting to see action groups against universities, they are collecting testimonies from students and will run class action suits,\" said Bachar.\n\n\"They also come to the universities and engage in rallies to help the students. This is great, but we need to do it more,\" he continued.\n\nLast week, the U.S. House of Representatives passed the Antisemitism Awareness Act by a margin of 320-91.\n\nThe bill, H.R.6090, would require the Department of Education to use the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance's working definition of antisemitism when considering whether Jews had been discriminated against under Title VI of the 1964 Civil Rights Act.\n\nThe legislation also discourages the use of other definitions, which may impair \"enforcement efforts by adding multiple standards and may fail to identify many of the modern manifestations of antisemitism.\"\n\nHowever, to Bachar, the fact that such legislation is even necessary is tragic.\n\n\"I think in a way it's a sad day, because if we are coming to a point where we need to use new laws to protect the Jews, it's sad -- but it's better to have it,\" he said.\n\nA failure of leadership\n\nUnlike on other campuses, at UCLA pro-Israel counter-protesters clashed with anti-Israel protesters.\n\nThe Jewish Federation of Los Angeles promptly distanced itself from the actions of the counter-protesters.\n\n\"We are appalled at the violence that took place on the campus of UCLA last night,\" it stated on Wednesday. \"The abhorrent actions of a few counter-protestors last night do not represent the Jewish community or our values.\"\n\nBachar, too, is against violence. However, he blames the university for allowing the deterioration which led to the confrontation in the first place.\n\n\"I don't know who the agitators were or who started the violence but I do know that the Jewish students were intimidated, prevented from going to class, that there were chants against them and that they were constantly singled out\" he said.\n\n\"I am against violence, however I do understand that the deterioration of the situation is because of a lack of leadership on the faculty level and at the administrative level,\" he added.\n\nThe new fighting Jew\n\nWhile he disagrees that the golden age of American Jewry has ended, as some have claimed, Bachar said American Jews will now have to fight for their home the way Israelis do.\n\n\"In order to win this war, we need to define it. There is an antisemitic war that is being financed, organized and orchestrated by various forces, including radical Islam, pro-Palestinian antisemitic and radical left forces that work against the Jewish community and Israel,\" he said.\n\n\"The only way that the Jews will be able to continue living in this golden age is if they fight for their home. I call it the new fighting Jew. There are Oct. 6 Jews and Oct. 8 Jews. There is a different reality on the ground and we cannot run away from it if we want to win it,\" he added.\n\nBachar called on American Jewry to continuously mobilize against antisemitism, even while noting ongoing deep support for Israel within American society.\n\nThe American people are with Israel\n\n\"I travel in America within my region, in Colorado, Nevada, Arizona and Utah. They connect emotionally and psychologically to the story of the Israeli people, they do want to support us. It's based on shared values,\" Bachar told JNS.\n\n\"The American people in the true essence are with Israel,\" he added.\n\nWhile a negative view of Hamas and Iran does not automatically mean a positive view of the Israel Defense Forces, Bachar said it does help to explain who Israel's enemy is.\n\nAlthough more than 40 colleges nationwide saw tent encampments spring up on campus, where protesters harassed Jewish students and engaged in the violent takeover of school facilities, U.S. President Joe Biden was slow to condemn the violence.\n\nHis silence drew criticism from Republicans, including former President Donald Trump and House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.). On April 22 the president condemned antisemitism but also \"those who don't understand what's going on with the Palestinians.\"\n\nBachar noted that the surge in antisemitism in the U.S. predates the current Israel-Hamas war. \"Antisemitism existed in America prior to Oct. 7, it just kept on changing its form and reasoning, but it's the same hate,\" he said.\n\n\"Israel started its military campaign three weeks after Oct. 7. We were accused by various Pro-Palestinian groups of carrying out a massacre before we even started defending ourselves,\" he noted.\n\nWith regard to U.S.-Israel relations amid the ongoing war with Hamas, he said that while there are disagreements between the Biden administration and Israel's government, \"At the end of the day, the State of Israel has the responsibility and the duty to take care of the Israeli people and we have to do what we have to do to secure our citizens.\"", "source": {"uri": "jns.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Jewish News Syndicate"}, "authors": [{"uri":

We appreciate the Secretary rapidly making himself available to us at this critical moment,\" the groups said.\n\n\"As organizations who have been dedicated to defending and supporting Jewish students experiencing harassment and violence on college campuses around the country, we thank the Secretary of Education for the opportunity this afternoon to share our urgent concerns,\" the statement continued.\n\n\"We directly raised our urgent concerns surrounding the current climate of antisemitism on campus and the lack thus far of effective response. In this moment of crisis, we asked the Department to be specific in their follow up and implementation of this week's clear statement made by President Biden and to provide universities with a clear path to effective enforcement of that statement.\n\n\"By sharing specific recommendations, we urged the Administration to do more to protect Jewish students and the broader student community from intimidation, harassment, and violence.\"\n\nThe head of Bend the Arc told the Jewish Telegraphic Agency that she was \"surprised\" that so many groups opted to protest the earlier meeting.\n\n\"I was really surprised not to see them there,\" Jamie Beran said of the boycotting organizations, noting that there were conservative groups that stayed on the call.\n\n\"I was grateful to be with groups that are taking the safety of students seriously and putting politics aside,\" she added.\n\nRabbi Jill Jacobs, executive director of the progressive T'ruah organization, called it a \"good thing\" that the Biden administration was willing to meet with a \"broad swath of the Jewish community,\" in order to \"get the fullest possible picture of what's happening.\"\n\n\"If there are centrist groups that refuse to be in a Zoom with an organization that represents more than 2,300 rabbis, including campus rabbis and rabbis who are in touch with college students from their communities regularly, they might want to reconsider that,\" Jacobs told Jewish Insider.\n\nThe White House faced criticism from Jewish groups last year for indicating that it \"welcomes and appreciates\" definitions of antisemitism not favored by the majority of mainstream Jewish organizations.", "source": {"uri": "nypost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "New York Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

Ritchie Torres wrote.\n\n\"Attacking Jewish institutions, however, is not criticism. It's antisemitism.\"\n\nIn a list of demands shared on Saturday on social media, the group calls for the university to \"Cut ties UC-wide with all zionist organizations -- including study abroad programs, fellowships, seminars, research collaborations and universities.\"\n\nListed among the so-called \"Zionist organizations\" were Jewish community groups, including the Hellen Diller Foundation, Koret Foundation, Israel Institute and Hillel International -- the biggest Jewish student life organization in the US.\n\n\"Three of the four organizations cited in the academic boycott demand by encampment activists at UCSC are Jewish charities and communal groups,\" the Bay Area Jewish Community Relations Counsel wrote on X.\n\n\"They are pillars of the Jewish community. This isn't just about opposing Israel's Gaza actions but seems aimed at Jewish institutions, revealing underlying antisemitism,\" the Jewish group adds.\n\nOther social media users also called out the list for \"effectively demanding the end of Jewish life on campus.\"\n\n\"All the people going 'but Hillel has a pro-Israel orientation' to the SJP at UCSC demands to remove Hillel would never be okay with someone saying \"but Muslim student union has so many convicted terrorist alumni\" as a defense to orgs asking it to be banned,\" one person commented on X.\n\nHillel prohibits chapters from hosting or partnering with groups that oppose Israel and gets some funding from the Israeli government, according to Foreign Policy. However, it is otherwise apolitical and stands at the center for Jewish life at nearly all college campuses across the US.\n\nAnother social media user slammed US-Santa Cruz's anti-Israel encampment as a \"terrorism recruitment festival.\"\n\n\"This list of their 'demands' transparently declares the real agenda to drive Jews out of universities and suppress safety and hate speech control,\" a poster on X said.\n\nWith their list of demands, the pro-Palestine group also calls on the university to divest from weapons manufacturing companies to \"end the targeted repression and policing of pro-Palestinian advocacy on campus\" and to \"sever all ties\" with the local police department.", "source": {"uri": "nypost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "New York Post"}, "authors": [],

It wasn't for a lack of concern about the war in Gaza or the backlash it has aroused on their campuses that some shied away from demonstrating.\n\nThey have had fervent debates with each other over whether and how to respond as pro-Palestinian encampments spread from one university to the next.\n\nSome joined the encampments, celebrating Passover among the tents with fellow protesters. Many felt unnerved by what they considered to be anti-Israel rhetoric and said they feared rallying.\n\nNow, groups in solidarity with Jewish students plan dozens of rallies in the coming days. Protesters hoisted Israeli flags at Indiana University Bloomington and near George Washington University on Thursday, and more flew outside MIT on Friday.\n\nTheir goals include standing in solidarity with Jewish students and showing there's room for empathy for both Palestinians and Israelis affected by the war.\n\nAt George Washington University in Washington, D.C., about 150 people -- including many Jewish students -- gathered Thursday in a grassy courtyard. The goal, said organizer Gabrielle Guigui, \"was to show Jewish pride and Jewish unity ... and to get Jewish students together, because a lot of them are scared.\"\n\nSenior Brina Cartagenova clutched a necklace with her Hebrew name on it, the same necklace she'd previously taken off over fear of retaliation on campus.\n\n\"I was scared to put this back on for, like, at least three weeks, and then I finally did the other day,\" she said. \"This type of event definitely helps me feel more comfortable.\"\n\nThe pro-Palestinian encampments around the country have been largely peaceful, though there have been some clashes. Administrators and campus police at UCLA faced intense criticism Wednesday for failing to act quickly to stop an attack on a pro-Palestinian encampment on campus by counter demonstrators who threw traffic cones and chairs, released pepper spray and tore down barriers.\n\nSome pro-Palestinian demonstrators fought back, and skirmishes continued for hours before outside law enforcement agencies were called to intervene.\n\nThe campus tensions are complicated by the deep history and emotions wrapped up in the Israel-Hamas war. It began on Oct. 7 when Hamas militants attacked Israel and killed roughly 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and took another 250 hostage -- the deadliest attack against Jews since the Holocaust.\n\nVowing to stamp out Hamas, Israel has waged a brutal campaign against the militant group that rules Gaza in a conflict that has killed more than 34,000 Palestinians along the way, according to the Health Ministry there.\n\nProtests in support of Israel or the Palestinians have bubbled up across the U.S. ever since Oct. 7. But the major wave of pro-Palestinian rallies on campuses kicked off two weeks ago, after more than 100 protesters were arrested at Columbia University in New York. They have demanded that colleges stop doing business with Israel and with companies tied to it.\n\nJewish Americans between the ages of 18 and 34 are closely divided on whether Israel's post-Oct. 7 military campaign has been acceptable, according to a Pew Research Center poll conducted in February.\n\nBut instances of hatred among the antiwar protests have rattled many Jewish students, regardless of how they feel about Israel's government or its treatment of Palestinians.\n\nSome examples from campus protests that stung: A poster depicting the Star of David crossed out in red. \"Death to Israel\" scrawled in spray paint. Chants of \"We are Hamas.\"\n\n\"Not everyone is actively endorsing these antisemitic posters and chants and signs and graffiti, but it feels like a large majority is at least OK with it -- OK enough to to ignore it and to let Jewish students continue feeling unwelcome,\" said Lily Cohen, 21, a Jewish student at Northwestern University.\n\n\"It felt very daunting to counterprotest,\" she said.\n\nInside the Northwestern encampment was another Jewish student, junior Paz Baum.\n\nBaum, who held a Passover seder among the tents with the other pro-Palestinian protesters, said her religious values compelled her to protest over the war in Gaza.\n\n\"I see a direct parallel between the experiences of my Jewish ancestors and the experience of the tens of thousands of Palestinians being slaughtered,\" said Baum, whose great-grandparents fled pogroms in eastern Europe.\n\nBaum insisted that hateful posters were taken down as they were spotted, and said the only antisemitism she had witnessed was from several Jewish protesters, mostly older adults, who confronted the encampment on Sunday.\n\nAs Baum held a sign reading \"Jews for a cease-fire,\" she said they lobbed antisemitic slurs at her. Other pro-Palestinian protesters have said accusations of antisemitism are bandied about merely to discredit their movement.\n\nThe encampment at Northwestern reached an agreement with the university on Monday and cleared out.\n\nAt Columbia, some pro-Palestinian protesters have condemned hateful rhetoric coming from their ranks, including remarks from a student who said \"Zionists don't deserve to live\" in a recently surfaced video. That student, who acted as a spokesperson for the encampment and has since walked back his statements, has been banned from campus. But the incident, along with others, struck a nerve.\n\n\"It is completely OK to protest the war in Gaza or be horrified by various actions of the Israeli government,\" said Jacob Schmeltz, a student at Columbia, but \"Jewish students at Columbia right now do not feel physically or emotionally safe to be on campus.\"\n\nSchmeltz, who is one of the leaders of the national Jewish on Campus Student Union, said the group has strategized on how to respond as protests multiplied.\n\nThey used social media to highlight what they saw as antisemitism on campus, but a protest wasn't really on the table.\n\n\"How is it possible to organize a counter protest when many of us are at home or just trying to stay in their dorm rooms because they're afraid of what will happen if they go onto campus?\" said Schmeltz.\n\nOrganizations including Hillel and the Israeli-American Council have planned more rallies in the coming days to show Jewish and pro-Israel students and faculty \"that they are not alone,\" said Elan Carr, CEO of the organization.\n\nAdam Lehman, president of Hillel International, said the rallies will affirm that Jewish students are resilient, deserve respect and can \"show empathy to the plight of Palestinians while also simultaneously showing empathy for Israelis.\"\n\nAt the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill, pro-Israel Jewish students have for weeks tossed around different ideas. A few argued to ignore the pro-Palestinian encampment on campus, to show that \"you can do that, but you're not affecting us,\" said Jewish student Eliana Halivni. A few waved Israeli flags.\n\nSome scrawled the Star of David in chalk, said Halivni, \"so that they know that we're here, even if they can't physically see us.\"\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press reporters

He then facetiously suggested a new tactic -- to find Jewish billionaires to make demands of university presidents to shut down pro-Palestine student groups.\n\nBesides simply being amusing, Mat\u00e9's Instagram actually reveals an important but rarely examined point: Namely, today's Jewish dissenters are not only keeping alive a Jewish tradition of standing with the oppressed but have been far more effective than mainstream Jewish organizations in the United States at countering growing antisemitism.\n\nCompare the overall approaches of the two groups. Consistent with its alarmist tendencies, Anti-Defamation League (ADL) Director Jonathan Greenblatt recently proclaimed, \"Antisemitism is nothing short of a national emergency, a five-alarm fire that is still raging across the country.\" Shamelessly, however, the ADL and other mainstream Jewish organizations add fuel to antisemitism by subordinating the struggle against antisemitism to advocacy on behalf of the state of Israel.\n\nRather than educate the public about the dangers of conflating Israel's actions with Jews at large, these organizations do the opposite by framing virtually all criticisms of Israel as antisemitic. Featuring a new Israel-heavy definition of antisemitism adopted by the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA), establishment groups label antisemitic any Palestinian rights advocacy group which speaks of Israeli depredations, laments that Israel's creation came at the expense of Palestinians, calls for boycotts or advocates for an alternative political system to Jewish hegemony. Depressingly, the U.S. House of Representatives just passed the Antisemitism Awareness Act, which mandates that the Department of Education adopt the IHRA definition to enforce anti-discrimination laws. Moreover, consistent with its prioritization of Israel advocacy, the mainstream U.S. Jewish groups like the ADL make common cause with individuals prone to antisemitic conspiracy theories, such as billionaire Elon Musk, who prove to be sufficiently \"pro-Israel,\" by validating dubious claims that phrases such as \"from the river to the sea\" amount to a call for genocide of Jews.\n\nJewish dissenters, by contrast, situate the growth of antisemitism in the rise of attacks on other vulnerable groups and urge a united front to \"dismantle all systems of oppression.\" Both Jewish Voice for Peace (JVP) and the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA), a document produced by critical Jewish scholars, reject the conflation of antisemitism with anti-Zionism and critiques of Israel. Such an approach, they point out, not only shields Israel from scrutiny, but erases the diverse views and experiences of Jews, demonizes Palestinian rights advocates and absolves \"pro-Israel\" reactionaries. At the same time, JVP and the JDA recognize and condemn all antisemitism, including if it is found in Palestine solidarity circles. JDA carefully distinguishes anti-Zionism, evidence-based criticisms of Israel, and boycotts from comments that employ classical antisemitic tropes in describing Israel, accuse Jews of dual loyalty and blame Jews collectively for Israel's actions.\n\nA similar contrast is found with regard to the post-October 7 setting. Mainstream Jewish organizations like the ADL and the American Jewish Committee ignore Israel's devastation of Gaza, which, to date, has killed more than 34,000 Palestinians, including 14,000 children, and brought famine to much of the population. Instead, they feature Hamas's killings of nearly 1,200 Israelis and taking of over 200 hostages; denounce any efforts to contextualize those attacks; and, with minor qualifications, maintain robust support for Israel's devastating onslaught that arguably amounts to genocide.\n\nMost dramatically, the ADL and allies have intensified the weaponization of antisemitism, especially on college campuses. It accuses student protesters of making U.S. Jews feel unsafe -- avoiding the inconvenient fact that a sizeable number of the protesters themselves are Jewish -- and implore universities to prevent demonstrations, lectures, films or other works of art deemed hostile to Israel. The ADL has gone so far to expand what's coded as antisemitism to apply to rallies that feature \"anti-Zionist slogans,\" meaning virtually all protests of Israel's Gaza offensive. It and others also continue to make common cause with the most intolerant figures in U.S. society. For example, at its March for Israel rally in November 2023, a coalition of Jewish establishment groups featured the antisemitic pastor John Hagee as one of its speakers.\n\nJewish dissenters, on the other hand, have responded with far greater nuance. Writing in the immediate aftermath, Jewish Currents Editor-in-Chief Arielle Angel observed that \"many ardent anti-Zionist Jews found they could not join Palestine-solidarity protests because they needed something the protests could not provide, a space to grieve the Israeli dead.\" Nevertheless, they understood that the October 7 attack was an outgrowth of Israel's decades-long subjection of Palestinians, especially in Gaza, to oppressive conditions. Dissenters also appreciated that Israel would respond with devastating force, which would further Israel's moral degeneration. They have, therefore, not allowed their grief to impede them from robust scrutiny of Israel and mainstream U.S. Jewish groups.\n\nThere has been a further dramatic divergence in response to the recent surge in campus encampments aimed at ending the complicity of their universities in Israel's Gaza assault and broader subjugation of Palestinians over multiple decades. Mainstream Jewish groups demand that universities condemn and shut down such activities in the name of supposedly keeping Jewish students safe. Conversely, dissenters are enthusiastically joining the encampments to honor the Jewish legacy of social justice. Across the country, dissenting Jewish students have held Passover seders, joined by activists with Students for Justice in Palestine, to uphold the holiday's commitment to liberation from tyranny. Ironically, a large contingent of militant \"pro-Israel\" Jews assumed the role of modern-day pharaohs by violently invading the UCLA encampment. Among the many victims of this assault were the numerous Jewish student dissenters. Sadly, the fear expressed by mainstream Jewish groups of Jewish students being unsafe came true. Yet the perpetrators were hardline Zionist Jews and the victims were the Jews of conscience.\n\nMainstream Jewish groups predictably reject these alternative approaches, claiming that they simply justify anti-Israel and anti-Zionist behavior. The ADL's Greenblatt, for instance, vows the organization will not allow JVP to use its \"Judaism as a shield,\" while Zionist activists Gil Troy and Natan Sharansky aim to excommunicate Jewish dissenters as \"Un-Jews.\"\n\nThis intolerance is unconscionable. If we hope to reverse Israel's escalating path of destruction and accompanying moral degeneration, reaffirm the proud Jewish social justice legacy and attach the struggle against antisemitism to a robust antiracist movement, then Jewish dissenters represent our best hope.\n\nAs we Jews observed Passover in April, two lessons are especially pertinent. One: We are not free if anyone else is oppressed. Two: We must never allow our own people to become modern pharaohs.", "source": {"uri": "truthout.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Truthout"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Hillel is the premier Jewish student organization on U.S. campuses. The other two are charities that are also pillars of the Jewish community,\" the ADL added. \"This is not an expression of opposition to Israel's actions in Gaza but effectively an expression of opposition to Jewish infrastructure.

The meeting took place a day after President Joe Biden condemned violent protests and antisemitism.\n\n\"The groups who had requested the meeting found out at the last minute that the meeting was not going to proceed as planned and it's now being rescheduled,\" said one source familiar with the meeting. Another participant told Jewish Insider that they decided to sit out the discussion after the Education Department sent a list of participating organizations 20 minutes before the meeting was scheduled to begin.\n\nJewish Federations of North America, Hillel International, the Anti-Defamation League, the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations, the Orthodox Union and the Louis D. Brandeis Center for Human Rights Under Law either did not participate in or dropped off the call, another source familiar with the meeting told JI.\n\nThese groups, along with the National Council of Jewish Women and the Conservative movement's Rabbinical Assembly, wrote to Cardona last Friday to ask him to meet with them within a week. Their email to Cardona asked him to join the Jewish advocates \"to discuss concrete actions the Department can take to support the restoration of order, compliance with civil rights laws and the protection of Jewish students,\" according to a copy of the letter obtained by JI. The letter said that actions previously proposed by the Jewish organizations in meetings with senior Education Department staff \"were not taken and now we confront the current crisis.\"\n\nRepresentatives of the groups that pulled out were frustrated to see the inclusion of some progressive organizations that oppose the use of the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance's (IHRA) working definition of antisemitism, including T'ruah, the Nexus Leadership Project and Bend the Arc. They were also surprised -- and puzzled -- to see a group called the Diaspora Alliance, which many had never heard of.\n\nThe Diaspora Alliance group is closely associated with IfNotNow, which since Oct. 7 has aligned itself with Jewish Voice for Peace and other anti-Israel advocacy groups. Three of the Diaspora Alliance's staff members -- including the group's international director, Carinne Luck, along with Simone Zimmerman and Emma Saltzberg -- co-founded IfNotNow a decade ago. Diaspora Alliance opposes the use of the IHRA definition, which has been endorsed by the Education Department, calling it \"bad for Jews and Palestinians, and for human and civil rights.\"\n\nIfNotNow's New York City chapter released a statement this week \"in support of student activists\" at Columbia University and other campuses in New York, calling the activists \"brave students [who] have spoken up in solidarity with Palestinians as they face a genocide in which our country and their universities are complicit.\" IfNotNow has been calling for a cease-fire in the Israel-Hamas war since days after the Oct. 7 attack and advocating for the U.S. to stop sending military assistance to Israel. The group has been referring to Israel's war against Hamas as a genocide since mid-October.\n\nThe meeting was organized by the Department of Education, which did not notify the White House of the attendees, according to a Biden administration official, who said the White House does not meet with the Diaspora Alliance. In the meeting, Tanden conveyed that fighting antisemitism is a top priority for the White House, the official shared.\n\nAn Education Department spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment.\n\n\"I think it's a good thing that Secretary Cardona wants to meet with a broad swath of the Jewish community to get the fullest possible picture of what's happening,\" said Rabbi Jill Jacobs, executive director of T'ruah, a progressive rabbinic human rights organization. \"If there are centrist groups that refuse to be in a Zoom with an organization that represents more than 2,300 rabbis, including campus rabbis and rabbis who are in touch with college students from their communities regularly, they might want to reconsider that.\"\n\nThe groups that pulled out of the morning Zoom call scheduled a separate meeting with the Education Department on Friday afternoon, according to a source with knowledge of the groups' plans.\n\nAmy Spitalnick, the CEO of the Jewish Council for Public Affairs, described the meeting as constructive, and said that the administration \"has repeatedly made clear its commitment to countering antisemitism on campus and keeping Jewish students safe,\" including on the meeting, but highlighted that the Education Department needs additional resources.\n\nDepartment officials shared that Office of Civil Rights staffers are currently each handling 50 open cases, given the volume of complaints filed in recent months, one participant shared.\n\nAnother source said that officials discussed previous and upcoming steps to address campus antisemitism, including an upcoming guidance to be issued next week around free speech on campuses. They said that the officials \"clearly understand the issue\" and are \"very concerned about antisemitism and student safety and the difference between the right to protest.\"\n\nOn Friday morning, Cardona sent a letter to college and university presidents condemning \"abhorrent\" instances of antisemitism on college campuses and directing them to resources to better combat it.\n\n\"As the 2023-24 school year comes to a close, I remain incredibly concerned by the reports of antisemitic hate directed at students on some campuses,\" Cardona said in the letter, which was published by CNN. He described a \"sharp rise in reports of antisemitism targeting Jewish students on some college campuses.\"\n\nOther organizations who attended the Friday meeting include Agudath Israel, the American Jewish Committee, J Street U, the National Council of Jewish Women, the Religious Action Center of Reform Judaism, UJA-Federation of New York and the Rabbinical Assembly.", "source": {"uri":

Meanwhile, the campus demonstrations have provoked hysteria among politicians and the media, who have smeared the protests as violent, antisemitic, and potentially even connected to international terror networks.\n\nLast week, the McCarthyist meltdown reached absurd new heights last week when the House of Representatives passed a bill enshrining a legally binding definition of antisemitism that includes anti-Zionism. This past Wednesday, the House of Representatives overwhelmingly approved the Antisemitism Awareness Act, by a vote of 320 to 91. The bill urges the Department of Education to codify a definition of antisemitism that includes anti-Zionist criticism of Israel.\n\nDespite the bill's name, purporting to call \"awareness\" to antisemitism, its actual contents are an insult to Jewish history and historical memory, erasing decades of Jewish anti-Zionist politics. In fact, in a tragic and deeply twisted irony, the bill would desecrate the graves of millions of Jewish victims of the Holocaust, many of whom were anti-Zionists themselves.\n\nThe Antisemitism Awareness Act directs the Department of Education to use the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) definition of antisemitism when \"reviewing, investigating, or deciding whether there has been a violation of title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.\" The controversial IHRA definition of antisemitism includes among its examples of antisemitism \"the targeting of the state of Israel, conceived as a Jewish collectivity,\" \"denying the Jewish people their right to self-determination, e.g., by claiming that the existence of a State of Israel is a racist endeavor,\" and \"drawing comparisons of contemporary Israeli policy to that of the Nazis.\"\n\nIn other words, the IHRA includes anti-Zionist political speech, the dominant Jewish stance on the idea of a Jewish nation-state before the Holocaust, in its definition of antisemitism. It would, for instance, define an article I wrote last spring -- which outlines the similarities between the current politics of the Israeli state and my own family's experiences in the Holocaust and the shtetl pogroms -- as antisemitic.\n\nIf passed and adopted by the US Department of Education (DOE), the act would empower the DOE to strip schools of federal funding if they refuse to repress students engaged in anti-Zionist speech, ban organizations like Students for Justice in Palestine and Jewish Voice for Peace (JVP), and bar teachers and professors from endorsing anti-Zionist messages. It would further give legal cover and encouragement to university administrations and local police departments already seeking to repress anti-Zionist demonstrations.\n\nDespite the Israeli state's insistence on the centrality of Israel and Zionism to Jewish identity and practice, Zionism is a nationalist political movement, and a rather recent one in Jewish history. In Ten Myths About Israel, Israeli-born historian Ilan Papp\u00e9 shows that before the Holocaust, Zionism was a minoritarian political movement among European Jewry.\n\nMost European Jews, Pappe explains, held one of three other political views, all of which were non- or anti-Zionist. In Western Europe, where Napoleon's conquests emancipated Jews from de jure oppression, Jewish people were more assimilated into their own countries' cultural practices and identity. For these Jews, many of whom were liberals, the goal was to be accepted within these national communities, not to break off and form a new and separate one -- an idea not too different from those advocated by antisemites in their home countries.\n\nIn Eastern Europe, where Jews remained subjugated under Tsarist rule -- confined to the shtetls, ghettoes, and the Pale of Settlement -- Jewish politics took two primary forms: socialist internationalism on the one hand, and religious orthodoxy on the other. Both were vehemently opposed to Zionism.\n\nWorking-class Jews throughout Eastern Europe played an outsize role in the militant and powerful labor movement that eventually seized power in the October Revolution. The Jewish Bund was the largest Jewish trade union movement and Jewish political party in Europe, and it fought for Jewish liberation alongside the struggle for socialism and international solidarity with other workers and oppressed peoples. In addition to the Bund, Jewish workers and intellectuals were disproportionately represented in other socialist, Marxist, and revolutionary parties like the Bolsheviks and Mensheviks, as well as in communist and socialist parties outside the Russian Empire.\n\nAgainst Zionism, the Bund insisted \"wherever we are, that's our homeland.\" It saw Zionism as abandoning the struggle against antisemitism, which could be defeated through working-class solidarity and struggle, and overturning the political and economic conditions that fueled antisemitism. Zionists, on the other hand, accepted the basic nationalistic and racialistic premises of our oppressors: that Jews could never be safe among non-Jews and instead needed to separate ourselves.\n\nLast, the more theologically orthodox in Eastern Europe rejected Zionism for religious reasons. Israel, the biblical promised land, could only be brought about by the messiah, not humankind. Transforming the concept of Israel into a modern nation-state-building project -- let alone one requiring war, colonization, and displacement of the current population -- was largely seen as anathema to religious dictates. As Papp\u00e9 recounts, a prominent Hasidic rabbi declared that \"Zionism [asked] him to replace centuries of Jewish wisdom and law for a rag, soil and a song (i.e., a flag, a land, and an anthem).\"\n\nImperial powers, especially Britain, soon began to adopt their own form of Christian Zionism, having identified a potentially powerful symbiotic relationship between Jewish Zionists and Christian and imperialist interests. A Britain-aligned Jewish colony in Palestine was seen at once as an incredible geopolitical asset for the British Empire and a solution to British and other European leaders' \"Jewish problem\" (i.e., antisemitic animus), all the while potentially fulfilling Christian prophecies of a Jewish-controlled Jerusalem that would bring about Armageddon.\n\nIt's no wonder Bundists decried Zionism as \"escapism,\" and Jewish liberals saw it as bolstering, not opposing, antisemitism.\n\nThe Antisemitism Awareness Act, expected to soon be passed in the Senate and signed into law by President Joe Biden, attempts to erase this history, and thereby gravely insults centuries of Jewish theology and politics. Since its founding, the Zionist movement and Israel have engaged in a global campaign to equate the political movement of Zionism with Judaism, the religion and people. In doing so, they have cynically co-opted the horrific tragedy of the Holocaust to silence critics of Israel's apartheid system and military occupation of Palestine.\n\nSupporters of Israel demonize Jewish anti-Zionist activists around the world as self-hating Jews, exiles from our own community. Before student protesters launched the Gaza solidarity encampment at Columbia and were met with brutal police repression, the university had already banned the chapter of the Jewish Voice for Peace there.\n\nSimilarly, one of first three students to be expelled by a university for Palestine activism, an organizer at Vanderbilt, was the chair of the school's JVP chapter and had lived in Israel for a year, where he first became an anti-Zionist after participating in anti-eviction activism in East Jerusalem. In Germany, perhaps the one country where anti-anti-Zionism crackdowns have been even more extreme than within Israel and the United States, many Jewish activists have been among those arrested and facing repression.\n\nIn fact, Jewish anti-Zionism not only has a rich history, but until the Holocaust was the dominant politics of international Judaism. While many survivors were convinced that their earlier ideas were naive, internalizing the fascist premise that Jews will never have a place in broader society, and many more were won over to Zionism in the years following the establishment of Israel, Zionism's rise to dominance within institutional Judaism must be understood in the context of the extermination of millions of anti-Zionist and non-Zionist Jews in concentration camps.\n\nCongress is currently seeking to pass a bill that would cast the views of millions of Jewish Holocaust victims as anti-Jewish and beyond the pale and would suppress those at schools throughout the country from freely discussing their ideas. In doing so, they are spitting on the graves of our ancestors.", "source": {"uri": "znetwork.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "ZNetwork"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

All facilities are closed but housing and dining remain open, according to a Triton Alert sent to students.\n\nThe Metropolitan Transit Service (MTS) has suspended service to UCSD's Central Campus Station due to the police activity.\n\nThe encampment was first established on May 1 joining dozens of universities around the world where students maintain pro-Palestinian sites.\n\n\"As a Jewish American student, I stand with the many Jewish, Palestinian and people of all backgrounds that demand divestment from the occupation and genocide of the Palestinian people,\" said Rachel, an undergraduate majoring in biological anthropology. \"We are inspired by the Black civil rights movement, the anti-apartheid movement in South Africa, and the Jewish concept of Tikkun Olam -- to repair the world -- to call for a free Palestine.\n\n\"The chancellor and university admin want us to stay silent -- not for the benefit of humanity but for the benefit of their own pockets.

The university rejected that call, stating: \"The resolution does not align with the position of UC San Diego, which like the University of California and the other nine UC campuses, has consistently opposed calls for a boycott against and divestment from Israel.\"\n\nThe UCSDivest Coalition is specifically calling on the university to issue a statement affirming the right of Palestinian people \"to live in freedom and safety in their indigenous homeland\" and condemn the actions of Israel, and offer amnesty for all associated with the encampment.\n\nThey also want a campus-wide boycott of institutional and research partnerships with Department of Defense contractors, companies named by the Boycott, Divest and Sanction movement and \"all Israeli companies, universities, and government agencies.\n\nNumerous San Diego Jewish community leaders and organizations released the following joint statement on Friday:\n\n\"We, as Jewish communal leaders in San Diego, stand with our Jewish college students. Like you, we have been watching, with great concern, as pro-Palestinian, anti-Israel protests and encampments have rolled out across college campuses across the country, including a walkout earlier this week at SDSU and an encampment at UCSD.\n\n\"We have watched in horror at the misinformation and disinformation on display amongst the protestors, at the students and outside agitators masking their identities with keffiyehs and glasses, in effect, dressing like Hamas terrorists, as if this is something to be emulated. To say these encampments are peaceful does not begin to capture the intended effect, and the intimidation they are meant to cause.\n\n\"Many of the protesters on campus are not actually students. On the ground on Library Walk at UCSD are chalked slogans like \"From the River to the Sea\" and \"One solution; intifada revolution.\" These words are not about liberation; they are about annihilation. From the River to the Sea is a slogan that calls for the obliteration of the state of Israel, from the Jordan River to the Mediterranean Sea. Calling for \"Intifada,\" the term commonly used to refer to two periods in Israel known for horrific terror attacks designed to kill Jews, is a call for violence.\n\n\"We agree that a university campus should provide a marketplace of ideas, but violence and intimidation are not provided for under free speech. These encampments violate campus protocols to which all students and faculty agree to abide. They are fueled by a campaign of misinformation and by underlying antisemitism, and we appreciate the steps that the university has taken and strongly encourage further action to ensure their code of conduct is honored, the encampment gets shut down, and to hold those responsible accountable for their actions, while protecting the safety of everyone involved.\n\n\"Collectively, we are in close contact around this situation, led by Hillel of San Diego and our campus partners. We are extraordinarily proud of the Jewish students who have been strong, resilient, articulate, supportive of one another and who have represented the Jewish people with remarkable care and courage. They have asked that community members not engage or antagonize the protestors. Rather, they have asked that the community attend any of the public events during the student-led Peace in Israel week, May 13-17, which includes important speakers, demonstrations against the atrocities committed by Hamas along with a rally and nighttime shuk.\n\n\"We all want to see peace in the Middle East. We want to see the more than 130 hostages still held in Gaza home safely, and an end to the fighting. And every single one of us wants to see our college students free to enjoy all that a university education entails without fear, intimidation or harassment simply because they are Jewish, or support the right of Israel to exist.\"\n\nUCSD Hillel, a campus Jewish organization, put out a post on Instagram calling for safety for Jewish students.\n\n\"Jewish students should be able to express their Jewish identities and support for the Jewish state without fear, in a learning environment free of hostility,\" the organization's post read. \"As always, we are resilient in the face of these challenges. Our doors are always open, and we will continue to serve as a safe space for Jewish students.\"\n\nHere is the full statement released by the chancellor:\n\nA Message from Chancellor Pradeep K. Khosla\n\nOn May 1, 2024, campus community members and non-affiliates established an illegal encampment near Library Walk. As I stated in my previous message, unauthorized encampments are strictly prohibited, and we must enforce our campus policies and the law for the safety and well-being of all members of our campus community. We began communicating with participants within minutes of the camp's establishment. Nevertheless, the encampment has tripled in size in violation of the group's commitment not to expand the footprint. This encampment poses an unacceptable safety and security hazard on campus.\n\nThroughout this unlawful encampment, campus police, security teams and free expression monitors have been on site to support the safety and security of all members of the campus community and to maintain the continuity of campus operations and our academic mission. Since the encampment was established, university administration has attempted to maintain regular communication with encampment liaisons identified by the group. We have been met with shifting liaisons and claims that the encampment has no organized leadership with whom to reach binding agreements. Nevertheless, we were assured that the encampment had committed not to increase the size of the area, and despite this agreement, that commitment was not honored.\n\nThe encampment poses serious safety and security hazards to those inside and outside the encampment area. In the last week, the encampment has limited free movement on campus, created a checkpoint for entry into the camp, and denied access to the fire marshal and health inspectors. As time passes, the threat and potential for violent clashes increases. The presence of a significant number of non-affiliates in the encampment heightens these concerns.\n\nUC San Diego strongly supports the right to free expression and has supported the rights of those participating in multiple pro-Palestinian protests this academic year, including a demonstration with more than 2,000 participants on March 6, 2024.\n\nThe violation of law and campus policy represented by this encampment, however, is not a peaceful protest. It has become dangerous. As University of California Board of Regents Chair Richard Leib recently stated in his letter to the university community, \"Protests that interfere with university operations or threaten the safety of students require immediate enforcement of university policies.\" I am calling on our students, faculty, staff and non-affiliates participating in the encampment to peacefully disperse.\n\nOn Wednesday, a fairly sizable crowd of protesters gathered on the main quad of the University of San Diego shortly after noon for what organizers described on social media as a Requiem for the Dead and Dying in Gaza.\n\nThe students and other pro-Palestinian supporters were peaceful, mostly lying prostrate on the ground or sitting in concentric waves around speakers, with many holding signs, including one that read \"Arresting Kids Is Not Self-Defence\"\n\nAt least three Palestinian flags were spotted flapping in the breeze.\n\nIf there was any police presence at the scene, it was difficult to detect with SkyRanger 7 flew over the campus.\n\nAn Instagram post that went up before the protest said, \"The Gaza @ USD faculty coalition is organizing a memorial THIS Wednesday, May 1st, and are inviting you to join in this moment of solidarity!\" and \"Stand With Us As We Pray for All the Lives Lost.\" The post also called for protesters to wear all back, a call to action responded to by a large percentage of those attending.\n\nThe announcement stated the protest was scheduled for 12:30-2 p.m.\n\nThe encampment comes a day after hundreds of San Diego State University students staged a walkout with demands for the university to sever financial ties with Israel amid the ongoing war in Gaza.\n\nThat action, organized by Students for Justice in Palestine at SDSU, San Diego 4 Palestine Coalition and SDSU's Middle Eastern and North African Student Union, began at 1:30 p.m. Tuesday at Hepner Hall followed by a march through campus at 2:30 p.m.\n\nA social media post circulated by the student groups said that among other demands, they want SDSU to \"divest financially from Israel's war on Gaza and occupation in Palestine.\" They called on SDSU President Adela De La Torre \"to acknowledge the genocide and discrimination on campus.\"\n\nSDSU addressed Tuesday's walkout with the following statement: \"As a public university, and as aligned with our institutional values, San Diego State University must allow for constitutionally protected free speech and an individual's right to acts of peaceful protest.\n\n\"As a diverse campus community, this also means that those within our campus community will have varying values, ideas and points of view. We both expect and encourage all those within our campus community to engage in respectful conversations and interactions, as detailed in SDSU's Principles of Community. SDSU does not accept any instance of harassment or discrimination. Additionally, university safety professionals and administrators from the division of Student Affairs and Campus Diversity continue to be in contact with members of our Jewish, Islamic, Arab, and Palestinian communities, in addition to other campus community members.\n\n\"We strongly encourage all who choose to gather to adhere to laws and university policies.\"\n\nWhile there were no reports of violence emerging from the walkout by mid-afternoon, a local law enforcement presence was formed.\n\nProtests also continued Wednesday at USC and UCLA, with encampments formed by protesters who have vowed to occupy public spaces on campus until their demands are met. Protest encampments also emerged Monday at UC Irvine and UC Riverside.", "source": {"uri": "nbcsandiego.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC 7 San Diego"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

One challah was decorated with a Palestinian flag in seeds and herbs; the ceremonial \"wine\" (grape juice) was chosen because it was not made in Israel. Palestinian flags and handmade posters with slogans protesting genocide hung from trees. As they prayed, other students, many of whom were Muslim, held up kaffiyehs, jean shirts and checkered blankets to form a privacy screen.\n\nSince April 29, Jewish anti-Zionist protesters at the Hyde Park campus have used food, ritual and community in the encampment as one of many ways to express their religious commitment to divestment from Israel, a multiethnic future and an end to killings in Gaza. In a practical sense, that means Seders and Shabbats (or Sabbaths), with non-Israeli kosher products, teaching about the pluralistic elements of Jewish traditions like the Moroccan Jewish Mimouna, and eating Palestinian food with Muslims and others in their coalition.\n\nAvi Steinberg, a writer, faculty member and graduate of Orthodox yeshivas who spoke at the event, described Shabbat as a time of reflection.\n\n\"People sit with their thoughts and their emotions,\" Steinberg said on a phone call Saturday. \"It's a time of stopping the clock completely.\"\n\nAfter the prayer and singing concluded, the Shabbat observers -- a small but sizable portion of the broader encampment -- dispersed; at the central food tent, a half-dozen or more unflipped maqluba pots sat beside rice and meat already doled out onto steam plates. Cold chopped salads and hot lentil soup were also served. This meal, donated by Arab restaurant Al Bahaar, acted informally as the Shabbat meal. The encampment food tent staff relies on donations of hot food and attempts to keep a variety of vegan, kosher, halal and nonallergenic options available for encampment dwellers.\n\nThe Muslim maghrib prayer began soon after on the same blue tarp. The University of Chicago United for Palestine coalition includes Students for Justice in Palestine, UChicago Jews for a Free Palestine, and several other organizations.\n\nNationally, encampments like this one have been accused of antisemitism. But in interviews with a half-dozen or more Jewish students and affiliated faculty members within the pro-Palestine encampment at the U. of C., none of them said they felt anything resembling antisemitism within the camp. Instead, they said they felt more connected to the Jewish tradition through their activism during the protests. They argued that anti-Zionism and advocating for Palestinian freedom is in a long tradition of Jewish values of pluralism and agitation for justice.\n\n\"When we're praying for peace and human emancipation, to me this is the essence of what it means to be Jewish,\" said graduate student Daniel Fernandez, speaking outside the encampment. \"What is so profoundly disappointing is that this is somehow controversial.\" Fernandez has stayed at the encampment, attending or sometimes leading several of the religious services this past week.\n\nChicago Jewish leaders held a news conference Wednesday where they called the encampments \"platforms for antisemitism.\" The university's major Jewish organizations have disavowed, criticized or ignored the protesters.\n\nIn an email to the Tribune, Rabbi Yossi Brackman of Rohr Chabad at the University of Chicago wrote, \"Movements have always had a token minority, this is no different. For example, there were some Black slave owners and Black people who fought for the Confederacy.\"\n\nTalking to the Tribune from within the encampment, graduate student Sofia Butnaru said many of the Israel-critical Jewish students did not feel they had a \"religious home\" at the U. of C. \"We felt we weren't represented in the other spaces, so we were really interested in building our own rituals and coming together as like-minded people to do the religious practices that are very near and dear to us,\" Butnaru said.\n\nCallie Maidhof, a professor of global studies and a member of Faculty for Justice in Palestine, agreed. \"(Our Jewish institutions) have not made space for this,\" she said. \"That is especially true of the largest Jewish campus organizations like Hillel.\"\n\nWhile Hillel International's Israel guidelines say the organization welcomes political pluralism and a diversity of student perspectives, its standards also state that it will not \"partner with, house, or host organizations, groups, or speakers\" that support practice certain positions, like the Boycott, Divest, Sanctions movement against the state of Israel. Members of organizations like FJP and Jewish Voices for Peace, which support BDS, would not be allowed to speak at Hillel under this policy.\n\nA Hillel rabbi acknowledged but did not respond to a request for comment from the Tribune.\n\nDespite feeling isolated from campus Jewish groups, UChicago Jews for a Free Palestine have organized several religious events since the encampment went up. According to messages with a Jewish organizer at DePaul's encampment, a similar Shabbat service was held within the encampment on their campus. These events have attracted supportive community members like retired researcher Sandy Perpignani. She sat outside the U. of C. encampment and engaged with critical onlookers. At Shabbat time, she entered the encampment to pray with the students and organizers.\n\nRegardless of some personal challenges, organizers constantly recentered the conversation toward what they see as the oppression and bravery of the Palestinian people. The protesters asked the university to divest from Israel and call for a cease-fire.\n\nWithin the Divinity School, Aviva Waldman, a writing instructor and alum who acts as a faculty liaison for organizing students, described a Passover event held by encampment organizers and allies that reflected their commitment to divestment from Israel, commitment to Palestinians and embrace of interreligious pluralism.\n\nDuring Passover, which ended last week, Jewish communities avoided chametz (leavened goods like wheat and spelt) and instead consumed matzo. Encampment organizers are, for the most part, supportive of the demands of the Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions movement, but many matzo brands, including Manischewitz, make much of their product in Israel. Though Manischewitz is not officially part of the BDS boycott list, organizers felt they needed to make a modification. Unable to find non-Israeli-origin matzo in Chicago, Waldman said they ordered matzo from a specialty farm in New York. Earlier, Butnaru cooked matzo ball soup for Passover using a matzo meal that was not a product of Israel.\n\n\"Our home is wherever we are,\" Waldman said. \"There's no nation-state that is our national homeland. We wanted our ritual items, the matzo, to come from our home.\"\n\nPalestinian olive oil from Jenin in the Israeli-occupied West Bank was also added to the Seder plate. The oil was available a bit closer to campus, from Canaan Palestine, a Madison, Wisconsin-based company that sources organic and fair trade olive oil from Palestinian orchards.\n\n\"The Seder plate is the most symbolic ritual item,\" Waldman said. \"(It) symbolizes Palestinian connection to the land and commitment to nurturing the land through farming olives and olive orchards.\"\n\nOrganizers also revised their Haggadah, the text traditionally read at Passover Seder, to highlight parallels between the Palestinian freedom struggle and the story of the Jewish community fleeing from Egypt.\n\nThese changes reflect deep rifts and debates happening within Chicago Jewish communities.\n\n\"The Passover Seder is about one thing and one thing only,\" Yossi wrote in an email. \"The exodus of the Israelites from Egyptian slavery to return to the land of their Patriarchs, what would then become known as the Land of Israel. Anything else is a bastardization of Judaism. \"\n\nAnother Chicago-area rabbi was supportive of the protesters.\n\n\"I'm in favor of Jewish people observing Shabbat, praying three times daily and fulfilling the commandments wherever they are,\" Rabbi Aryeh Bernstein wrote in a message on X, formerly Twitter. Bernstein said the students and organizers' actions are \"not in conflict with (the Torah and Jewish law and teachings).\"\n\nOn April 30, organizers held a Mimouna, a Sephardic tradition where Moroccan Jews celebrated the end of Passover by partaking in leavened goods and sweets with their Muslim neighbors. According to the organizers, observant Jews \"sell\" their leavened goods to Moroccan Muslims, only to buy it back when Passover is finished. While the festival is celebrated in Israel, Waldman says the important element of coexistence is not present.\n\nUndergraduate student Andrew Basta helped organize the Mimouna; he has stayed most nights at the encampment tents since they were established.\n\n\"The traditional kind of food of the holiday would be mofletta, which is a kind of crepe-like pancake that is sweet,\" Basta said on a phone call Saturday. \"Sadly, we are not able to achieve making that within the encampment, based on (lack of) access to stoves.\" Instead, they settled on pita and sweet dates.\n\n\"There were moments where we could be neighbors and be friendly and celebrate together,\" Butnaru said. \"Not to say that it was perfect coexistence, but there was coexistence.\"\n\nBasta is optimistic about the future and sees the Mimouna as symbolic of what is possible.\n\n\"We can rebuild joyous futures and multiethnic futures where Jews and Muslims can be neighbors without being part of an apartheid state or ethnic cleansing,\" Basta said.\n\nWhile Passover had ended by the time of Friday's Shabbat, many organizers were still thinking about the lessons of that story: the struggle for liberation in the face of oppression.\n\n\"There's nothing Jewish about an ethno-state,\" Butnaru said. \"There's plenty of things that are Jewish about building community.\"\n\nMany students expressed the challenges of bringing their activism to their parents. Fernandez described his parents as \"deeply committed to Zionism\" and said that their conversations around the subject of the war in Gaza and his organizing have been \"agonizing\" for both parties.\n\n\"They think when I am in these camps, standing on this tarp praying ... they think I'm praying for the destruction of the Jewish people.\" But Fernandez said he is committed to nonviolence. He and other organizers believe that there can be coexistence and repair between Palestinians and Jews.\n\nFor the most part, the organizers in the encampment wish things were different with their families; but that won't stop them from protesting.\n\n\"I want to begin from a premise that their hurt is real,\" Fernandez said. \"Our history as Jewish people is rooted in that; it's real and palpable and omnipresent. I don't want to dismiss their fear ... but the same Torah has placed us on opposite ends of the issue.\"\n\nDuring the Shabbat, Avi Steinberg spoke and referenced a daily prayer from the Book of Numbers that translated to \"How goodly are your tents, oh Jacob?\"\n\nThis reference got a chuckle, but he explained the deeper meaning: You need to live every day as if you are in the tents.\n\nIn a later message, Steinberg explained \"that talk was presenting tent life as a metaphor for radical politics specifically ... the need for maintaining that radical edge even on a daily basis when we're not literally in the tents.\" He said he believed the encampment itself is a victory and that they would succeed in getting university leadership to divest financially from Israel and call for a ceasefire.\n\nIn the meantime, they were building their vision here, in the impermanence of the tents. In what they say is a multiethnic, pluralistic group committed to justice and peace.", "source": {"uri": "chicagotribune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Chicago Tribune"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Wagner High School on Staten Island told Fox News Digital that after the terrorist organization Hamas invaded Israel Oct. 7, a Middle Eastern student \"screamed free Palestine\" and could be heard saying \"f -- ing Jew\" on the way to school.\n\nThe Jewish students said some anti-Israel students \"claim they are not antisemitic and say Israel should not exist.\" One student of Middle Eastern origin said it would be \"OK if the Holocaust happened,\" according to a witness at the school.\n\nThe Jewish students requested anonymity due to what they claim is an anti-Jewish environment at the school and a fear of reprisals from pro-Hamas students. According to the Jewish student, one student told an Israeli \"that Jewish people and Palestinian people can't coexist,\" and \"kept calling me an Israeli and Zionist.\"\n\nAt a meeting of student leaders at the school, Fox News Digital was told all accusations of antisemitism were rejected by the anti-Israel students. One example given was of anti-Israel agitators deliberately agitating outside the Jewish Community Center. It was also claimed that a student was permitted to wear a Hamas T-shirt at the school.\n\nThe U.S. government has classified Hamas a foreign terrorist organization. The Hamas jihadi movement murdered roughly 1,200 people Oct. 7 in southern Israel, including over 30 Americans. Hamas is holding over 130 people hostage in the Gaza Strip, including U.S. citizens.\n\nMany of the same students, it was claimed, also participated in an anti-Israel rally attended by 200 activists across from Susan E. Wagner high school during school hours in March with antisemitic groups promoting the destruction of the Jewish state.\n\nNYC MAYOR ERIC ADAMS BLASTS STUDENTS' 'VILE SHOW OF ANTISEMITISM' THAT FORCED TEACHER TO HIDE IN OFFICE\n\nFox News Digital obtained a photograph of the pro-Hamas slogan \"Free Palestine. From the River to the Sea\" scrawled on a teacher's blackboard at Susan E. Wagner High School. The pro-Hamas battle cry has been widely interpreted to be antisemitic because it urges the eradication of the Jewish state.\n\n\"Among the students were members of the 'Shut It Down For Palestine' coalition, a movement consisting of a multitude of groups calling for a cease-fire in Gaza and an end to Zionism,\" according to the Staten Island Advance. \"Supporters of the Party for Socialism and Liberation bolstered the student-driven rally, with some leading chants and eventually directing students to the Jewish Community Center (JCC) on Manor Road.\"\n\nA parent of a Jewish student at another city high school told Fox News Digital his family received an anonymous call with respect to his daughter. The antisemitic caller allegedly said, \"Stop the genocide. If she can't stop it, she will get hurt.\"\n\nRabbi Levi Katzman, who oversees the Jewish organization Chabad on the South Shore of Staten Island, told Fox News Digital, \"I know students from Wagner and not only Wagner. Students reached out to me and their parents. They feel they are being harassed by pro-Hamas students at the school. \"\n\nHe said one pro-Hamas student said, \"Now would be a good time for the Holocaust.\"\n\n\"The kids feel the faculty is protecting the pro-Hamas students,\" Katzman added.\n\nTRUMP SAYS 4 WORDS ABOUT ANTI-ISRAEL PROTESTS ON COLLEGE CAMPUSES AS ARRESTS SKYROCKET\n\nKatzman believes \"the higher-ups in Susan Wagner brush it under the rug. They make believe they do something, The Department of Education has an intuitional antisemitism problem that trickles down. For such outrageous anitsemitism to be tolerated it is insane. I am sure many of the children won't speak because of retaliation.\"\n\nHe urged that \"the community needs to stand up because this is a government-funded institution.\"\n\nJoe Borelli, the Republican minority Leader of the New York City Council who represents Staten Island's South Shore, told Fox News Digital, \"It is easier to see foolishness in high school kids than it is in our elite students at Columbia University. There is absolutely no reason for any kid to be threatened or harassed on the way to high school. The administration has to step up.\"\n\nBorelli and his Republican colleague, Inna Vernikov, who serves as the minority whip of the New York City Council, where she represents the 48th District in Brooklyn, have spearheaded actions to blunt the mushrooming antisemitism in New York City.\n\n\"Antisemitic harassment, bullying and woke indoctrination have become the norm across our public school system,\" Vernikov told Fox News Digital. \"Swastikas, death threats and Hitler glorification are all a result of a failure to properly educate our youth, and we must assign consequences to bad actors.\n\n\"Statements are welcomed, but action is required. Instead, complainants are consistently ignored or met with indifference.\"\n\nReached by Fox News Digital, a spokesman for David C. Banks, the chancellor of New York City Public Schools, told Fox News Digital, \"The chancellor has repeatedly made it clear that all forms of bigotry have no place in our public schools -- including both antisemitism and Islamophobia. The superintendent is fully engaged with the Wagner High School community and is working to ensure the school climate is safe and welcoming to all students.\"\n\nBIDEN RIPPED FOR DECRYING 'ISLAMOPHOBIA' AMID ANTISEMITIC CAMPUS PROTESTS: 'YET ANOTHER EQUIVOCATION'\n\nMarion Wilson is the Staten Island schools superintendent.\n\nThe chancellor's spokesman said Wilson \"helped the principal develop a comprehensive action plan, connect with groups of students and engage with professional development on creating an inclusive school community. While we do not comment on individual incidents, we do investigate every allegation and follow up with necessary action when needed.\"\n\nThe chancellor's spokesman did not answer a Fox News Digital question about the nature of alleged Islamophobia complaints that were also received. According to an anti-Israel flyer obtained by Fox News Digital that was circulated at Susan E. Wagner, students complained about the Wagner administration not permitting students to \"wear merchandise that's in support of Hamas.\"\n\nThe flyer claimed a double standard because a student was allowed to wear an Israel Defense Forces sweatshirt.\n\nNeither Wilson or the principal of Susan E. Wagner High School responded to Fox News Digital phone and email questions for comment.\n\nIn a statement to Fox News Digital, a spokeswoman for Mayor Eric Adams cited \"some steps we've taken in recent months to combat incidents of antisemitism and Islamophobia in our schools.\"\n\n\"We have continued to expand and update our vetted classroom and curricular resources on topics such as the Middle East crisis, Islamophobia and antisemitism, including a recent antisemitism guide from the Museum of Jewish Heritage,\" the spokeswoman said.\n\n\"On March 13, at a citywide principal conference, all principals received comprehensive safety training on applying the discipline code, uplifting our Respect for All program, and crisis de-escalation.\n\n\"Prior to Respect for All Week in February, we launched additional training to Respect for All liaisons on bullying prevention and incident reporting, which is ongoing. We also re-shared reporting pathways with school communities to ensure allegations of inappropriate conduct or bullying/harassment can be reported and investigated swiftly.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nBrooke Goldstein, the human rights attorney, told Fox New Digital \"the lack of transparency and accountability for highly charged and inaccurate curriculum and classroom content is only one part of the problem.\"\n\n\"Change comes through the legal system and through activism,\" she said. \"Parents who see their children affected by antisemitism at school need to come forward.

In recent weeks, the din of protest has crescendoed, prompting a measured countermovement as Jewish student groups begin to rally in support of Israel and against what they perceive as antisemitism. These actions are emerging as more students from the Jewish community openly question the implications of staying silent amidst the clamor of their fellow students' pro-Palestinian encampments.\n\nDespite their diverse opinions on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, the surge of pro-Palestinian campus protests has stirred Jewish students to gradually coalesce, daring now to more openly assert their stance. At Indiana University Bloomington and near George Washington University, supporters have proudly hoisted Israeli flags. Boston is bracing for its version of solidarity on Friday. This trend marks a stark contrast to the earlier hesitance of many Jewish students to vocalize their concerns, fearing academic and social repercussions amid what some saw as anti-Israel and antisemitic overtones.\n\nThe \"A Rally Against Antisemitism on Campus\" held at George Washington University assembled around 150 participants, according to WABE. Senior Brina Cartagenova shared her personal experience, saying, \"I was scared to put this back on for, like, at least three weeks, and then I finally did the other day,\" referring to her Hebrew-named necklace. \"This type of event definitely helps me feel more comfortable.\"\n\nWhile many pro-Palestinian gatherings on campuses have remained peaceful, instances of violence have marred the overall atmosphere, including a notable clash at the University of California, Los Angeles. The participants carrying Israeli flags, it should be noted, were not clearly identified as instigators. The overlapping narratives of these incidents have underscored the complex interplay of activism, identity, and safety that students are navigating.\n\nIn the wake of the upheaval, Jewish student organizations and allies have aggressively begun to strategize an appropriate response. The Jewish on Campus Student Union, led by students including Jacob Schmeltz from Columbia, has been particularly active, but as Schmeltz told WABE, \"How is it possible to organize a counter protest when many of us are at home or just trying to stay in their dorm rooms because they're afraid of what will happen if they go onto campus?\"\n\nOrganizations such as Hillel and the Israeli-American Coalition have announced further rallies in an attempt to fortify Jewish and pro-Israel students and faculty, ensuring them that they are neither insignificant nor alone. Adam Lehman, president of Hillel International, emphasized that the rallies would both celebrate Jewish student resilience and acknowledge the hardships faced by Palestinians and Israelis alike.\n\nWhile some students at the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill have advocated for a strategy of non-engagement with pro-Palestinian protests, others have made their presence subtly apparent. Eliana Halivni, a Jewish student, mentioned to WABE that some friends have made a point of drawing the Star of David in chalk around the campus, a quiet yet clear declaration: \"so that they know that we're here, even if they can't physically see us.\" It's a nuanced form of countenance, born from a complex weave of history, identity, and longing for recognition.", "source": {"uri": "hoodline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hoodline"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Antisemitism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jews"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Washington_University", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "George Washington University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Israel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Flag of Israel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_University_Bloomington", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indiana University Bloomington"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli\u2013Palestinian_conflict", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Zionism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anti-Zionism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California,_Los_Angeles", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "University of California, Los Angeles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillel_International", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hillel International"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_North_Carolina_at_Chapel_Hill", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_University", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Columbia University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_of_David", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Star of David"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Student", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Student", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Judaism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Judaism", "wgt": 31}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/College_Financing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/College Financing", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Nursing/Students", "label": "dmoz/Health/Nursing/Students", "wgt": 16}], "image": "https://img.hoodline.com/2024/5/jewish-students-rally-for-israel-and-speak-out-against-antisemitism-on-us-campuses-1.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538674", "eventUri": "eng-9538674", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 143, "relevance": 1}

Wagner High School on Staten Island told Fox News Digital that after the terrorist organization Hamas invaded Israel Oct. 7, a Middle Eastern student \"screamed free Palestine\" and could be heard saying \"f---ing Jew\" on the way to school.\n\nThe Jewish students said some anti-Israel students \"claim they are not antisemitic and say Israel should not exist.\" One student of Middle Eastern origin said it would be \"OK if the Holocaust happened,\" according to a witness at the school.\n\nThe Jewish students requested anonymity due to what they claim is an anti-Jewish environment at the school and a fear of reprisals from pro-Hamas students. According to the Jewish student, one student told an Israeli \"that Jewish people and Palestinian people can't coexist,\" and \"kept calling me an Israeli and Zionist.\"\n\nAt a meeting of student leaders at the school, Fox News Digital was told all accusations of antisemitism were rejected by the anti-Israel students. One example given was of anti-Israel agitators deliberately agitating outside the Jewish Community Center. It was also claimed that a student was permitted to wear a Hamas T-shirt at the school.\n\nThe U.S. government has classified Hamas a foreign terrorist organization. The Hamas jihadi movement murdered roughly 1,200 people Oct. 7 in southern Israel, including over 30 Americans. Hamas is holding over 130 people hostage in the Gaza Strip, including U.S. citizens.\n\nMany of the same students, it was claimed, also participated in an anti-Israel rally attended by 200 activists across from Susan E. Wagner high school during school hours in March with antisemitic groups promoting the destruction of the Jewish state.\n\nNYC MAYOR ERIC ADAMS BLASTS STUDENTS' 'VILE SHOW OF ANTISEMITISM' THAT FORCED TEACHER TO HIDE IN OFFICE\n\nFox News Digital obtained a photograph of the pro-Hamas slogan \"Free Palestine. From the River to the Sea\" scrawled on a teacher's blackboard at Susan E. Wagner High School. The pro-Hamas battle cry has been widely interpreted to be antisemitic because it urges the eradication of the Jewish state.\n\n\"Among the students were members of the 'Shut It Down For Palestine' coalition, a movement consisting of a multitude of groups calling for a cease-fire in Gaza and an end to Zionism,\" according to the Staten Island Advance. \"Supporters of the Party for Socialism and Liberation bolstered the student-driven rally, with some leading chants and eventually directing students to the Jewish Community Center (JCC) on Manor Road.\"\n\nA parent of a Jewish student at another city high school told Fox News Digital his family received an anonymous call with respect to his daughter. The antisemitic caller allegedly said, \"Stop the genocide. If she can't stop it, she will get hurt.\"\n\nRabbi Levi Katzman, who oversees the Jewish organization Chabad on the South Shore of Staten Island, told Fox News Digital, \"I know students from Wagner and not only Wagner. Students reached out to me and their parents. They feel they are being harassed by pro-Hamas students at the school. \"\n\nHe said one pro-Hamas student said, \"Now would be a good time for the Holocaust.\"\n\n\"The kids feel the faculty is protecting the pro-Hamas students,\" Katzman added.\n\nTRUMP SAYS 4 WORDS ABOUT ANTI-ISRAEL PROTESTS ON COLLEGE CAMPUSES AS ARRESTS SKYROCKET\n\nKatzman believes \"the higher-ups in Susan Wagner brush it under the rug. They make believe they do something, The Department of Education has an intuitional antisemitism problem that trickles down. For such outrageous anitsemitism to be tolerated it is insane. I am sure many of the children won't speak because of retaliation.\"\n\nHe urged that \"the community needs to stand up because this is a government-funded institution.\"\n\nJoe Borelli, the Republican minority Leader of the New York City Council who represents Staten Island's South Shore, told Fox News Digital, \"It is easier to see foolishness in high school kids than it is in our elite students at Columbia University. There is absolutely no reason for any kid to be threatened or harassed on the way to high school. The administration has to step up.\"\n\nBorelli and his Republican colleague, Inna Vernikov, who serves as the minority whip of the New York City Council, where she represents the 48th District in Brooklyn, have spearheaded actions to blunt the mushrooming antisemitism in New York City.\n\n\"Antisemitic harassment, bullying and woke indoctrination have become the norm across our public school system,\" Vernikov told Fox News Digital. \"Swastikas, death threats and Hitler glorification are all a result of a failure to properly educate our youth, and we must assign consequences to bad actors.\n\n\"Statements are welcomed, but action is required. Instead, complainants are consistently ignored or met with indifference.\"\n\nReached by Fox News Digital, a spokesman for David C. Banks, the chancellor of New York City Public Schools, told Fox News Digital, \"The chancellor has repeatedly made it clear that all forms of bigotry have no place in our public schools -- including both antisemitism and Islamophobia. The superintendent is fully engaged with the Wagner High School community and is working to ensure the school climate is safe and welcoming to all students.\"\n\nBIDEN RIPPED FOR DECRYING 'ISLAMOPHOBIA' AMID ANTISEMITIC CAMPUS PROTESTS: 'YET ANOTHER EQUIVOCATION'\n\nMarion Wilson is the Staten Island schools superintendent.\n\nThe chancellor's spokesman said Wilson \"helped the principal develop a comprehensive action plan, connect with groups of students and engage with professional development on creating an inclusive school community. While we do not comment on individual incidents, we do investigate every allegation and follow up with necessary action when needed.\"\n\nThe chancellor's spokesman did not answer a Fox News Digital question about the nature of alleged Islamophobia complaints that were also received. According to an anti-Israel flyer obtained by Fox News Digital that was circulated at Susan E. Wagner, students complained about the Wagner administration not permitting students to \"wear merchandise that's in support of Hamas.\"\n\nThe flyer claimed a double standard because a student was allowed to wear an Israel Defense Forces sweatshirt.\n\nNeither Wilson or the principal of Susan E. Wagner High School responded to Fox News Digital phone and email questions for comment.\n\nIn a statement to Fox News Digital, a spokeswoman for Mayor Eric Adams cited \"some steps we've taken in recent months to combat incidents of antisemitism and Islamophobia in our schools.\"\n\n\"We have continued to expand and update our vetted classroom and curricular resources on topics such as the Middle East crisis, Islamophobia and antisemitism, including a recent antisemitism guide from the Museum of Jewish Heritage,\" the spokeswoman said.\n\n\"On March 13, at a citywide principal conference, all principals received comprehensive safety training on applying the discipline code, uplifting our Respect for All program, and crisis de-escalation.\n\n\"Prior to Respect for All Week in February, we launched additional training to Respect for All liaisons on bullying prevention and incident reporting, which is ongoing. We also re-shared reporting pathways with school communities to ensure allegations of inappropriate conduct or bullying/harassment can be reported and investigated swiftly.\"\n\nBrooke Goldstein, the human rights attorney, told Fox New Digital \"the lack of transparency and accountability for highly charged and inaccurate curriculum and classroom content is only one part of the problem.\"\n\n\"Change comes through the legal system and through activism,\" she said. \"Parents who see their children affected by antisemitism at school need to come forward. They have rights, and those rights include being free of discrimination and harassment. Teachers have those same rights, and I encourage anyone experiencing Jew hatred to reach out to The Lawfare Project for pro bono help.\"\n\nQuestions sent to congresswoman Nicole Malliotakis, R-N.Y., who represents Staten Island and parts of south Brooklyn, were not returned.\n\nOriginal article source: NYC public schools under fire for failing to address antisemitism: 'Not seeing any action'", "source": {"uri": "aol.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Aol"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestine_(region)", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Palestine (region)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fox News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Zionism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Anti-Zionism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_school", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Secondary school"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Antisemitism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Wagner", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Richard Wagner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrimination", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Discrimination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_school", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "State school"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jews"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staten_Island", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Staten Island"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Staten Island"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susan_E._Wagner_High_School", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Susan E.

He asked how the university would have handled it if \"a barbaric terrorist group drove motorcycles, built hang gliders across the border and massacred 1,200 Muslims, raped Muslim women and killed them at a concert for peace, beheaded Muslim babies, torture Muslim children in front of their parents, killed them, filmed it and uploaded it to Facebook for their families and the world to see, and then that group took over 200 Muslim hostages -- children, babies, grandmothers -- and as we speak, would still have over 100 Muslim hostages including five Muslim Americans. And then a group of students, egged on by faculty at UCLA, formed an encampment to celebrate that terrorist group, those atrocities took over Royce Hall and started blocking Muslim students from moving across campus, started attacking Muslim students and sending them to a hospital, started creating checkpoints with wristbands and asking students, 'Are you Muslim'? And if they said yes, denied them entry into their spaces.\n\n\"Would you tolerate that, Gene Block?\" Ondrasik, who is not Jewish, continued. \"Would you enable that, board of UCLA? Would you assist that administrators, and would you participate and celebrate that, faculty?\"\n\nHe said that if any of them \"had any moral conscience or courage, you would resign, but you won't\" and accused them of creating \"a moral stain on this university that will never be washed clean ... that is your legacy.\"\n\nChoking up, Ondrasik said he is \"so sorry\" to UCLA's Jewish students and other students who haven't been consumed by the antisemitic hate that \"many of your faculty and the radicals that have convened at UCLA have been sharing with these kids ... I am so sorry that you have to deal with this,\" he said, adding that it breaks his heart that \"you have to be fighting for civilization against those who want to tear it down on the front lines.\n\n\"I know you feel abandoned. That is because you have been abandoned by the administrators and president of this school, our school,\" Ondrasik continued. \"But you are not alone. The facts are this: it may not seem like it, but the vast majority of Americans have your back. They support you... and I support you.\"\n\nPlatt said that the current outrage from the Jewish community \"has absolutely nothing to do with Palestinian liberation or the suffering of innocent people in Gaza, or an aversion to peaceful protesting, and anyone out there who characterizes our outrage as such ... is being willfully disingenuous in order to demonize the rest of us as callous, illiberal and evil to justify for themselves, their own callous, illiberal and immoral behavior.\"\n\n\"Our outrage is directed at one thing, and one thing only ... the open, blatant, vicious anti-Jew hate being hurled at random Jewish students and professors, simply for being Jews, or at least not the right kind of Jew,\" he continued, adding that \"Jews are being bullied, harassed, intimidated, assaulted, excluded\" on campus.\n\n\"We are with you. The Jewish community is with you, millions of kind-hearted, clear-eyed, critically thinking fellow Americans are with you, and together we will continue expressing our singular outrage until every shred of anti-Jew hate is scrubbed clean off this campus, and every other college campus across the land.\" - Jonah Platt\n\nPlatt took aim at the masked \"privileged American college students\" and \"paid outside agitators\" who \"openly call for the death of Jews, death of Israel, death of America as they cheer on Islamist terror groups like Hamas, PFLP [Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine] and Hezbollah.\"\n\n\"The only reason you would not be bothered by such hatred is if you believe that kindness, justice and progressive values should not apply to Jews as they do to everyone else, which is the textbook definition of contemporary antisemitism,\" Platt said. \"You do not need Jew-hatred to communicate a pro-Palestine vision, unless of course the Jew-hatred is actually the point.\"\n\nHis message to UCLA Jewish students: \"We are with you. The Jewish community is with you, millions of kind-hearted, clear-eyed, critically thinking fellow Americans are with you, and together we will continue expressing our singular outrage until every shred of anti-Jew hate is scrubbed clean off this campus, and every other college campus across the land.\"\n\nAlso speaking was Jewish student Gabby Lasry, vice president of Bruins for Israel. \"These past several days have been very difficult for Jewish students, and specifically when the encampment went up, Jewish students were incredibly intimidated,\" Lasry said, citing the \"encampment's rhetoric\" and that the encampment violated university policy. \"As Jewish Bruins, and specifically as members of Bruins for Israel, we work very hard to make sure that we follow guidelines, specifically to ensure peace on campus, to ensure equality on campus, and to ensure that all students are safe,\" she continued adding that when Bruins for Israel held a vigil after Oct. 7, they spoke with fire marshals and didn't use candles for the vigils since doing so would violate the university's safety standards.\n\nBut the encampment \"completely limited students' freedom of movement,\" as they only allowed students with wristbands to enter the area, added Lasry. \"These are the same students that unfortunately built the seven-foot large pig right outside of the [UC] Regents' meeting. This pig was incredibly antisemitic, and it hurt a lot of Jewish students on campus and it made us feel incredibly uneasy.\"\n\nAs for the encampment's rhetoric, Lasry said that this included \"calls for the death of all Zionists.\" \"Anti-Zionism is most definitely antisemitism,\" she said. \"Zionism is the right for the Jewish people to self-determinate in their homeland, in the land of Israel. When you agree to the self-determination of one people but you completely the self-determination of another people, you are imposing a double-standard, and that is inherently antisemitic.\"\n\nAdditionally, \"Israel is intrinsically tied to Jewish people's identity. We and Israel are one and the same,\" Lasry argued. \"A lot of the Jewish holidays that we celebrate has to do with the land of Israel, and so to me when you completely deny me access to my homeland, and you call for the eradication of my homeland, then you are calling for the eradication of the state of Israel and you are calling for the eradication of the Jewish people.\"\n\nShe concluded her remarks by pointing out that in difficult times, the Jewish community comes together and \"we hold each other tight through adversity and we persevere and we resist, just as Jewish history has always taught us.\"\n\nUCLA School of Law Professor David Nimmer, who is part of the Jewish Faculty Resilience Group at UCLA, claimed that he heard from numerous Jewish students and faculty members on campus who are dismayed, shocked, scared and some are even in \"terror\" over what has happened at the university. \"It's not only since Oct. 7 that we've had problems,\" he said, pointing out that on Sept. 25 -- Yom Kippur -- the UCLA Medical School required all students to attend a class on \"ethnic sensitivity.\" \"Jewish faculty courteously pointed out the inappropriateness of going forward,\" Nimmer said, \"and the response? No change. The mandatory seminar on ethnic sensitivity proceeded in violation of the sensitivity of Jewish people.\"\n\nRegarding incidents on campus that have happened since Oct. 7, Nimmer pointed to how on Oct. 12, protesters photographed a faculty member and said \"we will find you\"; they also photographed the faculty member's husband. Not long after, Nimmer said, the couple found \"a pile of garbage outside [their house] with a swastika on top.\" He also claimed that on Oct. 25, four or five Jewish medical students refused to participate in a \"mandatory\" walkout put on by protesters during class; the protesters disparaged these students as being \"dogs.\"\n\nAdditionally, one UCLA professor could be seen photographed during a solidarity mission to Israel; some students complained to the department head that they didn't feel safe with this faculty member grading \"their papers, even though the subject matter concerned East LA [Los Angeles],\" Nimmer said. The faculty member's supervisor allegedly urged the faculty member to apologize, prompting the faculty member to ask if the reaction would be the same \"to a Chinese American member of the faculty who happened to visit China\" or if they \"would ask a Black member of the faculty to apologize for being Black.\n\n\"There has been an ocean of hatred of Jews,\" Nimmer added. \"The tides must shift, we must see a fundamentally different situation here at UCLA.\"\n\nAt the beginning of the press conference, AJC Los Angeles Director Richard S. Hirschhaut lambasted the university for failing \"to uphold its most important and sacred responsibility: to ensure the safety, the well-being and the civil rights of all its students.\" \"Violence, harassment and intimidation are not free speech, and have no place on campus or anywhere,\" he added. \"Simply stated: we failed our Jewish students this week.\"\n\nHirschhaut claimed that the AJC has gotten calls from parents and students as to which schools they should go to for college; when a reporter asked what they tell parents and students about UCLA, Hirschhaut said that \"we're taking a little bit of a pause, we're asking them to work with us and let us come back to them with a little bit of a report card.\"\n\nADL Los Angeles Regional Director Jeffrey Abrams similarly criticized the university's \"lack of leadership,\" contending everything that's happened on campus in the past week \"was predictable, which meant it was preventable.\" \"The culture on this campus predating Oct. 7 has allowed antisemitism to flourish, and each opportunity Chancellor Block and the administration had to show leadership, they have failed,\" said Abrams, urging \"consequences\" for those who violated university policy and the law.\n\nHe also mentioned that the ADL recently released a report card on how universities have dealt with campus antisemitism, and there is now \"not good news to add about UCLA.\"\n\nToward the end of the press conference, Ondrasik strapped on an acoustic guitar started his playing his new song \"OK\"; he changed part of the lyrics to say, \"Gene Block, you are not okay, UCLA, evil's on the march.\"\n\n\"UCLA rhymes with okay, so that made it easy,\" Ondrasik laughed while talking the Journal afterwards. \"I'm ashamed at my university and I don't mind naming names when I call out people responsible for this ... Gene Block is the chancellor so it's on him. The faculty, the administration, every single board member, they are responsible for what happened on this university, not just the last week but for years that's been building up to this.\"\n\nAsked if he plans to perform his song \"OK\" at the UCLA campus, Ondrasik said: \"I'm happy to do it\" and that he's been in talks to come to Columbia University and schools in Toronto. However, he pointed out the trickiness of the timing because a lot of schools are almost out for summer, and he has to be invited to campus to perform. \"If a Jewish group of students want me to sit on the quad of Royce Hall and play 'OK,' I'm here for them,\" he said. \"I'm not here to do theatrics, performance art, I'm not here to rip up my diploma, but I'm here to support the Jewish students and I think events like this... letting them know that there's some old UCLA alumni who are not Jewish that have their back, I think that can be significant.\"\n\nOndrasik has heard from various students at USC, NYU and elsewhere that \"they're scared, they're intimidated, they're afraid to go to class\" while others are prepared to \"stand up to the bullies.\" \"It's similar to what I saw in Israel: we've been through this before, we've been surrounded by antisemitic maniacs our whole lives, we know how to deal with them and we'll stand up to them,\" he said. \"So it's this combination of fortitude and fear.\"\n\nThe Five for Fighting singer was performing at a weekly Tel Aviv rally calling for the release of the remaining hostages in Gaza on April 13 when Iran began firing missiles at the Jewish state, and pointed out that \"not one person left\" to go to a safe room despite the situation. \"Performing 'OK' and 'Superman' for the hostage families... you just want to cry. There are no words for that,\" he said. \"Similar to when I performed at the Concert for New York, singing for people in pain, I'm glad I was there... to show them that most of America has their back and they have not been forgotten... they've been forgotten by our president, they've been forgotten by the media, they've been forgotten by many of the voices in America. But I wanted to tell them that there are hundreds of millions of Americans praying for them, praying for the hostages to come home. And I think that gave them a little bit of solace.\"", "source": {"uri": "jewishjournal.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Jewish Journal"}, "authors": [{"uri": "aaron_bandler@jewishjournal.com", "name": "Aaron Bandler", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslims", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Muslims"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_for_Fighting", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Five for Fighting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonah", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jonah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_nationalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Palestinian nationalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Jewish_Committee", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "American Jewish Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California,_Los_Angeles", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "University of California, Los Angeles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Defamation_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Anti-Defamation League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Antisemitism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jews"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illiberal_democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Illiberal democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popular_Front_for_the_Liberation_of_Palestine", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hostage", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hostage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royce_Hall", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Royce Hall"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_D._Block", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gene D.

Those groups included Bend the Arc, a social justice activist group; T'ruah, a rabbinic human rights group; Nexus, a group that offers resources and position papers on Israel and antisemitism; and the Diaspora Alliance, a group that combats antisemitism in conjunction with minority communities whose leaders have harshly criticized Israel's actions.\n\n\"I was really surprised not to see them there,\" Jamie Beran, the Bend the Arc CEO, said in an interview about the missing organizations. Noting that a number of centrist and conservative groups did agree to join the call, she added, \"And I was grateful to be with groups that are taking the safety of students seriously and putting politics aside.\"\n\nNathan Diament, the Orthodox Union's Washington director, did not want to discuss on the record why he and other officials requested the second meeting, except to note that the meeting was initiated by the Orthodox Union and the Anti-Defamation League, and would not have happened otherwise. A letter to Cardona spearhead by the O.U. and the ADL said that while the groups appreciated Cardona's comments condemning antisemitism on campuses, \"they are not at all sufficient to address the crisis.\"\n\n\"We asked for a meeting within a week and we're very appreciative that they responded and made it happen within a week,\" Diament told JTA. \"And so we had the meeting that we asked for.\"\n\nHillel International, the umbrella Jewish campus group, had signed onto the ADL letter and had also been scheduled to attend but did not, according to officials invited to the call, although it was not clear if Hillel was boycotting.\n\nCardona agreed to re-run the call at 1 p.m. for the groups that boycotted the first call. About 20 groups were represented on the first call.\n\nGroups boycotting the first call declined to speak on the record to the Jewish Telegraphic Agency until the second call was completed. One of the officials from this group said the Conference of Presidents had arranged the call and was blindsided by the addition of the progressive groups.\n\n\"It's not a usual thing for a coalition to ask for a meeting for the meeting to be granted and then it turns out a different group of people are also invited,\" said the official, who asked not to be identified to speak frankly about a sensitive matter.\n\nAnother factor was that a number of the progressive groups oppose the enshrining into law of a popular and controversial definition of antisemitism, known by the shorthand IHRA, which they see as too focused on criticism of Israel.\n\nNexus advances a different definition that gives a wider berth to criticism of Israel.\n\n\"There would be more groups which meant that each group would have less time to speak and that it would have less of the feel of a real meeting, as opposed to the government just says what it's saying and we get very little opportunity to talk,\" said the official from one of the boycotting groups. \"Plus, there was a concern that there would be less uniformity among the groups because of the nature of the other groups who were getting on.\"\n\nThe Department of Education did not return requests for comment.\n\nSome officials of the groups that did participate -- including groups that have good relationships with the boycotting groups -- were stunned at their absence for what they regarded as a minor objection. They noted that groups that would be perceived as conservative, including the Orthodox Agudath Israel of America, and centrist, such as the American Jewish Committee, were in attendance. \"It was not even left vs. right, it was just a small group of organizations that decided not to show up,\" a participant said.\n\nAlso attending were liberal-leaning groups that work with the mainstream, such as the Reform movement, the Conservative movement, and the Jewish Council for Public Affairs. J Street, the liberal Jewish Middle East policy group, was represented by its student affiliate, J Street U.\n\nThe AJC's CEO, Ted Deutch delivered opening remarks on behalf of the Jewish groups. Julie Fishman Rayman, the AJC managing director of policy and political affairs, said the meeting, which also included Neera Tanden, Biden's domestic policy adviser, was productive. \"The Secretary and the White House Domestic Policy Advisor acknowledged the fear and anxiety Jews are feeling at this moment and expressed eagerness to address them and the need to do more,\" she said in an email.\n\nThe scramble by the Conference of Presidents to get people off the meeting was so last-minute that Kenneth Marcus, the chairman of the Brandeis Center, logged on for a minute, then wrote \"I have to leave\" in the chat, and logged off, according to two participants.\n\nCardona launched the meeting by noting the diversity of views on the call. The thrust of the appeal from department staffers was that its Office of Civil Rights was overwhelmed with requests to investigate civil rights violations at schools and universities, including antisemitism charges, among others.\n\nThe department had previously emphasized that complaints to the office were a welcome response to allegations of antisemitism on college campuses. An onslaught of complaints has ensued, many filed by Jewish groups and advocates, including the Brandeis Center.\n\nStaffers are handling 50 cases at a time, said Catherine Lhamon, the assistant secretary who runs the Office of Civil Rights, and that it takes months to handle each case.\n\n\"Anyone who cares about Jewish safety on campus needs to support more resources for OCR to actually get through the backlog of Title VI investigations, which is the core tool we have to protecting the civil rights of Jewish students and all students on campus,\" Amy Spitalnick, the JCPA CEO, said in an interview.\n\nKevin Rachlin, the Washington director of Nexus, said the Republicans in Congress now pledging to massively increase oversight of universities as a means of protecting Jewish students also were calling for cuts of up to 25% of the funding for the Office of Civil Rights. \"They clearly don't like OCR, and if they really wanted to combat antisemitism on campuses right now, they will increase this funding,\" he said.\n\nAlso raised was the need to balance free speech on campuses with the rights of Jewish students, some of whom have complained of being targeted and harassed by pro-Palestinian protesters, Beran said.\n\n\"The groups were really measured, saying that they need to protect free speech and students need to be protected from harassment,\" she said of participants on the call.\n\nHours before the call, Cardona sent out a Dear Colleague letter to university presidents decrying reports of antisemitic harassment on campuses. \"I am particularly disturbed by the sharp rise in antisemitism targeting Jewish students on some college campuses,\" he said.\n\nDiament said that on the second call, Cardona and others raised funding for OCR, which the groups appreciated. Diament said the groups pressed the department to provide greater clarity to universities on what constitutes antisemitism.\n\nOnly one group, the National Council of Jewish Women, was represented on both calls.", "source": {"uri": "jweekly.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "J."}, "authors": [{"uri": "ron_kampeas@jweekly.com", "name": "Ron Kampeas", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}],

Byron Donalds, R-Fla., and The Lawfare Project Executive Director Brooke Goldstein discuss the anti-Israel protests that continue to disrupt colleges across the country on 'Hannity.'\n\nA 110% rise in the number of antisemitic incidents in New York last year set a disturbing new record for the Empire State, and 60% of the outbreaks of Jew hatred unfolded in New York City.\n\nThe exploding levels of antisemitism were revealed last month by the Anti-Defamation League and have implications for recent incidents of anti-Jewish rhetoric and behavior in the city's public school system.\n\n\"The failure by the school system to impose consequences on Jew hatred is a major factor in the increased bigotry we see every day,\" said Brooke Goldstein, a human rights attorney, executive director of The Lawfare Project and founder of the End Jew Hatred movement.\n\nNoting recent antisemitic events, Goldstein demanded more needed to be done.\n\nNYC COUNCILWOMAN BLASTS FAILURE OF 'MODERN PROGRESSIVISM' AFTER ANTI-ISRAEL HIGH SCHOOL RIOT\n\n\"Whether at Hillcrest High School, where a Jewish teacher was reportedly targeted and hunted down just for being Jewish, or at Origins High School, where faculty reported a pattern of harassment and discrimination lasting for years, or now at schools in Staten Island, we are not seeing any action.\"\n\nJewish students and their parents, along with local politicians and community leaders, are raising alarm bells over shocking outbreaks of antisemitism in the New York City public school system.\n\nThey spoke with Fox News Digital about what they say are serious acts of anti-Jewish hatred coupled with a public school administration that has turned a blind eye to growing antisemitism.\n\nJewish students at Susan E. Wagner High School on Staten Island told Fox News Digital that after the terrorist organization Hamas invaded Israel Oct. 7, a Middle Eastern student \"screamed free Palestine\" and could be heard saying \"f---ing Jew\" on the way to school.\n\nThe Jewish students said some anti-Israel students \"claim they are not antisemitic and say Israel should not exist.\" One student of Middle Eastern origin said it would be \"OK if the Holocaust happened,\" according to a witness at the school.\n\nThe Jewish students requested anonymity due to what they claim is an anti-Jewish environment at the school and a fear of reprisals from pro-Hamas students. According to the Jewish student, one student told an Israeli \"that Jewish people and Palestinian people can't coexist,\" and \"kept calling me an Israeli and Zionist.\"\n\nAt a meeting of student leaders at the school, Fox News Digital was told all accusations of antisemitism were rejected by the anti-Israel students. One example given was of anti-Israel agitators deliberately agitating outside the Jewish Community Center. It was also claimed that a student was permitted to wear a Hamas T-shirt at the school.\n\nThe U.S. government has classified Hamas a foreign terrorist organization. The Hamas jihadi movement murdered roughly 1,200 people Oct. 7 in southern Israel, including over 30 Americans. Hamas is holding over 130 people hostage in the Gaza Strip, including U.S. citizens.\n\nMany of the same students, it was claimed, also participated in an anti-Israel rally attended by 200 activists across from Susan E. Wagner high school during school hours in March with antisemitic groups promoting the destruction of the Jewish state.\n\nNYC MAYOR ERIC ADAMS BLASTS STUDENTS' 'VILE SHOW OF ANTISEMITISM' THAT FORCED TEACHER TO HIDE IN OFFICE\n\nFox News Digital obtained a photograph of the pro-Hamas slogan \"Free Palestine. From the River to the Sea\" scrawled on a teacher's blackboard at Susan E. Wagner High School. The pro-Hamas battle cry has been widely interpreted to be antisemitic because it urges the eradication of the Jewish state.\n\n\"Among the students were members of the 'Shut It Down For Palestine' coalition, a movement consisting of a multitude of groups calling for a cease-fire in Gaza and an end to Zionism,\" according to the Staten Island Advance. \"Supporters of the Party for Socialism and Liberation bolstered the student-driven rally, with some leading chants and eventually directing students to the Jewish Community Center (JCC) on Manor Road.\"\n\nA parent of a Jewish student at another city high school told Fox News Digital his family received an anonymous call with respect to his daughter. The antisemitic caller allegedly said, \"Stop the genocide. If she can't stop it, she will get hurt.\"\n\nRabbi Levi Katzman, who oversees the Jewish organization Chabad on the South Shore of Staten Island, told Fox News Digital, \"I know students from Wagner and not only Wagner. Students reached out to me and their parents. They feel they are being harassed by pro-Hamas students at the school. \"\n\nHe said one pro-Hamas student said, \"Now would be a good time for the Holocaust.\"\n\n\"The kids feel the faculty is protecting the pro-Hamas students,\" Katzman added.\n\nTRUMP SAYS 4 WORDS ABOUT ANTI-ISRAEL PROTESTS ON COLLEGE CAMPUSES AS ARRESTS SKYROCKET\n\nKatzman believes \"the higher-ups in Susan Wagner brush it under the rug. They make believe they do something, The Department of Education has an intuitional antisemitism problem that trickles down. For such outrageous anitsemitism to be tolerated it is insane. I am sure many of the children won't speak because of retaliation.\"\n\nHe urged that \"the community needs to stand up because this is a government-funded institution.\"\n\nJoe Borelli, the Republican minority Leader of the New York City Council who represents Staten Island's South Shore, told Fox News Digital, \"It is easier to see foolishness in high school kids than it is in our elite students at Columbia University. There is absolutely no reason for any kid to be threatened or harassed on the way to high school. The administration has to step up.\"\n\nBorelli and his Republican colleague, Inna Vernikov, who serves as the minority whip of the New York City Council, where she represents the 48th District in Brooklyn, have spearheaded actions to blunt the mushrooming antisemitism in New York City.\n\n\"Antisemitic harassment, bullying and woke indoctrination have become the norm across our public school system,\" Vernikov told Fox News Digital. \"Swastikas, death threats and Hitler glorification are all a result of a failure to properly educate our youth, and we must assign consequences to bad actors.\n\n\"Statements are welcomed, but action is required. Instead, complainants are consistently ignored or met with indifference.\"\n\nReached by Fox News Digital, a spokesman for David C. Banks, the chancellor of New York City Public Schools, told Fox News Digital, \"The chancellor has repeatedly made it clear that all forms of bigotry have no place in our public schools -- including both antisemitism and Islamophobia. The superintendent is fully engaged with the Wagner High School community and is working to ensure the school climate is safe and welcoming to all students.\"\n\nBIDEN RIPPED FOR DECRYING 'ISLAMOPHOBIA' AMID ANTISEMITIC CAMPUS PROTESTS: 'YET ANOTHER EQUIVOCATION'\n\nMarion Wilson is the Staten Island schools superintendent.\n\nThe chancellor's spokesman said Wilson \"helped the principal develop a comprehensive action plan, connect with groups of students and engage with professional development on creating an inclusive school community. While we do not comment on individual incidents, we do investigate every allegation and follow up with necessary action when needed.\"\n\nThe chancellor's spokesman did not answer a Fox News Digital question about the nature of alleged Islamophobia complaints that were also received. According to an anti-Israel flyer obtained by Fox News Digital that was circulated at Susan E. Wagner, students complained about the Wagner administration not permitting students to \"wear merchandise that's in support of Hamas.\"\n\nThe flyer claimed a double standard because a student was allowed to wear an Israel Defense Forces sweatshirt.\n\nWilson did not respond to Fox News Digital email and phone messages. The principal, Susan E. Wagner, did not answer Fox News Digital press queries.\n\nIn a statement to Fox News Digital, a spokeswoman for Mayor Eric Adams cited \"some steps we've taken in recent months to combat incidents of antisemitism and Islamophobia in our schools.\"\n\n\"We have continued to expand and update our vetted classroom and curricular resources on topics such as the Middle East crisis, Islamophobia and antisemitism, including a recent antisemitism guide from the Museum of Jewish Heritage,\" the spokeswoman said.\n\n\"On March 13, at a citywide principal conference, all principals received comprehensive safety training on applying the discipline code, uplifting our Respect for All program, and crisis de-escalation.\n\n\"Prior to Respect for All Week in February, we launched additional training to Respect for All liaisons on bullying prevention and incident reporting, which is ongoing.

Last year, the Jewish Federation voted to start the Palm Beach County Center to Combat Antisemitism & Hatred. It recently organized a visit to Israel of leaders from local non-Jewish communities.\n\n\"Combatting antisemitism is not an issue just for the Jewish community to address,\" Michael Hoffman, president and CEO of the Jewish Federation said in an April interview with The Palm Beach Post. \"We need allies in the greater community representing all faiths, all ethnic groups, elected officials, faith leaders (and) law enforcement.\"\n\nMenorah restored: Hundreds gather at Juno sand sculpture destroyed with swastika\n\nADL report: Palm Beach County topped Florida in 2023 antisemitic incidents\n\nA recent audit by the Anti-Defamation League showed that Palm Beach County had the highest number of reported acts of antisemitism in Florida last year, with 84 incidents.\n\nBomb threats against Jewish institutions, the distribution of extremist literature in residential communities and acts of vandalism were contributing factors, the ADL report said. Florida had the fourth-highest number of reported incidents last year among all states.\n\nA recent report by USA Today showed that Jewish Americans across various states have expressed fear and frustration amid a widely reported surge in antisemitism.\n\nTed Deutch, a former U.S. congressman from Boca Raton who now serves as CEO of the American Jewish Committee, said many Jewish Americans are taking added precautions in their daily activities, including limiting posts on social media and altering what they wear and where they go in public for fear of being harassed or intimated.\n\nHe said the organization's own survey showed that 63 percent of Jewish Americans said the status of Jews in the U.S. is less secure, and that 46 percent have altered their behavior out of fear of antisemitism.\n\n\"That's something that should be alarming to the community as a whole,\" Deutch said. \"What we've seen these last few months on college campuses is further evidence of that.\n\n\"What happens around the rest of the country impacts what happens in Palm Beach County, because there are so many young people from Palm Beach County who attend colleges all across the states.\"\n\nADL CEO Jonathan Greenblatt cited the Oct. 7 terrorist attacks in Israel by Hamas and the ensuing military conflict as significant factors in the sharp rise in antisemitic incidents across the U.S. The conflict has sparked protests on college campuses across the country in recent weeks over the deaths of tens of thousands of innocent Palestinian civilans in Gaza -- including at the University of Florida, University of South Florida and University of North Florida.\n\nArden, of the county's Jewish Federation, said the roots of antisemitism run deeper than that exposed by the current military conflict in Gaza.\n\n\"Antisemitism didn't start on Oct. 7, and it didn't start as a result of the war,\" she said. \"The war just accelerated it.\"\n\nAbout a dozen people have been arrested over the past week during on-campus protests at several Florida universities. Deutch said he supports protesting as a fundamental right, but added that threats, harassment and disrupting campus functions should not be tolerated.\n\n\"When Jewish students are blocked from entering campus, when professors celebrate the mass murder of Jews, or students march wearing headbands of terrorist groups, that's not free speech,\" he said. \"That's threatening behavior that is meant to intimidate and silence an entire community.\"", "source": {"uri": "eu.palmbeachpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "eu.palmbeachpost.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

I never thought I'd be afraid to invite my parents to my graduation", "body": "\"You can come to New York to celebrate my graduation, but I won't bring you to campus\" I wrote to my parents earlier this week, the morning after protesters occupied Columbia University's Hamilton Hall.\n\nI'm an Israeli Journalism M.S. candidate at Columbia, where I also earned my B.A. in Sociology and Theater Studies. The university has been my home for several years now, but living here hasn't always been comfortable. As a humanities student, it was always clear that being from Israel was, to say the least, not cool.\n\nBut it was never dangerous, until now.\n\nOver the last two weeks, the not-so-secret anti-Israel undercurrents on campus have swelled into a flood. Israeli students, many of them my friends, have been called Nazis. Crowds have chanted \"we don't want no two states, we want all of it\" and \"we don't want no Zionists here.\" A protest leader was revealed to have previously said on Instagram live that Zionists don't deserve to live.\n\nI'm not the first person in my family to have antisemitism abruptly interfere with my education. My paternal grandmother dreamed of academia from her youngest days. But the rise of the Nazis saw her expelled from high school for being Jewish. She was rendered a refugee shortly thereafter, and while she survived the Holocaust, she never got even her high school diploma.\n\nIn 2017, I moved to New York City with the intent of living the dream life denied her. I wore a ring that used to belong to her at my college graduation, and wished she were still around to see my sisters and myself strive toward the dreams she cherished.\n\nAfter all that, it was so agonizing to me to ask my father -- her son -- to not attend my graduation.\n\nBut given that Columbia's president has asked police to remain on campus until after graduation, there seems good reason to expect further violence. I cannot put my parents at that kind of risk.\n\nAnd even if there is no violence, my parents should not come all the way from Israel to attend a graduation ceremony drowned by calls for their murder. Those who chant \"From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free\" are engaging in a whitewashed version of an Arabic slogan that explicitly calls for an end to the Jewish presence in Israel: \"From water to water Palestine shall be Arab\" -- which was also chanted in its Arabic original on campus.\n\nTo be sure, Columbia protesters have repeatedly claimed that they're anti-Zionists, not antisemitic, pointing for evidence to the Jewish students taking active part in the movement. And there's a legitimate argument against equating antisemitism with anti-Zionism: not all Jews see Israel as a part of their identity, and Jews must be free to demand divestment without being painted as self-hating Jews or traitors.\n\nBut the mere presence of Jewish students at a protest doesn't mean the protest movement at large hasn't dangerously blurred the line between anti-Zionism and antisemitism.\n\nA flat villanization of Zionism creates a rhetorical barrier of entry for Jewish safety -- it is as if protesters are demanding Jews either renounce their connection to Israel, or get out. With untold generations of our ancestors praying for \"next year in a rebuilt Jerusalem,\" that's a connection that many, if not most, Jewish people see as intrinsic to their identities. Why should we be forced to choose between our heritage and support of Palestine?\n\nThere are so many Israelis, some of whom are students at Columbia, who yearn for space to protest the Israeli government's extremism, the expansion of the occupation, fatal settler violence and the current bloodshed in Gaza. But they cannot do so in a hostile place where the ideology of \"by all means necessary\" was readily adopted and where protesters are reluctant to condemn the Oct. 7 massacre -- some even praise it -- or call for the return of hostages.\n\nImagine if, instead of unilaterally condemning everyone who harbors some Zionist inclinations, the organizers of these campus protests set up areas for Israeli and Jewish students to engage in productive dialogue with Palestinian students and their supporters. Many of us can imagine -- and deeply wish for -- a future in which the movement of Jewish self-determination can co-exist with the Palestinian movement for self-determination.\n\nWhat if there were a student group of Israeli and Palestinian students who protested against extreme forces on both sides of the fence, and worked together to cultivate a shared narrative of accountability for past violence, acknowledging each other's trauma? What extreme factions among Israelis and Palestinians fear the most is not hate and violence, but peaceful leaders. The rhetoric we've heard on campus since October is a gift for them both.\n\nThe Columbia encampment featured signs with slogans like \"whoever is in solidarity with our corpses but not our rockets is a hypocrite and not one of us.\" Solidarity with Hamas' rockets means unconditional support for the political agenda these rockets serve: per Hamas's own 1988 covenant, which the organization adjusted but has never refuted, Zionism cannot be separated from world Jewry. And so all Jews, everywhere, are legitimate targets for violence.\n\nHow then, could even the most avidly anti-Zionist Jewish students regard such signs as anything less than a demand for their blood?\n\nUsually, I'm a staunch supporter of student protests. My maternal grandfather risked his student visa to protest Vietnam on the UC Berkeley campus. I was raised to believe that student dissent is crucial for democracy.\n\nBut what we've seen at Columbia isn't dissent. It's protesting against one genocide by calling for another. As a Jewish student, the lack of nuance in this movement prevents me from believing it's exclusively an expression of care for Palestine and Palestinians. Hatred of the Jewish state is baked into every action the protesters have taken; at what point must we admit that hatred for Jews is part of what's driving this movement? The hate speech we've heard cannot be accepted into the sacred realm of free speech.\n\nI, like many of my friends, feel an absolute rage toward the Israeli government for its brutal ideology of prioritizing land expansion over prevention of bloodshed. But the hate we are encountering, has forced many of us into an existential mode of defense; it has made us less able to speak out for the principles we do share with the protesters.", "source":

In December of 2023, the US House Committee on Education opened a formal investigation into Harvard, MIT, and the University of Pennsylvania over their response to rising levels of antisemitism.\n\nIn March, students sue MIT for alleged complicity in antisemitism on campus. On April 22, police, at the request of the University's president, entered the campus of Columbia University to disperse a protest and conduct mass arrests of students. These are just a few of the many incidents documented over the last several months, including universities such as Cornell, Cooper Union, Boston University, Georgia Institute of Technology, Wellesley, Stanford, and UC Berkeley. According to the Washington Post, demonstrations involving students and faculty have resulted in more than 2,000 arrests.\n\nThe conflict in Israel has created serious concerns for the Jewish student community across the country. Hillel International research indicates four out of every five Jewish students say the situation in Israel and Gaza is affecting them. Two out of every three Jewish students are sad. Over half of Jewish students are scared. More than one in three Jewish students say they have needed to hide their Jewish identity.\n\nThis issue is not only restrained to university campuses. According to the Anti-Defamation League, in the first month following Hamas's terror attack, \"antisemitic incidents in the U.S. increased by 316 percent compared to the same time last year.\"\n\nIn April, students from Brown, Columbia, and Rutgers held a press conference, joined by leadership from Columbia/Barnard Hillel, Hillel International, American Jewish Committee (AJC), and UJA-Federation of New York, to demand more protection for Jewish students at these universities. Said Jillian Lederman, a Brown University student and the Executive Chair of Hillel International's Israel Leadership Network, \"We came to college to participate in vibrant, challenging, and equally-accessible learning environments. It is time for colleges and universities in the United States of America to decide whether they are still capable of meeting this description.\" Ted Deutch, CEO of AJC, made his stance clear,\n\nWe will not accept conditions that are so fraught for Jewish students that they rightfully fear attending classes or going to the library on campus. And we will not accept the idea that university events - graduation ceremonies - should be canceled rather than taking action to ensure that these events go on.\n\nProtests around the country have caused college administrations to reconsider their commencement proceedings.\n\nAmnesty International ended their press release with the following statement from Paul O'Brien, Executive Director of Amnesty International USA\n\nAdministrations have a responsibility to address the documented incidents of antisemitic hate and discrimination by individual protesters, as well as violence, anti-Arab and Islamophobic hate from counter-protesters whenever they occur. However, the actions of the few should not be used to characterize the protests generally, be used as pretext to shut down legitimate and peaceful dissent, or as a justification to violate the right of students to peacefully assemble.\n\nThe day after Amnesty International's press release, the ACLU of Indiana filed a lawsuit against Indiana University for First Amendment violations of student protesters.", "source": {"uri": "jurist.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "JURIST"}, "authors": [{"uri": "new_england_law@jurist.org", "name": "New England Law", "type": "author", "isAgency": false},

University of Sydney's encampment is nearing its third week.\n\nBut tensions are rising over the camps, with the shadow minister for education, Sarah Henderson, on Monday calling on the education minister, Jason Clare, to resign unless he explicitly banned hate speech on university campuses.\n\nSpeaking at a press conference over the weekend, Clare said calls of \"from the river to the sea\" and chants referencing \"intifada\" that had been common at the protests could be interpreted as meaning the annihilation of Israel or \"the opposite\".\n\nIntifada is an Arabic word that is understood to mean a civil uprising in the Palestinian context, while \"from the river to the sea\" has been interpreted as calling for the dismantling of the Jewish state.\n\nHenderson labelled it a \"train-wreck press conference\" that showed an \"appalling failure of leadership\". On Monday morning, Henderson met with a second roundtable of Jewish university students, staff and community leaders in Sydney, where she heard \"terrible stories\" of intimidation, harassment and threats to safety.\n\nHenderson said the situation was \"particularly bad\" at the University of Sydney, alleging it had failed to uphold codes of conduct and shut down the encampment, \"fuelling harassment and intimidation of Jewish and non-Jewish students\".\n\nA spokesperson for the University of Sydney said: \"As we've consistently told our students and staff, if we find members of our community have violated our codes of conduct we won't hesitate to take disciplinary action as appropriate.\n\n\"We've increased our security profile across campus for the time being as a precautionary measure and our protective services team is operating 24/7 if any students or staff feel unsafe.\"\n\nThe vice-president of the Australasian Union of Jewish Students (AUJS), Zac Morris, said he had met with the University of Sydney on multiple occasions and was disheartened by their response to growing concerns from Jewish staff and students.\n\n\"Students are afraid to go to class, they're missing lectures and tutorials,\" he said. \"They're being filmed, followed, intimidated.\"\n\nMorris pointed to a whiteboard displayed at the camp where protesters wrote \"globalise the intifada\" as well as now-covered graffiti of the words \"Zionists = Nazis\" on campus.\n\nHe also called out offensive messaging from a left-leaning Sydney University group, associated with the camp, which posted on social media last year that as socialists they \"unconditionally support ... Hamas' right to resist Israel's occupation by any means necessary\".\n\n\"This situation is the worst it's been,\" he said. \"It's terrifying. We respect freedom of speech but there is a line that should be clear. Chanting for intifada is traumatic for us, however it is intended.\n\n\"Jewish students [on] campus have loved ones who were victims of the suicide bombings of the second intifada [in the 2000s].\"\n\nSpeaking on the ABC on Monday, Clare reiterated that the community, including politicians, needed to \"lower the temperature\" to \"try and keep our country together\".\n\n\"It's obvious that there are students, Jewish students, who feel that they're afraid to go to university, and that's not on,\" he said.\n\nPointed again to the term \"intifada\", Clare hardened his stance, rejecting that the word was acceptable to use at protests.\n\n\"Anything that stokes fear at universities is intolerable, and I think I've made that clear,\" he said.\n\nThe Zionist Federation of Australia's CEO, Alon Cassuto, said the situation for Jewish students had \"dramatically worsened\" since 7 October.\n\n\"We told universities last year that two-thirds of Jewish students had faced antisemitism on campus,\" he said.\n\n\"Since that time ... Jewish students have become too frightened to admit their Jewishness to their peers. They are staying away from campus.\n\n\"The encampments are a physical, threatening presence telling Jews quite clearly that expressing their ethnic or religious identity on campus is unwelcome, and dangerous.\"\n\nStudents for Palestine organiser Shovan Bhattarai said the protest movement \"unequivocally opposes discrimination and oppression\".\n\n\"A lot of Jewish students, some of the key organisers of the camps ... totally disagree with their Jewish identity being weaponised,\" she said.\n\nBhattarai said students would be prepared to \"lower the temperature\", as Clare has urged, when the number of \"bombs raining down on Gaza have lowered\".\n\n\"This situation taking place right now in Gaza is escalating,\" she said. \"Things are getting worse. The death toll is rising ... the voices to stand up for Palestine should rise.\"\n\nThe Jewish Council of Australia's executive officer, Dr Max Kaiser, said protesters were \"taking a brave and peaceful stand against genocide\", adding many Jews had been part of the campus encampments.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [{"uri":

The protesters at Hamilton Hall were a threat to Jewish students like me", "body": "Many of my peers at Columbia University, where I am a freshman enrolled in a joint degree program with the Jewish Theological Seminary, have spent the past few days expressing fury over the end of the brief occupation of Hamilton Hall by pro-Palestinian protesters. Police were called in Tuesday night; in a press release, Columbia University Apartheid Divest called their arrest of more than 100 protesters within and outside the building \"shocking police violence\" that \"broke every written and unwritten rule of university norms.\"\n\nWhat they miss: This occupation, for some Jewish students like myself, showcased just how committed our classmates are to not listening to alternative perspectives. If it had been allowed to continue, many of my Jewish classmates would have continued to live in fear knowing that protesters who sought the destruction of Israel had not only hijacked a building in the heart of campus, but also had access to other buildings including freshman dorms and dining halls.\n\nAs it is, it will take a long, long time to begin rebuilding trust between visibly Jewish, Zionist students like me, and the rest of the Columbia community.\n\nThis occupation -- during which protesters used Hamilton Hall to display a giant \"Intifada\" banner and reportedly held a facilities worker hostage -- did not emerge from a vacuum. Instead, it was the culmination of a months-long failure to engage in rational deliberation and meaningful dialogue by my protesting classmates, whose demands included that Columbia divest from Israel and cut ties with Israeli academic institutions.\n\nThey repeatedly demonstrated an inability to engage in meaningful discourse with Jewish, pro-Israel voices on campus. They instead embraced, and amplified, a culture in which many students actively avoid dialogue that seeks to understand -- and came to see that avoidance as a virtue.\n\nThat culture first asserted itself only days after the horrific Hamas terrorist attacks of Oct. 7, when a large pro-Palestinian rally took over the center of campus, before Israel had initiated any military response. Many of my Jewish friends, including myself, felt deeply alarmed by the protest, which failed to condemn Hamas's terrorism.\n\nA Jewish student went on the record saying they felt \"highly disturbed\" while a professor explained that they were \"afraid\" to come to their own campus. Later that same day, many of my friends were forced to shelter in place at the Columbia Hillel after the same demonstrators walked right past it.\n\nThe organizers of that protest -- including Jewish Voice for Peace -- missed the perfect opportunity to engage and empathize with Jewish students in need of support after seeing close to 1,200 people massacred in Israel. By doing so, they initiated a self-righteous cycle whose participants consistently failed to extend empathy and support to many Jewish students in desperate need of it.\n\nIn the ensuing months, the repeated use of chants such as \"Intifada revolution,\" \"From the river to the sea,\" and \"We don't want no Zionists here\" have continued to make me and many other Jews feel alienated on campus, and unwelcome at our own university.\n\nIn all of these instances, organizers had the opportunity to directly engage with Jewish students who feel a close connection to Israel, and clarify their intentions behind such chants. Yet without such dialogue, a wider chasm has grown between the two camps.\n\nThis disregard for any attempt at reconciliation was perhaps best observed at the University's so-called \"Day of Dialogue\" in February, during which lectures by both pro-Palestine and pro-Israel speakers were to be given and discussed in small discussion groups. The program was readily welcomed by several friends and I at the Jewish Theological Seminary, who hoped to see more respect for and interest in our pro-Israel beliefs.\n\nBut Columbia University Apartheid Divest -- the student group that drove the recent wave of protests at the university -- announced a boycott of the event, declaring on their Instagram that, \"Students say NO to normalization,\" with groups of students chanting and marching directly outside of the room where the symposium was taking place.\n\nThese attempts at silencing not just pro-Israel perspectives, but perspectives that acknowledge the nuance of the situation in the Middle East, not only further polarized the Columbia community, but deliberately prevented anyone who sympathized with the pro-Palestine cause from humanizing me and many of my classmates.\n\nCampus organizers didn't just actively avoid dialogue that, in the words of the University, was meant to foster a \"shared commitment to mutual understanding and respect.\" They disrupted it, just as they have disrupted speeches by Hillary Clinton, who is pro-Israel, on campus, and just as they attempted to disrupt the testimony of President Minouche Shafik at Congress. Each of these efforts has further radicalized the protest movement.\n\nAt some point, I stopped being surprised by seeing stickers that read \"Zionists are terrorists,\" trucks with signs that read \"Israel is the new Nazi Germany,\" and demonstration leaders who say \"Zionists don't deserve to live\" around campus. Protesters have become drunk off their own rhetoric, and as dialogue with Jewish Zionists has only been further avoided, we have only become further vilified by them.\n\nBy shutting out Jewish, pro-Israel voices on campus, too many protesters have been guided down a path of extremism; increasingly threatening forms of rhetoric have become the norm. Their occupation of Hamilton Hall, to me, represents not a proud advocacy for free speech but the seriousness of a rift that has increasingly made me feel unsafe on campus.", "source": {"uri": "forward.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Forward"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_University", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Columbia University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jews"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamilton_Hall_(Columbia_University)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hamilton Hall (Columbia University)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_nationalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Palestinian nationalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_Theological_Seminary_of_America", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jewish Theological Seminary of America"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Intifada", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Second Intifada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apartheid", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Apartheid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft_hijacking", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aircraft hijacking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_brutality", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Police brutality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zionism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Zionism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stay-at-home_order", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stay-at-home order"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_Voice_for_Peace", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jewish Voice for Peace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massacre", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Massacre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Floyd_protests", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "George Floyd protests"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_polarization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Political polarization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_norm", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social norm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Clinton", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hillary Clinton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radicalization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Radicalization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nazi Germany"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boycott", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boycott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_speech", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Freedom of speech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhetoric", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rhetoric"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Middle East"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Norway"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Norway"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Judaism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Judaism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 75}], "image": "https://forward.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/columbia-hamilton-hall-jewish-students-zionist-GettyImages-2150407631.jpg?_t=1714775034", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538674", "eventUri": "eng-9538674", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-10-07", "textStart": 1969, "textEnd": 1975}], "sentiment": -0.2313725490196078, "wgt": 135, "relevance": 1}

The NYPD was scheduled to remain on campus through graduation at the request of Columbia's administration, with the campus only open to students living in dormitories and essential university personnel.\n\nOn Monday, however, graduation was officially canceled. It plans to hold smaller, in-person ceremonies for each of its schools.\n\n\"I don't want to be afraid to go to my classes, to go to a dining hall and just to eat lunch or learn in peace,\" said Singerman, who started carrying pepper spray the week before the protests were shut down.\n\n\"I think that safety has to be the No. 1 priority and making sure that these encampments and these unsanctioned protests don't happen again,\" he told JNS.\n\n'We're just trying to get an education'\n\nEllie Campbell Green, a doctoral student at New York University focusing on Holocaust theology and religious Zionism, told JNS she believes that the campus protests there will continue into the next semester. At least 13 people were arrested by police at NYU on Friday morning during a clearing out of an encampment there.\n\n\"I believe that the leaders of these protests are completely committed to continuing this rhetoric into the next semester. And that's going to be the challenge,\" she said. \"I don't think that the university should look away over the summer. I don't think they should stop acting. I don't think they should be passive just because students have gone home.\"\n\nSingerman told JNS that the increased police presence on campus is a start. Following the police operation on April 30, the NYPD has kept a significant number of officers in and around the area.\n\n\"It makes me feel like I can walk confidently and proudly,\" said Singerman, who dons a kippah and has a finger-ring grip on his cell phone emblazoned with the Israeli flag. While Singerman says he has not personally been attacked, a friend of his was \"shoved into a wall for having an Israel flag\" during the spring semester.\n\nHe said other Jewish friends have been accosted while walking around campus, with agitators telling them to \"go back to Poland.\"\n\n\"Jewish students should not have to feel that way on campus in New York at a place where we're paying a lot of money to go to, especially when we're just trying to get an education,\" Singerman said.\n\n'These decisions have lasting impacts'\n\nCampbell Green says that while NYU president Linda Mills has \"been largely proactive\" and recognizes \"the antisemitism that has really taken root\" there, the university's open design -- self-referred to as a campus without walls -- has allowed outsiders to infect the environment and radicalize students during protests there.\n\n\"I'm hoping that (Mills) is going to continue to do as much as she can, and, if necessary, bring in the NYPD if things do escalate,\" said Campbell Green. \"But otherwise, to try and ensure that these protests stay within the bounds of what is free speech and remain peaceful.\"\n\nShe said it is necessary to include Jewish and Israeli students in negotiations with protesters and in planning for any relevant policy changes. Academic institutions like Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill., and Brown University in Providence, R.I., have come under heavy criticism for caving to protesters' demands on issues like discussing divestment from Israel and the cancellation or other changes to joint programs in partnership with Israeli universities.\n\n\"These decisions have really lasting impacts. Even if some Jewish students feel like they need to tolerate what's happening, for very different reasons, a lot of Israeli students are being completely ignored,\" said Campbell Green.\n\nShe said the protests are \"being perceived as legitimate if it's anti-Israeli, which I also think is just crazy because that's also completely discriminatory, even if it's against Israel and not against all Jews.\"\n\nNow those students need to stew over whether or not the situation will improve or if they need to find a new educational home. Yeshiva University in New York City and Brandeis University in Waltham, Mass., have invited Jewish students affected by the protests to transfer to their institutions without the loss of accumulated credits or risk of delayed enrollment, as have some Christian colleges and universities in Israel.\n\nWhile Campbell Green calls it a great offer by these other schools, she lamented that it's come to this.\n\n\"I don't want to be dramatic, but it's a kind of self-ghettoization, where Jewish students can only go to Jewish institutions,\" she said. \"It's great if those universities want to do that. But I don't know if that's something that we want the state of affairs to be.\"", "source": {"uri": "jns.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Jewish News Syndicate"}, "authors": [{"uri":

The crowd included a mix of students, rabbis, local Jewish residents and others, some waving half-and-half Israeli and American flags and others holding pictures of hostages taken by the terrorist group Hamas. Most of the crowd looked to be middle-aged or older.\n\nAs the pro-Israel group continued chanting, about a dozen pro-Palestinian counter-protesters, mostly U students, assembled on the other side holding Palestinian flags and a sign reading \"We are witnessing a genocide in real time.\"\n\nDuring the competing chants, one of the pro-Israel demonstrators holding a large sign began walking towards a pro-Palestinian student holding a megaphone, forcing her to back up. Some pro-Palestinian demonstrators intervened and shouted for the man with the sign to move back, before pro-Israel protesters stepped in to separate them.\n\nTwo U police officers showed up a short time later and positioned themselves between the groups to prevent further altercations.\n\nU student Jonathan Greenspan, with Students Supporting Israel, said the group wanted to demonstrate Friday to show it's OK for Jews who support Israel or are Zionists to speak their opinions.\n\n\"We don't want to foster a campus where only one side can speak up, where people can be shunned, ostracized and attacked because of what they believe in and who they stand for,\" he said.\n\nWhile the pro-Israel rally continued, about 200 people gathered a few hundred yards away for a news conference hosted by anti-Zionist Jewish students at the U, who spoke in support of the Palestinian cause.\n\nThe pro-Palestinian rally was a collaboration between student leaders and the Twin Cities chapter of Jewish Voice for Peace. Speakers demanded that anti-Zionist Jewish students be included in conversations with university administrators, saying they have felt \"silenced\" this week, according to a news release.\n\nThe U is working on identifying a subset of Jewish students from the UMN Divest Coalition to arrange a meeting, according to a U spokesperson.\"We welcome open, productive dialogue that advances a more inclusive university,\" according to a university statement.\n\nMirabai Dornfest, a U junior who is Jewish and stayed at the encampment, said there's a false narrative that being Jewish means one is opposed to the pro-Palestinian protests. Dornfest compared the two demonstrations and said she thought they revealed an age gap in how many Jewish people are responding to the war in Gaza.\n\n\"We take to heart the lessons we learn from our families' histories with genocide, lessons we learn in universities, and we will take the lessons we've learned into the future,\" she said.", "source": {"uri": "startribune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Star Tribune"}, "authors": [{"uri": "louis_krauss@startribune.com", "name": "Louis Krauss", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_nationalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Palestinian nationalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Minnesota", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "University of Minnesota"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jews"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Students_Supporting_Israel", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Students Supporting Israel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Gaza_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2014 Gaza War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffman_Memorial_Union", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coffman Memorial Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Flag of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zionism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Zionism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabbi", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rabbi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hostage", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hostage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Palestine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Flag of Palestine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Zionism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anti-Zionism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genocide", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Genocide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Press_conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Press conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_Voice_for_Peace", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jewish Voice for Peace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minneapolis\u2013Saint_Paul", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minneapolis\u2013Saint Paul"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "University"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Judaism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Judaism", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.startribune.com/static/img/branding/logos/strib-social-card.png?d=1714769250", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538674", "eventUri": "eng-9538674", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 127, "relevance": 1}

R. 6090 is not needed, it is a threat to freedom of speech, Op-Ed", "body": "Photo: An American Jewish scholar holds a Palestinian flag during a protest against Israel's air strikes on Gaza.\n\nBy : Yuki Iwamura\n\nIn 2019, President Donald Trump signed an executive order to combat antisemitism on college campuses that used Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to withhold money from schools that fail to counter discrimination against Jews.\n\nThe order permitted the U.S. Department of Education to consider a definition of antisemitism that could include some criticism of Israel when vetting alleged Civil Rights Act violations that can lead to a loss of a school's federal funding.\n\nWe wrote an editorial opposing Trump's order, stating it \"raises serious concerns about censorship and stifling legitimate criticism of Israel.\"\n\nThe editorial added:\n\n\"Emily Mayer, political director of the liberal Jewish American group IfNotNow, correctly described the order as a victory for efforts 'to discredit any critique of Israel, Israeli policies or how Jewish supremacy has been codified within the Israeli state -- to try to describe that as anti-Semitism.'\"\n\nThe order appeared to be directed at Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions, BDS, a movement advocating economic measures opposing Israel's occupation of the West Bank. The international anti-Israel boycott movement has grown in popularity on campuses.\"\n\nThere is a new threat to Americans' constitutional right to freedom of speech over the Israel-Hamas war.\n\nIn response to a nationwide student protest movement over the Israel-Hamas war, the House last week passed legislation that would establish an even broader definition of antisemitism for the department to enforce anti-discrimination laws.\n\nThe Associated Press reports: \"The proposal passed 320-91 with bipartisan support. It would codify the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance's definition of antisemitism in Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. It would broaden the legal definition of antisemitism to include the \"targeting of the state of Israel, conceived as a Jewish collectivity.\"\n\nTo be clear, President Joe Biden is right to make a distinction between defending the right to protest and prevailing law and order as college campuses across the country face unrest over the war in Gaza.\n\n\"Dissent is essential for democracy,\" he said at the White House. \"But dissent must never lead to disorder.\"\n\nCritics are also right to call out protesters who target Jewish students with hateful remarks. Jewish students should not feel unsafe on college campuses or anywhere else.\n\nAntisemitism is unacceptable and must be strongly condemned in clear and strong terms.\n\nBut is it inaccurate and unfair to say the nationwide student protest movement is motivated by hate and antisemitism.\n\nThe broad-based multiethnic movement includes Jewish students who are opposed to Israel's conduct of the war in Gaza. More than 33,000 Palestinians have been killed since the war was launched in October, after Hamas staged a deadly terrorist attack against Israeli citizens.\n\nIsrael's conduct in the war has been condemned by several countries in the United Nations and religious and human rights groups. The attempt to label most of the student protesters as antisemitic because of the actions of a few is disingenuous and dangerous.\n\nThe House bill passed last week expanding the definition of antisemitism would have a chilling effect on free speech on college campuses.\n\nThe proposed definition should be strongly opposed by lawmakers, Jewish organizations, as well as free speech advocates.\n\nJeremy Ben-Ami, president of the centrist pro-Israel group J Street, said his organization opposes the bipartisan proposal because he sees it as an \"unserious\" effort led by Republicans \"to continually force votes that divide the Democratic caucus on an issue that shouldn't be turned into a political football.\"\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union was right to send a letter last Friday to lawmakers urging them to vote against the legislation, pointing out that federal law already prohibits antisemitic discrimination and harassment.\n\n\"H.R. 6090 is therefore not needed to protect against antisemitic discrimination; instead, it would likely chill free speech of students on college campuses by incorrectly equating criticism of the Israeli government with antisemitism,\" the letter stated.\n\nSupporters of Israel's right to exist and defend itself should oppose this bill. Regardless of their views on the Israel-Hamas war, Sens. Bob Casey and John Fetterman should vote to uphold the constitutional right to freedom of speech.", "source": {"uri": "yalibnan.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Ya Libnan"}, "authors": [],

His second book, Why Are We Still Afraid?, which follows his five-decade career and comes to a surprising conclusion, is available on Amazon.\n\nOne thing is clear about the antisemitic wave flooding American university campuses, leaving Jewish students and professors uncomfortable, even fearing for their lives: It's going to get worse. Just follow the money.\n\nWhat's needed is a plan to deal with it. The range of possibilities includes abandoning those campuses and setting up our own.\n\nWorse? It's been getting worse for decades. I attended one of the universities where today's \"pro-Palestinians\" set up an encampment. I was there in the famous '60s when students were also protesting. The difference is that they -- we -- were protesting a war the US was actually involved in, with 500,000 soldiers in Vietnam at the time.\n\nToday, while the US does send weapons and money to Israel, this is not a conflict that touches the US directly, any more than the larger, bloodier conflicts in Syria, Yemen, Sudan -- the list goes on and on -- and no one seems to care about them. That's evidence, if any more is needed that this unrest has little to do with Israel -- we're dealing with pure Jew-hatred here.\n\nBack then, I was a journalism student. After rising to the post of editorial page editor of the university newspaper, I encountered a student editor who was constantly on my back, making my life miserable. After a couple of months of this, a fellow Jewish student asked me, \"Do you think it's because you're Jewish?\"\n\nI'm the son of Holocaust survivors, so antisemitism is deeply embedded in my psyche -- but my honest answer was, \"That never occurred to me.\" And in the end, it wasn't the reason.\n\nNow follow along the next six decades, and you'll see the gradual rise of antisemitism on university campuses. It's bought and paid for by a concerted, long-term campaign by Arab countries to pour money into the universities, fund professorships, sponsor students, and finance departments and programs.\n\nOne compilation determined that Qatar alone had siphoned more than $5 billion into American universities. Cornell is the largest recipient of Arab funding, raking in more than $1.5 billion. So it's no wonder that Cornell was one of the first to \"erupt.\" Harvard, in contrast, has received \"only\" $187 million.\n\nUp to now, Jewish students, professors, and professional advocacy organizations have been complaining loudly, calling for university action against the lawbreakers and applauding the sending of police onto campuses. None of those actions accomplish more than putting out an occasional fire. We need to do more than that and more than whining to each other on antisocial media.\n\nFirst, consider these two options:\n\nIf you choose the first option, getting out of the conflict zones for the sake of getting an actual education in something besides battlefield survival, consider these possibilities:\n\n1a. Creating a new university. Its guidelines would begin with requiring all students and staff, from campus cops to top professors, to sign on to the IHRA definition of antisemitism, with an addition that while criticizing Israeli policy is legitimate, targeting Israel as a state or calling for attacks on its people is not -- and anyone who violates those terms is automatically and immediately expelled or dismissed.Housing a new university is more feasible now than ever. Because of the COVID pandemic and the move by so many people to work from home instead of in the office, there's a glut of business real estate in many places, even New York and San Francisco.\n\nJewish philanthropists who have donated to tainted universities should be ready to contribute instead to a project where Jewish students are not targeted and endangered. They could fund the purchase of an office building to be converted into a university.\n\nWith another portion of those donations, professors who feel more comfortable teaching and researching in an atmosphere of academic freedom and are not required to accept \"progressive\" mantras, mindsets, and now violence could be encouraged to move to the new university.\n\nDonor-funded scholarships would be offered to students who agree to the terms of the university.\n\n1b. Expand, strengthen, and improve the existing Jewish-oriented schools: Brandeis, Touro, and Yeshiva University.\n\nWorking in the same frame as above -- requiring a commitment to the IHRA definition and the Israel addendum -- thousands of additional students, hundreds of professors and staff, and a rash of new buildings to accommodate them would bolster these schools.A concerted effort would be made to raise the academic standing of all of them while accepting as many Jewish students as possible -- two somewhat contradictory goals but not necessarily incompatible.\n\nAfter a few years, the universities that made Jewish students unwelcome would begin to see their academic ratings fall, just as the academic ratings of the Jewish-friendly universities rise. Sweet justice.\n\n1c. Send students to Israel for their university years. Well-established, successful academic programs exist for visiting students at top Israeli universities.These would be expanded to accommodate many thousands of students who would likely jump at the chance to go where they're really welcome and get a top-notch education, too. Present tuitions for overseas programs in Israel are considerably less than those for \"prestigious\" universities in the US. There's even a world-class graduate-level university where the language of instruction is English: the Weizmann Institute of Science in Rehovot, where I live.\n\nSo there are four options to choose from. And, as in the most annoying multiple-choice questions, the best answer is \"all of the above.\"\n\nAll the university programs would be coordinated. A student could decide to be a warrior for Jewish rights for a year, then seamlessly transfer to one of the Jewish-oriented universities, then to Israel, then back to the US.\n\nThe goal is to offer every Jewish university student a proper education in a welcoming atmosphere, shelter from the burgeoning Jew hatred on university campuses, and a chance to excel academically.\n\nAmbitious? Yes. Possible? It has to be. The Jewish community must mobilize and redirect donations like never before, enlist the best academic minds, and pull together to make this vision a reality -- because it will worsen. It's only a matter of time until there's bloodshed on today's antisemitism-stained campuses.", "source": {"uri": "themedialine.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Media Line"}, "authors": [{"uri":

That is true at least since 1933 at Oxford, when 428 students against 275 voted in favor of the resolution, which Winston Churchill termed \"that abject, squalid, shameless avowal\" not to fight for king and country \"under no circumstances.\"\n\nAny fair observation of the happenings across campuses this past month in the United States would not be wrong to characterize them as aggressive, threatening, menacing, occasionally out-right violent, foul-mouthed, damaging and very anti-Jewish.\n\nEven a correspondent for The New York Times, Katherine Rosman, could not avoid writing on April 26 that the \"issue at the core of the conflict rippling across campuses nationwide [is] the tension between pro-Palestinian activism and antisemitism.\" Three days later, she highlighted how it works when three Jewish students approached a tent village at Columbia University and the cry went up: \"We have Zionists who have entered the camp.\"\n\nAt the University of California, Los Angeles, a campus journalist was prevented from walking about. A Jewish female student there was beaten and required medical attention and an older man was attacked and threatened. One Christian, supporting Israel at the University of Pennsylvania by holding the blue-and-white flag, was \"ghettoized,\" having a chalk circle drawn around him (at 0:54 on a CNN video). At Stanford, a protester dressed up as a Hamas suicide-bomber. This violence -- actual and implied -- and more probably led to the ugly scenes the night afterwards. But the atmosphere of violence was initiated by the pro-Palestine proponents.\n\nThis has led to a situation whereby students have termed as \"conditionally Jewish\" those Jews who are barely acceptable in polite society on campuses, as Tessa Veksler explained to Mandana Dayani. There's a scale now for being Jewish, and it has nothing to do with Judaism as a religion or ethnicity. Rather, it has to do with the degree of revolutionary value -- specifically on behalf of the ideology, Palestinianism -- that seeks to eliminate both Jewish national identity and as many Jews as possible.\n\nThe campus uprisings revolve around the Jews, not Arabs of a certain Palestinian strain. It is done so in a two-tiered obverse/reverse situation.\n\nFirst, the attack is on Israel as the Jewish state. Of all the tragedies, wars and human-rights violations in the world, it is Israel that draws so much attention, in addition to being incorrectly and falsely accused of various crimes. Moreover, more likely than not, any Jew not immediately recognized as belonging to the rallies, encampments and other springtime frivolities will be identified as a \"Zionist.\" Of course, in doing so, these anti-Zionists prove how wrong their claim is that Judaism should not be identified as nationalism. Then again, logic and rationality are not the strong sides of these days of rage.\n\nSecondly, Jews have once again come to the fore as \"revolutionaries\" with all the ramifications pertaining to those sections of America's population not interested in any sort of revolution -- be it social, economic or intellectual.\n\nThirdly, there is the role of a specific Jewish sub-group: the fervent frenzied anti-Zionists. If not for the involvement, participation and financial resources of IfNotNow, Jewish Voice for Peace and their sponsors providing cover as well as justification, the marches, take-overs and encampments could not have succeeded as they have. As I am not fully familiar with all the Jewish academics urging them on, I'll just note my suspicion of their responsibility in encouraging and urging on the antics.\n\nOne professor, however, deserves a mention. Naomi Klein, professor of climate justice at the University of British Columbia, spoke during Passover outside Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer's residence in Brooklyn, N.Y. According to the transcript of her remarks, she promoted \"an exodus from Zionism.\" She is bothered that \"too many of our people are worshipping a false idol. ... Profaned by it.\" That \"idol?\" Yes, Zionism.\n\nIsrael, she promotes, is an \"ethnostate ... of colonial land theft, roadmaps for ethnic cleansing and genocide.\" Drunk on her own four cups of whatever, she proclaimed that \"political Zionism's version of liberation is itself profane.\" For Klein, Judaism is \"internationalist by nature.\"\n\nAnd so, not only do the anti-Zionist Jews of the secular variety (the Neturei Karta is too complex to be dealt with here) undermine the religious nature of the Passover celebration but apply a globalist messaging that corrupts and perverts the essence of the Jewish people, its religion and culture -- the entire crux and soul of being Jewish, as exemplified by the Passover holiday.\n\nAn enslaved people -- the Jewish people -- existed as a community in its exile. It accepts a unique religious practice and philosophy of belief, and proceeds to a specific land and territory to fulfill its commandments that cannot be done anywhere else. And every year since, during the time of the Holy Temples and exiles across the globe, a symbolic feast marking the event is concluded with the words, \"Next Year in Jerusalem.\" Yet, for Klein and cosmopolitan compatriots, that not only should not be but is sacrilegious, if I be permitted to borrow a term.\n\nAs has happened in the past, Jews are playing with other Jewish lives as pro-Palestinians exploit and take advantage of anti-Jewish sentiment. They are literally feeding a frenzy of antisemitism. That they call themselves \"progressives\" is a travesty and a failure of their educational system. Too many of America's Jews are caught up in the stage of being sophomoric, and it is proving dangerous. Far, far too dangerous.", "source": {"uri": "jns.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Jewish News Syndicate"}, "authors": [{"uri": "yisrael_medad@jns.org", "name": "Yisrael Medad", "type": "author",

One challah was decorated with a Palestinian flag in seeds and herbs; the ceremonial \"wine\" (grape juice) was chosen because it was not made in Israel. Palestinian flags and handmade posters with slogans protesting genocide hung from trees. As they prayed, other students, many of whom were Muslim, held up kaffiyehs, jean shirts and checkered blankets to form a privacy screen.\n\nSince April 29, Jewish anti-Zionist protesters at the Hyde Park campus have used food, ritual and community in the encampment as one of many ways to express their religious commitment to divestment from Israel, a multiethnic future and an end to killings in Gaza. In a practical sense, that means Seders and Shabbats (or Sabbaths), with non-Israeli kosher products, teaching about the pluralistic elements of Jewish traditions like the Moroccan Jewish Mimouna, and eating Palestinian food with Muslims and others in their coalition.\n\nAvi Steinberg, a writer, faculty member and graduate of Orthodox yeshivas who spoke at the event, described Shabbat as a time of reflection.\n\n\"People sit with their thoughts and their emotions,\" Steinberg said on a phone call Saturday. \"It's a time of stopping the clock completely.\"\n\nAfter the prayer and singing concluded, the Shabbat observers -- a small but sizable portion of the broader encampment -- dispersed; at the central food tent, a half-dozen or more unflipped maqluba pots sat beside rice and meat already doled out onto steam plates. Cold chopped salads and hot lentil soup were also served. This meal, donated by Arab restaurant Al Bahaar, acted informally as the Shabbat meal. The encampment food tent staff relies on donations of hot food and attempts to keep a variety of vegan, kosher, halal and nonallergenic options available for encampment dwellers.\n\nThe Muslim maghrib prayer began soon after on the same blue tarp. The University of Chicago United for Palestine coalition includes Students for Justice in Palestine, UChicago Jews for a Free Palestine, and several other organizations.\n\nNationally, encampments like this one have been accused of antisemitism. But in interviews with a half-dozen or more Jewish students and affiliated faculty members within the pro-Palestine encampment at the U. of C., none of them said they felt anything resembling antisemitism within the camp. Instead, they said they felt more connected to the Jewish tradition through their activism during the protests. They argued that anti-Zionism and advocating for Palestinian freedom is in a long tradition of Jewish values of pluralism and agitation for justice.\n\n\"When we're praying for peace and human emancipation, to me this is the essence of what it means to be Jewish,\" said graduate student Daniel Fernandez, speaking outside the encampment. \"What is so profoundly disappointing is that this is somehow controversial.\" Fernandez has stayed at the encampment, attending or sometimes leading several of the religious services this past week.\n\nChicago Jewish leaders held a news conference Wednesday where they called the encampments \"platforms for antisemitism.\" The university's major Jewish organizations have disavowed, criticized or ignored the protesters.\n\n...continued",

They are the experts. If they are giving Holocaust Day speeches, just wait patiently. Op-ed.\n\nA few days ago, Jew-hating, pro-Hamas mobs were effectively in control of the University of California at Los Angelas. They barred Jewish students from reaching classes. They even beat a female Jewish student unconscious.\n\nApparently, the Los Angelas police were taking an extended break at a local Dunkin Donuts the whole while. Thus, they did nothing to stop the protesters.\n\nFinally, counter protestors, presumably Jews, stormed the antisemites' \"encampment.\" They allegedly physically attacked the Jew-bashers.\n\nBy sheer coincidence, this response on behalf of UCLA's Jews happened to occur exactly at the moment that the cops' five-day donut break ended. Now the police stormed in to quash the violence from \"both sides.\"\n\nLos Angeles Mayor Karen Bass, who was reportedly enjoying a siesta when the Jewish student was beaten, woke up just in time to vow to prosecute the pro-Israel \"vigilantes\" who attacked the illegal \"Palestine Solidarity Encampment.\"\n\nNo doubt, the full might of the L.A. district attorney's office will be brought to bear on the \"Zionists.\" After all, the D.A.'s office has plenty of time on its hands. What with its policy of not prosecuting violent crimes committed by non-Jews (other than Trump supporters).\n\nI know what you're thinking: Oy vey! What a balagan (mess)! Who will stand up for us?\n\nDon't' worry. Ever vigilant, a major Jewish organization and a prominent Jewish UCLA academic promptly issued missives of condemnation.\n\nCondemnation of the pro-Jewish counter protestors, that is. **\n\n\"We are appalled at the violence,\" a spokesman for the L.A. Jewish Federation stated. The spokesman decried the counter protestors' acts as \"abhorrent.\"\n\nA Jewish UCLA professor, and chairman of the Jewish studies department, tweeted that he was \"heartbroken.\" The prof condemned the offending Jews for having \"laid siege\" to the \"pro-Palestinian\" protest encampment and for having \"violently attacked it.\" He decried the counter demonstrators as outside instigators.\n\nEven more heartrending was the reaction of some self-described Jewish UCLA students. One, named Stella, complained that the counter protestors gave \"our community a really bad look.\" And another proud, fearless Jewish student, who requested anonymity, noted that if \"this was the stock market we'd be a penny stock ...It's over. Anyone pro-Israel looks like a barbarian right now.\"\n\nThose last comments by the students are particularly puzzling. First, I've never known anyone or anything named \"Stella\" who wasn't an Italian Catholic. Or maybe a cookie.\n\nSecond, penny stocks can be profitable, if you know what you're doing.\n\nMost important, I could almost swear that, even before the counter-protests arose, the pro-Hamas protestors were accusing Jews of a lot worse things than just being \"barbarians.\" Like being perpetrators and supporters of \"genocide,\" \"a holocaust\" and \"apartheid.\" Now, those kinds of words don't exactly make us look like Marilyn Monroe.\n\nBut I am getting old.

They do not feel safe. We know because they are telling us. Believing them isn't hard.\n\nWe believe members of the Black community who say they feel unsafe when law enforcement pulls them over. We believe Muslim Americans who say they feel unsafe when a mosque is vandalized. We believe members of the Asian American and Pacific Islander community who say they feel unsafe when scapegoated for the spread of covid-19. We believe members of the LGBTQ+ community who say they feel unsafe when bigots attack their dance clubs.\n\nSimply put, when members of our greater community tell us they feel, and are, unsafe, we defend them. We show up at their places of worship and pray with them; we march with them in pride parades; we patronize their businesses; we listen to them and hear what they are experiencing. All the while, we don't relent in allowing for other people's right to hate and their right to express that hatred in ways that do not threaten anyone's safety.\n\nJewish kids have been telling us for months they do not feel safe. Jewish Chicago Public Schools students were fearful for their safety during anti-Israel walkouts earlier this year. Protesters yelled antisemitic slurs during a recent City Council meeting. And 73 percent of Jewish college students said they experienced or witnessed some form of antisemitism during the first three months of the 2023-24 school year alone--a number we should assume is exponentially higher five months later.\n\nEncampments up the antisemitism ante. Encampments on college and university campuses are not peaceful protests against war. They are platforms for antisemitism, and administrators who do not act aggressively to shut them down risk becoming complicit.\n\nWhen protesters at the encampment at Northwestern University chanted, \"Long live the intifada\" and \"We don't want no Zionists here,\" and posters at the University of Chicago encampment on last week read, \"Globalize the intifada,\" Jewish students know these messages are calling for the killing of Jews everywhere.\n\nLet's be clear: Encampments on college campuses are not First Amendment-protected protests, and the actions of the students and agitators participating in them are not speech. \"Oct. 7 will happen to American Jewish students 10,000 times over\" is not protected speech. Yet it is tolerated on campus.\n\nUniversity leaders can start to reverse the trend by enforcing their codes of conduct and campus policies to restore calm and safety for all students.\n\nThe environment on college campuses is a natural extension of record levels of antisemitism in America and a growing tolerance of hate against Jews. But that's not an excuse.\n\nWe rightly believe other targeted communities when they say they are unsafe. So, are Jewish students just not believable? Or is antisemitism that baked into the collegiate DNA that no one sees it, even when it's camping right in front of you?\n\nDavid Goldenberg is the Evelyn R.

Wagner High School on Staten Island told Fox News Digital that after the terrorist organization Hamas invaded Israel Oct. 7, a Middle Eastern student \"screamed free Palestine\" and could be heard saying \"f -- ing Jew\" on the way to school.\n\nThe Jewish students said some anti-Israel students \"claim they are not antisemitic and say Israel should not exist.\" One student of Middle Eastern origin said it would be \"OK if the Holocaust happened,\" according to a witness at the school.\n\nThe U.S. government has classified Hamas a foreign terrorist organization. The Hamas jihadi movement murdered roughly 1,200 people Oct. 7 in southern Israel, including over 30 Americans. Hamas is holding over 130 people hostage in the Gaza Strip, including U.S. citizens.\n\nMany of the same students, it was claimed, also participated in an anti-Israel rally attended by 200 activists across from Susan E. Wagner high school during school hours in March with antisemitic groups promoting the destruction of the Jewish state.\n\nNYC MAYOR ERIC ADAMS BLASTS STUDENTS' 'VILE SHOW OF ANTISEMITISM' THAT FORCED TEACHER TO HIDE IN OFFICE\n\nFox News Digital obtained a photograph of the pro-Hamas slogan \"Free Palestine. From the River to the Sea\" scrawled on a teacher's blackboard at Susan E. Wagner High School. The pro-Hamas battle cry has been widely interpreted to be antisemitic because it urges the eradication of the Jewish state.\n\n\"Among the students were members of the 'Shut It Down For Palestine' coalition, a movement consisting of a multitude of groups calling for a cease-fire in Gaza and an end to Zionism,\" according to the Staten Island Advance. \"Supporters of the Party for Socialism and Liberation bolstered the student-driven rally, with some leading chants and eventually directing students to the Jewish Community Center (JCC) on Manor Road.\"\n\nA parent of a Jewish student at another city high school told Fox News Digital his family received an anonymous call with respect to his daughter. The antisemitic caller allegedly said, \"Stop the genocide. If she can't stop it, she will get hurt.\"\n\nRabbi Levi Katzman, who oversees the Jewish organization Chabad on the South Shore of Staten Island, told Fox News Digital, \"I know students from Wagner and not only Wagner. Students reached out to me and their parents. They feel they are being harassed by pro-Hamas students at the school. \"\n\nHe said one pro-Hamas student said, \"Now would be a good time for the Holocaust.\"\n\n\"The kids feel the faculty is protecting the pro-Hamas students,\" Katzman added.\n\nTRUMP SAYS 4 WORDS ABOUT ANTI-ISRAEL PROTESTS ON COLLEGE CAMPUSES AS ARRESTS SKYROCKET\n\nKatzman believes \"the higher-ups in Susan Wagner brush it under the rug. They make believe they do something, The Department of Education has an intuitional antisemitism problem that trickles down. For such outrageous anitsemitism to be tolerated it is insane. I am sure many of the children won't speak because of retaliation.\"\n\nHe urged that \"the community needs to stand up because this is a government-funded institution.\"\n\nJoe Borelli, the Republican minority Leader of the New York City Council who represents Staten Island's South Shore, told Fox News Digital, \"It is easier to see foolishness in high school kids than it is in our elite students at Columbia University. There is absolutely no reason for any kid to be threatened or harassed on the way to high school. The administration has to step up.\"\n\nBorelli and his Republican colleague, Inna Vernikov, who serves as the minority whip of the New York City Council, where she represents the 48th District in Brooklyn, have spearheaded actions to blunt the mushrooming antisemitism in New York City.\n\n\"Antisemitic harassment, bullying and woke indoctrination have become the norm across our public school system,\" Vernikov told Fox News Digital. \"Swastikas, death threats and Hitler glorification are all a result of a failure to properly educate our youth, and we must assign consequences to bad actors.\n\n\"Statements are welcomed, but action is required. Instead, complainants are consistently ignored or met with indifference.\"\n\nReached by Fox News Digital, a spokesman for David C. Banks, the chancellor of New York City Public Schools, told Fox News Digital, \"The chancellor has repeatedly made it clear that all forms of bigotry have no place in our public schools -- including both antisemitism and Islamophobia. The superintendent is fully engaged with the Wagner High School community and is working to ensure the school climate is safe and welcoming to all students.\"\n\nBIDEN RIPPED FOR DECRYING 'ISLAMOPHOBIA' AMID ANTISEMITIC CAMPUS PROTESTS: 'YET ANOTHER EQUIVOCATION'\n\nMarion Wilson is the Staten Island schools superintendent.\n\nThe chancellor's spokesman said Wilson \"helped the principal develop a comprehensive action plan, connect with groups of students and engage with professional development on creating an inclusive school community. While we do not comment on individual incidents, we do investigate every allegation and follow up with necessary action when needed.\"\n\nThe chancellor's spokesman did not answer a Fox News Digital question about the nature of alleged Islamophobia complaints that were also received. According to an anti-Israel flyer obtained by Fox News Digital that was circulated at Susan E. Wagner, students complained about the Wagner administration not permitting students to \"wear merchandise that's in support of Hamas.\"\n\nThe flyer claimed a double standard because a student was allowed to wear an Israel Defense Forces sweatshirt.\n\nNeither Wilson or the principal of Susan E. Wagner High School responded to Fox News Digital phone and email questions for comment.\n\nIn a statement to Fox News Digital, a spokeswoman for Mayor Eric Adams cited \"some steps we've taken in recent months to combat incidents of antisemitism and Islamophobia in our schools.\"\n\n\"We have continued to expand and update our vetted classroom and curricular resources on topics such as the Middle East crisis, Islamophobia and antisemitism, including a recent antisemitism guide from the Museum of Jewish Heritage,\" the spokeswoman said.\n\n\"On March 13, at a citywide principal conference, all principals received comprehensive safety training on applying the discipline code, uplifting our Respect for All program, and crisis de-escalation.\n\n\"Prior to Respect for All Week in February, we launched additional training to Respect for All liaisons on bullying prevention and incident reporting, which is ongoing. We also re-shared reporting pathways with school communities to ensure allegations of inappropriate conduct or bullying/harassment can be reported and investigated swiftly.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nBrooke Goldstein, the human rights attorney, told Fox New Digital \"the lack of transparency and accountability for highly charged and inaccurate curriculum and classroom content is only one part of the problem.\"\n\n\"Change comes through the legal system and through activism,\" she said. \"Parents who see their children affected by antisemitism at school need to come forward. They have rights, and those rights include being free of discrimination and harassment. Teachers have those same rights, and I encourage anyone experiencing Jew hatred to reach out to The Lawfare Project for pro bono help.\"\n\nQuestions sent to congresswoman Nicole Malliotakis, R-N.Y., who represents Staten Island and parts of south Brooklyn, were not returned.", "source": {"uri": "foxwilmington.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "foxwilmington.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "fox_wilmington@foxwilmington.com", "name": "Fox Wilmington", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fox News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_school", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Secondary school"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Antisemitism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Wagner", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Richard Wagner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrimination", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Discrimination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_school", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "State school"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jews"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staten_Island", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Staten Island"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Staten Island"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susan_E._Wagner_High_School", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Susan E.

Roughly half the population is under 18. So often you're seeing kids playing, laughing, crying, screaming ... everywhere.\n\n\"And I had friends there who had kids, and we often would spend time with those children.\n\n\"There was in parts of Gaza real beauty, a calmness. Amazing fresh produce, beautiful fresh fish.\"\n\nNow, when he sees images of Gaza's destruction, it feels personal.\n\n\"I've tried to look at those images and see, did I go to some of those areas? Did I go to a restaurant there, or did I meet people there on the shore? And I am furious and sad and often feel helpless,\" he says.\n\n\"Seeing what has happened to Gaza since October 7 has been heartbreaking, honestly, and I'm so ashamed, I'm so ashamed. Because it's being done in my name.\"\n\nNow living in Sydney, Loewenstein is a leading voice among Australian Jews speaking out against Israel's military campaign in Gaza.\n\nHe is not just appalled by the mass casualties among civilians, but by the insistence that the campaign is about protecting Jews.\n\n\"Jewish leaders, in Australia, US, the UK, their message is uniform: back what Israel's doing, that's what's keeping us safe. And the evidence for that is simply absent,\" he says.\n\n\"It's actually making us more unsafe. And until Palestinians are safe and secure, Israelis never will be, and Jews never will be.\"\n\nFor the past six months, Loewenstein has been voicing his outrage to millions of people, appearing as a commentator for media networks like CNN, MSNBC, Al Jazeera English and Turkish radio and television.\n\nHis latest book, The Palestine Laboratory, investigating Israel's testing and use of hi-tech weaponry against occupied Palestinians, has become an international bestseller and won him Australia's peak journalism prize, the Walkley Award.\n\nHe says thousands of people have contacted him to thank him for speaking out.\n\n\"Jewish people (have been) saying 'thank God there's a voice that is against what Israel is doing,'\" he says.\n\nBut some Australian Jews see him as little better than Hamas. He has received hate mail, anonymous death threats and been labelled a traitor and self-hating Jew.\n\nSuzanne Rutland, an Australian-Jewish historian, believes anti-Zionist activism, regardless of who promotes it, puts Jews in danger.\n\n\"The anti-Zionist message leads to attacks on Jews in Australia. So it fosters antisemitism, and we've seen that with a huge upsurge post October 7,\" she says.\n\n\"The mainstream Jewish leadership, most Jews see people like Antony Loewenstein, that extreme left-wing voice, as highly destructive to the well-being of Jews, and particularly the wellbeing of the over 7 million Jews living in Israel.\"\n\nIt's not how he expected his life to turn out when he was studying for his bar mitzvah in Melbourne in the 1980s.\n\n\"When I started writing about Israel-Palestine, started thinking about it, literally probably 35, 40 years ago within my Jewish family and synagogue and the wider community, I didn't think that I would become this person,\" she says.\n\nBorn in 1974, Antony Loewenstein grew up in a liberal Jewish family that observed Jewish holidays like Passover, celebrated the Sabbath and saw Israel as a safe haven should anything threaten Jews abroad.\n\nHis grandparents on both sides escaped Nazi Germany and Austria in 1939 but many others in the family were murdered.\n\n\"As far as Antony's Jewishness was concerned, it was important to us that he should know his heritage,\" his father Jeffrey Loewenstein told Compass.\n\n\"And I suppose it also was informed by the fact that we had family who'd been lost during the Holocaust. My father's parents were taken by train to Auschwitz in March 1943, and paradoxically the day they were executed, I was born.\"\n\nLike all their Jewish friends and family, Jeffrey and his wife Violet accepted the significance of Israel as a Jewish state.\n\n\"Being sort of one-eyed about Israel in the 1970s, I think has to be seen in context,\" Jeffrey says.\n\n\"Nobody talked about the Palestinians other than as terrorists. And they'd done awful things. The Munich massacre, for example. And you've got to look at it in context, in the wider Jewish community in Melbourne, which is the largest -- then -- Holocaust survivor community outside Israel.\"\n\nBut Antony Loewenstein did question what he saw as \"unthinking\" Zionism. After travelling to Israel for the first time in his early 20s, he wrote his first book My Israel Question, criticising both the occupation of the Palestinian territories and the influence of the pro-Israel lobby in Australia and globally.\n\nIt became a best-seller but made him a pariah in Australia's Jewish community. Australia's then only Jewish MP, Michael Danby, called for the book to be pulped.\n\nEven Antony's parents were ostracised by the Jewish community.\n\n\"Violet and I immediately got the cold shoulder from a lot of (Jewish) people who had been really close friends,\" Jeffrey says.\n\n\"Antony kind of became a non-person. And that still exists to a certain extent today.\"\n\nTheir treatment led Jeffrey and Violet to question their own feelings for Israel.\n\nWhen Antony followed his partner Alison to live in East Jerusalem (she worked for an international humanitarian organisation), his parents came to stay. They visited the occupied Palestinian territories, seeing villages where Palestinian homes were being demolished to make way for Jewish settlers.\n\n\"I went everywhere in the West Bank, I've been to villages that have been destroyed again and again by the Israelis,\" Jeffrey says.\n\n\"So, I've seen it firsthand, what I've seen just appalled me.\"\n\nAntony believes that much of Australia's Jewish community is stuck in a time warp.\n\nOverseas, particularly in the US, younger Jews have been progressively turning against Israel over its treatment of Palestinians, a process that has accelerated with the deaths of tens of thousands in Gaza being documented on social media.\n\n\"I was appalled by the brutality of the Hamas attacks with the targeting of Israeli civilians in parts of southern Israel. And I knew that the impact of them would be so catastrophic for the Palestinians in Gaza.\n\n\"It was pretty clear within really a day or so after October 7, that the splits in the Jewish community around Israel and Zionism, which existed long before that day, were going to explode.\"\n\nProfessor Rutland, citing a June 2023 survey, says 77 per cent of Jews in Australia identify as Zionist.\n\n\"Zionism is a Jewish right for self-determination, that is the right for Israel to exist as a state for the Jewish people. It's so important because our community is largely a post Holocaust community,\" she says.\n\n\"I definitely think that young Jews, particularly in universities, are influenced more by some of the anti-Zionist narrative, but many simply don't want to be cancelled.\"\n\nAntony Loewenstein says the power of the Zionist lobby is waning.\n\n\"The recent, inspiring student protests in the US, Australia and beyond, involving large numbers of Jews in opposition to the mass slaughter in Gaza and universities working with weapons manufacturers, shows what's possible,\" he says.\n\n\"There are far more critical Jews around than many in the Jewish establishment want to acknowledge.\n\n\"The false charge of antisemitism against anybody who challenges Israeli racism and occupation is increasingly shunned by young Jews, Palestinians and people of conscience.\"", "source": {"uri": "abc.net.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "Australian Broadcasting Corporation"}, "authors": [],

Australia recorded 622 antisemitic incidents in October and November 2023, in comparison to 79 during the same period in 2022.\n\nWhile the dramatic increases in comparison to 2022 largely followed October 7, the report emphasized that most countries with large Jewish minorities saw relative increases also in the first nine months of 2023, before the Gaza war started.\n\nFor example, in the United States, ADL data (based on the narrower definition for antisemitic incidents) point to an increase from 1,000 incidents in October-December 2022 to 3,976 in the same period in 2023, but also to an increase from 2,697 incidents between January-September 2022 to 3,547 in the same period in 2023 (NYPD registered a decrease in that period, while LAPD an increase).\n\nIn France, the number of incidents during January-September 2023 increased to 434 from 329 during the same period in 2022; in Britain - from 1,270 to 1,404. In Australia, 371 incidents were recorded between January and September 2023, compared to 363 in the same period in 2022. On the other hand, Germany and Austria, where national programs for fighting antisemitism are applied, saw decreases.\n\nProf. Uriya Shavit, head of the Center for the Study of Contemporary European Jewry and the Irwin Cotler Institute\" (named for by former Canadian justice minister and attorney-general Irwin Cotler), said, \"The year is not 1938, not even 1933. Yet if current trends continue, the curtain will descend on the ability to lead Jewish lives in the West - to wear a Star of David, attend synagogues and community centers, send kids to Jewish schools, frequent a Jewish club on campus, or speak Hebrew. We are concerned that the curtain will descend on Jewish life in the West.\"\n\nShavit continued, \"With bomb threats against synagogues becoming a daily occurrence, Jewish existence in the West is forced to fortify itself, and the more it does so, the more the sense of security and normalcy is undermined. What the fight against antisemitism needs now is efforts focused on the hubs of poison and the presentation of measurable and attainable goals. Foremost, the reality in which big companies make big money by spreading big hate has to end.\"\n\nShavit added, \"The reality is that Israel, as a state, is limited in what it can do for Jewish communities. But even the little that can be done is not done. Israel does not have a meaningful strategic plan for combatting antisemitism that is based on the needs of Jewish communities. The main contributions of the government are pompous statements and sporadic initiatives. Responsibility for combatting antisemitism should be delegated to the Foreign Ministry, whose officials are professionals who know the Jewish communities firsthand.\n\n\"The Ministry for Diaspora Affairs and Combatting Antisemitism is redundant. A small example of just how much so - A few months ago, we noted in another report that the link provided on their website in English for reporting antisemitic incidents leads to an empty page. It made headlines in the media. And what happened? Nothing. No one bothered to fix it. It still leads to an empty page. There are no limits to the negligence and lack of professionalism.\" According to Shavit, \"one of the biggest challenges of our time is how to mobilize support for the fight against antisemitism without making it the definer of Jewish identity.\"\n\nComments by ADL CEO\n\nJonathan Greenblatt, the CEO and national director of the ADL, commented, \"The aftermath of Hamas's horrific attack on Israel on October 7 was followed by a tsunami of hate against Jewish communities worldwide. Unprecedented levels of antisemitism have surged globally in the streets of London, New York, Paris, Santiago, Johannesburg, and beyond. This year's report is incredibly alarming, with documented unprecedented levels of antisemitism, including in the US, where 2023 saw the highest number of antisemitic incidents in the US ever recorded by ADL.\n\nGreenblatt added, \"We are proud to partner with Tel Aviv University on this important annual report, which will be used to inform governments and civil society and help push back against antisemitic trends.\"\n\nIn a special essay for the report, he declared that \"antisemitism isn't just an abstract issue. It is a real-life threat to Jewish life in America and Jews around the world, and our history teaches us that we do not have the luxury to be indifferent when moments like these occur. That means we need to be clear-eyed about the threats we face and have the determination to confront them.\"\n\nCotler offers in the report a historical and political analysis of the development of present-day antisemitism and a detailed 11-point plan for trying to combat the phenomenon around the world. He warns, \"The explosion of antisemitism is a threat not only to Jews, but is toxic to our democracies, an assault on our common humanity, and a standing threat to human security - in a word, the bloodied canary in the mineshaft of global evil. Jews alone cannot combat it, let alone defeat it. What is required is a constituency of conscience - a whole of government, whole of society commitment and action to fight this oldest and most lethal of hatreds.\"\n\nThe report includes in-depth essays on different countries, as well as a study on the profiles of the spreaders of antisemitic content on X, formerly Twitter. The essays examine, among other issues, the proliferation of antisemitic discourses in the Arab world, Turkey, and Iran following October 7 and trace their roots. It also argues that \"any future diplomatic negotiations must prioritize the uprooting of antisemitism from Arab societies.\"\n\nHate speech was articulated already before Israel launched its campaign in Gaza, including on leading university campuses, and thus urged against seeing the recent wave of antisemitism as an emotional response to the war, the report continues. \"Some antisemitic attackers emphasize their problem is with Israel, not with Jews, and then attack Jews and Jewish institutions.\"\n\nAntisemitism from both sides of the political aisle\n\nDr. Carl Yonker, a senior researcher and project manager at TAU's Center for the Study of Contemporary European Jewry who wrote a study for the report on antisemitism in the US, said, \"Contrary to the conventional wisdom, post-October 7 incidents were also led from the far right in America. Neo-Nazis, white supremacists, and others glorified Hamas and used the war to spread antisemitic propaganda along with conspiracy theories, according to which the crisis will advance the replacement of the white majority in the West by migrants from the Middle East. The fringes in the US are encroaching on the political center from both right and left, making combatting antisemitism much trickier.\"\n\nThe impossibility of reliably tracking antisemitic incidents in Russia at the present is also discussed. An extensive essay examines the antisemitic rhetoric of the Russian dictator Vladimir Putin and members of his regime. \"At the beginning of 2023, the Chief Rabbi of Moscow in exile, Pinchas Goldschmidt, warned that Jews should leave Russia before they are scapegoated. Sadly, 2023 did not disprove the words of this wise and courageous religious leader.\"\n\nIn the nine months leading to October 2023, in which no exceptional event happened, most countries with significant Jewish populations saw a rise in the number of antisemitic incidents compared to the same period in 2022, including the US, France, the UK, Australia, Italy, Brazil, and Mexico. \"This means that the war in Gaza helped spread a fire that was already out of control. And it was already out of control despite the significant efforts invested in recent years by governments on educational and legal initiatives aimed at reversing the trend.\n\nFighting antisemitism is failing\n\nTwo years ago, this report stated that the fight against antisemitism was failing. The data from 2023 show that bad has come to worse. It is time for soul searching. More slogans and more speeches will certainly not do the job. It is equally naive to think that more budgets will solve everything. There is a need for careful, independent, and transparent studies of the methods applied so far to inform which are effective and which are not, which need to be expanded, and which should be neglected. The obvious must be mentioned: As in the case of any social evil, the test for programs applied against antisemitism is whether they lead to a decline in the phenomenon. The distress and danger Jews currently experience should not be overstated.\"\n\nThe authors continued that \"there is no good racism and bad racism, racism that can be ignored and racism that cannot. Racism directed against groups considered socially strong is as destructive as any other form of racism. No society can be truly free and peaceful if its Jews are subjected to intimidation and harassment based on their ethnicity and beliefs.\n\n\"An important lesson to draw from the Gaza war is that peace in the Middle East will not be achieved unless antisemitism is firmly uprooted from Arab societies, they continued. Demanding actions to that effect should become fundamental in all future diplomatic processes. Social media is a primary tool in the present-day proliferation of antisemitism. It allows extremist evil-wishers to spread falsehoods, defamations, and conspiracy theories without being held accountable. No significant improvement in the fight against antisemitism will be accomplished unless those who provide platforms for hate speech will be made to apply responsible editorial discretion, including such that hinders the abuse of social media by global agents of chaos.\"\n\nWhat constitutes antisemitism?\n\nCriticizing Israel, including in harsh terms, is not antisemitism. Seeking its elimination as the national home of the Jewish people, including through the false argument that it is an unlawful colonial enterprise, is antisemitic, the report continues.\n\n\"The historical facts are that the Land of Israel is the ancestral homeland of Jews, where they maintained a continued presence, and where, with the rise of Zionism, they purchased the lands on which they settled and were given the right to a state by an overwhelming majority of the UN General Assembly. Those who believe that all the above does not make Israel in its recognized borders a legitimate state should realize that unless they come up with a good explanation why their historical-moral criteria apply to Israel only, they will not avoid the label they try to disavow.\"\n\nTAU's contribution to writing the report was by the Center for the Study of Contemporary European Jewry with the

The connections between campus protests organized by Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP), Jewish Voice for Peace, far-left extremists, and communist organizations are now inescapable:\n\nAnecdotal reports continue to indicate that more Jewish students are shunning elite universities in favor of institutions in the south. A letter from the heads of Israeli universities also decried the rise in antisemitism at American institutions, and offered assistance to Jewish students and faculty who wished to join their institutions. Brandeis University also extended its deadline for students to apply to transfer, specifically in order to allow as many Jewish students as necessary to relocate.\n\nStudent governments and other groups also continue efforts to remove Jewish members, including at the University of California at Santa Barbara, where a senator and the president were targeted. At Vanderbilt University the Multicultural Leadership Council also denied membership to Students Supporting Israel. Israeli or Jewish events have also been disrupted or shut down by protestors\n\nStudent BDS resolutions and referendums greatly accelerated in April. Only a selection are presented here:\n\nAn important student government resolution was approved at Rutgers University that made Palestinians' victimization at the hands of the Jews an official doctrine.\n\nStudent demands for divestment have been mostly rejected by university administrators and trustees, including at the University of California. At Yale University, the university announced that it would not divest from military industries, but would liquidate holdings in companies retailing \"assault weapons\" to the public.\n\nOngoing \"negotiations\" between administrations and protest organizers, however, produced concessions on divestment or ties to Israel to restore calm, particularly at smaller institutions like Bryn Mawr College. At Portland State University, the university decided to \"temporarily\" halt donations from aerospace giant Boeing as a concession to students.\n\nOther examples of appeasement emerged at Northwestern University, where the administration negotiated an agreement with protestors to disperse most of their encampment in exchange for an \"advisory committee on investment responsibility,\" which includes students and faculty. Additional concessions include advising employers not to rescind job offers and to support two Palestinian faculty and five students at university expense. At Brown University, the administration agreed that the university corporation would hold a vote on divestment in October in return for students ending their encampment.\n\nFaculty remain at the forefront of promoting campus anti-Israel bias and antisemitism. Only a sample are presented here:\n\nIn one incident, the York University Department of Politics proposed that any defense of Israel be regarded as \"anti-Palestinian, Islamophobic, and anti-Arab.\" The report called for \"a departmental definition of anti-Palestinian racism,\" since, \"The struggle for Palestinian self-determination will support the liberation of all humans and non-humans from colonial oppression\" and since \"Zionism is a settler colonial project and ethno-religious ideology in service of a system of Western imperialism that upholds global white supremacy.\"\n\nSimilarly, the City University of New York faculty union announced a special meeting to consider five demands for the administration:\n\nIn the international sphere, reports continue regarding growing informal boycotts of Israeli academics and universities. One reports detail how European and American counterparts have ceased collaborations with Israelis, accused them of \"genocide,\" and succumbed to student pressure to disinvite Israeli speakers and collaborators.\n\nAttention also continues to be paid to antisemitism and anti-Israel bias in K-12 education, especially \"ethnic studies\":\n\nOutside of campus, protests earlier in April included the disruption of an Easter Mass at St. Patrick's Cathedral, a New York City fundraiser attended by President Joe Biden, and former presidents Clinton and Obama (at which Jewish women were chased and called \"murderous f****g kikes\"), a sit-in outside the headquarters of Britain's National, Health Service, a sit-in at the US Senate cafeteria at which 50 participants were arrested, and an attack on an Israel-Norway soccer match in Skien, which included fireworks and rocks aimed at police.\n\nAnti-Israel protests in Britain continue every weekend, with infrequent arrests of protestors displaying swastikas and other proscribed symbols.\n\nIn heavily Jewish Teaneck, New Jersey, car caravans of Palestinians from nearby Patterson have become a regular occurrence. In one case, an event featuring Israeli first responders turned into a face-off between pro-Israel and pro-Hamas crowds.\n\nEfforts to isolate Israel economically were the focus of the A15 global protests. Overall, except for the tourism sector, Israel's economy appears to be weathering the Gaza war, including in the high tech and defense sectors. International ratings agencies were split regarding the economic outlook, with S&P following Moody's in downgrading Israel's credit rating. Long-term issues such as war risks, budget deficits, and government expenditures remain the main concerns rather than BDS.\n\nInternational companies have also been targeted by the BDS movement. Some, like Starbucks, have no presence in Israel ,and the boycott was driven purely by rumors and by the perception of support from the company's CEO. One real casualty has been McDonald's, which has been targeted after its Israeli franchisee offered soldiers free meals, leading to widespread boycotts in Asia and a decline in revenue. In April, the conglomerate bought back the franchise after the retirement of its Israeli owner, leading to speculation that the company would withdraw entirely from the Israeli market.\n\nThe tech industry was also the focus of protests, including from Google employees who occupied several New York and California offices, including that of the Google Cloud president to demand the company cease all work in Israel, especially a cloud computing project for the government. Several were arrested, and several dozens were fired.\n\nIreland's sovereign wealth fund divested its holdings of Israeli companies, including banks and supermarket chains, for their operations in the West Bank. The stated rationale was the \"risk profile\" of the companies rather than an explicit political statement. The Irish Communications Workers Union also passed a motion demanding the right for postal workers to not handle mail from Israel.", "source": {"uri": "algemeiner.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Mark Patinkin finds out from a student", "body": "New York Police Dept. bodycam footage reveals officers breaking through barriers from pro-Palestine protesters at New York's Columbia University.\n\nI wondered what it's like to be a Jewish student at Columbia University, a pro-Palestinian epicenter, but I was told most were afraid to speak publicly.\n\nJews there who support Israel have been shunned - even vilified - and many don't want to stick their necks out in the media.\n\nBut, finally, Columbia's Hillel connected me with Yakira Galler.\n\nShe's 20, grew up in Sharon, Massachusetts, and both her parents work in Providence, her dad, Ezra, an ophthalmologist and her mother, Julie, his office manager.\n\nYakira goes to Barnard, Columbia's adjoining sister school. I reached her on campus Thursday, just after the weeks-long tent encampment had been dismantled and more than 100 arrested for occupying the administration building.\n\nBut Yakira told me the campus is still tense and under such a severe lockdown that she's now not allowed to walk the few yards from Barnard to the connected Columbia side.\n\nShe's glad she's at the end of a long, stressful year.\n\nYakira is a freshman, having taken a gap year in Israel after graduating from Gann Academy, a Jewish high school in Waltham. When Barnard accepted her, she embraced the idea of a rigorous school known for its social consciousness.\n\n\"I'm a Democrat, I'm a liberal, I'm a leftist,\" she told me. She's even in favor of a Palestinian state. \"I'm also a Zionist, and those things don't contradict each other.\"\n\nBut at Columbia, she said, most leftist students see her as a pariah on the side of the \"oppressor\" because she backs Israel's right to defend itself - and to even exist.\n\nI asked her for the kind of moments that have made her uncomfortable on her own campus.\n\nYakira remembers being in a library classroom early last December when yet another pro-Palestinian rally unfolded on the lawn outside. It became loud and disruptive, which by then was common. In many cases, she said, students would walk out of classes, or not attend them, to join protests.\n\nAfter her class was over, Yakira went outside with some Jewish friends and approached a woman protester with a \"Ceasefire Now\" sign. Many around her wore keffiyehs and had their faces covered, which Yakira found intimidating, and still does today.\n\n\"I want a ceasefire, too,\" Yakira told the woman, a fellow student, \"but how do you think that's possible when Hamas just rejected one?\"\n\nThe woman, said Yakira, scoffed at her and aggressively said, \"I'm not talking to you.\"\n\n\"It made me realize they just wanted to be chanting and yelling and creating disruption,\" Yakira told me, \"and there's no space for debating this conflict.\"\n\nIt was upsetting to be barked at like that by a school peer. Yakira walked away on the verge of tears. She went back into the library to study, putting in AirPods with loud music to drown out the rally, but it didn't work, in part because by now there were protesters on the library balconies echoing the chants.\n\nWithin a month or so after Oct. 7, Yakira felt that the Israelis kidnapped into Gaza were being forgotten, so she joined other Jewish students at a weekly outdoor \"Hostage Table,\" giving out pins and dog tags to raise awareness. They shared that Arab Bedouins and Thais had also been murdered that day by Hamas.\n\nBut few fellow students at Columbia wanted to hear that. Many of those going past simply glared.\n\n\"One person walked by and just screamed,\" said Yakira.\n\nA few weeks ago, she and other Jewish students organized a silent protest, standing outside to focus on sexual violence against Israelis on Oct. 7 and those in captivity. One of their signs said, \"#MeToo unless you are a Jew.\" She and the others put symbolic tape over their mouths, and Yakira held a sign saying, \"Hamas weaponizes sexual assault.\"\n\nSome thanked them, but many others scowled and said, \"Free Palestine.\"\n\nAs the pro-Palestinian tent encampment was put up a few weeks ago and protests became more tumultuous, things for Yakira and other Jewish students became especially difficult. She often had to go past the tents and hundreds of masked protesters to get to class. It was upsetting to see Columbia faculty join the rallies. Although proud of her heritage, Yakira at times avoided sharing her Jewish background, and that she has relatives in Israel.\n\nAt Brown: After talking to these students, Mark Patinkin says Brown has an antisemitism problem\n\nFinally, Columbia banned outsiders without IDs from campus, but big crowds began to rally just outside the main gate. Hundreds of Pro-Palestinian students joined on the inside doing loud call-and-response chants.\n\nSome of the chants were intimidating, including: \"We don't want no Zionists here ... We love Hamas ... Keep on bombing Tel Aviv.\"\n\nThere's a now-viral photo of a woman at a Columbia protest with a sign about Hamas's military wing saying, \"Qasam's next targets,\" and an arrow pointed at nearby Jewish students. Some of those students were Yakira's friends.\n\n\"It was like a war zone in a lot of ways,\" Yakira told me.\n\nThe anti-Israel atmosphere - often anti-Jewish too, she feels - left Yakira constantly anxious, her stomach in knots. It was hard to sleep, both because of stress and the chanting going past 2 a.m. near her dorm.\n\nThen Yakira told me something unexpected. Although she felt the students occupying the administration building should have been removed, she was upset at some of the images of their arrests.\n\n\"It was hard seeing my peers thrown on the ground,\" Yakira said. \"They're still my peers.\"\n\nWith the encampment now gone, the campus, she said, was weirdly quiet on the Thursday when we spoke, though many students are still wearing keffiyehs, masks and \"Stop the genocide,\" stickers.\n\nOn campus: Brown University protesters agree to clear encampment. In exchange, Brown will vote on divestment.\n\nI asked Yakira if she had lost friends over this.\n\n\"Yes,\" she said. \"People have stopped speaking to me. Giving me the silent treatment. Like I would walk by them, and they'd avoid eye contact. I've been estranged in many ways.\"\n\nHas this changed how she as a Jewish student feels about Columbia and Barnard?\n\n\"I don't feel welcome here,\" said Yakira. \"I feel that I'm an 'other.'\" And she often has not felt safe on campus.\n\nBut she loves her classes and the friends she still has. She plans to stay.\n\n\"This is my school,\" said Yakira, \"this is my community. I won't be scared away. I hope this will pass and the war in Gaza will end and we'll be able to heal and move forward.\"\n\nBut right now, Yakira Galler is glad her freshman year is over.\n\nAnd that she'll soon be able to leave behind Columbia's anti-Israel atmosphere - often anti-Jewish - and come home.", "source": {"uri": "eu.providencejournal.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Associated Press"}, "authors": [],

And we feel that because we have so many Jewish students, we'd like to make them feel comfortable and contribute to the university's diversity.\"\n\nThey're also looking to maintain a safe space for Jewish faculty and students in the wake of the nationwide campus protests, which have grown far more heated elsewhere.\n\n\"We urgently appeal for your leadership to address the growing climate of intimidation on higher education campuses,\" the group wrote in a letter to UNLV President Keith Whitfield and senior administrators on Tuesday. \"We have been closely monitoring the current situation nationally from the context of the past six and one-half months at UNLV, and we are troubled by some past incidents of disruptive behavior as possible harbingers of even more disruptive behavior to come.\"\n\nThe letter was signed by Robert Levrant, chair of the Jewish Faculty and Staff Group. He also is a member of the Jewish Affinity Group and the director of UNLV's Strategic Initiatives and Osher Lifelong Learning Institute.\n\n\"Until Oct. 7, I think we felt OK,\" Levrant said. \"I think we felt maybe a sense of complacency, a sense of safety that we no longer feel.\n\n\"I don't necessarily feel unsafe here,\" he continued. \"But I think a few months ago, no one would have said they felt unsafe at Columbia or UCLA -- and we do have people who feel unsafe.\"\n\nTaking action\n\nIt was an intended show of support that Levrant couldn't fully support.\n\nIn the wake of the Oct. 7 terrorist attacks, UNLV's president issued an open letter condemning \"the atrocities committed against civilians, including Americans, by Hamas in Israel.\"\n\n\"While I don't pretend to understand all of the nuances and variables involved in this longstanding conflict,\" he added later, \"as a society, we must and we do condemn acts of terrorism.\"\n\nFor Levrant, though, the statement didn't offer the kind of unqualified support that other victimized individuals or communities had received from the university in the wake of previous horrific acts.\n\n\"It was a sense that other groups had gotten much more of a, 'Hey, racism is wrong.' 'Homophobia is wrong,' \" he said. \"With this, we got more of a, 'It's complicated.'\"\n\nSimilarly, Gregory Brown said he felt Whitfield's statement could have offered more direct support and outreach for UNLV's Jewish population.\n\n\"That initial statement, it was really not addressing either the fact that there were people on campus directly implicated -- Israeli students, Israeli faculty -- or that the Jewish-American community is a diaspora community and that people have family ties, professional ties, personal ties, emotional ties to Israel,\" he said. \"The moment really felt like a missed opportunity for the university to do what it generally considers an important priority, which is to create an environment that's inclusive, an environment that fosters the manifestation of those identities, especially when we're talking about this in the days after the attacks.\"\n\nLevrant, Brown and other staff and faculty members began addressing their concerns in a group chat, and with organizational support from Jewish Nevada, created what would become the Jewish Affinity Group.\n\n\"The goal became to not just respond to the statement,\" Brown explained, \"but to really think about what we can do to address the underlying concerns and advance the underlying goals, which is to have a greater awareness of the presence and value of the Jewish community on campus, to advance how that contributes to our educational role and also to this very important community engagement mission that the university has.\"\n\nIn December, they met with the university provost and were formally recognized by UNLV two months later.\n\nBeyond establishing a Jewish studies program, the group aims to provide a greater sense of community for Jewish students and faculty and play a larger role in the university's diversity and inclusion efforts.\n\nInstead, it became an unlikely political flashpoint.\n\nOn Feb. 27, Asaf Peer, an associate professor in the physics department at Israel's Bar-Ilan University, was scheduled to speak at UNLV.\n\nBut shortly into his speech, Peer, who is Jewish, was interrupted by pro-Palestinian protesters.\n\nCampus police were called; the lecture was canceled.\n\n\"After conferring with University Police, UNLV faculty decided to pause the lecture by Prof. Asaf Peer as a result of the interruptions,\" UNLV said in a statement to the Las Vegas Review-Journal. \"Even though the professor said he never felt unsafe, University Police, as a precaution only, accompanied him as he left the building.\"\n\nPeer completed his lecture virtually and two days later returned for in-person talk that went uninterrupted.\n\nThe incident highlights how UNLV isn't immune to the tensions roiling universities nationwide.\n\nBrown experienced these tensions at the University of Southern California last week during a scholarly gathering that was disrupted by protesters.\n\n\"I was there for an academic conference that had to be relocated because a small minority of people felt interrupting university operations was their goal,\" he noted. \"The host university's goal was to be open.\"\n\nFor him, there's a clear antidote to this kind of divisiveness: inclusion, an open dialogue, core tenets of the Jewish Affinity Group.\n\nTo that end, the Jewish Affinity Group has already had some success. Before Thursday's discussion, it held two other well-attended events that went smoothly -- a panel on Jewish identities on campus and a luncheon on what a Jewish studies program at UNLV might entail.\n\n\"Not a single person came to disrupt or interfere in any way with us,\" Levrant said.\n\nFor Levrant, trying to further foster this understanding via the Jewish Affinity Group isn't just educational -- it's personal.\n\n\"Oct. 7 was the largest number of Jews killed in one day since the Holocaust,\" he noted. \"We hear the word 'genocide' being tossed around a lot, but we're just a generation removed from having experienced it.\n\n\"I've been Jewish my whole life,\" he said. \"I'm 53 years old. This is the first time I've been scared. For me, it's like, I needed to take a stand. I needed to show my children that I'm willing to do this. I needed to put my foot down and say, 'I'm here.' \"", "source": {"uri": "reviewjournal.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Las Vegas Review-Journal"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

On the South Lawn in front of Butler Library was the tent city of students with the misguided idea to boycott Israel.\n\nBut far worse, outside the gates on Broadway, exercising their First Amendment right to spread hate under the watchful eyes of a great many NYPD cops, were a hardcore bunch of anti-Israel zealots (be they students or not), with their loud, nasty chants and their banging drums. Their message was that Israel is committing genocide in Gaza, a horrendous lie, and the world's only Jewish state must be destroyed. It was a lot less pro-Palestinian than viciously anti-Israel and antisemitic.\n\nAnd so once again, the free Palestine movement is infected with antisemitism, the socialism of fools, an embarrassing and disgusting reality that they will not admit.\n\nColumbia President Minouche Shafik was correct to tell Congress that there is Jew-hatred on campus and some Jewish students are fearful, with a campus rabbi suggesting they stay away.\n\nYes, we know that there are Jewish students in the tent city, but the presence of an anti-Zionist Jewish minority -- which has always existed -- does not whitewash the antisemitism coursing through the anti-Israel protests at Columbia and elsewhere, on and off campus.\n\nA lot of people despise Israeli Prime Minister Bibi Netanyahu and want him out of office and maybe even locked up in jail. That might constitute a majority of the Israeli electorate, but those Israelis do not want their country wiped off the map.\n\nThere is a great difference in wanting Israel to change its policy in its war with Hamas, in its treatment of Palestinians, in its relations with its Arab neighbors, and wanting there not to be an Israel.\n\nAs for Shafik, she followed up her congressional testimony by suspending the original group in tents for violating university policies (which they were doing) and called the cops to remove the trespassers. That move blew up in her face, causing hateful protesters to appear and demand her head.\n\nLast week, Republican congressmen had gathered on the other side of the street from the noisy protesters to call for Shafik to resign. Later in the day some Democratic congressmen went to campus to show solidarity with Jewish students being targeted. What an awful way to spend Passover.\n\nEveryone is upset as anti-Israel students feel that their right to legitimate protest (a college tradition) is being impinged, while some Jews on campus are feeling afraid (a tremendous breach of the idea of university) and the professional Israel-haters out in the street raise their voices and the temperature under the protection of the police and the Constitution.\n\nFree speech, even hateful speech, should be respected on and off campus. But intimidation and threats should not be permitted.", "source": {"uri": "yakimaherald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yakima Herald-Republic"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Zionism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Anti-Zionism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_University", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Columbia University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Antisemitism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Lawn", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "South Lawn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_nationalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Palestinian nationalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boycotts_of_Israel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boycotts of Israel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butler_Library", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Butler Library"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Netanyahu", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Benjamin Netanyahu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City_Police_Department", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York City Police Department"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadway_theatre", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Broadway theatre"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "First Amendment to the United States Constitution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jews"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genocide", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Genocide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Jews_in_Poland", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "History of the Jews in Poland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Israel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of Israel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabbi", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rabbi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Socialism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Constitution of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arabs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passover", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Passover"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_speech", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Freedom of speech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Judaism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Judaism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 69}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/yakimaherald.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/6/30/630fe964-08c3-11ef-b78d-57759b7984fa/6633f91a35a7d.image.jpg?crop=1763%2C926%2C0%2C124&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538674", "eventUri": "eng-9538674", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3960784313725491, "wgt": 115, "relevance": 1}

They just want all of the Jews to go ... somewhere else. They chant for the creation of Palestine \"from the river to the sea,\" an explicit call for the end of Israel.\n\nWould Jews be welcome in the Palestinian state? Consider the only Jews in Gaza are Israeli soldiers trying to free Israeli captives.\n\nThey're not antisemitic; they just have an affinity for all the organizations that have spent decades explicitly calling for the murder of Jews and carrying out those crimes whenever possible. They proudly wear headbands of Hamas and fly Hezbollah flags, and, yet we still pretend not to know who they are and what they want. They are terrorist wannabes at best, and they want what all Islamic extremists want: dead Jews.\n\nFor the Daily Wire, Kassy Akiva reported, \"One of the most vocal student activists leading the anti-Israel Gaza Solidarity Encampment at Columbia University, Khymani James, openly stated in a livestream of an official university inquiry in January that 'Zionists don't deserve to live.' \" Only because of the following uproar did Columbia take action, booting James from the university.\n\nAnd yet, the day after Akiva's report was published, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez praised the encampment during a visit, gushing, \"The leadership you have is just so fantastic.\"\n\nOcasio-Cortez, a founding member of the Squad, a group of legislators with a long, problematic history of antisemitism themselves, isn't the only one wholeheartedly supporting the protests. Rep. Ilhan Omar joined the protests after her daughter was suspended for her involvement, and she called some Jewish students \"pro-genocide,\" drawing a deserved rebuke from the Anti-Defimation League.\n\nThe protests aren't just in response to how Israel has handled its operations in Gaza. Their love of terror was immediately evident before Israel launched its response to the attacks of Oct. 7. It's not about what Israel has done or what they have alleged it has done. It's that the Jewish state dares to exist. The Jerusalem Post reported in October, before any Gaza operation began:\n\n\"A tenured professor at New York's Columbia University authored an article praising Hamas' attack on Israeli civilians last Saturday, less than a day after the attacks took place. 'What can motorized paragliders do in the face of one of the most formidable militaries in the world?' asked Joseph Massad, who has taught Modern Arab Politics at Columbia since 1999, in his article for the website Electronic Intifada. 'Apparently much in the hands of an innovative Palestinian resistance.' \"\n\nThe protests taking over America's college campuses can't be more explicit. And their love for terror organizations is reciprocated. Sami Al-Arian, convicted financier of Palestinian Islamic Jihad, tweeted his support of his wife, Nahla, who had set up camp at Columbia's encampment. She knows who her friends are.\n\nIn an email recently, Columbia's president, Minouche Shafik, told the campus community that the pro-Hamas camp and the environment on campus have become intolerable to Jewish students and others. Many Jewish students, at the behest of their rabbi who sent a WhatsApp message to observant students on campus, have already fled. Shafik went on to explain that antisemitic language and actions, not to mention calls for violence, have no place on campus.\n\nThis had to be said because this is the environment that these protests have created.

That doesn't mean they're not right. | Lydia Polgreen", "body": "Editor's note: This was published in the New York Times April 26.\n\nOn Wednesday morning last month, on a corner across the street from Columbia University, a man dressed in black, a huge gold cross around his neck, brandished a sign that featured a bloodstained Israeli flag and the word \"genocide\" in capital letters. He was also shouting at the top of his lungs.\n\n\"The Jews control the world! Jews are murderers!\"\n\nI watched as a pro-Palestine protester approached the man. \"That is horribly antisemitic,\" she said. \"You are hurting the movement and you are not a part of us. Go away.\"\n\nThe man shouted vile, unprintable epithets back at her, but the woman, who told me she had come to New York from her home in Baltimore to support the protesting students, walked away.\n\nHours later, a well-known congressional reporter covering House Speaker Mike Johnson's visit to Columbia's campus posted a photograph of the same man. \"One sign here at the Columbia protest,\" the reporter, Jake Sherman, wrote. \"This man is ranting about Jews controlling the universe.\"\n\nThe man wasn't \"at the Columbia protest.\" The university's campus has been closed to outsiders for over a week -- even as a journalist and an alumnus, I had trouble getting in. He was, several people on social media told Sherman, a well-known antisemitic crank completely unconnected from what was unfolding on campus. Indeed, last week I had seen a man wearing an identical cross carrying a similarly lettered sign that read, \"Google it! Jews vs. TikTok\" protesting outside Donald Trump's criminal trial in lower Manhattan. He was, for the record, standing on the pro-Trump side of the protest area.\n\nBut the incident is emblematic of how difficult it has become to make sense of what is actually happening on college campuses right now. As the protests have spread to dozens of campuses and counting, competing viral clips on social media paint vastly different versions of what's happening inside these pro-Palestine camps. Are they violent conflict zones, filled with militant protesters who hurl antisemitic abuse and threaten Jewish students, requiring, as some political leaders have suggested, deployment of the National Guard? Or is it a giant lovefest of students braiding daisy chains and singing \"Kumbaya\"?\n\nI tried to figure this out the only way I know how: by reporting. I happened to have been on campus on April 18, the day Columbia's president, Minouche Shafik, decided to call in the New York Police Department to clear the protesters from campus, and I returned a week later to spend the day reporting on the protests and the mood on campus.\n\nWhat I saw were moving, creative and peaceful protests by people seeking to end the slaughter in the Gaza Strip, where more than 34,000 people have died, the majority of them women and children. I also saw things that left me quite troubled, and heard from Jewish students both inside and outside the camps navigating a campus fraught with emotions. But while reporting on the protests up close gave me insight into how unsettling some aspects of activism can be, it doesn't mean the protesters' actions are misguided. These young people seek a worthy cause: to end what may be the most brutal military operation for civilians in the 21st century.\n\nIn the days since Shafik called for the NYPD to break up protests, copycat encampments have sprung up on dozens of campuses across the country, and at least 17 of them have faced police intervention. My social media feeds have filled with horrifying images of students and professors being violently dragged away by police. In one especially shocking video from Emory University captured by CNN, a police officer shouted at Caroline Fohlin, a middle-aged economics professor: \"Get on the ground! Get on the ground!\" The officer grabs her and flips her onto the grass as she screams: \"Oh, my God! Oh, my God!\"\n\nOn Wednesday afternoon, during his visit to campus, Johnson made it clear what he thought was happening there. He all but called the university a war zone and declared the protests as antisemitic, conflating, as many proponents of Israel do, opposition to Israel's policies with hatred of Jews. \"It's detestable, as Columbia has allowed these lawless agitators and radicals to take over,\" he said. \"If this is not contained quickly, and if these threats and intimidation are not stopped, there is an appropriate time for the National Guard. We have to bring order to these campuses.\"\n\nWhile Johnson was meeting with a group of Jewish students, I was wandering among the lawless agitators, who have been camping out on a lawn on campus. In one corner of the encampment, a small group of students sat cross legged, discussing the poem \"Kindness\" by Palestinian American poet Naomi Shihab Nye. Another group had broken out art supplies to reapply the paint to their Gaza Solidarity Encampment banner. Others were napping or doing yoga. There was a well-stocked food tent, with options for all -- gluten-free, vegan, nut-free and more. I have spent more than my share of time in war zones. This felt more like an earnest folk music festival.\n\nOn campus, I spoke to Muslim and Arab students who told me how frightened and angry they are. I spoke to Jewish students who participated in the pro-Palestine protests and scoffed at the notion that the protests endanger them. I also spoke to Jewish students who told me that they feel the protests target them as Jews, and make them fear for their safety.\n\nWhether you are watching student protesters on social media or experiencing the protests in person, the way you understand these protests depends on your perception of what they are protesting. It could not be otherwise. If you feel that what is happening in Gaza is a moral atrocity, the student protests will look like a brave stand against American complicity in what they believe is genocide -- and a few hateful slogans amid thousands of peaceful demonstrators will look like a minor detail. If you feel the war in Gaza is a necessarily violent defense against terrorists bent on destroying the Jewish state, the students will seem like collaborators with murderous antisemitism -- even if many of them are Jewish.\n\nI heard both of these perspectives from Columbia students on campus. \"When I sit in statistics class, and I am hearing 'globalize the Intifada,' 'from the river to the sea and so on,' I cannot study and I cannot focus on the class,\" Saar, a junior at Columbia who asked that I not include her last name, told me. \"I don't know who will sit behind me in class, who might follow me after class and God knows what might happen. You're living in fear all the time. People are hiding their faces. You don't know who is who.\"\n\nDavid Pomerantz, a sophomore who was among the group that met with the House speaker, told me that he didn't personally feel he was in imminent danger, but worried about others. \"I think especially my friends who are visibly Jewish, who walk around in kipa, get dirty looks, get chastised for that,\" he said. \"I think they do feel like they're in real physical danger. It's a problem that can't continue.\"\n\nWhile Jewish students who object to the pro-Palestine encampment navigate fear and uncertainty, those inside the camp are facing a different type of threat. I spoke to Jared, a Jewish student participating in the protests. He had given an interview in which his full name appeared, and said someone in his family had received a threatening voicemail.\n\n\"They like to dress us up as a token minority or as self-hating Jews,\" he told me. \"But I was raised as a Jewish person to call attention to injustice whenever I see it. Palestinians should be the focus, not my safety on campus. The only threat to my safety comes from the administration.\"\n\nJust outside the campus gates, the scene was more tense. The protests have become a destination for opportunists of all kinds. Nasty purveyors of chaos. Gavin McInnes, right-wing founder of the Proud Boys, turned up, student journalists reported. On Thursday, Christian nationalists descended on Columbia to stage their own, ostensibly pro-Israel protest, screaming through the campus gates to the student protesters inside: \"You want to camp? Go camp in Gaza!\" according to a reporter on the scene.\n\nAt times I saw pro-Israel protesters seek to provoke pro-Palestine groups into confrontations. A white-haired man in a khaki military-style shirt with a small Israeli flag stitched onto the chest approached a group of protesters I was interviewing just off campus. They were standing around, not chanting or holding signs.\n\n\"Israel has had 400 Nobel Prize winners,\" he falsely claimed (13 Israelis have won the prize), tapping the flag. \"How many has your side won?\"\n\nOne of the protesters, a man with a kaffiyeh wrapped around the top of his head, replied: \"I don't care about Nobel Prizes right now. I care about dead Palestinian babies.\"\n\nInteractions like those make up the flood of \"evidence\" we're seeing online, much of it placed there by the moral combatants themselves. Some videos, like one that supposedly depicted a Jewish Yale student getting stabbed in the eye by a Palestinian flag, turn out to be misleadingly portrayed by the victim. Others depict what appears to be clear harassment of Jewish students, such as the one filmed outside the gates of Columbia's campus where a protester shouted \"go back to Poland,\" at Jewish students, and another declared that Oct. 7 would happen \"10,000 times.\" Many videos show peaceful, even joyful protests, or feature Jewish students who support the pro-Palestine protests and declare that they feel safe on campus.\n\nWhat are we to make of these competing claims? Having spent the past week immersed in these protests, I understand the desire to fix upon some singular piece of evidence that will decode, definitively, their moral core. But there is plenty of evidence ready-made for any side to claim moral high ground here. The camps are on the whole peaceful but it must be acknowledged that problematic things are being said.\n\nOn Thursday, video from January began circulating of one of the student protest leaders at Columbia, Khymani James, saying that \"the same way we are very comfortable accepting that Nazis don't deserve to live, fascists don't deserve to live, racists don't deserve to live, Zionists, they shouldn't live in this world,\" and \"be grateful that I'm not just going out and murdering Zionists.\" On Friday James released a statement apologizing for the video.\n\nOn Monday, after the arrest of more than 100 New York University protesters, demonstrations outside police headquarters went on all night. I live nearby, and went down to see the protest for myself. It was a different vibe from the night the Columbia students had been arrested. There were more chants, delivered with much tighter unison and at greater volume.\n\n\"From the river to the sea, Palestine is almost free,\" one chant went.\n\n\"Move, cops, get out the way, we know you're Israeli trained.\"\n\n\"There is only one solution, intifada revolution,\" went another.\n\nI winced upon hearing the last chant. Not so much the word intifada, which has many meanings and intonations depending on the context. But why choose the word \"solution,\" one so redolent of the Nazis' \"final solution,\" which murdered 6 million Jews across Europe?\n\nWhen the time came for a late-evening prayer, some protesters laid down their banners to use them as prayer rugs, turning toward Mecca, which in this case meant bowing down before a line of police officers in riot gear. After the prayer concluded, some of the men wandered over to the line of officers who stood behind barricades. They singled out one officer in particular, a dark-skinned man who they seemed to think was a fellow Muslim.\n\n\"There's no way he is a Muslim and he supports the killing of 15,000 kids,\" one of the protesters said (it's estimated nearly 14,000 children have been killed in Gaza since the war began). \"Impossible, unless he is not a Muslim.\"\n\n\"May Allah forgive you, bro,\" another said.\n\nThe officer stared straight ahead, betraying no reaction to what he was hearing. Standing next to him was another officer, a Black woman. Another protester seemingly shouted her way: \"Your ancestors are ashamed of you. Your ancestors were murdered by colonizers, and you are here standing with the colonizers.\"\n\nAlmost instinctively, I took umbrage at the sight of a group of light-skinned young men badgering a Black woman doing her job. Personally, I found these tactics unpleasant, even repellent. It made me uncomfortable. I can see how they might make someone feel unsafe. But to me, this discomfort came nowhere near constituting a crisis requiring extraordinary interventions, like bringing in the National Guard.\n\nPretending that there is no antisemitism whatsoever in the movement is foolish and self-defeating. Antisemitism is widespread, not to mention on the American right. It stands to reason that there are some people who hold antisemitic views among a mass movement of protesters.\n\nIt is easy when looking backward to remember the fight for a good cause as pure and untainted, even if it did not seem so at the time. In the same way, we now remember the Vietnam War as an American tragedy. The students at Columbia University who protested it seem, in retrospect, to have been right. But our memories elide some of their more outr\u00e9 tactics. A list of popular chants employed by anti-war protesters at a time when thousands of American soldiers were dying each year fighting in the war included things like \"One side's right, one side's wrong, We're on the side of the Viet Cong!\" and \"Save Hanoi, Lose Saigon, Victory to the Viet Cong!\"\n\nThese slogans are sickening. But by 1968, when the protests reached their peak, the U.S. government had realized, according to the Pentagon Papers, that the war was all but unwinnable. Yet its brutal killing machine ground on for another five years, and an additional 38,000 Americans, and countless more Vietnamese, Cambodian and Laotian people died pointless deaths in a senseless, futile war.\n\nThere are clear signs that Israel is prosecuting a war just as brutal, and unwinnable, as the United States did back then. Some people might not like the slogans, tactics or proposals of today's pro-Palestine protesters. But the truth is that a majority of Americans have qualms about Israel's pitiless war to root out Hamas, whatever the consequences for civilians. As politicians send riot police onto campuses to try to smother a new protest movement, we'd do well to keep in mind why we've forgotten the ugliest aspects of the Vietnam protests: Those memories have been replaced, instead, by an enduring horror at what we did.", "source": {"uri": "seattletimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Seattle Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

California is home to the second largest Jewish population in the U.S., with thriving communities in Los Angeles, San Francisco, San Diego and other parts of the state. This month, we recognize the enduring faith, perseverance, and resilience of the Jewish people and lift up the many ways that Jewish Americans enrich our culture, politics, civil society, and countless other areas.\n\nAs we celebrate these accomplishments, we must also recognize the bigotry and violence that Jews have faced throughout history, and that shamefully persist to this day. Amid brazen displays of antisemitic hate, California is taking action to protect our communities and ensure that future generations never forget the lessons of the past, including the deliberate murder of approximately six million European Jews during the Holocaust.\n\nIn partnership with the Jewish Caucus and other legislative leaders, my Administration has advanced major investments to increase security at houses of worship and other at-risk cultural centers, funded anti-hate programs that combat intolerance and support victims, and launched the CA vs. Hate Resource Line and Network statewide to provide a safe, anonymous reporting option for victims and witnesses of hate acts.\n\nWe have enlisted leading experts to steer our Commission on the State of Hate and the Council on Holocaust and Genocide Education - an important tool to combat the shocking decline in awareness among young people about the horrors of the Holocaust. And we have released California's first-ever plan to counter antisemitism in all its forms, statewide.\n\nCalifornia will continue to lead the fight to confront racial, ethnic and religious hate across our society with education and empathy. This Jewish American Heritage Month, let us pay tribute to the many and varied contributions of the Jewish people to our California story and celebrate our common commitment to pluralism, cultural diversity, and religious freedom.\n\nNOW THEREFORE I, GAVIN NEWSOM, Governor of the State of California, do hereby proclaim May 2024, as \"Jewish American Heritage Month.\"\n\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Great Seal of the State of California to be affixed this 5th day of May 2024.", "source": {"uri": "lapost.us", "dataType": "news", "title": "lapost.us"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jews"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Jews", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "American Jews"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Holocaust", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Holocaust"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_American_Heritage_Month", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jewish American Heritage Month"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gavin_Newsom", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gavin Newsom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "San Diego"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Diego"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacramento,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sacramento, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sacramento, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Jews_in_Europe", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "History of the Jews in Europe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Antisemitism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_society", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Civil society"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrimination", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Discrimination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Organization_for_Women", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Organization for Women"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pluralism_(political_philosophy)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pluralism (political philosophy)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_diversity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cultural diversity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_California", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Governor of California"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_religion", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Freedom of religion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genocide", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Genocide"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Race-Ethnic-Religious_Relations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Race-Ethnic-Religious Relations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Judaism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Judaism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Genealogy/Religions", "label": "dmoz/Society/Genealogy/Religions", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 45}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538674", "eventUri": "eng-9538674", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sacramento, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 114, "relevance": 1}

Stern is the founder and president of the Endowment for Middle East Truth (EMET), a think tank that specializes in the Middle East. She is the author of Saudi Arabia and the Global Terrorist Network (2011).\n\nAnarchy reigns in our universities. Across the country, campuses are exploding with the adolescent rage of a hateful minority. Jewish students are being subjected to a terrifying climate of hatred and fear. Jews are once again the ultimate outsider, the perfect scapegoat, the haters' incarnation of evil.\n\nRemember where all this began: with the horrific and genocidal Oct. 7 Hamas massacre. By Oct. 9, celebrations of the attack had broken out across the U.S. This pro-terrorist movement has now escalated to the extent that many students are afraid to cross campus or the quad while wearing a kippa or a Star of David.\n\nAn Israeli student at Harvard University was only trying to get to class when he was attacked by thugs hiding behind keffiyehs and masks shouting, \"Shame! Shame!\" Other Jewish Harvard students returned for the spring semester to find posters of the hostages held by Hamas defaced with demented slogans like \"Israel did 911\" and \"Fake News!\" Barbarically scrawled on an image of Kfar Bibas, a 9-month-old kidnapped baby, was \"Evidence needed. Head still on.\"\n\nThis was just the beginning. Jewish students are being routinely terrorized, bullied, spat upon, jeered and harassed. According to the ADL, a majority of Jewish students feel uncomfortable with their fellow students even knowing they are Jewish. More than half feel subjected to hostile environments in which they are routinely intimidated and threatened. This was attested to in the riveting testimony of nine courageous students at a House Education and Workforce Committee hearing on March 4.\n\nNoam Barenholtz, a relative of mine who is an undergrad at Yale University, described the situation best in an article in The Yale Daily News:\n\nWelcome to Beinecke Plaza, or as it's now affectionately known, Gaza Solidarity Plaza. If you look to the left, you'll see posters idolizing terrorists like Leila Khaled, who hijacked two planes, and Walid Daqqa, who was convicted of leading the terrorist ring that kidnapped, castrated, gouged out the eyes of, tortured and murdered a 19-year-old Israeli.\n\nLooking right ahead, you'll notice the central flagpole is missing its American flag. That's because in a great act of patriotic fervor, protestors tore it down while the crowd cheered. And they weren't satisfied with just desecrating Yale's American flag: they also ripped an American flag a student was holding. As one protestor told the News, they want to \"divest from the defense of Israel, Ukraine, America and more.\" Supporting your own country is unpopular in the Gaza Solidarity Plaza.\n\nThere's a religious, almost revivalistic atmosphere about the whole scene. Hundreds of people, students, faculty and outside agitators, hold hands, close their eyes, pray in unison and call for violence in Israel. \"Resistance is justified when people are occupied,\" they shout, calling for more terrorism against Israelis, who have, of course, committed the crime of being Jewish instead of Palestinian. Someone hands out propaganda leaflets that, among other antisemitic lies, blame Zionists for the Holocaust. \"Stop genocide,\" everyone chants, as they yell chants that imply that it's the Jews' own fault Hamas wants to kill every one of them.\n\nThe protestors also seem to have a strange relationship with the truth. Right after shouting, \"Intifada, revolution, there is no other solution,\" they sing \"all we want is peace.\" The Intifada, for those unaware, involved bus bombings and terrorists indiscriminately targeting civilians, including tourists, at restaurants and hotels.\n\nThis is why my organization EMET has been working so hard over the past several years to pass the Antisemitism Awareness Act. Many have claimed that the Act is an assault on the First Amendment. Nothing could be further from the truth. As Section 6 of the bill clearly states: \"Nothing in this Act shall be construed to diminish or infringe upon any right under the First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States.\"\n\nTo appreciate the necessity of this Act, simply substitute the word \"black,\" \"gay\" or \"Hispanic\" for the word \"Jew.\" Would it be acceptable to bring a KKK member to campus who says, \"We need a million more lynchings of blacks\"? Obviously not. So, why is it okay for students to shout, \"We need a million more Oct. 7's\" or \"Jews, go back to Poland\"?\n\nWe are not dealing with a rational policy debate over a two-state solution. We are dealing with murderous loathing of the very existence of the State of Israel and the Jews as a whole. It is a violent assault on Jewish students for the unspeakable crime of being Jews.\n\nThis is an inferno that has been allowed to burn for far too long. It threatens not just Jewish students and the State of Israel, but the United States itself. It's time we put a stop to it. The U.S. Senate can help do so by passing the Antisemitism Awareness Act.", "source": {"uri": "jns.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Jewish News Syndicate"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Columbia University was at the center of attention. We could hardly believe our ears when we heard the slogans shouted by hundreds of students on campus, and even more radically outside the university gates.\n\nJewish students were harassed, beaten, and prevented from entering some of the spaces on campus. Slogans such as \"From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free!\" and \"Globalize the Intifada\" were heard at many American universities. The first slogan takes up almost verbatim the wording of the Hamas charter of 2017, which calls for the \"liberation\" of the territory on which Israel is located. What else can this mean other than the desire to eradicate Israel, and at least the acceptance of murder and ethnic cleansing against Jews as part of this \"liberation\"?\n\nHamas has not only repeatedly affirmed this goal verbally and in writing, but put it into practice to the best of its ability on October 7, 2023. And Hamas has vowed that as long as it retains power, it will try to repeat October 7 over and over.\n\nAnyone who does not want to be misunderstood should therefore explicitly distance themselves from Hamas. But the protesters are not doing that.\n\nThe call to \"globalize the intifada\" is no less murderous. Both the first and second intifadas were violent, and Israeli civilians were targeted -- in caf\u00e9s, buses, and on the street. This terror is now to be globalized?\n\nMy university, Indiana University in the Midwest, is not exactly known as a trouble spot. Still, there have been some protests by students and professors here. We are not an Ivy League university, but one of the Big Ten research universities, known for the Jacobs School of Music, the Kelly School of Business, the McKinsey Institute, and the Maurer School of Law, among others.\n\nAround 10 percent of the almost 50,000 students on our campus in Bloomington are Jewish. Since April 25, there has been an encampment \"for unconditional solidarity with Palestine\" opposite the Chabad House, where many Jewish students come and go. Some of the slogans, chanted verbally and put on posters, seem to be aimed directly at Jews.\n\nNot all of the slogans are implicitly murderous. Some merely demonize Israel -- for example, the claim that Israel is committing genocide in Gaza, which is presented as an indisputable fact through constant repetition. You can show solidarity with the Palestinian victims of the war (started by Hamas), you can condemn the war, you can be very partial to the Palestinians -- but the accusation of genocide is slander.\n\nThe false claim to genocide is so pernicious, because it justifies all the hate directed at Israel -- and at those who don't explicitly condemn Israel.\n\nThere is a certain logic to this. If one is truly convinced that Israel is in the process of deliberately exterminating an entire people, then not only is Israel is reprehensible, but all those people who support and normalize Israel, or are Zionists themselves, are evil -- that means most Jews.\n\nThe dynamic is similar to the medieval accusation of ritual murder. Anyone who was really convinced that Jews were murdering Christian children in order to use their blood for their rituals understandably wanted to put an end to it by any means necessary -- even with violence. \"Resistance by all means\" does not allow for criticism of the barbarity of Hamas.\n\nNot all students who write and shout such slogans are aware of their meaning, and their effect on Jewish students.\n\nI spoke to students who held up a poster that equated campus police, the KKK, and \"IOF\". But it took one of the masked organizers, who came running to block our conversation, to clarify what IOF meant. The students didn't know. \"Israel Offence Forces or Israel Occupying Forces\" -- he wasn't quite sure either. But the message that comes across to the Jewish students who pass by these posters is that the country they feel deeply connected to is being demonized in a way that condemns them at the same time.\n\nMany of the protesting students may be astonishingly ignorant and naive. Not so the organizers. There has been a rapid, sectarian radicalization among them over the past six months. Shortly after October 7, I had a discussion with the president of the Palestine Solidarity Committee (PSC) at our university on the university radio station. Even though we disagreed on many points, he condemned Hamas, at least in private conversation. And he asked Jewish acquaintances whether they were doing okay. A week ago, I looked at his Twitter profile. \"Glory to Hamas\" was written there. For him, Israel is \"a demonic, irredeemable society that never has and never will have ever [have] a single right to exist.\" He equates Zionists, i.e. all those who do not condemn Israel, with the Nazis. Zionists, he writes, are \"indigenous to hell.\"\n\nThe PSC plays a key role in calling for the campus protests, and regularly reports on the protest camp on its Instagram page. There is a lot of applause for this -- also from an Iranian account called \"Mahdi_Alavi\". He encourages students to read Ayatollah Khamenei's letter to the youth of Europe and North America. There were love and applause emojis in the comments, but no objections.\n\nAnother key leader of the protests, who is particularly good at reaching other students via megaphone, also provides an insight into his thinking on social media. He writes about the Israeli army on X: \"They lied about mass rape so they themselves could mass rape,\" and has denied the unimaginably brutal sexual violence of the murderers of October 7. He also takes a liking to Hamas. It is \"morally superior to Israel in every way that matters.\"\n\nWhat is the answer to such pro-Hamas propaganda? The Jewish students played loud music by Jewish-American musicians such as Matisyahu and Israeli pop songs, drew attention to the hostages, and posed with Israeli flags in front of the encampment where implicit and explicit Hamas sympathizers were present.\n\nA similar response came from Rabbi Levi Cunin. The group \"Faculty & Staff for Israel\" had called for a rally on May 2. A politics professor known at the university for being anti-Israel and tearing down posters of the hostages filmed the entire event, possibly to intimidate participants. When Rabbi Cunin, while giving a speech, became aware of him, he turned to him and shouted in his face \"And when there are antisemites who come to [our] anti-Hamas rally, what do you say? Am Israel Chai!\" Long live the people of Israel.\n\nAnd indeed they shall.", "source": {"uri": "algemeiner.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Algemeiner"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Peterson has said that most people are wrong in imagining they would be Oskar Schindler, the industrialist who risked his life to shelter approximately 1,100 Jews during the Holocaust. It is far more likely that they would be silent or even participate in the mass murder.\n\nRecently, I joined thousands of Christians at Columbia University to stand in solidarity with the Jewish community. We did so due to the antisemitic demonstrations now spreading across U.S. campuses.\n\nWe worshiped, prayed and marched around the perimeter of the university. Whenever I looked behind me, I saw the entire block flooded with American and Israeli flags. It might have been one of the most incredible sights I have ever witnessed.\n\nAt Columbia, Yale, MIT and other top universities, anti-Israel protestors have not only called for violence against Jews but physically assaulted and intimidated identifiably Jewish students. This is not a new trend. American students have been primed to celebrate terrorism against Israel and Jews for decades. The silence from mainstream media and our politicians is deafening.\n\nJust a few examples: At Yale, a Jewish student was stabbed in the eye with a Palestinian flag. Another was encircled by protestors who prevented him from entering campus. At Columbia, a pro-Hamas student pointed a sign towards Jewish students that read, \"Al-Qassam's next target\" (Al-Qassam is Hamas's terrorist wing). A Jewish student's Israeli flag was set on fire and he was chased off the grounds.\n\nColumbia has announced it will conduct classes remotely due to the violence. At Yale, almost 50 people were arrested after more than 100 arrests earlier that week at Columbia. At Columbia, protestors set up a \"Gaza Solidarity Encampment,\" complete with dozens of tents and Palestinian flags. Michigan University jumped on the bandwagon with its own \"Liberated Encampment Zone,\" where pamphlets proclaiming \"Death to America\" and calling for a third intifada were handed out.\n\nThese antisemitic demonstrations, which not coincidentally began on the eve of Passover, are a new low in a long line of pro-Palestinian protests that have taken place on American campuses since Oct. 7. The antisemitic students involved refuse to condemn Hamas, overtly celebrate the Oct. 7 atrocities and parrot terrorist propaganda. All of this has gone largely unchallenged.\n\nWe must ask, when did our moral compass shatter? Why are we yielding to genocidal terror supporters?\n\nIn Dec. 2023, we witnessed the then-presidents of Harvard and UPenn, as well as the still-sitting president of MIT, state before a congressional hearing that calls for the genocide of Jews only violated their universities' policies \"depending on the context.\" This total moral bankruptcy was irrefutable and disturbing proof of the rotted values of our academic institutions, which have also bred far-left ideologies like DEI that pander to Marxist ideologies of perpetual victimhood.\n\nHigher education's anti-morality has now allied itself with Islamist antisemitism, paving the way for yet another iteration of the racist motif of Jews as the world's ultimate oppressors. This alliance between far-left ideologues and Muslim antisemites is destroying the credibility of our premiere educational institutions and our society is silent.\n\nWho will speak out for the Jewish community?\n\nChristians must stand with the people whose values are the foundation of our civilization. The West\u202fwas built\u202fon Judeo-Christian principles. Today, those who reject those principles\u202fare yet again revolted\u202fby the people to whom God revealed his law.\n\nThis is the moment for Christians to join in prayer and worship, and march in solidarity with Israel. We must march and pray wherever antisemitism raises its head, including on the campuses of Yale and Columbia. Unopposed antisemitism is an unmistakable sign of cultural decay. Now is the time for a new generation of leaders to rise to restore and heal our troubled land.", "source": {"uri": "jns.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Jewish News Syndicate"}, "authors": [],

Yet you continue to claim to speak for all Jews. Keep our names out of your mouths. You, who called us 'Judenrat,' put us on lists of 'bad Jews,' and cheered the brutalization of our comrades, do not represent us,\" the message read.\n\nCOLUMBIA CRACKS DOWN ON PROTESTERS, THREATENS SUSPENSION AS DEADLINE LOOMS\n\n\"While you repeatedly cried wolf with claims that anti-Zionist speech was antisemitic, which diluted the very real instances of antisemitism, we shared uplifting, welcoming Shabbat services in the Gaza solidarity Encampment. While you threatened doxxing and disciplinary actions, we found community in the encampment and imagined a more just world,\" the email continued. \"Our safety cannot be predicated on the oppression of others, whether campus protesters or Palestinians. No Jew is safe until everyone is safe, and no Jew is free until Palestine is free.\"\n\nThe group also pushed back against concerns over the safety of Jewish students and faculty, claiming that they are only being used as a \"pretext for Columbia's violence.\"\n\n\"We have repeated to the point of exhaustion that the protection of Jewish students and faculty is a dangerous, flimsy pretext for Columbia's violence. By now, it is abundantly clear that this excuse is a gross perversion of the truth. This excuse has been weaponized by white Christian nationalists, including those in Congress, whose main motivations are dismantling diversity initiatives and promoting a Jewish majority in Israel to initiate the rapture.\"\n\nFox News Digital reached out to Columbia Law and its National Lawyers Guild chapter for a comment.\n\nAccording to the New York chapter for the National Lawyer's Guild's website, its mission is \"to provide fellowship for those who seek excellence in the practice of law and who embrace a radical vision of economic, social and environmental justice. A core tenet of our practice is to provide mass defense to these movements and to victims of police repression.\"\n\nIn response o the message, Conference of European Rabbis Chairman Rabbi Pinchas Goldschmidt told Fox News Digital, \"It is reckless for Columbia Law's National Lawyers Guild group to throw around words such as safety and freedom when the message they are communicating directly threatens the safety and freedom of Jewish students on campus, and more broadly, all Jews across the United States and around the world.\"\n\nHe continued, \"While I agree that Jews are not safe at Columbia or many other hundreds of campuses across the US, it is not for the reason cited in this letter, but rather, it is simply for the fact that our mere existence seems to pose an existential threat to the groups spewing hatred towards Jewish people. As someone who knows first-hand the power of words, I urge those writing letters such as this one to think twice before pressing send.\"\n\nOlami Executive Vice President Rabbi David Markowitz added, \"What we have learned over the last couple of weeks is that Columbia University is ground zero of the violent campus protests across the US. When Columbia set up encampments other universities followed, when Columbia students and others stormed and occupied school buildings, other universities followed.\"\n\n\"This latest statement from Columbia Law's National Lawyers Guild chapter appears to be another escalation that we can expect to follow on other campuses. Escalating calls for the destruction of university property, and illegal encampments have now stepped up to direct threats. We need to learn the lessons of the last few months and stop this before it gets worse. There can be zero tolerance for threats, hatred or violence of any kind,\" he concluded.\n\nApproximately 300 people were arrested at Columbia and nearby City College on Tuesday night, with preliminary charges that ranged from trespassing to criminal mischief to burglary, according to police.\n\nCOLUMBIA LAW REVIEW EDITORS URGE SCHOOL TO CANCEL FINALS AFTER POLICE RAID LEFT STUDENTS 'HIGHLY EMOTIONAL'\n\nMany of the protesters in Hamilton Hall were not students at the university, but outside agitators, NYPD Deputy Commissioner of Public Information Tarik Sheppard told \"Your World Cavuto\" on Thursday.\n\n\"They are professionals,\" he said. \"They may just fly in for a day or two and leave. You'll see them traveling around the country, and they have funding.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nFox News' Jeffrey Clark contributed to this report.", "source": {"uri": "foxnews.com",

Although the events were not explicitly linked, there was overlap among participants, with the workers' rally expressing unity with Palestine.\n\n...\n\n\"Our SJP local is answering a call which came down from the SJP National, which came down from organizers in Palestine and in the Palestinian Youth Movement,\" said Dax, a participant and media representative for the encampment.\n\nThe Times of Israel noted SJP's demands:\n\nUnder its call for a \"complete academic boycott,\" SJP demands that the California university, \"Cut ties UC wide with all zionist organizations -- including study abroad programs, fellowships, seminars, research collaborations and universities. Cut ties with the Hellen Diller foundation, Koret foundation, Israel Institute and Hillel International.\"\n\n...\n\n\"Three of the four organizations cited in the academic boycott demand by encampment activists at UCSC are Jewish charities and communal groups,\" the Bay Area JCRC writes on X, formerly Twitter.\n\n\"They are pillars of the Jewish community. This isn't just about opposing Israel's Gaza actions but seems aimed at Jewish institutions, revealing underlying antisemitism,\" the Jewish group adds.\n\nAs local Bay Area Jewish leaders noted, Hillel is simply a Jewish organization that provides religious and cultural services to Jews on campus, worldwide.\n\nActivists elsewhere have made similar demands. At UC Riverside, SJP demanded a commitment to boycott Sabra hummus. Sabra is an American company, but the word \"Sabra\" is a Hebrew term referring to a native-born Israeli.\n\nDespite the fact that the demand violates civil rights laws barring discrimination on the basis of nationality, and also violates California's \"anti-BDS\" law barring boycotts of Israel or other nations, UC Riverside agreed to the demand.", "source": {"uri": "breitbart.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Breitbart"}, "authors": [{"uri": "joel_b_pollak@breitbart.com", "name": "Joel B.

An important lesson to draw from the Gaza war is that peace in the Middle East will not be achieved unless antisemitism is firmly uprooted from Arab societies. Demanding actions to that effect should become fundamental in all future diplomatic processes.\"\n\nBefore we continue to the report's press release, may I suggest that TAU and the ADL should have started with something easier than uprooting Arab antisemitism - perhaps reversing the effects of climate change, or clearing tons of plastic garbage that pollute our oceans.\n\nRabbi Shimon bar Yochai, who later starred as the central character in the Zohar, is quoted by Midrash Sifri: \"Rabbi Shimon ben Yochai said, it is known Halacha that Esau hates Jacob.\"\n\nEsau in this context represents all the Gentiles, and Jacob is all the Jews, and the normative state of things is, according to Rabbi Shimon, that the Gentiles hate Jews. Hatred of Jews is part of nature, the default state of the cosmos, like rain and sun, winter and summer, the fruits of the trees, the birds and the bees, life, and especially death. And as we cannot change the weather, no matter how much we talk about it, we can't do anything against antisemitism either because it is also a force of nature.\n\nThat's why I believe that when we encounter Gentiles who love us sincerely, and God knows there are such wonderful people in the world, we should bow to God and thank Him for this miracle.\n\nWith that in mind, here's the press release about antisemitism and the dire need to uproot it.\n\nThe Annual Antisemitism Worldwide Report reveals that 2023 saw an increase of dozens of percentage points in the number of antisemitic incidents in Western countries in comparison to 2022. A particularly steep increase was recorded following the October 7 attacks, but the first nine months of 2023, before the war started, also witnessed a relative increase in the number of incidents in most countries with large Jewish minorities, including the United States, France, the UK, Australia, Italy, Brazil, and Mexico.\n\n\"October 7 helped spread a fire that was already out of control,\" states the Report.\n\nCOUNTRIES RECORDING STEEP INCREASES\n\nAccording to the Report, in New York, the city with the largest Jewish population in the world, NYPD recorded 325 anti-Jewish hate crimes in 2023 in comparison to the 261 it recorded in 2022. LAPD recorded 165 in comparison to 86, and CPD 50 in comparison to 39. The ADL recorded 7,523 incidents in 2023 compared to 3,697 in 2022 (and according to a broader definition applied, it recorded 8,873); the number of assaults increased from 111 in 2022 to 161 in 2023 and of vandalism from 1,288 to 2,106.\n\nOther countries also saw dramatic increases in the number of antisemitic attacks, according to data collected by the Report from governmental agencies, law enforcement authorities, Jewish organizations, media, and fieldwork.\n\nIn France, the number of incidents increased from 436 in 2022 to 1,676 in 2023 (the number of physical assaults increased from 43 to 85); in the UK from 1, 662 to 4,103 (physical assaults from 136 to 266); in Argentina from 427 to 598; in Germany from 2,639 to 3,614; in Brazil from 432 to 1,774; in South Africa from 68 to 207; in Mexico from 21 to 78; in the Netherlands from 69 to 154; in Italy from 241 to 454; and in Austria from 719 to 1,147. Australia recorded 622 antisemitic incidents in October and November 2023, in comparison to 79 during the same period in 2022.\n\nANTISEMITIC INCIDENTS INCREASED BEFORE OCTOBER 7\n\nWhile the dramatic increases in comparison to 2022 largely followed October 7, the Report emphasizes that most countries with large Jewish minorities saw relative increases also in the first nine months of 2023, before the war started.\n\nFor example, in the United States, ADL data (based on the narrower definition for antisemitic incidents) point to an increase from 1,000 incidents in October-December 2022 to 3,976 in the same period in 2023, but also to an increase from 2,697 incidents between January-September 2022 to 3,547 in the same period in 2023 (NYPD registered a decrease in that period, while LAPD an increase).\n\nIn France, the number of incidents during January-September 2023 increased to 434 from 329 during the same period in 2022; in Britain - from 1,270 to 1,404. In Australia, 371 incidents were recorded between January and September 2023, compared to 363 in the same period in 2022. On the other hand, Germany and Austria, where national programs for fighting antisemitism are applied, saw decreases.\n\nAccording to Prof. Uriya Shavit, Head of the Center for the Study of Contemporary European Jewry, and the Irwin Cotler Institute, \"The year is not 1938, not even 1933. Yet if current trends continue, the curtain will descend on the ability to lead Jewish lives in the West - to wear a Star of David, attend synagogues and community centers, send kids to Jewish schools, frequent a Jewish club on campus, or speak Hebrew.\"\n\nShavit added: \"With bomb threats against synagogues becoming a daily occurrence, Jewish existence in the West is forced to fortify itself, and the more it does so, the more the sense of security and normalcy is undermined. What the fight against antisemitism needs now is efforts focused on the hubs of poison, and the presentation of measurable and attainable goals. Foremost, the reality in which big companies make big money by spreading big hate has to end.\"\n\nOne of the first reports that foresaw the Holocaust was issued by the Jewish Telegraphic Agency on October 27, 1932 (H/T Hana Levi Julian): 19 Jewish Students Injured as New Nazi Attacks Occur at Vienna Colleges.\n\nAccording to the Holocaust Encyclopedia, before World War II, Jews played an important role in Austria's economic and cultural life. In 1938, Austria had a Jewish population of about 192,000, representing almost 4 percent of the total population.\n\nSystematic mass deportations from Vienna, as elsewhere in Greater Germany, began in October 1941. The Nazis established centers where Jews were to be assembled before deportation. About 35,000 Jews were deported from Vienna to ghettos in Eastern Europe, mostly to Minsk, Riga, and Lodz, and to ghettos in the Lublin region of Poland. Most Jews sent to Minsk and Riga were shot by detachments of the Einsatzgruppen shortly after arrival. Over 15,000 Viennese Jews were deported to Theresienstadt. Thousands of Jews were also sent to concentration camps in Germany. By November 1942 only about 7,000 Jews remained in Austria, mostly those married to non-Jews. Some Jews remained in hiding.\n\nHere's the thing, though: I spent considerable time seeking information about efforts to uproot antisemitism in Austria, Germany, or any other country in Europe that eventually became the killing fields of some six million Jews. Didn't find any. But the TAU/ADL report holds on to the hope that Rabbi Shimon's cool-headed analysis can be proven wrong.\n\nThe report includes the contribution of former Canadian Justice Minister and Attorney General Irwin Cotler, 84, a Montreal-born Jewish politician. Cotler offers a historical and political analysis of the development of present-day antisemitism, and a detailed 11-point plan for globally combatting the phenomenon.\n\nCotler explains: \"What is required is a constituency of conscience - a whole of government, whole of society commitment and action to fight this oldest and most lethal of hatreds.\"\n\nLike I said, clean the ocean first, it's easier.\n\nWhat is required, obviously, is mass Aliyah of millions of Jews from the West, before they face the same fate as the Jews of Vienna.

files pro-Jewish resolution", "body": "A Boston city councilor who voted against a cease-fire resolution criticized by Jewish groups for being one-sided in failing to condemn the Hamas terror attack is asking his colleagues to denounce antisemitism and declare support for local Jews.\n\nEd Flynn, a supporter of Israel who joined fellow moderate Erin Murphy in voting against a measure put forward by Tania Fernandes Anderson last week that declared the majority progressive body's support for a cease-fire in Gaza, has filed a resolution for Wednesday's meeting, \"denouncing acts of antisemitism.\"\n\n\"We have seen a disturbing rise in antisemitism, neo-Nazism, and hate crimes locally and across the country over the last several years, especially after the terrorist attacks by Hamas on Oct. 7,\" Flynn said in a Monday statement to the Herald. \"We have Jewish neighbors who are now afraid for their safety.\n\n\"Now, more than ever, it is critical that we stand up for our Jewish neighbors, continue to denounce antisemitism, and any hate speech or crime.\"\n\nThe resolution was filed during what is recognized as Jewish American Heritage Month, and petitions the City Council to \"recognize and celebrate the many contributions that Jewish Americans bring to our city and country.\"\n\nIt cites statistics from the Anti-Defamation League, that show, since the Oct. 7 Hamas terror attack on Israel that killed more than 1,200 Israelis, recognized as the worst massacre of Jews since the Holocaust, New England has seen a dramatic rise in antisemitic incidents.\n\nThere have been 623 reported incidents of assault, harassment and vandalism, which represents a 205% increase from 2022 and the highest number since the ADL began tracking those statistics four decades ago, the resolution states.\n\nWhile Flynn insists his resolution is not in response to the cease-fire measure adopted by the City Council last week, it comes on the heels of criticism he and the Jewish community have directed at that vote.\n\nThe ADL and Jewish Community Relations Council criticized the City Council's cease-fire language for being \"one-sided,\" and failing to condemn the Oct. 7 terrorist attack, acknowledge that it sparked the war, or identify Hamas as a terrorist organization.\n\nIsrael's retaliatory bombing has resulted in the deaths of tens of thousands of Palestinians in Gaza.\n\nThe Herald was told city councilors had been debating adding language about the Hamas terror attack in the text of the cease-fire resolution, but were pressured by progressive groups to not include that language in the final draft.\n\nAfter his 'no' vote last week, Flynn mentioned the measure's failure to condemn the terror attack and said, \"The City Council is not the place to debate and vote on divisive and controversial international issues.\"\n\nNotably, however, the city's only Jewish councilor, Benjamin Weber, said the approved resolution, while not perfect, \"represents an important step towards reconciliation and shared acknowledgement within both the Jewish and Palestinian communities here in Boston.\"", "source": {"uri":

They reached out to me because of the recent wave of protests, antisemitism, and violence nationwide triggered by the Israel-Hamas War. Some parents have students in college, while others have children in grades K-12. Regardless of how old their child is, each parent asked variations of the same question: Why are their children and other Jewish students not proud of their Jewish identities? Why do these Gen Z Jews not have large circles of Jewish friends or care much for Jewish traditions or heritage?\n\nParents are the ones to blame.\n\nSo many parents of Gen Z students have not prioritized building Jewish social connections for their children. Throughout their children's lives, Jewish parents have failed to make Judaism meaningful by being far too secular and not overtly seeking out Jewish community, and we are now seeing the consequences of weakened identity and communal ties. What will anchor children to their Judaism -- based on talking with thousands of students around the country over the years -- are positive social and communal connections to Jewish life. Parents must make that a priority if American Jewry is going to survive.\n\nParents should not make their children engage in text study, read Jewish literature, participate in traditional synagogue rituals, or even attend religious services at any regular frequency, as used to be the post-war norm. While this created networks decades ago, children dislike and have rejected these approaches. Parents can help their children in a much simpler way. So much of Jewish life -- from its history to its ethical teachings -- is experienced in social environments. Parents must lean into their cultural heritage and help their children build strong networks of Jewish friends around Jewish values outside of purely religious, institutional settings.\n\nThere are numerous ways parents can enhance their children's social capital. There are two solutions I see regularly among proud Jewish students. The first is maintaining a regular Sabbath dinner on Friday nights. For one night of the week, Jewish families should take a break from their regular, chaotic lives and sit together for a meal. This is a reminder of something bigger than themselves; for one night, family and friends can come together to break bread and enjoy each other's company. In an anxiety-laden world, Jewish families could use this and build shared connections and deepened relationships along the way.\n\nThrough these brief symbolic rituals, children learn the core values of Judaism together with family. Sabbath dinner should not be heavy-handed or unpleasant. Poet Ahad Ha'am even noticed that \"More than the Jewish People have kept Shabbat, Shabbat has kept the Jews.\" Put somewhat differently, a Sabbath dinner stops normal life for a brief moment and brings people together such that \"communities do not create rituals; it's more that rituals create communities.\" One scholar argues that in Israel, \"Shabbat is so powerful that it has become ingrained even by those who seem to have no connection to religion... even those who do none of the blessings still gather the family for Shabbat dinner.\" American Jews should adopt this simple practice. The effects on the next generation of Jews will be profound.\n\nA second step that Jewish parents can take to strengthen communal life is to send their children to Jewish summer camp. There is ample research that shows that the impact of summer programs can last a lifetime for many. One Jewish camp attendee in the 1980s declared, \"I can credit camp with my entire Jewish identity. The whole reason I stuck with Judaism was camp and the connections I made.\"\n\nOne lay leader in DC region captures the impact of Jewish camp by observing that, \"camp helps form life-long friendships, creates a sense of community and belonging, and aids in forging a sense of self and Jewish identity.\" Camp is a joyous and open place and is so critical because it \"integrates Judaism into intentional yet spontaneous experiences, helping to foster a love for and deep connection to Jewish life. As a result, few offerings are as impactful of an entry point for people's life-long Jewish journeys as camp.\"\n\nJewish children who attend Jewish camps learn more about Judaism socially and often end up with strong circles of Jewish friends, value their Jewish heritage, and do not hide their values and identities, even during challenging times. The simple power of a regular, communal Sabbath dinner should not be overlooked. To achieve these critically important social ends, parents need to take action now and make sure that their children are in social settings that nurture strong Jewish communities. The tools already exist to help Jewish children become proud of their Judaism and push back against rampant antisemitism; now the parents need to act.", "source": {"uri": "aei.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "American Enterprise Institute - AEI"}, "authors": [{"uri": "julia_cataneo@aei.org", "name": "Julia Cataneo", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shabbat", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Shabbat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judaism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Judaism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jews"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ritual", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ritual"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Jews", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American Jews"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Antisemitism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secularism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Secularism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_norm", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social norm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_literature", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jewish literature"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahad_Ha'am", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ahad Ha'am"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_ethics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jewish ethics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_capital", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social capital"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_heritage", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cultural heritage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bread", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bread"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ethics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synagogue", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Synagogue"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_identity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jewish identity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Religion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Race-Ethnic-Religious_Relations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Race-Ethnic-Religious Relations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Judaism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Judaism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Genealogy/Religions", "label": "dmoz/Society/Genealogy/Religions", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 63}], "image": "https://www.aei.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Abrams.AEIdeas.050624.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538674", "eventUri": "eng-9538674", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 452725463, "relevance": 2}], "totalResults": 64, "page": 1, "count": 1, "pages": 64}}}

We have plenty of festive rainbow-colored dishes and desserts to choose from for your celebrations, but we also want to spotlight just a few of the talented voices from the queer community that bring so much vibrancy to the food scene. Below, we\u2019ve picked out a handful of dishes from some of our favorite chefs and cookbook authors, including mains, sides and desserts.

Here, Hukwe\u2019s daughter, Pendo, and granddaughter, Leah, pick up his mantle on an album made with British producers Oli Barton-Wood and Tom Excell, who add guitar and studio effects to the mix. The sheer vocal power of the duo is arresting, a shifting polyphony primarily addressing family and domestic affairs; this is the first time women in Gogo music have been allowed to write their own stories. There\u2019s a powerful rhythmic drive to tracks like Maisha and Kuseka \u2013 aunt and niece prove fiercesome drummers \u2013 while on Sauti Ya Mama and Fahari Yetu, recorded on the roof of a Zanzibar hotel, the production turns dreamy and hypnotic under the cascades of thumb piano.

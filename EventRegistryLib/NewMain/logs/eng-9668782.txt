These teams are finding answers -- quickly\n\nOn the sweaty commute to work or as your kids beg for another ice cream to cool down, this week's heat wave has everyone asking: is it climate change? Researchers for Environment and Climate Change Canada are trying to answer that question with a new rapid extreme weather attribution system meant to identify just how human-caused unusual and dramatic weather events are. The new research group is attempting to parse out the human impact on weather events and notify the public as soon as possible -- the group hopes to get its findings on this week's heat wave as early as the end of next week. Learn more about the new research group in reporter Kate Allen's rundown.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW Why it matters: Meteorologists warned on Wednesday that this week's heat wave is extremely rare for this early in the summer -- and can have deadly consequences. Heat can be particularly dangerous for vulnerable groups, including children, the elderly and people with chronic illnesses.Go deeper: A new StatCan report released Wednesday underscores just how dangerous extreme heat can be.Who cares: Students are struggling with the heat, especially in classrooms without air conditioning. Only 177 of the 582 schools in the Toronto District School Board have central air, while the rest have designated areas for cooling off.A six-year-old boy is dead after being struck by a school bus driver in Vaughan\n\nChildren could be heard screaming when a school bus driver stuck and killed a six-year-old Matteo Caputi in Kleinburg early Wednesday morning. \"The bus driver didn't even know what she had done,\" a witness told the Star's Calvi Leon. The child's mother was seen holding her son in her arms, visibly distraught. The community is described by neighbours as being full of young families with a nearby park and schools. \"The boy was so full of life,\" a witness added. Here's how the tragedy unfolded.\n\nWhat we know: \"Matteo will always be remembered as a happy little boy who lit up the lives of everyone who was lucky enough to have known him,\" a GoFundMe page organized by colleagues of Caputi's grandmother reads. \"He adored his little brother Luca very much.\"The aftermath: York police said victim services and peer support groups are being offered to the community. Investigators are appealing to any witnesses who haven't already spoken with police or anyone with dash cam footage of the incident. The bus driver remained on the scene and is cooperating with the investigation, police said.With dipping study permit approval rates for international students, Canada may not meet its reduced target\n\nA drastic drop in the number of international student applications from India has led to a halving of Canada's processing of new study permits, first quarter immigration data shows. That means Canada might not even meet its reduced 2024 target, which was introduced to slow the intake of students from abroad. Between January and April, the overall approval rate for study permits was 50 per cent, eight percentage points lower than the 2023 average. After Immigration Minister Marc Miller imposed new international student policies in January, one expert said Canada is already seeing those restrictions come to bear. Here's how far the numbers have come down.\n\nWho cares: The dip in study permit approval rates will be a shock to the 152,000 applicants, of whom only 76,000 will be let into Canada to study. Indian students accounted for about a third of all study permits processed, but that still made for a historically low number for students from India.Miss something? Miller hit the brakes on foreign student growth earlier in the year, imposing a cap on study permits, with the aim of reducing issued permits by 35 per cent from 2023 levels. That will mean big changes for Ontario, home to 51 per cent of Canada's international students.Bad news for: Colleges, some of which have already started cancelling classes and letting go of instructors.

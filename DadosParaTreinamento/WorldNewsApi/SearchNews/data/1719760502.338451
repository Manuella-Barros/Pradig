Just Google \u201cgenerational gap\u201d and you\u2019ll get dozens, if not hundreds, of articles, websites and blogs highlighting each generation\u2019s unique characteristics and differences. However, a survey by Deloitte Insights found that the differences between millennials, Gen Z and Gen X are actually diminishing; and that a new group called \u201cperennials\u201d are emerging. Deloitte defines this group as people of all ages who don\u2019t share their generations\u2019 typical attributes or positions \u2014 like 25-year-old managers or 65-year-old interns. As a result, organizations are scrambling to find new ways of understanding their employees outside of their generation. Instead of focusing on perceived generational differences as their employees\u2019 defining attributes, leaders need to see their team members as individuals with unique preferences, skills and backgrounds.

From my decades of leading multi-generational teams, here are five strategies I\u2019ve found to be helpful. 1. Build relationships. The heart of leadership is relationships. You need to prioritize getting to know your employees on a personal level, regardless of their age or position. By doing so, you build trust and create stronger and healthier teams. It will also help you see your employees as unique individuals. Make building relationships and checking in with your team a regular part of your schedule. Take time each week to meet one-on-one with your employees, paying special attention to their unique skills, backgrounds and personalities. This will help you effectively support your team and position them where they can be the most successful. 2. Ask questions. Many Gen Zers prefer face-to-face communication in the workplace and value authentic relationships, according to a study by UKG Workforce Institute. However, not all of your younger employees will have the same communication style. Factors like their personality, their ratio of introversion versus extroversion and personal preferences will play a significant role in each individual\u2019s communication style. It\u2019s impossible to know every Gen Z employee\u2019s communication preferences. One of the best things you can do for your people is ask them questions. Ask about their preferred communication methods, peak productivity times, preferred schedule and workload. While you may not be able to accommodate every situation, you\u2019ll know what each team member prefers. You will be better equipped to meet their needs and help them succeed. 3. Value diversity. Having a multi-generational team gives you access to a wide range of unique perspectives, talents and insights that can empower your team to overcome challenges and achieve new levels of innovation. It\u2019s crucial that you take the time to unlock that potential. Provide spaces for collaboration between groups who may not typically work with each other or have the same positions or backgrounds. Invite feedback from all levels of your team, regardless of their tenure, age or position. Encouraging open communication will show your employees you value their insights and recognize the unique skills they bring to the team. 4. Provide equal opportunities. You may have team members who are just starting in their careers. Or, senior employees who have been in the industry for many years. Regardless of their background or age demographic, it\u2019s essential that you give your team members equal access to career development and advancement opportunities. Look for ways to encourage your team\u2019s growth, whether through seminars, networking conventions, training or other professional development opportunities. Be sure to let your employees know if your company offers benefits or scholarships for those who want to go back to college or get additional certifications. And when the time comes to discuss promotions, raises and bonuses, be sure to consider all members of your team and what they bring to the table. 5. Be willing to learn. One piece of advice I give to our college-aged students is that they have to possess the mentality of lifelong learning\u2014regardless of their stage in life. As you invest in your employees, you can learn from your team in the process. Provide opportunities for your employees to teach you new skills they\u2019re trained in, share their perspectives or offer insights from their personal experiences. Be intentional about asking for your team\u2019s advice, and then genuinely listen to what they have to share. By doing so, you show your team they\u2019re valued and they can help you grow as a leader. A multi-generational team provides your organization with fresh and diverse perspectives. It empowers your organization to overcome challenges and continue innovating with confidence. By encouraging collaboration among the diverse individuals on your team, you will inspire your employees to do the same. As a result, you\u2019ll create a welcoming, positive work environment for everyone. Forbes Business Council is the foremost growth and networking organization for business owners and leaders.

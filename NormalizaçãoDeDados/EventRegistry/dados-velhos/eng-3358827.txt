No country is entitled to instruct wider EU institutions, \u00c7elik said Thursday, referring to German Chancellor Angela Merkel's recent statement on suspending Turkey-EU talks about updating a Customs Union deal. Speaking at a joint news conference in Ankara with British Foreign Office Minister Sir Alan Duncan Thursday, \u00c7elik described Merkel's statement Wednesday as \"unfortunate.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, in an interview with young video bloggers ahead of the elections in Germany next month, Merkel signaled that the EU would not enter into talks with Ankara on modernizing an existing customs union due to recent political tensions. \"But in any case, for the time being, we would not carry out talks with Turkey on improving or enhancing the customs union,\" the German chancellor said. However, \u00c7elik warned against allowing a bilateral dispute to become a wider problem. \"EU resolutions are determined by principles,\" \u00c7elik added. The minister also warned against individual European leaders making decisions \"against the basic mechanisms of the EU.\"\n\nThe EU minister emphatically stated that Merkel's comments are driven by the recent political row between Turkey and Germany. \"EU institutions should prevent Germany's stance to transform this topic into an EU-level issue,\" he said.\n\nPointing out that the impact analysis of the bloc propelled them to initially make a modernization offer to Turkey, \u00c7elik noted that the update should be evaluated on a win-win basis with due consideration given to the expansion of free trade.\n\n\"Germany tries to turn the modernization of the deal into a favor for Turkey. I would like to highlight that Turkey has no one-sided ambitions for the update of the customs deal,\" he noted.\n\nPresidential spokesperson \u0130brahim Kal\u0131n also criticized Merkel's statements, calling this \"unfortunate\" during a press conference in the afternoon.\n\n\"For an EU member state to take an instructing tone against EU institutions is not acceptable,\" the spokesman said while noting that the Customs Union is devised on a win-win basis. If this approach is attacked, both Germany and Turkey will be exposed to economic losses.\n\nMerkel's remarks came after opposition parties increased pressure on the German government, seeking a harsher tone against Turkey, particularly due to the recent arrests in Turkey of around 10 German citizens, including a reporter and a human rights activist, for allegedly supporting terrorist organizations.\n\nThe German chancellor, who long favored dialogue with Turkey to resolve political differences between the two countries, repeated on Wednesday that it is important to keep communication channels open.\n\nShe also renewed her call for the release of German citizens who were arrested in Turkey as part of counterterror investigations.\n\nTurkish officials have so far ruled out any political influence in these investigations, stressing that independent courts would decide on these cases.\n\nTurkey's relations with Germany and several other EU member states have suffered further setbacks in recent months, as Turkish leaders slammed their counterparts for failing to demonstrate strong solidarity with Ankara over the defeated coup attempt on July 15, 2016. Ankara has also denounced what it sees as German authorities providing support to groups that are hostile toward Turkey.\n\nThe Foreign Ministry also issued a diplomatic note to Germany on Wednesday over reports that claim Adil \u00d6ks\u00fcz, one of the suspected masterminds of the failed coup attempt, was spotted in Germany. According to diplomatic sources, Turkey issued the note and requested the extradition of fugitive \u00d6ks\u00fcz, who is accused of perpetrating the July 15, 2016 coup attempt on behalf of the G\u00fclenist Terror Group (FET\u00d6), if he is indeed in Germany.\n\nSeveral EU countries also voiced concerns over the rule of law and human rights issues amid widespread investigations by the Turkish authorities into the G\u00fclenist Terrorist Group (FET\u00d6). In Germany, which is home to more than 3 million Turkish immigrants, FET\u00d6 has a large network with dozens of private schools, businesses and media organizations. Since the coup attempt, nearly 4,000 FET\u00d6 suspects have come to Germany from Turkey and other countries, according to local media reports.\n\nChange in Turkey policy claimed to be \"state policy\"\n\nAfter Merkel's remarks on Turkey, Turkish Deutsche Welle reported that the German government is trying to turn its recent political strife with Turkey into state policy, claiming that it is not an ephemeral issue targeting elections in Germany.\n\nThe Turkish edition of the German-based paper claims that German diplomatic sources have stated that the country had been a strong advocate for the expansion of the scope of the customs deal, but reversed its attitude after the recent turn of events.\n\nGermany was also reported to have initiated simultaneous diplomatic talks about its new policy for Turkey with EU governments, in addition to the European Commission. Seeking support from other members, the report claims, German officials do not see this recent change in policy as a temporary one, nor is it directed towards the elections next month.\n\nEffective business policy with EU is necessaryAs the only non-EU member country that has had a customs union agreement with the EU since 1996, Turkey has been one of the largest trade partners of the union with an export value of 66.7 billion euros and an import value of 78 billion euros in 2016 in goods alone. As for services, Turkish exports to the EU totaled 16.4 billion euros and imports of services stood at 12.2 billion euros, according to European Commission (EC) data. Among EU states, Germany has been the top destination for Turkish goods for a while. July export data reveals that Germany was the top market for Turkish exports in eight sectors, including the automotive, ready-to-wear, iron, machinery, air conditioning, hazelnuts, fruits and vegetables and dried fruits sectors.\n\nDespite Germany's attempts to curb the update process, these figures make Turkey by far the number one trade partner, as the EC itself has confirmed. As such, both politicians and experts argue that a modernized Customs Union would be lucrative for both parties.\n\nIn its December 21, 2016 assessment, the EC proposed the modernization of the current deal, which only covers a limited range of industrial products and excludes agriculture, public procurement and services. Highlighting that the upgrade of Turkey-EU trade relations forms an essential part of efforts made by Turkey and the EU to deepen relations in key areas of common interest, the EC reiterated its resolution to continue delivering on the commitments it has made as part of the deal with Ankara. \"Modernizing the Customs Union to reflect current EU-Turkey trade relations would bring substantial economic benefits for both partners,\" the commission said in its proposal.\n\nA 2017 report prepared by Brussels-based think-tank the European Neighborhood Council in association with the Independent Industrialists' and Businessmen's Association (M\u00dcS\u0130AD) outlines that a reformed Customs Union will make a 1.44 percent contribution to Turkey's gross domestic product (GDP) while it enables the growth of the EU economy by 0.01 percent. Not taking the impacts of services and public procurement liberalization into account, this calculation is considered important for both sides. Yet, when the services and public procurement are included, EU exports to Turkey are predicted to increase by 27 billion euros whereas Turkish exports to the bloc are expected to increase by 5 billion euros.\n\nAlbeit an important agreement, the Customs Union was initially devised for a temporary period and as a result of trade diversion and global shifts, it is now losing its purpose and institutional strength as a win-win economic deal, remaining an unfinished architecture.Reacting to the ongoing debates fueled by political agenda, members of the Turkish business circle previously called for well-calculated and temperate business diplomacy to provide a fruitful platform for a win-win basis, which Turkey reiterates on every occasion. Chairmen of both M\u00dcS\u0130AD and the Foreign Economic Relations' Board (DE\u0130K) expressed the necessity to manage this process, which was spoiled by Germany's political motivations and harsh policy on Turkey, through effective and thoughtful negotiations.", "id": "9781381", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Turkey reproves Merkel's 'unfortunate' statements on customs union", "image": "https://iadsb.tmgrup.com.tr/f9871e/645/344/0/0/645/344?u=https://idsb.tmgrup.com.tr/2017/08/17/turkey-reproves-merkels-unfortunate-statements-on-customs-union-1503001746242.jpg", "extractedDates": [{"textStart": 3561, "freq": 2, "date": "2016-07-15", "amb": false, "textEnd": 3574}, {"textStart": 6608, "date": "2016-12-21", "amb": false, "textEnd": 6625}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "Federal Republic of Germany"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 5, "id": "56", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "label": {"eng": "Federal Republic of Germany"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "Turkey"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 5, "id": "225", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey", "label": {"eng": "Turkey"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "Turkey"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Ankara"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 5, "id": "10258", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ankara", "label": {"eng": "Ankara"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "Federal Republic of Germany"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Land Berlin"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 4, "id": "111334", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin", "label": {"eng": "Land Berlin"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Angela Merkel"}, "id": "303059", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angela_Merkel"}, {"label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "id": "303064", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union"}, {"label": {"eng": "European Commission"}, "id": "303458", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Commission"}, {"label": {"eng": "Member state of the European Union"}, "id": "303880", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_state_of_the_European_Union"}, {"label": {"eng": "Accession of Turkey to the European Union"}, "id": "303914", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accession_of_Turkey_to_the_European_Union"}, {"label": {"eng": "Customs union"}, "id": "382637", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customs_union"}, {"label": {"eng": "Elections in Germany"}, "id": "589336", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elections_in_Germany"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 108, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 139, "label": "dmoz/Society/Government", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Government"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 140, "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 405, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Recreation/Outdoors", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Recreation/Outdoors"}], "time": "21:37:00"}

This would minimise disruption and offer business a smooth and orderly transition,\" DExEU said in a press release.\n\nMay and her Cabinet want to retain as many benefits of customs union membership as possible without being part of it -- possibly via a \"temporary customs union.\" Britain will go into talks pursuing \"the freest and most frictionless possible trade in goods between the UK and the EU,\" the paper says.\n\nThe plan is a victory of sorts for Chancellor Philip Hammond, who has urged colleagues to embrace a \"business-friendly\" Brexit based on temporary arrangements. The plans will likely irk hard Brexiteers, including those on the Tory backbenches, who want a clean divorce which isn't delayed by a transitional period of any sort. An unnamed Cabinet minister last month accused Hammond and his sympathisers of trying to \"f--- up\" and \"frustrate\" Brexit.\n\nIn a statement accompanying the position paper, Hammond said: \"Our proposals are ambitious, and rightly so. They set out arrangements that would allow UK businesses to continue to trade with their European partners in the future, while expanding their markets beyond the EU.\n\n\"And in the near term they will reassure people and companies that, the day after we leave the EU, they will still be able to go about their business without disruption as we make a smooth transition to our bright future outside the EU and deliver a Brexit that works for Britain.\"\n\nBrexit Secretary David Davis told BBC Radio 4 this morning the transitional period will \"most likely\" last two years and said he hoped a long-term customs arrangement will be in place by mid-2019. Asked whether Britain may be required to make financial contributions to the EU during this interim period, Davis said: \"What happens in that sort of interim period you will have to leave me to negotiate, I'm afraid.\"\n\nIn a statement published on Tuesday, Davis says: \"The way we approach the movement of goods across our border will be a critical building block for our independent trade policy. An interim period would mean businesses only need to adjust once to the new regime and would allow for a smooth and orderly transition.\n\n\"The UK is the EU's biggest trading partner so it is in the interest of both sides that we reach an agreement on our future relationship. The UK starts from a strong position and we are confident we can deliver a result that is good for business here in the UK and across the EU.\"\n\nThe Brexit Secretary also confirmed the government wants to negotiate new free trade deals with countries outside the EU during this transitional period -- but will not be able to implement them. Cabinet Brexiteers like Liam Fox have been keen for Britain to leave the customs union as members are prohibited from doing trade deals with nations outside the EU.\n\nThe feeling within Westminster is British negotiators will struggle to make progress when talks resume this month unless the British side has a clear understanding of what it wants post-Brexit trade relations to look like.\n\nHowever, the EU has made it clear on several occasions it will not discuss future trade relations with Britain until significant progress has been made on issues like the rights of citizens and the money the UK must pay in financial obligations, or the divorce bill as it has become known.\n\nResponding to the UK government position paper, a spokesperson for the European Commission said \"frictionless trade not possible outside the single market and customs union.\"\n\nThe EU Parliament's chief Brexit negotiator Guy Verhofstaft described Britain's plans as a \"fantasy\" in a tweet posted before the paper was published.\n\nResponding to the paper Steve Bullock, a former UK negotiator to the EU who BI interviewed last month, said: \"It's a slightly better try than I'd expected, but is essentially more 'cake and eat it' as many have predicted.\"\n\nWiktor Dabkowski/DPA/PA Images\n\nThe customs union is a central part of the 28-nation bloc's apparatus which means member states trade freely with each other and have all agreed to charge the same tariff on imports from outside of the bloc. This means countries importing goods into the EU pay the same tariff regardless of which member states they are importing to. Members of the customs union are prohibited from negotiating their own trade deals with countries elsewhere in the world.\n\nThe position paper published today confirms Britain will leave the customs union in March 2019. Opponents of this plan warn leaving the customs union would unleash economic and political chaos, like heavy tariffs being imposed on goods; long queues at customs; and the return of a hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland.\n\nDExEU claims its plan for a transitional customs deal followed by a permanent customs arrangement will guarantee minimal disruption in the short-term, and in the long-term meet three key objectives: 1) \"ensure trade with the EU is frictionless as possible\" 2) \"avoid any form of hard-border between Ireland and Northern Ireland,\" and 3) \"establish an independent international trade policy.\"\n\nThe Labour Party has attacked the proposals as \"incoherent\" and urged the government to retain the \"same basic terms\" of customs union membership.\n\n\"Labour is clear that we need to retain the benefits of the customs union and avoid a cliff-edge for the British economy,\" a spokesperson said. \"That means committing now to strong transitional arrangements on the same basic terms we currently enjoy -- including the single market and customs union.\"\n\nThe Liberal Democrats dismissed the plans as merely delaying the inevitable \"pain\" of an extreme Brexit. The party's Brexit Spokesperson Tom Brake said: \"Even if they were agreed to by the EU, these proposals will only delay the economic pain caused by leaving the customs union.\n\n\"We still face the prospect of more red tape for businesses, longer queues at our borders, and higher prices for consumers once the transition comes to an end.\"\n\nBrake added: \"The only way to ensure 'free and frictionless' trade with the EU is to remain a full member of the Customs Union and Single Market. It doesn't matter how it's dressed up or how long it's postponed, the government's extreme Brexit will end up leaving Britain poorer.\"", "id": "9424693", "details": {"gpCnt": 4}, "date":

And anti-Brexit campaigners in Britain said they would merely replace EU regulations with new ones that could be even more onerous.\n\nThe Department for Exiting the European Union said there could be \"a temporary customs union between the UK and the EU\" to avoid border chaos when Britain officially leaves the bloc in March 2019.\n\nBrexit Secretary David Davis said the transition period could last about two years.\n\nIn the long term, the department said, a \"customs partnership\" could eliminate the need for a border for goods travelling between Britain and the EU. The partnership would see Britain impose the same requirements as the EU on goods from outside the bloc destined for member states.\n\nAlternately, it suggested \"a highly streamlined customs arrangement\" could be set up, using technology to ease border procedures.\n\nThe proposals drew a cool response from Brussels.\n\n\"To be in and out of the customs union and 'invisible borders' is a fantasy,\" tweeted Guy Verhofstadt, the European Parliament's Brexit coordinator.\n\nSome British businesses have accused the government of being vague about whether there will be economic barriers with the EU after Brexit. The persistent uncertainty - 14 months after Britain voted to leave the EU - is weighing on the economy.\n\nTrade Secretary Liam Fox and Treasury chief Philip Hammond wrote in the Sunday Telegraph that in 2019, Britain will leave both the EU's single market in goods and services and its customs union.\n\nThe single market ensures tariffless trade in goods and services and is linked closely by the EU with other rights, such as the right of EU citizens to cross borders. The customs union allows goods to move within the EU without checks, but also imposes tariffs on imports from outside the EU. That would prevent Britain striking new free trade deals while it remains inside the arrangement.\n\nThe British proposal says the UK should be free to negotiate new trade relationships during the transition period, something EU officials are likely to find problematic.\n\nScottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, who favours Britain's staying in the single market and customs union, accused the government on Twitter of having a \"daft 'have cake and eat it' approach\" to Brexit.\n\nPro-EU Labour lawmaker Chuka Umunna said the proposals \"are offering a red tape bombshell for British business\".\n\nThe customs proposals are the first in a series of papers covering thorny issues in the negotiations, which are due to resume in Brussels at the end of this month. Another, on the status of the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, is due to be published this week.\n\nThe European Commission said it took note of Britain's suggestions, \"but we will only address them once we have made sufficient progress on the terms of the orderly withdrawal\" from the bloc.\n\nThe EU says negotiations on its future relations with Britain can't start until sufficient progress has been made on three initial issues: how much money the UK will have to pay to settle its outstanding commitments to the bloc; whether security checks and customs duties will be instituted on the Irish border; and the status of three million EU nationals living in Britain.\n\nMichel Barnier, the EU's chief Brexit negotiator, tweeted that the quicker the two sides \"agree on citizens, settling accounts and Ireland, the quicker we can discuss customs and future relationship.\"", "id": "9411034", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-16", "title": "UK pitches

So far \u20ac189 million ($221 million) have been delivered to help Turkey adopt European standards, in various fields including rule of law, human rights and press freedom.\n\nEU's financial assistance to Turkey had become a controversial issue in Germany ahead of elections on Sept. 24, with certain opposition politicians calling on Merkel to take measures to freeze these funds.\n\nThe German chancellor, who long favored dialogue with Turkey to resolve political differences between the two countries, repeated on Wednesday that it was important to keep communication channels open.\n\nShe also renewed her call for the release of German citizens who were arrested in Turkey as part of antiterrorism investigations.\n\nTurkish officials have so far ruled out any political influence in these investigations, and they stressed that independent courts would decide on these cases.\n\nTurkey's relations with Germany and several other EU member states have suffered further setbacks in recent months, as Turkish leaders slammed their counterparts for failing to demonstrate strong solidarity with Ankara over the defeated coup attempt in 2016. Ankara has also denounced what it sees as German authorities providing support to groups hostile to Turkey.\n\nFET\u00d6 and PKK\n\nSeveral EU countries also voiced concerns over the rule of law and human rights issues amid widespread investigations by the Turkish authorities into the Fetullah Terrorist Organization (FET\u00d6).\n\nFET\u00d6 and its U.S.-based leader Fetullah Gulen orchestrated the defeated coup of July 15, 2016, which left 250 people martyred and nearly 2,200 injured.\n\nFET\u00d6 is also behind a long-running campaign to overthrow the state through the infiltration of Turkish institutions, particularly the military, police, and judiciary.\n\nIn Germany, which is home to more than 3 million Turkish immigrants, FET\u00d6 has a large network with dozens of private schools, businesses and media organizations.\n\nSince the coup attempt, nearly 4,000 FET\u00d6 suspects have come to Germany from Turkey and other countries, according to local media reports.\n\nThe terrorist PKK group is also active in Germany and carries out significant propaganda, recruitment and funding activities.\n\nThe group has nearly 14,000 followers among the Kurdish immigrant population in Germany, according to the German domestic intelligence agency.", "id": "9624701", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Merkel opposes EU-Turkey divorce", "image": "http://yenisafak.feo.doracdn.com/resize/47uQufiZbmsgHk3H/600/0/resim/imagecrop/2017/08/17/09/07/resized_91da9-f3b527edmerkel11.jpg", "extractedDates": [{"imp": true, "textStart": 2031, "date": "2017-09-24", "amb": false, "textEnd": 2039}, {"textStart": 3291, "date": "2016-07-15", "amb": false, "textEnd": 3304}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "Federal Republic of Germany"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 4, "id": "56", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "label": {"eng": "Federal Republic of Germany"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "Turkey"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 5, "id": "225", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey", "label": {"eng": "Turkey"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 2, "id": "233", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "Turkey"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Ankara"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 5, "id": "10258", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ankara", "label": {"eng": "Ankara"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Human rights"}, "id": "302584", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights"}, {"label": {"eng": "Angela Merkel"}, "id": "303059", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angela_Merkel"}, {"label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "id": "303064", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union"}, {"label": {"eng": "Member state of the European Union"}, "id": "303880", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_state_of_the_European_Union"}, {"label": {"eng": "Accession of Turkey to the European Union"}, "id": "303914", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accession_of_Turkey_to_the_European_Union"}, {"label": {"eng": "Kurdistan Workers' Party"}, "id": "313342", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurdistan_Workers'_Party"}, {"label": {"eng": "Rule of law"}, "id": "317071", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_law"}, {"label": {"eng": "Elections in Germany"}, "id": "589336", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elections_in_Germany"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 41, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 42, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Human Rights and Liberties", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Human_Rights_and_Liberties"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 140, "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 405, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Recreation/Outdoors", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Recreation/Outdoors"}], "time": "06:32:00"}

This would minimise disruption and offer business a smooth and orderly transition,\" DExEU said in a press release.\n\nMay and her Cabinet want to retain as many benefits of customs union membership as possible without being part of it -- possibly via a \"temporary customs union.\" Britain will go into talks pursuing \"the freest and most frictionless possible trade in goods between the UK and the EU,\" the paper says.\n\nThe plan is a victory of sorts for Chancellor Philip Hammond, who has urged colleagues to embrace a \"business-friendly\" Brexit based on temporary arrangements. The plans will likely irk hard Brexiteers, including those on the Tory backbenches, who want a clean divorce which isn't delayed by a transitional period of any sort. An unnamed Cabinet minister last month accused Hammond and his sympathisers of trying to \"f--- up\" and \"frustrate\" Brexit.\n\nIn a statement accompanying the position paper, Hammond said: \"Our proposals are ambitious, and rightly so.\n\n\"They set out arrangements that would allow UK businesses to continue to trade with their European partners in the future, while expanding their markets beyond the EU.\n\n\"And in the near term they will reassure people and companies that, the day after we leave the EU, they will still be able to go about their business without disruption as we make a smooth transition to our bright future outside the EU and deliver a Brexit that works for Britain.\"\n\nBrexit Secretary David Davis told BBC Radio 4 this morning the transitional period will \"most likely\" last two years and said he hoped a long-term customs arrangement will be in place by mid-2019. Asked whether Britain may be required to make financial contributions to the EU during this interim period, Davis said: \"What happens in that sort of interim period you will have to leave me to negotiate, I'm afraid.\"\n\nIn a statement published on Tuesday, Davis says: \"The way we approach the movement of goods across our border will be a critical building block for our independent trade policy. An interim period would mean businesses only need to adjust once to the new regime and would allow for a smooth and orderly transition.\n\n\"The UK is the EU's biggest trading partner so it is in the interest of both sides that we reach an agreement on our future relationship. The UK starts from a strong position and we are confident we can deliver a result that is good for business here in the UK and across the EU.\"\n\nThe Brexit Secretary also confirmed the government wants to negotiate new free trade deals with countries outside the EU during this transitional period -- but will not be able to implement them. Cabinet Brexiteers like Liam Fox have been keen for Britain to leave the customs union as members are prohibited from doing trade deals with nations outside the EU.\n\nThe EU has made it clear on several occasions it will not discuss future trade relations with Britain until significant progress has been made on issues like the rights of citizens and the money the UK must pay in financial obligations, or the divorce bill as it has become known.\n\nResponding to the UK government position paper, a spokesperson for the European Commission said \"frictionless trade not possible outside the single market and customs union.\"\n\nThe EU Parliament's chief Brexit negotiator Guy Verhofstaft described Britain's plans as a \"fantasy\" in a tweet posted in response to the position paper.\n\nThe feeling within Westminster is British negotiators will struggle to make progress when talks resume this month unless the British side has a clear understanding of what it wants post-Brexit trade relations to look like.\n\nWiktor Dabkowski/DPA/PA Images\n\nThe customs union is a central part of the 28-nation bloc's apparatus which means member states trade freely with each other and have all agreed to charge the same tariff on imports from outside of the bloc. This means countries importing goods into the EU pay the same tariff regardless of which member states they are importing to. Members of the customs union are prohibited from negotiating their own trade deals with countries elsewhere in the world.\n\nThe position paper published today confirms Britain will leave the customs union in March 2019. Opponents of this plan warn leaving the customs union would unleash economic and political chaos, like heavy tariffs being imposed on goods; long queues at customs; and the return of a hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland.\n\nDExEU claims its plan for a transitional customs deal followed by a permanent customs arrangement will guarantee minimal disruption in the short-term, and in the long-term meet three key objectives: 1) \"ensure trade with the EU is frictionless as possible\" 2) \"avoid any form of hard-border between Ireland and Northern Ireland,\" and 3) \"establish an independent international trade policy.\"\n\nThe Labour Party has attacked the proposals as \"incoherent\" and urged the government to retain the \"same basic terms\" of customs union membership.\n\n\"Labour is clear that we need to retain the benefits of the customs union and avoid a cliff-edge for the British economy,\" a spokesperson said. \"That means committing now to strong transitional arrangements on the same basic terms we currently enjoy -- including the single market and customs union.\"\n\nThe Liberal Democrats dismissed the plans as merely delaying the inevitable \"pain\" of an extreme Brexit. The party's Brexit Spokesperson Tom Brake said: \"Even if they were agreed to by the EU, these proposals will only delay the economic pain caused by leaving the customs union.\n\n\"We still face the prospect of more red tape for businesses, longer queues at our borders, and higher prices for consumers once the transition comes to an end.\"\n\nBrake added: \"The only way to ensure 'free and frictionless' trade with the EU is to remain a full member of the Customs Union and Single Market. It doesn't matter how it's dressed up or how long it's postponed, the government's extreme Brexit will end up leaving Britain poorer.\"", "id": "9269693", "details": {"liCnt": 6, "gpCnt": 4}, "date":

Germany is also withdrawing forces from Turkey's Incirlik air base after Ankara restricted access to German politicians.\n\nTurkey formally remains a candidate to join the European Union but Merkel said on Wednesday that no new chapters in accession talks were being opened and aid to Turkey had been cut to a minimum. There would be no expansion in the customs union, she said, and \"no kind of deepening at all\" in relations.\n\nTurkey's European Union minister Omer Celik said Merkel's comments were unfortunate and damaging.\n\n\"We should emphasize that no EU member should give orders to EU institutions or EU processes,\" he told a news conference in Ankara. \"These situations are very dangerous, they represent statements that harm the EU's credibility.\"\n\nCelik said both Turkey and the European Union would gain from updating the customs union. \"But they are acting as if doing so is a favor to Turkey. Let me be very clear, we are in no rush,\" he said.\n\nGermany, Europe's leading power, has toughened its stance towards Turkey in recent weeks, urging citizens to exercise caution if traveling there and threatening measures that could hinder German investment.\n\nTurkish President Tayyip Erdogan says the post-coup crackdown, in which 50,000 people have been detained and 150,000 sacked or suspended from the judiciary, journalism, academia and other sectors was needed to address deep-seated security threats.\n\nDomestic and foreign critics accuse him of using a state of emergency as cover to root out opposition and strengthen his grip on power.\n\nCelik called on Berlin to cooperate with Turkey's request for the extradition of Adil Oksuz, a theology lecturer suspected of playing a major role in the failed coup.\n\nTurkish authorities say Oksuz was detained near an air base hours after the July 15, 2016 coup attempt, only to be released by a judge two days later. He has been on the run since.\n\nTurkish media have reported that he has been seen in Frankfurt and Ulm and given a temporary residence permit by Germany's Baden-Wurttemberg state.\n\n\"No ally of ours can harbor a killer,\" Celik said. \"Even the possibility of someone with a clear tie to the coup attempt being harbored by our ally is saddening.\"\n\nGermany's foreign ministry said on Wednesday that the Turkish request would be examined by a German judge before the German government could make a decision on the request.\n\nCelik repeated Turkey's complaint that it submitted thousands of files to Germany and requested suspects to be handed over without any response from Berlin.\n\n\"The Oksuz issue is very clear. We are allies with Germany, allied countries. We expect an attitude that is fitting of our level of cooperation,\" he said.\n\nThe justice ministers of the two countries spoke by phone for an hour on Thursday, Turkey's justice ministry said. It described the conversation as \"very productive and positive\", but gave no details.\n\nGermany has dismissed accusations that it is not cooperating with Ankara's requests.

The pair are pictured together in Brussels last month\n\nNo back door: Chancellor Philip Hammond (left), who favours a 'softer' Brexit and hardliner Liam Fox (right) agree that the UK will pull out of both the EU single market and customs union\n\nMr Davis said: 'I've launched this process because with time of the essence, we need to get on with negotiating the bigger issues around our future partnership to ensure we get a deal that delivers a strong UK and a strong EU.\n\n'It's what businesses across Europe have called on both sides to do and will demonstrate that the UK is ready for the job.'\n\nMeanwhile The Times said the slow progress so far had led to complaints in Whitehall that senior officials were now trying to rush through decisions in an attempt to break the policy logjam.\n\nThere were said to be concerns that Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood and the Permanent Secretary at the Department for Exiting the EU were railroading through issues at a time when many ministers were away, leading to poor decision-making.\n\nAt the end of a difficult summer, marked by speculation over a possible leadership challenge and jostling for position among senior ministers over Brexit, there was some respite for the Prime Minister with an apparent truce between two of the leading protagonists.\n\nChancellor Philip Hammond, who favours a 'soft', pro-business Brexit, and the Brexiteer International Development Secretary Liam Fox signed up to a joint statement at the weekend agreeing that there would have to be a transition period after Britain has left the EU.\n\nThey agreed that while the measure was necessary to ensure there was no 'cliff-edge' break for businesses, it would be time-limited and that Britain would leave the EU single market and the customs union when it left the bloc.\n\nThe move was criticised by the Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable, who accused the Chancellor of caving in to the demands of the hardline Brexiteers.", "id": "9037793",

And anti-Brexit campaigners in Britain said they would merely replace EU regulations with new ones that could be even more onerous.\n\nThe Department for Exiting the European Union said there could be \"a temporary customs union between the U.K. and the EU\" to avoid border chaos when Britain officially leaves the bloc in March 2019.\n\nBrexit Secretary David Davis said the transition period could last about two years.\n\nRead more:\n\nU.K. prime minister's office says free movement from EU will end in 2019\n\nEU's chief Brexit negotiator urges Britain to clarify its position on divorce bill\n\nU.K. government unveils 62-page bill to make Brexit a reality\n\nIn the long term, the department said, a \"customs partnership\" could eliminate the need for a border for goods travelling between Britain and the EU. The partnership would see Britain impose the exact same requirements as the EU on goods from outside the bloc destined for member states.\n\nAlternately, it suggested \"a highly streamlined customs arrangement\" could be set up, using technology to ease border procedures.\n\nThe proposals drew a cool response from Brussels.\n\n\"To be in & out of the Customs Union & 'invisible borders' is a fantasy,\" tweeted Guy Verhofstadt, the European Parliament's Brexit co-ordinator.\n\nSome British businesses have accused the government of being vague about whether there will be economic barriers with the EU after Brexit. The persistent uncertainty -- 14 months after Britain voted to leave the EU -- is weighing on the economy.\n\nTrade Secretary Liam Fox and Treasury chief Philip Hammond wrote in the Sunday Telegraph that in 2019 Britain will leave both the EU's single market in goods and services and its customs union.\n\nThe single market ensures tariff-less trade in goods and services and is linked closely by the EU with other rights, such as the right of EU citizens to cross borders. The customs union allows goods to move within the EU without checks, but also imposes tariffs on imports from outside the EU. That would prevent Britain striking new free trade deals while it remains inside the arrangement.\n\nThe British proposal says the U.K. should be free to negotiate new trade relationships during the transition period, something EU officials are likely to find problematic.\n\nScottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, who favours Britain's staying in the single market and customs union, accused the government on Twitter of having a \"daft 'have cake and eat it' approach\" to Brexit.\n\nPro-EU Labour lawmaker Chuka Umunna said the proposals \"are offering a red tape bombshell for British business.\"\n\nThe customs proposals are the first in a series of papers covering thorny issues in the negotiations, which are due to resume in Brussels at the end of this month. Another, on the status of the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, is due to be published this week.\n\nThe European Commission said it took note of Britain's suggestions, \"but we will only address them once we have made sufficient progress on the terms of the orderly withdrawal\" from the bloc.\n\nThe EU says negotiations on its future relations with Britain can't start until sufficient progress has been made on three initial issues: how much money the U.K. will have to pay to settle its outstanding commitments to the bloc; whether security checks and customs duties will be instituted on the Irish border; and the status of 3 million EU nationals living in Britain.\n\nMichel Barnier, the EU's chief Brexit negotiator, tweeted that the quicker the two sides \"agree on citizens, settling accounts and Ireland, the quicker we can discuss customs & future relationship.\"", "id": "9295367", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-15", "title": "U.K. lays out plan for

false, "storyUri": "eng-3358827", "body": "(AFP) - Britain said on Tuesday it would seek a \"temporary customs union\" with the European Union after Brexit, in an opening gambit for trade negotiations that received a cool response from Brussels.\n\nThe government said broadly similar arrangements could apply to EU-UK trade in goods as they do now for around two years, to give businesses more time to adapt to new post-Brexit systems.\n\nUnlike at present, however, Britain said it wanted to be able to negotiate free trade agreements with third countries during the interim period which would then be implemented afterwards.\n\n\"It's much more sensible, we think, if there is a shortish period in which we maintain the current arrangements,\" Brexit minister David Davis told BBC radio, adding that it could last \"something like two years\" -- ending before the 2022 election.\n\nThe proposal for a transitional arrangement was welcomed by the Confederation of British Industry, Britain's big business lobby group, but critics dismissed it as a \"fantasy\".\n\nThe European Commission, the EU's executive arm, said it would \"take note\" of the proposals, but warned: \"'Frictionless trade' is not possible outside the single market and customs union.\"\n\nEU chief negotiator Michel Barnier also repeated that talks on the future trading relationship could not begin until progress was made on other issues, including Britain's exit bill.\n\nBritain says its membership of the EU customs union, which allows for the tariff-free movement of goods, will end along with its membership of the single market -- its largest trading partner -- when it leaves the bloc in March 2019.\n\nExperts have warned it will be extremely difficult, if not impossible, to negotiate a new EU-UK free trade agreement before then, raising fears of a damaging \"cliff-edge\".\n\n\"One possible approach would be a temporary customs union between the UK and the EU,\" the Brexit ministry said.\n\nThe CBI's deputy director Josh Hardie said the government's proposal was \"encouraging\", but added: \"The clock is ticking and what matters now is giving companies the confidence to continue investing as quickly as possible.\"\n\nIn a policy paper published on Tuesday, Britain said it could streamline and simplify trade arrangements with the EU once it has left the customs union.\n\nBut it admitted there would be \"an increase in administration compared with being inside the EU customs union\".\n\nAn alternative would be a new customs partnership in which Britain effectively adopts the EU's external customs border to allow for free EU-UK trade, but applies its own trade policy and tariff for imports and exports with third countries destined only for the UK market.\n\nBut in recognition of the huge practical challenges that Brexit presents, the policy paper acknowledged this was \"an innovative and untested approach\".\n\nA third round of Brexit negotiations is due to begin at the end of August, focused on Britain's financial settlement, the issue of expatriate rights, and the border between British-controlled Northern Ireland and Ireland.\n\nLondon argues that customs arrangements are crucial to resolving the Irish border issue, on which it plans to publish further proposals on Wednesday.\n\nBut Brussels insists there must be broad agreement on the three priority issues before trade negotiations begin, by the EU leaders' summit in October at the earliest.\n\n\"The quicker UK & EU 27 agree on citizens, settling accounts and Ireland, the quicker we can discuss customs and future relationship,\" Barnier said on Twitter.\n\nOpposition Labour lawmaker Chris Leslie, from the campaign group Open Britain, said the proposal for an interim customs union represented \"wishful thinking of the highest order\".\n\n\"It is a fantasy to pretend we can have the freest and most frictionless trade possible with our largest partner when the government remain intent on pulling Britain out of the customs union,\" he said.\n\nGuy Verhofstadt, the European Parliament's outspoken Brexit negotiator, added: \"To be in & out of the Customs Union & 'invisible borders' is a fantasy.\"", "id": "9308284", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-15", "title": "Brexit: UK to seek 'temporary customs union' with EU after Brexit", "image":

Alternately, it suggested \"a highly streamlined customs arrangement\" could be set up, using technology to ease border procedures.\n\nThe proposal - one of a series intended to disprove allegations that Britain is underprepared for Brexit - drew a cool response from Brussels.\n\n\"To be in & out of the Customs Union & 'invisible borders' is a fantasy,\" tweeted Guy Verhofstadt, the European Parliament's Brexit coordinator.\n\nSome British businesses have accused the government of being vague about whether there will be economic barriers with the EU after Brexit in March 2019. The persistent uncertainty -- 14 months after Britain voted to leave the EU - is weighing on the economy.\n\nTrade Secretary Liam Fox and Treasury chief Philip Hammond wrote in the Sunday Telegraph that in 2019 Britain will leave both the EU's single market in goods and services and its customs union.\n\nThe single market ensures tariff-less trade in goods and services and is linked closely by the EU with other rights, such as the right of EU citizens to cross borders. The customs union allows goods to move within the EU without checks, but also imposes tariffs on imports from outside the EU.

Germany is also withdrawing forces from Turkey's Incirlik air base after Ankara restricted access to German politicians.\n\nTurkey formally remains a candidate to join the European Union but Merkel said on Wednesday that no new chapters in accession talks were being opened and aid to Turkey had been cut to a minimum. There would be no expansion in the customs union, she said, and \"no kind of deepening at all\" in relations.\n\nTurkey's European Union minister Omer Celik said Merkel's comments were unfortunate and damaging.\n\n\"We should emphasize that no EU member should give orders to EU institutions or EU processes,\" he told a news conference in Ankara. \"These situations are very dangerous, they represent statements that harm the EU's credibility.\"\n\nCelik said both Turkey and the European Union would gain from updating the customs union. \"But they are acting as if doing so is a favour to Turkey. Let me be very clear, we are in no rush,\" he said.\n\nGermany, Europe's leading power, has toughened its stance towards Turkey in recent weeks, urging citizens to exercise caution if travelling there and threatening measures that could hinder German investment.\n\nTurkish President Tayyip Erdogan says the post-coup crackdown, in which 50,000 people have been detained and 150,000 sacked or suspended from the judiciary, journalism, academia and other sectors was needed to address deep-seated security threats.\n\nDomestic and foreign critics accuse him of using a state of emergency as cover to root out opposition and strengthen his grip on power.\n\nCelik called on Berlin to cooperate with Turkey's request for the extradition of Adil Oksuz, a theology lecturer suspected of playing a major role in the failed coup.\n\nTurkish authorities say Oksuz was detained near an air base hours after the July 15, 2016 coup attempt, only to be released by a judge two days later. He has been on the run since.\n\nTurkish media have reported that he has been seen in Frankfurt and Ulm and given a temporary residence permit by Germany's Baden-Wurttemberg state.\n\n\"No ally of ours can harbour a killer,\" Celik said. \"Even the possibility of someone with a clear tie to the coup attempt being harboured by our ally is saddening.\"\n\nGermany's foreign ministry said on Wednesday that the Turkish request would be examined by a German judge before the German government could make a decision on the request.\n\nCelik repeated Turkey's complaint that it submitted thousands of files to Germany and requested suspects to be handed over without any response from Berlin.\n\n\"The Oksuz issue is very clear. We are allies with Germany, allied countries. We expect an attitude that is fitting of our level of cooperation,\" he said.\n\nThe justice ministers of the two countries spoke by phone for an hour on Thursday, Turkey's justice ministry said. It described the conversation as \"very productive and positive\", but gave no details.\n\nGermany has dismissed accusations that it is not cooperating with Ankara's requests.", "id": "9671806", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Merkel harming EU credibility over Turkey, minister says", "image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20170817&t=2&i=1197481209&w=&fh=545px&fw=&ll=&pl=&sq=&r=LYNXNPED7G0S6", "extractedDates": [{"textStart": 2433, "date": "2016-07-15", "amb": false, "textEnd": 2446}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "Federal Republic of Germany"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 5, "id": "56", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "label": {"eng": "Federal Republic of Germany"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "Turkey"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 5, "id": "225", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey", "label": {"eng": "Turkey"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "Turkey"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Ankara"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 5, "id": "10258", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ankara", "label": {"eng": "Ankara"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "Federal Republic of Germany"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Land Berlin"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 2, "id": "111334", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin", "label": {"eng": "Land Berlin"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "Federal Republic of Germany"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Frankfurt am Main, Stadt"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 2, "id": "277805", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankfurt", "label": {"eng": "Frankfurt am Main, Stadt"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": null, "score": 2, "id": "303048", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Angela Merkel"}, "id": "303059", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angela_Merkel"}, {"label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "id": "303064", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union"}, {"label": {"eng": "Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan"}, "id": "303349", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recep_Tayyip_Erdo\u011fan"}, {"label": {"eng": "Foreign Office (Germany)"}, "id": "303356", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Office_(Germany)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Coup d'\u00e9tat"}, "id": "303506", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coup_d'\u00e9tat"}, {"label": {"eng": "Member state of the European Union"}, "id": "303880", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_state_of_the_European_Union"}, {"label": {"eng": "State of emergency"}, "id": "305517", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_emergency"}, {"label": {"eng": "Eurasian Customs Union"}, "id": "340949", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurasian_Customs_Union"}, {"label": {"eng": "Customs union"}, "id": "382637", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customs_union"}], "location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "Turkey"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Ankara"}, "type": "place"}, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 139, "label": "dmoz/Society/Government", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Government"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 140, "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 143, "label": "dmoz/Reference/Education/Colleges and Universities", "uri": "dmoz/Reference/Education/Colleges_and_Universities"}], "time": "11:10:00"}

And anti-Brexit campaigners in Britain said they would merely replace EU regulations with new ones that could be even more onerous.\n\nThe Department for Exiting the European Union said there could be \"a temporary customs union between the U.K. and the EU\" to avoid border chaos when Britain officially leaves the bloc in March 2019.\n\nBrexit Secretary David Davis said the transition period could last about two years.\n\nIn the long term, the department said, a \"customs partnership\" could eliminate the need for a border for goods traveling between Britain and the EU.

The customs union allows goods to move within the EU without checks, but also imposes tariffs on imports from outside the EU. That would prevent Britain striking new free trade deals while it remains inside the arrangement.\n\nThe British proposal says the U.K. should be free to negotiate new trade relationships during the transition period, something EU officials are likely to find problematic.\n\nScottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, who favors Britain's staying in the single market and customs union, accused the government on Twitter of having a \"daft 'have cake and eat it' approach\" to Brexit.\n\nPro-EU Labour lawmaker Chuka Umunna said the proposals \"are offering a red tape bombshell for British business.\"\n\nThe customs proposals are the first in a series of papers covering thorny issues in the negotiations, which are due to resume in Brussels at the end of this month. Another, on the status of the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, is due to be published this week.\n\nThe European Commission said it took note of Britain's suggestions, \"but we will only address them once we have made sufficient progress on the terms of the orderly withdrawal\" from the bloc.\n\nThe EU says negotiations on its future relations with Britain can't start until sufficient progress has been made on three initial issues: how much money the U.K. will have to pay to settle its outstanding commitments to the bloc; whether security checks and customs duties will be instituted on the Irish border; and the status of 3 million EU nationals living in Britain.\n\nMichel Barnier, the EU's chief Brexit negotiator, tweeted that the quicker the two sides \"agree on citizens, settling accounts and Ireland, the quicker we can discuss customs & future relationship.\"", "id": "9301332", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-15", "title": "UK Says It May Seek

The customs union allows goods to move within the EU without checks, but also imposes tariffs on imports from outside the EU.

duties will be instituted on the Irish border; and the status of 3 million EU nationals living in Britain.\n\nMichel Barnier, the EU's chief Brexit negotiator, tweeted that the quicker the two sides

It will be the clearest insight yet into the details of what Prime Minister Theresa May, Brexit Secretary David Davis, and the rest of the Cabinet hope to achieve in divorce talks with the EU.\n\nThe paper is expected to express the government's desire to leave the customs union but seek to negotiate a totally \"new\" customs relationship which is as \"frictionless\" as possible. The British side hopes the EU will agree to a bespoke, time-limited customs arrangement, which will protect the economy from the effects of a \"cliff-edge\" Brexit and allow businesses to carry on as normal, according to multiple reports.\n\nThis will be viewed as a victory for Chancellor Philip Hammond, who has urged colleagues to embrace a softer Brexit based on transitional arrangements. The plans will likely anger hard Brexiteers, including those on the Tory backbenches, who want to see a clean divorce which isn't delayed by a transitional period. An unnamed Cabinet minister last month accused Hammond and his sympathisers of trying to \"f--- up\" and \"frustrate\" Brexit.\n\nThe government also wants to be able to negotiate trade deals with countries around the world during this proposed transitional period. Full custom union members are prohibited from doing trade deals with countries outside the EU.\n\nThe EU has made it clear on several occasions it will not discuss future trade relations with Britain until significant progress has been made on issues like the rights of citizens and the money the UK must pay in financial obligations, or the divorce bill as it has become known.\n\nHowever, the feeling within government is British negotiators will struggle to make progress when talks resume later this month unless the British side has a clear understanding of what it wants post-Brexit trade relations to look like.\n\nThe Confederation of British Industry (CBI) welcomed the government's plan for a transitional customs union arrangement, describing the position paper as \"encouraging\" in a statement released on Tuesday morning.\n\nCBI Deputy Director General Josh Hardie said: \"Companies will welcome the progress government has made today in publishing these papers. Over the past year, businesses have been providing policymakers with the evidence, ideas and solutions to make a success of Brexit.\n\n\"So it's encouraging to see that these papers propose a time-limited interim period and a customs system that is as barrier-free as possible.\"\n\nThe Labour Party has attacked the proposals as \"incoherent\" and urged the government to retain the \"same basic terms\" of customs union membership.\n\n\"Labour is clear that we need to retain the benefits of the customs union and avoid a cliff-edge for the British economy,\" a spokesperson said. \"That means committing now to strong transitional arrangements on the same basic terms we currently enjoy -- including the single market and customs union.\"\n\nThe Liberal Democrats dismissed the plans as merely delaying the inevitable \"pain\" of an extreme Brexit. The party's Brexit Spokesperson Tom Brake said: \"Even if they were agreed to by the EU, these proposals will only delay the economic pain caused by leaving the customs union.\n\n\"We still face the prospect of more red tape for businesses, longer queues at our borders, and higher prices for consumers once the transition comes to an end.\"\n\nBrake added: \"The only way to ensure 'free and frictionless' trade with the EU is to remain a full member of the Customs Union and Single Market. It doesn't matter how it's dressed up or how long it's postponed, the government's extreme Brexit will end up leaving Britain poorer.\"\n\nRead More\n\nJack Taylor / Getty\n\nWhat is the customs union? And what does the government want to achieve?\n\nThe customs union is a central part of the 28-nation bloc's apparatus which means member states trade freely with each other and have all agreed to charge the same tariff on imports from outside of the bloc. This means countries importing goods into the EU pay the same tariff regardless of which member states they are importing to. Members of the customs union are prohibited from negotiating their own trade deals with countries elsewhere in the world.\n\nMay's government has accepted Britain will leave the customs union when the two-year Article 50 period expires in March 2019. Opponents of this plan warn leaving the customs union would unleash economic and political chaos, like heavy tariffs being imposed on goods; long queues at customs; and the return of a hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland. A position paper on the Irish border dilemma is expected to be published this month.\n\nThe Cabinet is keen to avoid chaos and so aims to negotiate a transitional customs arrangement which will allow Britain to continue having close relations with the customs union for an interim period as a non-EU member state.\n\nOnce the transitional period is over, Britain will seek to negotiate a \"highly streamlined\" long-term customs arrangement with the EU or a new \"partnership\" with no customs border at all, the paper is set to add.\n\nThe EU has warned Britain it will not be able to negotiate a \"cherry-picked\" transition deal and will be expected to adhere to EU rules if it wishes to enjoy a privileged relationship with institutions like the customs union.\n\n\"If you want the advantages you of a single market and customs union, you have to take the obligations,\" EU Parliament chief Brexit negotiator Guy Verhofstadt said earlier this year.\n\nNOW WATCH: Guy Verhofstadt tells us why

That means businesses need to have confidence that there will not be a cliff-edge when we leave the EU in just over 20 months' time,\" they wrote.\n\n\"That is why we believe a time-limited interim period will be important to further our national interest and give business greater certainty -- but it cannot be indefinite; it cannot be a back door to staying in the EU.\"\n\n\"We are both clear that during this period the UK will be outside the customs union and will be a 'third country', not a party to EU treaties.\"\n\nThe joint comments by Hammond and Fox came after weeks of clashes over the UK's future outside the bloc.\n\nThe UK is currently due to leave the EU at the end of March 2019 after nearly 52 percent of Britons opted to leave the bloc during the EU referendum in June last

"eng-3358827", "body": "LONDON: Britain said on Tuesday it would seek a \"temporary customs union\" with the European Union after Brexit, in an opening gambit for trade negotiations that received a cool response from Brussels.\n\nThe government said broadly similar arrangements could apply to EU-UK trade in goods as they do now for around two years, to allow businesses longer to adapt to new post-Brexit systems.\n\nUnlike at present, however, Britain said it wanted to be able to negotiate free trade agreements with third countries during the interim period which would then be implemented afterwards.\n\n\"It's much more sensible, we think, if there is a shortish period in which we maintain the current arrangements,\" Brexit minister David Davis told BBC radio, adding that it could last \"something like two years\" -- ending before the 2022 election.\n\nThe proposal for a transitional arrangement was welcomed by the Confederation of British Industry, Britain's big business lobby group, but critics dismissed it as a \"fantasy\".\n\nThe European Commission, the EU's executive arm, said it would \"take note\" of the proposals, but warned: \"'Frictionless trade' is not possible outside the single market and customs union.\"\n\nEU chief negotiator Michel Barnier also repeated that talks on the future trading relationship could not begin until progress was made on other issues, including Britain's exit bill.\n\n- 'Clock is ticking' -\n\nBritain says its membership of the EU customs union, which allows for the tariff-free movement of goods, will end along with its membership of the single market -- its largest trading partner -- when it leaves the bloc in March 2019.\n\nExperts have warned it will be extremely difficult, if not impossible, to negotiate a new EU-UK free trade agreement before then, raising fears of a damaging \"cliff-edge\".\n\n\"One possible approach would be a temporary customs union between the UK and the EU,\" the Brexit ministry said.\n\nThe CBI's deputy director Josh Hardie said the government's proposal was \"encouraging\", but added: \"The clock is ticking and what matters now is giving companies the confidence to continue investing as quickly as possible.\"\n\nIn a policy paper published on Tuesday, Britain said it could streamline and simplify trade arrangements with the EU once it has left the customs union.\n\nBut it admitted there would be \"an increase in administration compared with being inside the EU customs union\".\n\nAn alternative would be a new customs partnership in which Britain effectively adopts the EU's external customs border to allow for free EU-UK trade, but applies its own trade policy and tariff for imports and exports with third countries destined only for the UK market.\n\nBut in recognition of the huge practical challenges that Brexit presents, the policy paper acknowledged this was \"an innovative and untested approach\".\n\n- 'Wishful thinking' -\n\nA third round of Brexit negotiations is due to begin at the end of August, focused on Britain's financial settlement, the issue of expatriate rights, and the border between British-controlled Northern Ireland and Ireland.\n\nLondon argues that customs arrangements are crucial to resolving the Irish border issue, on which it plans to publish further proposals on Wednesday.\n\nBut Brussels insists there must be broad agreement on the three priority issues before trade negotiations begin, by the EU leaders' summit in October at the earliest.\n\n\"The quicker UK & EU 27 agree on citizens, settling accounts and Ireland, the quicker we can discuss customs and future relationship,\" Barnier said on Twitter.\n\nOpposition Labour lawmaker Chris Leslie, from the campaign group Open Britain, said the proposal for an interim customs union represented \"wishful thinking of the highest order\".\n\n\"It is a fantasy to pretend we can have the freest and most frictionless trade possible with our largest partner when the government remain intent on pulling Britain out of the customs union,\" he said.\n\nGuy Verhofstadt, the European Parliament's outspoken Brexit negotiator, added: \"To be in & out of the Customs Union & 'invisible borders' is a fantasy.\"", "id": "9306633", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-15", "title": "UK to seek 'temporary customs union' after Brexit | Business Recorder", "image":

He estimated to the BBC \"something like two years, maybe a bit shorter\", and said it would end by 2022 at the latest.\n\nThe paper also sets out two alternatives for a permanent customs arrangement with the EU. It does not say which the government prefers, calling them \"two broad approaches the UK could adopt\" depending on negotiations with the EU.\n\nUnder one, a \"highly streamlined customs arrangement\", the UK and EU would use \"technology-based solutions\" to make it easier for businesses to satisfy new requirements and procedures when moving goods across the border.\n\nUnder the other, the UK would sign a \"new customs partnership\" with the EU that would eliminate the need for a border - for example mirroring EU requirements for imports from the rest of the world where the final destination is the EU.\n\nInternational Trade Secretary Dr Liam Fox said leaving the customs union would allow Britain to generate \"fully independent trade policy\".\n\n\"We will seek a new customs arrangement that ensures that trade between the UK and the EU remains as frictionless as possible and allows us to forge new trade relationships with our partners in Europe and around the world,\" he said.\n\nA European Commission spokesman they would study the UK position paper ahead of the next round of negotiations at the end of August.\n\nHowever they do not want to start talking about customs plans until they have made more progress on talks over the \"divorce bill\" - an agreement on the Brexit financial settlement as well as issues including the rights of EU citizens in the UK.\n\n\"We take note of the UK's request for an implementing period and its preferences as regards the future relationship, but we will only address them once we have made sufficient progress on the terms of the orderly withdrawal,\" the spokesman said.\n\n\"An agreement on a future relationship between the EU and the UK can only be finalised once the UK has become a third country??? 'frictionless trade' is not possible outside the single market and customs union.\"\n\nThe EU is also working on a position paper on the customs union.\n\nMr Davis said during the transition period Britain would be able to negotiation new trade deals.\n\n\"We should be able to have an arrangement where we can do the negotiations, sign it off, but not enter into effect,\" he said.\n\nBut former European commissioner for trade Karel de Gucht told the BBC he doubted the EU would agree to a temporary customs union if it also meant Britain could start working on other trade deals.\n\nOtherwise the EU would effectively be agreeing to help the UK undercut EU tariffs, he said.\n\nInstead, he predicted, the EU would want the UK to stay in the customs union on its own terms: paying contributions to the EU budget and not seeking to sign other trade deals.\n\n\"It's a quagmire, you know,\" he said.\n\nIreland's EU commissioner Phil Hogan told the Financial Times that Dublin could block a customs deal unless the problem of the Northern Ireland border was satisfactorily solved.\n\n\"There's a high level of delusion in London at the moment about what is required to be done,\" Mr Hogan said.\n\nThe government is expected to publish its plan for the border on Wednesday.\n\nThe customs plan is being seen as a concession towards a 'soft Brexit' that has been sought by companies and other groups worried about the impact of a rushed exit from Europe.\n\nThe Federation of Small Businesses said it \"would give small businesses the time they need to prepare for new customs arrangements, which is very welcome\".\n\nBut the official Leave campaign called it a \"Brexit betrayal\", saying it was a \"stitch-up to delay global trade for years\".\n\n\"When 17.4 million voted Leave last year we wanted to control our destiny as a trading nation,\" the Leave.EU Twitter account said. \"This new plan is a disgrace!\"\n\nWhen 17.4m voted Leave last year we wanted to control our destiny as a trading nation.

During this interim period, which will be negotiated with Brussels, Britain will look to negotiate bold new trade relationships around the world.\"\n\nBusinesses welcomed the proposals, but the Confederation of British Industry also warned the government that \"the clock is ticking and what matters now is giving companies the confidence to continue investing as quickly as possible\".\n\nEU WANTS PROGRESS ON WITHDRAWAL\n\nThe EU said it would study the proposals carefully but it would only address the proposal for an implementation period once sufficient progress had been made on Britain's withdrawal.\n\nThe EU wants to make progress on several key issues by October, including the financial bill for Britain's exit, but Brexit minister David Davis told the BBC there would not be an agreed figure on the financial settlement by then.\n\n\"We're going to talk it through very, very carefully, so at this stage we're not going to commit,\" he said.\n\nHe later told LBC Radio: \"We're going to have a long haggle ... (EU chief negotiator) Michel (Barnier) is getting quite cross with us. He's saying 'You should make your proposal'.\"\n\nDavis said Britain should not have to pay to have a temporary customs union with the EU. Any transitional period would most likely last for two years, he added, and must be over by the time of the next British national election, due in 2022.\n\nIn an effort to move the talks with the EU on to the issue of Britain's future relationship, Prime Minister Theresa May and her government had promised to publish a series of policy documents this week.\n\nBut after being accused by some EU officials of being ill prepared for the first rounds of negotiations, the government's demand to secure trade deals while participating in a temporary customs union may cause further problems.\n\n\"It looks like the new unified position in the cabinet is to return the government to the territory of wanting to have their cake and eat it\", said Chris Leslie, a pro-EU campaigner and member of Britain's opposition Labour Party.\n\nTURKISH ARRANGEMENT?\n\nCountries that are part of the EU's customs union are not allowed to negotiate bilateral trade deals, and May's government has said Brexit means Britain must leave the customs union.\n\nBut Turkey, while not an EU member, is part of a separate customs union for industrial goods and can still negotiate bilateral trade deals. It was not clear whether Britain was pursuing a similar arrangement to Turkey.\n\nThe government said that, by sorting out the customs arrangements, Britain and the bloc could avoid a \"hard border\" with EU member state Ireland, something that officials fear could reignite tensions between Irish nationalists and unionists in British-ruled Northern Ireland.\n\nIt proposed two different approaches -- a highly streamlined customs arrangement managed by Britain, or a new customs partnership with the EU -- that it said could \"negate the need for a customs border\".\n\nThe government will set out its proposed solutions for the border between Northern Ireland and Ireland in detail on Wednesday.\n\nThe position papers are intended to flesh out the government's Brexit vision and show a united stance over the future relationship after rifts emerged among ministers.", "id": "9255196", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-15", "title": "Britain Asks for Interim Customs Deal With EU, New Trade

Any transitional period would most likely last for two years and must be over by the time of the next British election, due in 2022, he said.\n\nBut May's government, which hopes that the publication of its thinking will paper over the cracks between ministers on Brexit, will also demand that Britain should be able to negotiate deals with other countries during the interim period - a potential sticking point with the EU.\n\nOpposition politicians criticised the government for wanting to have \"their cake and eat it\", while pro-Brexit campaigners said Britain was taking a \"defeatist attitude\" by accepting it could not implement new trade deals during the interim period.\n\nCountries that are part of the EU's customs union are not allowed to negotiate bilateral trade deals, and May's government has said Brexit means Britain must leave the customs union.\n\nBut Turkey, while not an EU member, is part of a separate customs union for industrial goods and can still negotiate bilateral trade deals.\n\nBritain said that \"while the government has looked at precedents set by customs agreements between other countries, it is not seeking to replicate another country's model\".\n\nThe government said that, by sorting out the customs arrangements, Britain and the bloc could avoid a \"hard border\" with EU member state Ireland, something that officials fear could reignite tensions between Irish nationalists and unionists in British-ruled Northern Ireland.\n\nThe government will set out its proposed solutions for the border between Northern Ireland and Ireland

[Shutterstock]\n\nThe United Kingdom has said it wants an interim customs agreement with the European Union after Brexit to allow the freest possible trade of goods, but that it will also seek the right to negotiate other trade deals - a possible sticking point in the talks.\n\nAccording to excerpts of a government document to be published on Tuesday (15 August) setting out Britain's strategy, the government will say one option to minimise friction when it leaves the bloc in March 2019 would be to introduce a temporary customs union, which should be \"time-limited\".\n\nThat would provide certainty for businesses, the government said, aiming to address a main concern of companies who fear the introduction of customs checks will cause expensive delays.\n\n\"Ministers will announce an intention to seek an 'interim' period with the EU of close association with the customs union that would allow for a smooth and orderly transfer to the new regime,\" the government said in a statement ahead of publication of the first in a series of \"future partnership papers\".\n\n\"One possible approach would be a temporary customs union between the UK and the EU... During this interim period, which will be negotiated with Brussels, Britain will look to negotiate bold new trade relationships around the world.\"\n\nBusinesses welcomed the proposals, but the Confederation of British Industry also warned the government that \"the clock is ticking and what matters now is giving companies the confidence to continue investing as quickly as possible\".\n\nEU demands progress\n\nThe EU said it would study the proposals carefully but it would only address the proposal for an implementation period once sufficient progress had been made on Britain's withdrawal.\n\nThe EU wants to make progress on several key issues by October, including the financial bill for Britain's exit, but Brexit minister David Davis told the BBC there would not be an agreed figure on the financial settlement by then.\n\n\"We're going to talk it through very, very carefully, so at this stage we're not going to commit,\" he said.\n\nHe later told LBC Radio: \"We're going to have a long haggle ... (EU chief negotiator) Michel (Barnier) is getting quite cross with us. He's saying 'You should make your proposal'.\"\n\nDavis said Britain should not have to pay to have a temporary customs union with the EU. Any transitional period would most likely last for two years, he added, and must be over by the time of the next British national election, due in 2022.\n\nIn an effort to move the talks with the EU on to the issue of Britain's future relationship, Prime Minister Theresa May and her government had promised to publish a series of policy documents this week.\n\nBut after being accused by some EU officials of being ill prepared for the first rounds of negotiations, the government's demand to secure trade deals while participating in a temporary customs union may cause further problems.\n\n\"It looks like the new unified position in the cabinet is to return the government to the territory of wanting to have their cake and eat it\", said Chris Leslie, a pro-EU campaigner and member of Britain's opposition Labour Party.\n\nTurkey model?\n\nCountries that are part of the EU's customs union are not allowed to negotiate bilateral trade deals, and May's government has said Brexit means Britain must leave the customs union.\n\nBut Turkey, while not an EU member, is part of a separate customs union for industrial goods and can still negotiate bilateral trade deals. It was not clear whether Britain was pursuing a similar arrangement to Turkey.\n\nThe government said that, by sorting out the customs arrangements, Britain and the bloc could avoid a \"hard border\" with EU member state Ireland, something that officials fear could reignite tensions between Irish nationalists and unionists in Northern Ireland.\n\nIt proposed two different approaches - a highly streamlined customs arrangement managed by Britain, or a new customs partnership with the EU - that it said could \"negate the need for a customs border\".\n\nThe government will set out its proposed solutions for the border between Northern Ireland and Ireland in detail on Wednesday (16 August).\n\nThe position papers are intended to flesh out the government's Brexit vision and show a united stance over the future relationship after rifts emerged among ministers.", "id": "9258952", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-15", "title": "UK floats post-Brexit interim customs deal idea", "image":

He estimated to the BBC \"something like two years, maybe a bit shorter\", and said it would end by 2022 at the latest.\n\nThe paper also sets out two alternatives for a permanent customs arrangement with the EU. It does not say which the government prefers, calling them \"two broad approaches the UK could adopt\" depending on negotiations with the EU.\n\nUnder one, a \"highly streamlined customs arrangement\", the UK and EU would use \"technology-based solutions\" to make it easier for businesses to satisfy new requirements and procedures when moving goods across the border.\n\nUnder the other, the UK would sign a \"new customs partnership\" with the EU that would eliminate the need for a border - for example mirroring EU requirements for imports from the rest of the world where the final destination is the EU.\n\nInternational Trade Secretary Dr Liam Fox said leaving the customs union would allow Britain to generate \"fully independent trade policy\".\n\n\"We will seek a new customs arrangement that ensures that trade between the UK and the EU remains as frictionless as possible and allows us to forge new trade relationships with our partners in Europe and around the world,\" he said.\n\nA European Commission spokesman they would study the UK position paper ahead of the next round of negotiations at the end of August.\n\nHowever they do not want to start talking about customs plans until they have made more progress on talks over the \"divorce bill\" - an agreement on the Brexit financial settlement as well as issues including the rights of EU citizens in the UK.\n\n\"We take note of the UK's request for an implementing period and its preferences as regards the future relationship, but we will only address them once we have made sufficient progress on the terms of the orderly withdrawal,\" the spokesman said.\n\n\"An agreement on a future relationship between the EU and the UK can only be finalised once the UK has become a third country??? 'frictionless trade' is not possible outside the single market and customs union.\"\n\nThe EU is also working on a position paper on the customs union.\n\nMr Davis said during the transition period Britain would be able to negotiation new trade deals.\n\n\"We should be able to have an arrangement where we can do the negotiations, sign it off, but not enter into effect,\" he said.\n\nBut former European commissioner for trade Karel de Gucht told the BBC he doubted the EU would agree to a temporary customs union if it also meant Britain could start working on other trade deals.\n\nOtherwise the EU would effectively be agreeing to help the UK undercut EU tariffs, he said.\n\nInstead, he predicted, the EU would want the UK to stay in the customs union on its own terms: paying contributions to the EU budget and not seeking to sign other trade deals.\n\n\"It's a quagmire, you know,\" he said.\n\nIreland's EU commissioner Phil Hogan told the Financial Times that Dublin could block a customs deal unless the problem of the Northern Ireland border was satisfactorily solved.\n\n\"There's a high level of delusion in London at the moment about what is required to be done,\" Mr Hogan said.\n\nThe government is expected to publish its plan for the border on Wednesday.\n\nThe customs plan is being seen as a concession towards a 'soft Brexit' that has been sought by companies and other groups worried about the impact of a rushed exit from Europe.\n\nThe Federation of Small Businesses said it \"would give small businesses the time they need to prepare for new customs arrangements, which is very welcome\".\n\nBut the official Leave campaign called it a \"Brexit betrayal\", saying it was a \"stitch-up to delay global trade for years\".\n\n\"When 17.4 million voted Leave last year we wanted to control our destiny as a trading nation,\" the Leave.EU Twitter account said. \"This new plan is a disgrace!\"\n\nWhen 17.4m voted Leave last year we wanted to control our destiny as a trading nation.

The persistent uncertainty -- 14 months after Britain voted to leave the EU -- is weighing on the economy.\n\nTrade Secretary Liam Fox and Treasury chief Philip Hammond wrote in the Sunday Telegraph that in 2019 Britain will leave both the EU's single market in goods and services and its customs union.\n\nThe single market ensures tariff-less trade in goods and services and is linked closely by the EU with other rights, such as the right of EU citizens to cross borders. The customs union allows goods to move within the EU without checks, but also imposes tariffs on imports from outside the EU.

London has tried to cover up the cracks in the British cabinet by dancing around the key decisions, while at the same time seeking to assure British businesses that it does not plan to crash out of the EU without a deal on what happens next.\n\nThe result is a fudge which will not fly with the rest of the EU. This plan will not survive contact with the enemy when the British negotiators get to Brussels.\n\nBefore Brexit we did not spend much of our time talking about the EU customs union. It is the agreement which allows goods to circulate freely within the EU. It also means that goods imported from outside the EU can move without restriction around the EU, once they clear customs at the first point of entry.\n\nIt is a normal part of business now for companies across the union - and in Britain - for example allowing car parts to be manufactured in France and assembled in the UK, or goods to move from Ireland through the UK for onward sale in Germany, France or wherever.\n\nBritain is trying to hold on to the advantages of this - in so far as it can - while at the same time winning flexibility to negotiate new trade deals with other countries, such as the US. At the same time, London is trying to come up with a plan which keeps the hard Brexit lobby happy, while at the same time avoiding the cliff-edge fall out of the EU in March 2019 which business fears.\n\nThe resulting confusion is best seen in its approach to the customs union. It would make sense for Britain to propose to remain in the customs union, certainly for a transition period after Brexit and - from an economic point of view - beyond that as well.\n\nHowever the hard Brexit lobby insists \"Brexit means Brexit\" and Britain must leave the EU single market and the customs union. To try to ride both horses at once, the document suggests that Britain will leave the customs union when it leaves the EU in March 2019, but that it will seek to have an interim period when it would have a \"continued close association with the EU customs union for a time-limited period after the UK has left the EU\". This, it says, could involve a common external tariff and no customs processes and duties between the UK and the EU.\n\nNow, using the duck test, this would mean in effect that Britain wants to remain a member of the customs union, in all but name, during the interim period. But at the same time it would see itself as free to start trade negotiations with other third countries. This won't fly with the rest of the EU. Why should they agree to it? They are likely to tell Britain that it is either in or out of the customs union during any transition - and if it is in, it plays by all the rules. This has echoes of the wider Brexit dilemma for Britain - it can't hold on to the advantages of EU membership, while at the same time implementing its own policies in areas such as immigration.\n\nBeyond the transition period, wider questions appear about a long-term UK/EU trade deal. The paper sees two possible solutions. One is to erect customs borders, but to try to keep them as seamless as possible. There is no doubt that advanced IT can help, but a border is still a border and the paper concedes that the administrative burden on business will rise. The economic nonsense of Brexit is exposed again - a whole load of new IT and customs investment for something that is worse than the situation which currently exits.\n\nThe second option seen by the paper in the longer term is some kind of new customs union deal between Britain and the EU, which the document says could avoid the need for a UK/EU goods border. This looks even less likely to come into being .\n\nThe key issue here is how to control goods entering Britain from third countries and ensure the correct rules and tariffs are applied before they enter the EU. The document makes suggestions on policing this, but they don't look very convincing. Also, the same issue applies for the EU. Why sign up to this deal which gives Britain so many benefits of a customs union without the same obligations as the rest?\n\nGiven the incoherence of the British approach, the best strategy for Ireland - for the moment at least - seems to be to keep pushing for Britain to remain in the customs union. The document says that it won't, but a lot of talking still lies ahead.\n\nWe also need to play the Border card as hard as possible. The British paper rules out Border controls between the North and the UK. This means that if Britain is out of the customs union, a Border will be needed on the island. This is where we need to dig in.\n\nW e also need to be ready for some serious rows when the talks start again in a few weeks, with all the unwelcome uncertainty that will bring. The most overused phrase we will hear about Brexit in the weeks ahead is \"the clock is ticking\".

"storyUri": "eng-3358827", "body": "Britain said on Tuesday it would seek a \"temporary customs union\" with the European Union after Brexit, in an opening gambit for trade negotiations that received a cool response from Brussels.\n\nThe government said broadly similar arrangements could apply to EU-UK trade in goods as they do now for around two years, to allow businesses longer to adapt to new post-Brexit systems.\n\nUnlike at present, however, Britain said it wanted to be able to negotiate free trade agreements with third countries during the interim period which would then be implemented afterwards.\n\n\"It's much more sensible, we think, if there is a shortish period in which we maintain the current arrangements,\" Brexit minister David Davis told BBC radio, adding that it could last \"something like two years\" -- ending before the 2022 election.\n\nThe proposal for a transitional arrangement was welcomed by the Confederation of British Industry, Britain's big business lobby group, but critics dismissed it as a \"fantasy\".\n\nThe European Commission, the EU's executive arm, said it would \"take note\" of the proposals, but warned: \"'Frictionless trade' is not possible outside the single market and customs union.\"\n\nEU chief negotiator Michel Barnier also repeated that talks on the future trading relationship could not begin until progress was made on other issues, including Britain's exit bill.\n\n- 'Clock is ticking' -\n\nBritain says its membership of the EU customs union, which allows for the tariff-free movement of goods, will end along with its membership of the single market -- its largest trading partner -- when it leaves the bloc in March 2019.\n\nExperts have warned it will be extremely difficult, if not impossible, to negotiate a new EU-UK free trade agreement before then, raising fears of a damaging \"cliff-edge\".\n\n\"One possible approach would be a temporary customs union between the UK and the EU,\" the Brexit ministry said.\n\nThe CBI's deputy director Josh Hardie said the government's proposal was \"encouraging\", but added: \"The clock is ticking and what matters now is giving companies the confidence to continue investing as quickly as possible.\"\n\nIn a policy paper published on Tuesday, Britain said it could streamline and simplify trade arrangements with the EU once it has left the customs union.\n\nBut it admitted there would be \"an increase in administration compared with being inside the EU customs union\".\n\nAn alternative would be a new customs partnership in which Britain effectively adopts the EU's external customs border to allow for free EU-UK trade, but applies its own trade policy and tariff for imports and exports with third countries destined only for the UK market.\n\nBut in recognition of the huge practical challenges that Brexit presents, the policy paper acknowledged this was \"an innovative and untested approach\".\n\n- 'Wishful thinking' -\n\nA third round of Brexit negotiations is due to begin at the end of August, focused on Britain's financial settlement, the issue of expatriate rights, and the border between British-controlled Northern Ireland and Ireland.\n\nLondon argues that customs arrangements are crucial to resolving the Irish border issue, on which it plans to publish further proposals on Wednesday.\n\nBut Brussels insists there must be broad agreement on the three priority issues before trade negotiations begin, by the EU leaders' summit in October at the earliest.\n\n\"The quicker UK & EU 27 agree on citizens, settling accounts and Ireland, the quicker we can discuss customs and future relationship,\" Barnier said on Twitter.\n\nOpposition Labour lawmaker Chris Leslie, from the campaign group Open Britain, said the proposal for an interim customs union represented \"wishful thinking of the highest order\".\n\n\"It is a fantasy to pretend we can have the freest and most frictionless trade possible with our largest partner when the government remain intent on pulling Britain out of the customs union,\" he said.\n\nGuy Verhofstadt, the European Parliament's outspoken Brexit negotiator, added: \"To be in & out of the Customs Union & 'invisible borders' is a fantasy.\"", "id": "9280971", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-15", "title": "UK to seek 'temporary customs union' after Brexit", "image":

Brexit Secretary David Davis said the transition period could last about two years.\n\nIn the long term, the department said, a \"customs partnership\" could eliminate the need for a border for goods traveling between Britain and the EU. Alternately, it suggested \"a highly streamlined customs arrangement\" could be set up, using technology to ease border procedures.\n\nThe proposal - one of a series intended to disprove allegations that Britain is underprepared for Brexit - drew a cool response from Brussels.\n\n\"To be in & out of the Customs Union & 'invisible borders' is a fantasy,\" tweeted Guy Verhofstadt, the European Parliament's Brexit coordinator.\n\nSome British businesses have accused the government of being vague about whether there will be economic barriers with the EU after Brexit in March 2019. The persistent uncertainty - 14 months after Britain voted to leave the EU - is weighing on the economy.\n\nTrade Secretary Liam Fox and Treasury chief Philip Hammond wrote in the Sunday Telegraph that in 2019 Britain will leave both the EU's single market in goods and services and its customs union.\n\nThe single market ensures tariff-less trade in goods and services and is linked closely by the EU with other rights, such as the right of EU citizens to cross borders. The customs union allows goods to move within the EU without checks, but also imposes tariffs on imports from outside the EU. That would prevent Britain striking new free trade deals while it remains inside the arrangement.\n\nThe British proposal says the U.K. should be free to negotiate new trade relationships during the transition period, something EU officials are likely to find problematic.\n\nScottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, who favors Britain's staying in the single market and customs union, accused the government on Twitter of having a \"daft 'have cake and eat it' approach.\"\n\nThe customs proposals are the first in a series of papers covering thorny issues in the negotiations, which are due to resume in Brussels at the end of this month. Another, on the status of the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, is due to be published this week.\n\nThe European Commission said it took note of Britain's suggestions, \"but we will only address them once we have made sufficient progress on the terms of the orderly withdrawal\" from the bloc.\n\nThe EU says negotiations on its future relations with Britain can't start until sufficient progress has been made on three initial issues: how much money the U.K. will have to pay to settle its outstanding commitments to the bloc; whether security checks and customs duties will be instituted on the Irish border; and the status of 3 million EU nationals living in Britain.\n\nCopyright 2017 The Associated Press.

During this interim period, which will be negotiated with Brussels, Britain will look to negotiate bold new trade relationships around the world.\" Businesses welcomed the proposals, but the Confederation of British Industry also warned the government that \"the clock is ticking and what matters now is giving companies the confidence to continue investing as quickly as possible\".\n\nEU wants progress on withdrawal\n\nThe EU said it would study the proposals carefully but it would only address the proposal for an implementation period once sufficient progress had been made on Britain's withdrawal.\n\nThe EU wants to make progress on several key issues by October, including the financial bill for Britain's exit, but Brexit minister David Davis told the BBC there would not be an agreed figure on the financial settlement by then.\n\n\"We're going to talk it through very, very carefully, so at this stage we're not going to commit,\" he said.\n\nHe later told LBC Radio: \"We're going to have a long haggle... [EU chief negotiator] Michel [Barnier] is getting quite cross with us. He's saying 'You should make your proposal'.\"\n\nDavis said Britain should not have to pay to have a temporary customs union with the EU. Any transitional period would most likely last for two years, he added, and must be over by the time of the next British national election, due in 2022.\n\nIn an effort to move the talks with the EU on to the issue of Britain's future relationship, Prime Minister Theresa May and her government had promised to publish a series of policy documents this week.\n\nBut after being accused by some EU officials of being ill prepared for the first rounds of negotiations, the government's demand to secure trade deals while participating in a temporary customs union may cause further problems.\n\n\"It looks like the new unified position in the cabinet is to return the government to the territory of wanting to have their cake and eat it\", said Chris Leslie, a pro-EU campaigner and member of Britain's opposition Labour Party.\n\nTurkish arrangement?\n\nCountries that are part of the EU's customs union are not allowed to negotiate bilateral trade deals, and May's government has said Brexit means Britain must leave the customs union.\n\nBut Turkey, while not an EU member, is part of a separate customs union for industrial goods and can still negotiate bilateral trade deals. It was not clear whether Britain was pursuing a similar arrangement to Turkey.\n\nThe government said that, by sorting out the customs arrangements, Britain and the bloc could avoid a \"hard border\" with EU member state Ireland, something that officials fear could reignite tensions between Irish nationalists and unionists in British-ruled Northern Ireland.\n\nIt proposed two different approaches -- a highly streamlined customs arrangement managed by Britain, or a new customs partnership with the EU -- that it said could \"negate the need for a customs border\".\n\nThe government will set out its proposed solutions for the border between Northern Ireland and Ireland in detail on Wednesday.\n\nThe position papers are intended to flesh out the government's Brexit vision and show a united stance over the future relationship after rifts emerged among ministers.\n\nBritish inflation steadies as Brexit impact fades\n\nLondon: Britain's annual inflation rate steadied in July, with an expected rise failing to materialise as the pound recovers from a Brexit-fuelled slump, official data showed Tuesday.\n\nThe Consumer Prices Index (CPI) stood at 2.6 per cent last month, the same level as June, the Office for National Statistics said in a statement.\n\nThe ONS added that lower motor fuel costs offset rising prices for clothing, food and household goods.\n\nAnalysts' consensus forecast had been for an increase to 2.7 per cent.\n\n\"The expected pick-up didn't happen,\" said Neil Wilson, analyst at trading firm ETX Capital.\n\n\"The sterling exchange rate has stabilised, meaning far less pass-through from the weaker pound on the inflation rate. We're even getting to the stage in the year where the pound will be actually stronger than it was 12 months before, especially against the US dollar,\" Wilson said.", "id": "9323288", "details": {},

post-Brexit systems.\n\nUnlike at present, however, Britain said it wanted to be able to negotiate free trade agreements with third countries during the interim period which would then be implemented afterward.\n\n\"It's much more sensible, we think, if there is a shortish period in which we maintain the current arrangements,\" Brexit minister David Davis told BBC radio, adding that it could last \"something like two years\" -- ending before the 2022 election.\n\nThe proposal for a transitional arrangement was welcomed by the Confederation of British Industry, Britain's big business lobby group, but critics dismissed it as a \"fantasy.\"\n\nThe European Commission, the EU's executive arm, said it would \"take note\" of the proposals, but warned: \"'Frictionless trade' is not possible outside the single market and customs union.\"\n\nEU chief negotiator Michel Barnier also repeated that talks on the future trading relationship could not begin until progress was made on other issues, including Britain's exit bill.\n\nBritain says its membership of the EU customs union, which allows for the tariff-free movement of goods, will end along with its membership of the single market -- its largest trading partner -- when it leaves the bloc in March 2019.\n\nExperts have warned it will be extremely difficult, if not impossible, to negotiate a new EU-UK free trade agreement

\"an increase in administration compared with being inside the EU customs union.\"\n\nAn alternative would be a new customs partnership in which Britain effectively adopts the EU's external customs border to allow for free EU-UK trade, but applies its own trade policy and tariff for imports and exports with third countries destined only for the UK market.\n\nBut in recognition of the huge practical challenges that Brexit presents, the policy paper acknowledged this was \"an innovative and untested approach.\"\n\nA third round of Brexit negotiations is due to begin at the end of August,

May has made it clear the UK is to end free movement of people with the EU in 2019.\n\nSimon Fraser, former head of the British diplomatic services, has said the Brexit talks have not begun well for Britain so far because of an internal discord in the UK Cabinet.\n\nThere have been reports in the British press that the government in London is prepared to pay up to GBP 36 billion (app. EUR 40 billion, USD 47 billion) to the EU to settle the so called Brexit \"divorce bill\", a substantially lower figure than the EUR 60 - 100 billion cited by some estimates.\n\nMedia reports have alleged the EU plans to ask Britain to pay some EUR 60 billion (USD 71 billion) to settle all financial obligations undertaken by the EU 28 until 2019, which is when Brexit is supposed to become a fact.\n\nHowever, a report by The Financial Times said the Brexit \"divorce bill\" to be sought by the EU was estimated at EUR 100 billion (USD 118 billion), almost double the previous estimate.\n\n'Untested Approach'\n\nThe British government will propose an \"innovative and untested approach\" to customs checks as part of its Brexit negotiations, the BBC reported.\n\nThe model is one of two being put forward in a newly-published paper, and would mean no customs checks at UK-EU borders.\n\nThe UK's alternative proposal - a more efficient system of border checks - would involve \"an increase in administration\".\n\nThe UK has already said it will leave the customs union - the EU's tariff-free trading area - after Brexit, and businesses have been calling for clarity on what the replacement system will involve.\n\nThe UK's departure from the EU's customs union was confirmed at the weekend in a joint article by Chancellor Philip Hammond and Trade Secretary Liam Fox.\n\nThe UK's proposals, detailed in what it calls a \"future partnership paper\", also include the possibility of a \"temporary customs union\" after the UK leaves the EU in March 2019 to avoid a \"cliff-edge\" for business as they adapt to the new arrangements.\n\n'Highly Streamlined' or No Border at All\n\nAccording to the newly-published government paper, the UK could ask the EU to establish a \"temporary customs union\" after Brexit in March 2019.\n\nBut during this period, it would also expect to be able to negotiate its own international trade deals - something it cannot do as an EU customs union member.\n\nOnce this period expires, the UK will look to agree either a \"highly streamlined\" border with the EU, or a new \"partnership\" with no customs border at all.\n\nThe British government said the interim arrangements would mean businesses would only have to adjust once to the new arrangements.\n\nAll of this will have to be negotiated with the EU - and the two sides have not yet even started discussing trade matters.\n\nDavid Davis, Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union, said he envisioned the interim customs system being \"as close as we can to the current arrangements\", but with the UK able to negotiate and sign its own international trade deals.\n\nHe did not rule out the UK paying to be part of the arrangement, saying he was not going to conduct negotiations on air.\n\nDavis said he did not believe the European Court of Justice would be the arbiter of the temporary arrangement, adding that the government would publish proposals on \"international arbitration\" next week.\n\nHe added the transition period had \"to be done by the election\", which has to take place by 2022 at the latest.", "id": "9424725", "details": {}, "date":

The persistent uncertainty -- 14 months after Britain voted to leave the EU -- is weighing on the economy.\n\nTrade Secretary Liam Fox and Treasury chief Philip Hammond wrote in the Sunday Telegraph that in 2019 Britain will leave both the EU's single market in goods and services and its customs union.\n\nThe single market ensures tariff-less trade in goods and services and is linked closely by the EU with other rights, such as the right of EU citizens to cross borders. The customs union allows goods to move within the EU without checks, but also imposes tariffs on imports from outside the EU. That would prevent Britain striking new free trade deals while it remains inside the arrangement.\n\nThe British proposal says the U.K. should be free to negotiate new trade relationships during the transition period, something EU officials are likely to find problematic.\n\nEU officials say Britain's stated goal of \"frictionless\" trade is impossible outside the single market and customs union.\n\nThe British government is trying to rebuff claims by EU officials that it is has been underprepared for divorce negotiations before a new round of talks in Brussels at the end of this month.\n\nThe customs proposals are the first in a series of papers covering thorny issues in the negotiations.

It was not clear whether Britain was pursuing a similar arrangement to Turkey.\n\nThe government said that, by sorting out the customs arrangements, Britain and the bloc could avoid a \"hard border\" with EU member state Ireland, something that officials fear could reignite tensions between Irish nationalists and unionists in British-ruled Northern Ireland.\n\nIt proposed two different approaches -- a highly streamlined customs arrangement managed by Britain, or a new customs partnership with the EU -- that it said could \"negate the need for a customs border.\"\n\nThe government will set out its proposed solutions for the border between Northern Ireland and Ireland in detail on Wednesday.\n\nThe position papers are intended to flesh out the government's Brexit vision and show a united

The EU said it would \"carefully\" study the proposals, including measures for an interim customs agreement and two suggestions for a new trade partnership, but the terms of divorce needed to be settled first.\n\nBritain's Brexit minister, David Davis, said in a statement: \"The UK is the EU's biggest trading partner so it is in the interest of both sides that we reach an agreement on our future relationship. The UK starts from a strong position and we are confident we can deliver a result that is good for business here in the UK and across the EU.\"\n\nBritain lost a battle earlier this year to discuss the immediate divorce and future ties alongside each other.

It described a \"highly streamlined customs arrangement\" that would borrow from existing systems while expanding the use of technology, or a new customs partnership that could mirror the EU's requirements for imports from the rest of the world.\n\nBritain also wants an interim customs agreement to allow the freest possible trade of goods by removing the threat of costly logjams at borders and to enable businesses to adapt to any future customs arrangement after leaving the bloc in March 2019. Davis said Britain should not have to pay to have a temporary customs union with the EU and that any transitional period would most probably last for two years.\n\nBut May's government, which hopes that the publication of its thinking will paper over the cracks between ministers over Brexit, will also demand that Britain should be able to negotiate deals with other countries during the interim period - a potential sticking point with the EU.\n\nOpposition politicians criticised the government for wanting to have \"their cake and eat it\", while pro-Brexit campaigners said Britain was taking a \"defeatist attitude\" by accepting it could not implement new trade deals during the interim period.

The customs union allows goods to move within the EU without checks, but also imposes tariffs on imports from outside the EU. That would prevent Britain striking new free trade deals while it remains inside the arrangement.\n\nThe British proposal says the U.K. should be free to negotiate new trade relationships during the transition period, something EU officials are likely to find problematic.\n\nEU officials say Britain's stated goal of \"frictionless\" trade is impossible outside the single market and customs union.\n\nThe British government is trying to rebuff claims by EU officials that it is has been underprepared for divorce negotiations before a new round of talks in Brussels at the end of this month.\n\nThe customs proposals are the first in a series of papers covering thorny issues in the negotiations. Another, on the status of the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, is due to be published this week.\n\nThe European Commission said it took note of Britain's suggestions, \"but we will only address them once we have made sufficient progress on the terms of the orderly withdrawal\" from the bloc.\n\nThe EU says negotiations on its future relations with Britain can't start until sufficient progress has been made on three initial issues: how much money the U.K. will have to pay to settle its outstanding commitments to the bloc; whether security checks and customs duties will be instituted on the Irish border; and the status of 3 million EU nationals living in Britain.", "id": "9251734", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-15", "title": "UK says it may seek 'temporary' customs union with EU :: WRAL.com", "image": "https://wwwcache.wral.com/asset/business/2017/08/13/16877229/media_f7fb71ba52d54ecaa9ce0cc2b70dee1c-DMID1-5brpikp4e-540x360.jpg", "extractedDates": [{"textStart": 846, "date": "2019-03-", "amb": false, "textEnd": 856}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-15", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 5, "id": "76", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "Republic of Ireland"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 2, "id": "101", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Ireland", "label": {"eng": "Republic of Ireland"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Northern Ireland"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 2, "id": "85555", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland", "label": {"eng": "Northern Ireland"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 4, "id": "86522", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "Kingdom of Belgium"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Brussels"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 2, "id": "102303", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brussels", "label": {"eng": "Brussels"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "id": "303064", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union"}, {"label": {"eng": "Trade"}, "id": "303410", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade"}, {"label": {"eng": "European Commission"}, "id": "303458", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Commission"}, {"label": {"eng": "Government of the United Kingdom"}, "id": "304310", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_the_United_Kingdom"}, {"label": {"eng": "Philip Hammond"}, "id": "304608", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Hammond"}, {"label": {"eng": "Customs"}, "id": "304875", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customs"}, {"label": {"eng": "Internal market"}, "id": "305938", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_market"}, {"label": {"eng": "Free trade"}, "id": "307357", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_trade"}, {"label": {"eng": "Import"}, "id": "307363", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Import"}, {"label": {"eng": "Tariff"}, "id": "309353", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tariff"}, {"label": {"eng": "Citizenship of the European Union"}, "id": "311961", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizenship_of_the_European_Union"}, {"label": {"eng": "Single market"}, "id": "326525", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_market"}, {"label": {"eng": "Liam Fox"}, "id": "330676", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liam_Fox"}, {"label": {"eng": "Eurasian Customs Union"}, "id": "340949", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurasian_Customs_Union"}, {"label": {"eng": "Customs union"}, "id": "382637", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customs_union"}, {"label": {"eng": "Withdrawal from the European Union"}, "id": "410168", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Withdrawal_from_the_European_Union"}, {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom withdrawal from the European Union"}, "id": "1268836", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_withdrawal_from_the_European_Union"}], "location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "type": "place"}, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 139, "label": "dmoz/Society/Government", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Government"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 140, "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 143, "label": "dmoz/Reference/Education/Colleges and Universities", "uri": "dmoz/Reference/Education/Colleges_and_Universities"}], "time": "10:10:00"}

a potential sticking point with the EU.\n\nOpposition politicians criticised the government for wanting to have \"their cake and eat it\", while pro-Brexit campaigners said Britain was taking a \"defeatist attitude\" by accepting it could not implement new trade deals during the interim period.\n\nEven British businesses, which welcomed the clarity, said they needed more detail, and the car industry urged the government to ensure that the country retained full participation in the EU's single market during a transition.\n\nTURKISH ARRANGEMENT?\n\nCountries that are part of the EU's customs union are not allowed to negotiate bilateral trade deals, and May's government has said Brexit means Britain must leave the customs union.\n\nBut Turkey, while not an EU member, is part of a separate customs union for industrial goods and can still negotiate bilateral trade deals.\n\nBritain said that \"while the government has looked at precedents set by customs agreements between other countries, it is not seeking to replicate another country's model\".\n\nThe government said that, by sorting out the customs arrangements, Britain and the bloc could avoid a \"hard border\" with EU member state Ireland, something that officials fear could reignite tensions between Irish nationalists and unionists in British-ruled Northern Ireland.\n\nThe government will set out its proposed solutions for the border between Northern Ireland and Ireland in detail on Wednesday.\n\n\"Our proposals are ambitious, and rightly so,\" finance minister Philip Hammond said in a statement.\n\n\"They set out arrangements that would allow UK businesses to continue to trade with their European partners in the future, while expanding their markets beyond the EU.\"", "id": "9302633", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-15", "title": "Real thing or just \"fantasy\"?

AP\n\nIn the long term, the department said, a \"customs partnership\" could eliminate the need for a border for goods travelling between Britain and the EU. Alternately, it suggested \"a highly streamlined customs arrangement\" could be set up, using technology to ease border procedures.\n\nThe proposal -- one of a series intended to disprove allegations that Britain is underprepared for Brexit -- drew a cool response from Brussels.\n\n\"To be in and out of the Customs Union and 'invisible borders' is a fantasy,\" tweeted Guy Verhofstadt, the European Parliament's Brexit coordinator.\n\nSome British businesses have accused the government of being vague about whether there will be economic barriers with the EU after Brexit in March 2019. The persistent uncertainty -- 14 months after Britain voted to leave the EU -- is weighing on the economy.\n\nTrade Secretary Liam Fox and Treasury chief Philip Hammond wrote in the Sunday Telegraph that in 2019 Britain will leave both the EU's single market in goods and services and its customs union.\n\nThe single market ensures tariff-less trade in goods and services and is linked closely by the EU with other rights, such as the right of EU citizens to cross borders. The customs union allows goods to move within the EU without checks, but also imposes tariffs on imports from outside the EU. That would prevent Britain striking new free trade deals while it remains inside the arrangement.\n\nThe British proposal says the UK should be free to negotiate new trade relationships during the transition period, something EU officials are likely to find problematic.\n\nScottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, who favours Britain's staying in the single market and customs union, accused the government on Twitter of having a \"daft 'have cake and eat it' approach\".\n\nThe customs proposals are the first in a series of papers covering thorny issues in the negotiations, which are due to resume in Brussels at the end of this month. Another, on the status of the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, is due to be published this week.\n\nPublished Date: Aug 15, 2017 06:33 pm | Updated Date: Aug 15, 2017 06:33

Doing so is our shared duty,\" he said.\n\n\"The united desire to avoid unnecessary disruption or a disorderly exit for the United Kingdom from the European Union is a strong foundation for the negotiations.\"\n\nMinisters have been warned about the strain ports could be put under if they face a big increase in bureaucracy for dealing with goods entering and leaving the country.\n\nThe proposals for new customs arrangements to allow trade with the EU are being outlined in the first of a series of \"future partnership papers\" being released by the Government.\n\nAlthough negotiations on a new system are not scheduled to start for some time, the Government said setting out its aims showed the UK's \"desire to ensure our exit from the EU is smooth, orderly and successful\".\n\nOne option being put forward by Mr Davis for new arrangements would see the UK manage a new customs border with administration streamlined to the \"fullest extent possible\".\n\nThe Brexit Secretary will also float plans for a customs partnership with the EU that would negate the need for a customs border between the UK and the rest of the bloc.\n\nA position paper on the fraught issue of the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic will be published on Wednesday, ahead of the third round of Brexit negotiations in Brussels at the end of the month.\n\nSir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, called the proposals \"incoherent and inadequate\" in response to pleas for certainty from British businesses.\n\n\"Instead, the Cabinet remain split on key issues and cannot decide between two very different but equally unachievable options,\" he said.\n\n\"The first proposal suggests 'a new customs border with the EU' could be introduced without disrupting trade; the second suggests a new borderless customs partnership could somehow be agreed while Britain also signs external trade deals.\n\n\"These fantastical and contradictory proposals provide no guidance for negotiators or certainty for businesses.\n\n\"The proposals also make it less likely that necessary transitional arrangements will be in place by March 2019.\"\n\nIt comes after Chancellor Philip Hammond and International Trade Secretary Liam Fox said the UK would pull out of both the single market and the customs union in 2019.\n\nLabour former shadow chancellor Chris Leslie, a leading supporter of the Open Britain campaign group, said: \"It looks like the new unified position in the Cabinet is to return the Government to the territory of wanting to have their cake and eat it.\n\n\"Ministers claim we can leave the customs union and yet still achieve 'the most frictionless customs agreement anywhere in the world' but with absolutely no detail about how such a miraculous new system will be achieved.\n\n\"It is a fantasy to pretend we can have the freest and most frictionless trade possible with our largest partner when the Government remain intent on pulling Britain out of the customs union.\"\n\nTom Brake, the Liberal Democrats Brexit spokesman, said the Government's \"extreme Brexit will end up leaving Britain poorer\".\n\nHe added: \"Even if they were agreed to by the EU, these proposals will only delay the economic pain caused by leaving the customs union.\n\n\"We still face the prospect of more red tape for businesses, longer queues at our borders and higher prices for consumers once the transition comes to an end.\"", "id": "9285465", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-15", "title": "Latest: British brexit proposals on customs must be close to status

Tuesday that it would not address the issue of Britain's future partnership with the bloc post-Brexit until progress had been made on the terms of withdrawal.\n\nResponding to a new British position paper released Tuesday, a European Commission spokesman noted Britain's proposal for a temporary customs union after leaving the EU.\n\nBut, he added: \"We will only address them once we have made sufficient progress on the terms of the orderly withdrawal.\"\n\nBritain's membership of the EU customs union, which allows for the tariff-free movement of goods, will end along with its membership of the single market when it leaves the bloc in March 2019.\n\nIt wants to negotiate transitional arrangements to soften the effect of Brexit.\n\nOne option its Department for Exiting the EU suggested in a statement Tuesday is \"a temporary customs union between the UK and the EU.\" It will publish a full paper on that proposal later Tuesday.\n\nThe Brexit Ministry said Britain wanted to be able to sign trade agreements with non-EU countries during the transition period, though these would be implemented only at the end of it.\n\nBrexit Minister David Davis told BBC radio on Tuesday that the transition period could last \"something like two years\" and would have to be over by the time of the next general election, which is set for 2022.\n\nBut a Commission spokesman insisted Tuesday that \"an agreement on a future relationship between the EU and the UK can only be finalized once the UK has become a third country.\"\n\n\"As Michel Barnier has said on several occasions, 'frictionless trade' is not possible outside the Single Market and Customs Union,\" the EU spokesman said.\n\nBarnier, the chief negotiator for the EU in the Brexit talks, later posted on Twitter that the EU would not budge on its Brexit stance.\n\n\"The quicker UK & EU27 agree on citizens, settling accounts and Ireland, the quicker we can discuss customs & future relationship,\" Barnier tweeted.\n\nExperts have warned that it will be extremely difficult to negotiate a new EU-UK free trade agreement before Britain leaves the bloc -- particularly as Brussels has so far refused even to start trade talks.\n\nThe EU says there must first be broad agreement on three key issues: Britain's financial settlement, expatriate rights, and the status of the border between British-controlled Northern Ireland and Ireland.\n\nBritain will publish its proposals on the Northern Ireland border issue on Wednesday, before the third round of Brexit negotiations in Brussels at the end of the month.\n\nThe EU itself is currently working on another series of position papers, \"including one on customs issues related to the orderly withdrawal of the UK,\" the EU statement said, without indicating when it would be published.\n\nThe next round of Brexit negotiations between Britain and the EU is scheduled for the week beginning August 28.", "id": "9343260", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-15", "title":

During this interim period, which will be negotiated with Brussels, Britain will look to negotiate bold new trade relationships around the world.\"\n\nBusinesses welcomed the proposals, but the Confederation of British Industry also warned the government that \"the clock is ticking and what matters now is giving companies the confidence to continue investing as quickly as possible\".\n\nThe EU said it would study the proposals carefully but it would only address the proposal for an implementation period once sufficient progress had been made on Britain's withdrawal.\n\nThe EU wants to make progress on several key issues by October, including the financial bill for Britain's exit, but Brexit minister David Davis told the BBC there would not be an agreed figure on the financial settlement by then.\n\n\"We're going to talk it through very, very carefully, so at this stage we're not going to commit,\" he said.\n\nHe later told LBC Radio: \"We're going to have a long haggle ... (EU chief negotiator) Michel (Barnier) is getting quite cross with us. He's saying 'You should make your proposal'.\"\n\nDavis said Britain should not have to pay to have a temporary customs union with the EU. Any transitional period would most likely last for two years, he added, and must be over by the time of the next British national election, due in 2022.\n\nIn an effort to move the talks with the EU on to the issue of Britain's future relationship, Prime Minister Theresa May and her government had promised to publish a series of policy documents this week.\n\nBut after being accused by some EU officials of being ill prepared for the first rounds of negotiations, the government's demand to secure trade deals while participating in a temporary customs union may cause further problems.\n\n\"It looks like the new unified position in the cabinet is to return the government to the territory of wanting to have their cake and eat it\", said Chris Leslie, a pro-EU campaigner and member of Britain's opposition Labour Party.\n\nCountries that are part of the EU's customs union are not allowed to negotiate bilateral trade deals, and May's government has said Brexit means Britain must leave the customs union.\n\nBut Turkey, while not an EU member, is part of a separate customs union for industrial goods and can still negotiate bilateral trade deals. It was not clear whether Britain was pursuing a similar arrangement to Turkey.\n\nThe government said that, by sorting out the customs arrangements, Britain and the bloc could avoid a \"hard border\" with EU member state Ireland, something that officials fear could reignite tensions between Irish nationalists and unionists in British-ruled Northern Ireland.\n\nIt proposed two different approaches -- a highly streamlined customs arrangement managed by Britain, or a new customs partnership with the EU -- that it said could \"negate the need for a customs border\".\n\nThe government will set out its proposed solutions for the border between Northern Ireland and Ireland in detail on Wednesday.\n\nThe position papers are intended to flesh out the government's Brexit vision and show a united stance over the future relationship after rifts emerged among ministers.", "id": "9243189", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-15", "title": "Britain asks for interim customs deal with EU, new trade

But Brussels has insisted that progress must be made on divorce arrangements first.\n\n\"We need to get on with negotiating the bigger issues around our future partnership to ensure we get a deal that delivers a strong UK and EU,\" David Davis, Brexit minister, said in a statement.\n\nBritain's call to move forward with Brexit talks came as Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond and International Trade Secretary Liam Fox presented a united front that there should be a time-limited transition period -- signalling a truce between rival factions in Prime Minister Theresa May's cabinet.\n\nDavis's Brexit department said it was preparing to publish several papers, including plans for a new customs arrangement and a proposal on how to resolve the difficulties of a non-physical border between Ireland and Northern Ireland.\n\n\"We've been crystal clear that issues around our withdrawal and our future partnership are inextricably linked,\" a source in Britain's Brexit department said.\n\n\"These papers show we are ready to broaden out the negotiations.\"\n\nTalks so far have focused on how much Britain should pay to leave the EU, what rights British and EU citizens will have, and how to manage a land border to the bloc in Ireland. The two sides will be looking for a solution to those issues at the next round of talks due at the end of this month.\n\nThe decision to announce the publication of papers on its plans indicates Britain's desire to counter criticism from Brussels about its approach to the talks.\n\nIn July, EU officials said progress was difficult not because Britain had unacceptable demands, but because it had no position at all on many issues. EU negotiators have warned that an already-tight timetable could be delayed ahead of a scheduled March 2019 exit.\n\nIrish Schengen area\n\nA British paper focused on \"issues unique to Northern Ireland and Ireland\" is expected ahead of the talks, but no further details of the proposal were provided on Sunday.\n\nThe Sunday Telegraph reported that Britain was seeking a \"Schengen area\" between Britain and Ireland, which would allow free movement of people and a \"light-touch customs regime\" across the border of the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland. The Brexit department declined to comment on the story.\n\nThe report, which cited an unnamed source in the Brexit department, said that Irish citizens would be able to work freely in the UK, and British citizens would work freely in Ireland. Citizens of other EU countries could access the UK over the Irish border but would not be able to work in Britain without a work permit.\n\nSeparate papers would also address \"Continuity in the availability of goods for the EU and the UK\" and \"Confidentiality and access to official documents,\" the Brexit department said.\n\nEager to push talks past the opening divorce issues and on to the future trading and legal ties to the bloc, Britain also promised a series of \"Future Partnership\" papers in the run-up to October's European Council. The first will be a proposal for new customs arrangements.\n\nThe push to move forward with Brexit comes as Prime Minister May's top ministers moved to strike a more united tone on leaving the EU, after in-fighting in the wake of an electoral failure in June in which May's Conservative party lost its majority in parliament.\n\nSome still dispute her approach, with former foreign minister for the now-opposition Labour party David Miliband and pro-EU Conservative MP Anna Soubry warning in Sunday newspapers of the economic \"self-harm\" of leaving the single market.\n\nHowever, pro-European finance minister Hammond and ardent Brexiteer trade minister Fox set out a joint position in the Sunday Telegraph that a transition period was needed when Britain leaves the EU, but single market membership would still end and the interim period would not be used to stop Brexit.\n\nForeign Secretary Boris Johnson said in a tweet that the article was the \"right way forward\" and would \"create certainty and a great new European relationship.\"", "id": "8965657", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-13", "title": "Britain says Brexit talks should move to next phase", "image":

But Brussels has insisted that progress must be made on divorce arrangements first.\n\nEU 'completely united' ahead of Brexit talks\n\n\"We need to get on with negotiating the bigger issues around our future partnership to ensure we get a deal that delivers a strong UK and EU,\" Brexit minister David Davis said in a statement.\n\nBritain's call to move forward with Brexit talks came as finance minister Philip Hammond and trade minister Liam Fox presented a united front that there should be a time-limited transition period - signalling a truce between rival factions in Prime Minister Theresa May's cabinet.\n\nDavis's Brexit department said it was preparing to publish several papers, including plans for a new customs arrangement and a proposal on how to resolve the difficulties of a non-physical border between Ireland and Northern Ireland.\n\n\"We've been crystal clear that issues around our withdrawal and our future partnership are inextricably linked,\" a source in Britain's Brexit department said.\n\n\"These papers show we are ready to broaden out the negotiations.\"\n\nTalks so far have focused on how much Britain should pay to leave the EU, what rights British and EU citizens will have, and how to manage a land border to the bloc in Ireland. The two sides will be looking for a solution to those issues at the next round of talks due at the end of this month.\n\nThe decision to announce the publication of papers on its plans indicates Britain's desire to counter criticism from Brussels about its approach to the talks.\n\nIn July, EU officials said progress was difficult not because Britain had unacceptable demands, but because it had no position at all on many issues. EU negotiators have warned that an already-tight timetable could be delayed ahead of a scheduled March 2019 exit.\n\nIRISH SCHENGEN AREA?\n\nA British paper focused on \"issues unique to Northern Ireland and Ireland\" is expected ahead of the talks, but no further details of the proposal were provided on Sunday.\n\nThe Sunday Telegraph reported that Britain was seeking a \"Schengen area\" between Britain and Ireland, which would allow free movement of people and a \"light-touch customs regime\" across the border of the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland. The Brexit department declined to comment on the story.\n\nEU citizens face uncertain future in Brexit Britain\n\nThe report, which cited an unnamed source in the Brexit department, said that Irish citizens would be able to work freely in the UK, and British citizens would work freely in Ireland. Citizens of other EU countries could access the UK over the Irish border but would not be able to work in Britain without a work permit.\n\nSeparate papers would also address \"Continuity in the availability of goods for the EU and the UK\" and \"Confidentiality and access to official documents\", the Brexit department said.\n\nEager to push talks past the opening divorce issues and on to the future trading and legal ties to the bloc, Britain also promised a series of \"Future Partnership\" papers in the run-up to October's European Council. The first will be a proposal for new customs arrangements.\n\nThe push to move forward with Brexit comes as Prime Minister May's top ministers moved to strike a more united tone on leaving the European Union, after in-fighting in the wake of an electoral failure in June in which May's Conservative party lost its majority in parliament.\n\nSome still dispute her approach, with former foreign minister for the now-opposition Labour party David Miliband and pro-EU Conservative MP Anna Soubry warning in Sunday newspapers of the economic \"self-harm\" of leaving the single market.\n\nHowever, pro-European finance minister Hammond and ardent Brexiteer trade minister Fox set out a joint position in the Sunday Telegraph that a transition period was needed when Britain leaves the EU, but single market membership would still end and the interim period would not be used to stop Brexit.\n\nForeign Minister Boris Johnson said in a tweet that the article was the \"right way forward\" and would \"create certainty and a great new European relationship\".", "id": "9023993", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-14", "title": "Brexit talks to move to next phase as ministers show unity",

During this interim period, which will be negotiated with Brussels, Britain will look to negotiate bold new trade relationships around the world.\"\n\nBusinesses welcomed the proposals, but the Confederation of British Industry also warned the government that \"the clock is ticking and what matters now is giving companies the confidence to continue investing as quickly as possible\".\n\nEU WANTS PROGRESS ON WITHDRAWAL\n\nThe EU said it would study the proposals carefully but it would only address the proposal for an implementation period once sufficient progress had been made on Britain's withdrawal.\n\nThe EU wants to make progress on several key issues by October, including the financial bill for Britain's exit, but Brexit minister David Davis told the BBC there would not be an agreed figure on the financial settlement by then.\n\n\"We're going to talk it through very, very carefully, so at this stage we're not going to commit,\" he said.\n\nHe later told LBC Radio: \"We're going to have a long haggle ... (EU chief negotiator) Michel (Barnier) is getting quite cross with us. He's saying 'You should make your proposal'.\"\n\nDavis said Britain should not have to pay to have a temporary customs union with the EU. Any transitional period would most likely last for two years, he added, and must be over by the time of the next British national election, due in 2022.\n\nIn an effort to move the talks with the EU on to the issue of Britain's future relationship, Prime Minister Theresa May and her government had promised to publish a series of policy documents this week.\n\nBut after being accused by some EU officials of being ill prepared for the first rounds of negotiations, the government's demand to secure trade deals while participating in a temporary customs union may cause further problems.\n\n\"It looks like the new unified position in the cabinet is to return the government to the territory of wanting to have their cake and eat it\", said Chris Leslie, a pro-EU campaigner and member of Britain's opposition Labour Party.\n\nTURKISH ARRANGEMENT?\n\nCountries that are part of the EU's customs union are not allowed to negotiate bilateral trade deals, and May's government has said Brexit means Britain must leave the customs union.\n\nBut Turkey, while not an EU member, is part of a separate customs union for industrial goods and can still negotiate bilateral trade deals. It was not clear whether Britain was pursuing a similar arrangement to Turkey.\n\nThe government said that, by sorting out the customs arrangements, Britain and the bloc could avoid a \"hard border\" with EU member state Ireland, something that officials fear could reignite tensions between Irish nationalists and unionists in British-ruled Northern Ireland.\n\nIt proposed two different approaches -- a highly streamlined customs arrangement managed by Britain, or a new customs partnership with the EU -- that it said could \"negate the need for a customs border\".\n\nThe government will set out its proposed solutions for the border between Northern Ireland and Ireland in detail on Wednesday.\n\nThe position papers are intended to flesh out the government's Brexit vision and show a united stance over the future relationship after rifts emerged among ministers.\n\n(Additional reporting by Kylie MacLellan;

Germany is also withdrawing forces from Turkey's Incirlik air base after Ankara restricted access to German politicians.\n\nTurkey formally remains a candidate to join the European Union but Merkel said on Wednesday that no new chapters in accession talks were being opened and aid to Turkey had been cut to a minimum. There would be no expansion in the customs union, she said, and \"no kind of deepening at all\" in relations.\n\nTurkey's European Union minister Omer Celik said Merkel's comments were unfortunate and damaging.\n\n\"We should emphasize that no EU member should give orders to EU institutions or EU processes,\" he told a news conference in Ankara. \"These situations are very dangerous, they represent statements that harm the EU's credibility.\"\n\nCelik said both Turkey and the European Union would gain from updating the customs union. \"But they are acting as if doing so is a favour to Turkey. Let me be very clear, we are in no rush,\" he said.\n\nGermany, Europe's leading power, has toughened its stance towards Turkey in recent weeks, urging citizens to exercise caution if travelling there and threatening measures that could hinder German investment.\n\nTurkish President Tayyip Erdogan says the post-coup crackdown, in which 50,000 people have been detained and 150,000 sacked or suspended from the judiciary, journalism, academia and other sectors was needed to address deep-seated security threats.\n\nDomestic and foreign critics accuse him of using a state of emergency as cover to root out opposition and strengthen his grip on power.\n\nEXTRADITION REQUEST\n\nCelik called on Berlin to cooperate with Turkey's request for the extradition of Adil Oksuz, a theology lecturer suspected of playing a major role in the failed coup.\n\nTurkish authorities say Oksuz was detained near an air base hours after the July 15, 2016 coup attempt, only to be released by a judge two days later. He has been on the run since.\n\nTurkish media have reported that he has been seen in Frankfurt and Ulm and given a temporary residence permit by Germany's Baden-Wurttemberg state.\n\n\"No ally of ours can harbour a killer,\" Celik said. \"Even the possibility of someone with a clear tie to the coup attempt being harboured by our ally is saddening.\"\n\nGermany's foreign ministry said on Wednesday that the Turkish request would be examined by a German judge before the German government could make a decision on the request.\n\nCelik repeated Turkey's complaint that it submitted thousands of files to Germany and requested suspects to be handed over without any response from Berlin.\n\n\"The Oksuz issue is very clear.

During this interim period, which will be negotiated with Brussels, Britain will look to negotiate bold new trade relationships around the world.\"\n\nBusinesses welcomed the proposals, but the Confederation of British Industry also warned the government that \"the clock is ticking and what matters now is giving companies the confidence to continue investing as quickly as possible\".\n\nEU WANTS PROGRESS ON WITHDRAWAL\n\nThe EU said it would study the proposals carefully but it would only address the proposal for an implementation period once sufficient progress had been made on Britain's withdrawal.\n\nThe EU wants to make progress on several key issues by October, including the financial bill for Britain's exit, but Brexit minister David Davis told the BBC there would not be an agreed figure on the financial settlement by then.\n\n\"We're going to talk it through very, very carefully, so at this stage we're not going to commit,\" he said.\n\nHe later told LBC Radio: \"We're going to have a long haggle ... (EU chief negotiator) Michel (Barnier) is getting quite cross with us. He's saying 'You should make your proposal'.\"\n\nDavis said Britain should not have to pay to have a temporary customs union with the EU. Any transitional period would most likely last for two years, he added, and must be over by the time of the next British national election, due in 2022.\n\nIn an effort to move the talks with the EU on to the issue of Britain's future relationship, Prime Minister Theresa May and her government had promised to publish a series of policy documents this week.\n\nBut after being accused by some EU officials of being ill prepared for the first rounds of negotiations, the government's demand to secure trade deals while participating in a temporary customs union may cause further problems.\n\n\"It looks like the new unified position in the cabinet is to return the government to the territory of wanting to have their cake and eat it\", said Chris Leslie, a pro-EU campaigner and member of Britain's opposition Labour Party.\n\nTURKISH ARRANGEMENT?\n\nCountries that are part of the EU's customs union are not allowed to negotiate bilateral trade deals, and May's government has said Brexit means Britain must leave the customs union.\n\nBut Turkey, while not an EU member, is part of a separate customs union for industrial goods and can still negotiate bilateral trade deals. It was not clear whether Britain was pursuing a similar arrangement to Turkey.\n\nThe government said that, by sorting out the customs arrangements, Britain and the bloc could avoid a \"hard border\" with EU member state Ireland, something that officials fear could reignite tensions between Irish nationalists and unionists in British-ruled Northern Ireland.\n\nIt proposed two different approaches -- a highly streamlined customs arrangement managed by Britain, or a new customs partnership with the EU -- that it said could \"negate the need for a customs border\".\n\nThe government will set out its proposed solutions for the border between Northern Ireland and Ireland in detail on Wednesday.\n\nThe position papers are intended to flesh out the government's Brexit vision and show a united stance over the future relationship after rifts emerged among ministers.\n\n(Additional reporting by Kylie MacLellan;

someone would bring in cheap goods and then sell them on.\n\n\"But we should be able to have an arrangement by which we can do the negotiation , sign it off, but not enter (it) into effect.\"\n\nMr Davis also refused to rule out paying for the temporary deal, while officials admitted the European Court of Justice's role in enforcing customs union rules during the interim period would be subject to negotiations.\n\nPressed on whether the UK would have to pay, Mr Davis said: \"I am not going to do the negotiation on air.\n\n\"What we are not going to do, let's be clear, we are not going to continue the \u00a310 billion a year net contributions we currently have.\"\n\nThe partnership paper is the first in a series of documents the Government hopes to publish in the coming weeks in order to inform Brexit negotiations.\n\nBut Mr Barnier insisted a new customs relationship cannot be discussed until agreement is reached on phase one of the talks.\n\nHe tweeted: \"The quicker #UK & EU27 agree on citizens, settling accounts and #Ireland, the quicker we can discuss customs & future relationship.\"\n\nA Commission spokesman echoed Mr Barnier's words and drew attention to his previous statement that frictionless trade is not possible outside the single market and customs union.\n\nThe spokesman said Brussels would study the customs paper \"carefully\", adding: \"We take note of the UK's request for an implementing period and its preferences as regards the future relationship, but we will only address them once we have made sufficient progress on the terms of the orderly withdrawal.\n\n\"An agreement on a future relationship between the EU and the UK can only be finalised once the UK has become a third country.\n\n\"As Michel Barnier has said on several occasions, 'frictionless trade' is not possible outside the single market and customs union.\"\n\nThe EU is also working on a position paper on the customs union, following a tranche of documents published before the summer on issues such as citizens' rights and nuclear materials, he said.\n\nFormer Ukip leader and leading Brexit-backer Nigel Farage criticised the plan for temporary arrangements.\n\n\"Under the plan revealed by David Davis today, we would not be able to sign that trade deal until President Trump was nearing the end of his second term,\" he told the BBC.\n\n\"This is not what we voted for - we voted to leave, not for transitional arrangements.\"\n\nThe Government paper also outlined preparations for a \"no deal\" scenario, with a Customs Bill to be brought forward in Autumn.\n\nThe legislation is required in any case to ensure a new customs regime is in place after the expected departure in March 2019 as the UK leaves the jurisdiction of EU law.\n\nBut it will also give Britain the power to operate standalone customs, VAT and excise systems in the event of no deal being agreed, with EU countries being treated the same as those outside the bloc.\n\nThe paper explained: \"Customs duty and import VAT would be due on EU imports. Traders would need to be registered. Traders exporting to the EU would have to submit an export declaration, and certain goods may require an export licence.\n\n\"The EU would also apply the customs rules and VAT to imports from the UK that it applies to non-EU countries.

It wanted to see an deal that created \"frictionless\" trade.\n\nThe customs union allows goods to travel across the EU free of tariffs and checks. The sticking point will be the Britain's insistence that it can strike trade deals with non-EU states.\n\nUnder one option of the plan, Britain would \"continue some existing arrangements we have with the EU, reduce or remove barriers to trade through new arrangements, and adopt technology-based solutions to make it easier for businesses to comply with customs procedures\".\n\nA second option would be a new customs partnership \" by aligning our approach to the customs border in a way that removes the need for a UK-EU customs border. One potential approach would involve the UK mirroring the EU's requirements for imports from the rest of the world where the final destination is the EU\".\n\nThe government admitted there would be \"an increase in administration compared with being inside the EU Customs Union\".\n\n\"While the government has looked at precedents set by customs agreements between other countries, it is not seeking to replicate another country's model and will pursue the approach that works best for the UK,\" it added.\n\nA European Commission spokesman said the interim period request had been noted, but reminded Davis that it progress was still needed on other key issues such as the rights of EU nationals, the border with Ireland and the final \"divorce bill\".\n\n\"An agreement on a future relationship between the EU and the UK can only be finalised once the UK has become a third country,\" the spokesman said\n\n\"As (EU chief negotiator) Michel Barnier has said on several occasions, 'frictionless trade' is not possible outside the single market and customs union.\"\n\nDavis said he could not see a deal on the final financial settlement being reached before November.\n\n\"There won't be a number by October or November,\" he told the BBC.\n\nLabour's shadow Brexit secretary, Sir Keir Starmer, branded the customs proposals \"incoherent and inadequate\" and \"designed to gloss over deep and continuing divisions within the Cabinet\".\n\nBritish Retail Consortium chief executive Helen Dickinson said a proper deal was \"essential to ensuring UK consumers are able to buy the products they want after Brexit\".\n\n\"However, this is a complex issue, including safety checks as well as customs paperwork and we need to develop a system that avoids disruption at our ports,\" she said.\n\n\"We import more food than non-food from the EU and much of that is fresh, so delays would have a significant impact on supply chains.

Government's first \"future partnership paper\", published on Tuesday by the Department for Exiting the European Union (DExEU).\n\nThe outline of post-Brexit customs arrangements is designed to keep all members of the Cabinet onside.\n\nWhile confirming the UK's exit from the EU's customs union after Brexit, the paper proposes a \"temporary customs union between the UK and the EU\" as a \"possible approach\" to getting a \"smooth and orderly\" transfer to a post-Brexit customs regime.\n\nAt the moment, all goods and parts travel across the EU free of both tariffs and checks as part of the bloc's customs union.\n\nFollowing the Brexit vote there has been an ongoing debate within Cabinet about whether to stay in the system.\n\nRemaining in the EU's customs union would restrict Britain's ability to sign independent trade deals with non-EU countries, with a common external tariff applied outside the zone.\n\nTurkey already has its own customs union with the EU for industrialised goods, which enables participation in complex manufacturing supply chains.\n\n:: Brexit: Hammond and Fox pledge fixed transition to avoid 'cliff-edge'\n\nSpeaking to Sky News last month, International Trade Secretary Liam Fox said there was a difference between \"the\" customs union and \"a\" customs union, but cautioned against using Turkey as a model.\n\nDExEU says the interim customs arrangements will be \"time-limited\" to allow for businesses to adapt to a post-Brexit system.\n\nNo actual timeframe has been mentioned, although some Cabinet ministers have suggested it will have to expire before the next scheduled general election in 2022.\n\nThere has been much criticism of the Government's own preparedness to introduce the sorts of customs systems and checks required by its policy to leave the EU's customs union by 2019.\n\nThe National Audit Office was hugely critical of HMRC in a recent report.\n\nThe EU will have to agree to any interim arrangement and especially to the establishment of a temporary customs union.\n\n:: Brexit tension brewing over Irish border plans\n\nLabour's shadow Brexit Secretary Sir Keir Starmer branded the customs proposals \"incoherent and inadequate\" and \"designed to gloss over deep and continuing divisions within the Cabinet\".\n\nHe said: \"Businesses, trade unions and the country need certainty about our future trading and customs arrangements.\n\n\"They also need a pragmatic and considered approach that delivers the best deal for Britain.\n\n\"Instead, the Cabinet remain split on key issues and cannot decide between two very different but equally unachievable options.\n\n\"The first proposal suggests 'a new customs border with the EU' could be introduced without disrupting trade; the second suggests a new borderless customs partnership could somehow be agreed while Britain also signs external trade deals.\n\n\"These fantastical and contradictory proposals provide no guidance for negotiators or certainty for businesses.\n\n\"The proposals also make it less likely that necessary transitional arrangements will be in place by March 2019.\n\n\"Labour is clear that we need to retain the benefits of the customs union and avoid a cliff-edge for the British economy.\n\n\"That means committing now to strong transitional arrangements on the same basic terms we currently enjoy - including the single market and the customs union.\"\n\n:: When PM's holiday's over will things get better?\n\nIt is not clear whether the EU will respond to the paper, having agreed with the UK to first deal with issues of the so-called Brexit bill, Ireland (Other OTC: IRLD - news) and citizens' rights during negotiations before moving on to the future EU-UK relationship.\n\nOutlining a position on customs arrangements does, however, help bring some clarity to the position of the border with Ireland.\n\nA further Government paper on the issue of Ireland's border will be published on

"eng-3358827", "body": "Theresa May is expected to be back in Downing Street this week as ministers prepare to flesh out their negotiating position on Brexit.\n\nThe return of the Prime Minister, who has spent three weeks on holiday in Italy with her husband Philip, coincides with the publication this week of a series of new position papers on Brexit - including one on the fraught issue of the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic.\n\nIt is thought that it will include an offer of continued free movement for Irish nationals in and out of the UK once Britain has left the EU in March 2019.\n\nThere will then be a further series of papers in the run up to the European Council in Brussels in October, setting out the Government's vision of Britain's future relations with the EU, including the crucial issue of the post-Brexit customs arrangements.\n\nThe move comes amid complaints from Brussels about a lack of clarity about the British negotiating position.\n\nEU chief negotiator Michel Barnier is reported to have warned his first two rounds of talks with Brexit Secretary David Davis, covering the opening issues of the Irish border, the rights of EU citizens in the UK, and Britain's \"divorce bill\", had made limited progress.\n\nMinisters hope the release of the position papers will convince the EU side that they will be ready to move on to the next phase of the negotiations, including a new free trade deal with the bloc, in the autumn.\n\nMr Davis said: \"I've launched this process because with time of the essence, we need to get on with negotiating the bigger issues around our future partnership to ensure we get a deal that delivers a strong UK and a strong EU.\n\n\"It's what businesses across Europe have called on both sides to do and will demonstrate that the UK is ready for the job.\"\n\nMeanwhile The Times said the slow progress so far had led to complaints in Whitehall that senior officials were now trying to rush through decisions in an attempt to break the policy logjam.\n\nThere were said to be concerns that Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood and the Permanent Secretary at the Department for Exiting the EU were railroading through issues at a time when many ministers were away, leading to poor decision-making.\n\nAt the end of a difficult summer, marked by speculation over a possible leadership challenge and jostling for position among senior ministers over Brexit, there was some respite for the Prime Minister with an apparent truce between two of the leading protagonists.\n\nChancellor Philip Hammond, who favours a \"soft\", pro-business Brexit, and the Brexiteer International Development Secretary Liam Fox signed up to a joint statement at the weekend agreeing that there would have to be a transition period after Britain has left the EU.\n\nThey agreed that while the measure was necessary to ensure there was no \"cliff-edge\" break for businesses, it would be time-limited and that Britain would leave the EU single market and the customs union when it left the bloc.\n\nThe move was criticised by the Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable, who accused the Chancellor of caving in to the demands of the hardline Brexiteers.\n\nAP", "id": "9010598", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-14", "title": "Theresa May heads back into Brexit battle", "image":

It dates back to 1958 and is what Britain signed up to when we joined the then EEC back in 1973.\n\nIt also differs in that it only covers tariffs, not non-tariff barriers such as standards and regulations, which businesses say are just as important as tariffs in determining where they export to.\n\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8Cancel Play now New trade deals\n\nThe Government also says it hopes to start negotiating new trade deals with non-EU nations while the temporary arrangements are in place. This could cause problems, because under the EU treaty members are not allowed to negotiate trade deals with third parties - only the EU can do that.\n\nBut the Government argues that the prohibition relates to signatories of the EU treaty, and once Britain has left the EU it is no longer bound by its provisions, even if it is still within the customs union for a limited time.\n\nThe Government will argue that it should be able to start talking with other states during the temporary arrangements so long as nothing is signed or implemented until the period is over. In practice the length of time it takes to negotiate trade deals means any new deals are unlikely to be finalised before Britain leaves the customs union.\n\nNew trading arrangements with the EU Read More Brexit\n\nThe purpose behind our temporary membership of the customs union after Brexit would be to allow extra time to negotiate our new trading arrangement with our former EU partners. This means deciding what tariffs if any will apply on goods imported from and exported to the EU, as well as discussing how passing through customs can be made as quick and easy as possible.\n\nThere's also the thorny question of non-tariff barriers - those differences in standards and regulations that the single market is designed to remove. The EU will be concerned at the impact of diverging standards and regulations in Britain and will probably seek to block them at least during the temporary customs union phase, and reduce their impact afterwards.\n\nThe timescale\n\nMany people think it will be impossible to conclude a deal with the EU before the March 2019 deadline for Britain's departure - especially as the EU is insisting that the details of Britain's departure are thrashed out before its future relationship with the union is discussed.\n\nThis is why the Government has raised the idea of temporary membership of the customs union in the two or three years immediately after 2019. In the absence of a new trade deal - which most people agree could take years to negotiate - this would at least avoid the 'cliff edge' that economists and business people fear as British companies suddenly find themselves outside the tariff wall of the Customs Union.\n\nSingle market\n\nThe single market is the cornerstone of what the EU is all about. Under its rules people, goods, capital and services are allowed to move as freely as possible between the 28 member states.\n\nMargaret Thatcher signed Britain up to the single market when she put her name to the Single European Act back in 1986. The idea was to boost economic growth by removing the remaining barriers to trade that still existed within the European Economic Community (EEC) that Britain joined in 1973.\n\nThe single market is Britain's biggest trading partner, accounting for 45% of UK exports and 50% of imports. Membership of the single market allows British companies to trade across the 28 member states without restrictions, and Britons to live and work anywhere in the EU.\n\nRemainers would like the UK to remain part of the single market, but this could only happen if we accepted freedom of movement and the all the regulations that come with membership.\n\nSo soft Brexiteers prefer to talk about access to the single market under a special arrangement such as that enjoyed by Norway or Switzerland Both can trade freely with the EU, without tariffs, but have to accept freedom of movement and make some level of contribution to the EU budget.\n\nFreedom of movement\n\nMost commentators felt that concern over immigration was at the heart of the Leave vote in June 2016 - and Theresa May made regaining control of it the cornerstone of her position on Brexit.\n\nEnding freedom of movement means leaving the single market, and the Conservatives pledged to reduce net migration to tens of thousands per year in their 2017 election manifesto.\n\nDivorce settlement\n\nWhat the EU wants to discuss first is arrangements for its citizens who live in the UK, and settling Britain's outstanding debts, which could amount to tens of billions of pounds.\n\nSome hard Brexiteers say Britain shouldn't pay a penny, but most politicians accept that the UK should honour any financial commitments it has already entered into, even if this means paying a contribution into the EU budget after we have left.\n\nIf Britain continues to stay in the customs union, even if only for a short period, it may also have to pay a contribution to the EU. Brexit Secretary David Davis refused to be drawn on whether Britain would pay, saying it was something that would have to be part of the negotiations.\n\nWhat business says\n\nBusiness groups have welcomed today's announcement. Janet Jones, FSB Wales Policy chair, said: \"Today's commitment from the Government would give small businesses in Wales the time they need to prepare for new customs arrangements, which is very welcome. But it is essential that this interim deal is negotiated as soon as possible with the EU Commission, to give businesses the certainty to keep investing in the UK.\n\n\"We also welcome the aspiration that negotiation on Free Trade Agreements globally will be able to begin once we have left the EU. Whilst 63% of our small businesses across the UK would prioritise an FTA with the EU, 49% would prioritise an FTA with the US and 28% with China.\n\n\"Beyond the interim period it is essential that new customs arrangements achieve the most frictionless trade with small businesses as possible. Our UK-wide research shows that non-tariff barriers are just as important as tariff barriers in determining where small businesses export to.\n\n\"Many Welsh businesses trade within the EU Single Market and so engagement with small businesses is essential to develop a new customs relationship with the EU that enhances trade and successfully capitalises upon the opportunities offered by digital technology.\"\n\nJosh Hardie, CBI deputy director-general, said: \"Companies will welcome the progress Government has made today in publishing these papers. Over the past year, businesses have been providing policymakers with the evidence, ideas and solutions to make a success of Brexit.\n\n\"So it's encouraging to see that these papers propose a time-limited interim period and a customs system that is as barrier-free as possible.\n\n\"We at the CBI have always been clear that new ideas on crucial issues like this should be brought to the table quickly. But the clock is ticking and what matters now is giving companies the confidence to continue investing as quickly as possible.\"\n\n\"Business wants to see as frictionless a customs system as possible, with a strong emphasis on digital systems that make it easier to trade.\n\n\"But to secure frictionless trade, negotiations on regulation, tariff and non-tariff barriers will have to take place. All efforts should be made to deliver a single-step transition, so that businesses don't have to adapt twice.\"", "id": "9476657", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-16", "title": "What is the customs union?

It says there must be broad agreement first on three key issues Britain's financial settlement, the issue of expatriate rights, and the question of the border between British-controlled Northern Ireland and Ireland.\n\nBritain will publish its proposals on the border issue on Wednesday, ahead of the third round of Brexit negotiations in Brussels at the end of the month. Officials in London believe the border is inextricably linked to the customs issue.\n\nAfter Brexit, the Irish border will be Britain's only land border with the EU. There are fears that the reintroduction of physical checkpoints could upset the fragile balance of peace in Northern Ireland.\n\nBritain's membership of the EU customs union precludes it from striking its own trade deals, and the government made clear Tuesday that such freedom was crucial to its post-Brexit plans.\n\n\"During this interim period, which will be negotiated with Brussels, Britain will look to negotiate bold new trade relationships around the world,\" it said.\n\nThe statement added: \"Our goal is to secure as frictionless trade as possible with the EU alongside the ability to forge trade deals around the world.\"However, opposition Labour lawmaker Chris Leslie, from the campaign group Open Britain, said the proposal represented \"wishful thinking of the highest order\".\n\n\"It

It says there must be broad agreement first on three key issues Britain's financial settlement, the issue of expatriate rights, and the question of the border between British-controlled Northern Ireland and Ireland.\n\nBritain will publish its proposals on the border issue on Wednesday, ahead of the third round of Brexit negotiations in Brussels at the end of the month. Officials in London believe the border is inextricably linked to the customs issue.\n\nAfter Brexit, the Irish border will be Britain's only land border with the EU. There are fears that the reintroduction of physical checkpoints could upset the fragile balance of peace in Northern Ireland.\n\nBritain's membership of the EU customs union precludes it from striking its own trade deals, and the government made clear Tuesday that such freedom was crucial to its post-Brexit plans.\n\n\"During this interim period, which will be negotiated with Brussels, Britain will look to negotiate bold new trade relationships around the world,\" it said.\n\nThe statement added: \"Our goal is to secure as frictionless trade as possible with the EU alongside the ability to forge trade deals around the world.\"\n\nHowever, opposition Labour lawmaker Chris Leslie, from the campaign group Open Britain, said the proposal represented \"wishful thinking of the highest order\".\n\n\"It is a fantasy to pretend we can have the freest and most frictionless trade possible with our largest partner when the government remain intent on pulling Britain out of the customs

"eng-3358827", "body": "The Government plans to have a customs union system with the EU in place by the first half of 2019, the Brexit Secretary has said.\n\nDavid Davis said a limited transition period would \"enable business to continue as usual\" while a number of new systems are put in place.\n\nHe told Sky News that negotiations are \"tough\", \"occasionally tense but amicable\".\n\nIt comes as the UK said it wants to create an interim customs union with the EU to avoid a \"cliff-edge\" for manufacturers after Brexit.\n\nThe proposal is contained in the Government's first \"future partnership paper\", published on Tuesday by the Department for Exiting the European Union (DExEU).\n\nThe plan is designed to keep the Cabinet united after disagreements over whether the UK should remain in the customs union.\n\nIt confirms the UK will ultimately leave the system but proposes a \"temporary customs union between the UK and the EU\" as a \"possible approach\" to getting a \"smooth and orderly\" transfer.\n\nThe customs union allows goods to travel across the EU free of tariffs and checks.\n\nRemaining part of this system would restrict Britain's ability to sign independent trade deals with non-EU countries, with a common external tariff applied outside the zone.\n\nTurkey already has its own customs union with the EU for industrialised goods, which enables participation in complex manufacturing supply chains.\n\n:: Brexit: Hammond and Fox pledge fixed transition to avoid 'cliff-edge'\n\nSpeaking to Sky News last month, International Trade Secretary Liam Fox said there was a difference between \"the\" customs union and \"a\" customs union - though he cautioned against using Turkey as a model.\n\nDExEU says the interim customs arrangements would be \"time-limited\" so businesses can adapt to a post-Brexit system.\n\nNo timeframe is mentioned, although some Cabinet ministers have suggested it will have to expire before the next general election in 2022.\n\nThere has been criticism of the Government's preparedness to introduce the sorts of customs systems and checks required after Brexit.\n\nThe National Audit Office was hugely critical of HMRC in a recent report.\n\n:: Brexit tension brewing over Irish border plans\n\nLabour's shadow Brexit secretary, Sir Keir Starmer, branded the customs proposals \"incoherent and inadequate\" and \"designed to gloss over deep and continuing divisions within the Cabinet\".\n\nHe said: \"Businesses, trade unions and the country need certainty about our future trading and customs arrangements.\n\n\"They also need a pragmatic and considered approach that delivers the best deal for Britain.\n\n\"Instead, the Cabinet remain split on key issues and cannot decide between two very different but equally unachievable options.\n\n\"The first proposal suggests 'a new customs border with the EU' could be introduced without disrupting trade; the second suggests a new borderless customs partnership could somehow be agreed while Britain also signs external trade deals.\n\n\"These fantastical and contradictory proposals provide no guidance for negotiators or certainty for businesses.\n\n\"The proposals also make it less likely that necessary transitional arrangements will be in place by March 2019.\n\n\"Labour is clear that we need to retain the benefits of the customs union and avoid a cliff-edge for the British economy.\n\n\"That means committing now to strong transitional arrangements on the same basic terms we currently enjoy - including the single market and the customs union.\"\n\n:: When PM's holiday's over will things get better?\n\nIt is not clear whether the EU will respond to the paper, having agreed with the UK to first deal with issues of the so-called Brexit bill, Ireland (Other OTC: IRLD - news) and citizens' rights during negotiations before moving on to the future EU-UK relationship.\n\nOutlining a position on customs arrangements does, however, help bring some clarity to the position of the border with Ireland.\n\nA further Government paper on the issue of Ireland's border will be published on Wednesday.", "id": "9455161",

During this interim period, which will be negotiated with Brussels, Britain will look to negotiate bold new trade relationships around the world.\"\n\nBusinesses welcomed the proposals, but the Confederation of British Industry also warned the government that \"the clock is ticking and what matters now is giving companies the confidence to continue investing as quickly as possible\".\n\nThe EU said it would study the proposals carefully but it would only address the proposal for an implementation period once sufficient progress had been made on Britain's withdrawal.\n\nThe EU wants to make progress on several key issues by October, including the financial bill for Britain's exit, but Brexit minister David Davis told the BBC there would not be an agreed figure on the financial settlement by then.\n\n\"We're going to talk it through very, very carefully, so at this stage we're not going to commit,\" he said.\n\nHe later told LBC Radio: \"We're going to have a long haggle ... (EU chief negotiator) Michel (Barnier) is getting quite cross with us. He's saying 'You should make your proposal'.\"\n\nDavis said Britain should not have to pay to have a temporary customs union with the EU. Any transitional period would most likely last for two years, he added, and must be over by the time of the next British national election, due in 2022.\n\nIn an effort to move the talks with the EU on to the issue of Britain's future relationship, Prime Minister Theresa May and her government had promised to publish a series of policy documents this week.\n\nBut after being accused by some EU officials of being ill prepared for the first rounds of negotiations, the government's demand to secure trade deals while participating in a temporary customs union may cause further problems.\n\n\"It looks like the new unified position in the cabinet is to return the government to the territory of wanting to have their cake and eat it\", said Chris Leslie, a pro-EU campaigner and member of Britain's opposition Labour Party.\n\nCountries that are part of the EU's customs union are not allowed to negotiate bilateral trade deals, and May's government has said Brexit means Britain must leave the customs union.\n\nBut Turkey, while not an EU member, is part of a separate customs union for industrial goods and can still negotiate bilateral trade deals. It was not clear whether Britain was pursuing a similar arrangement to Turkey.\n\nThe government said that, by sorting out the customs arrangements, Britain and the bloc could avoid a \"hard border\" with EU member state Ireland, something that officials fear could reignite tensions between Irish nationalists and unionists in British-ruled Northern Ireland.\n\nIt proposed two different approaches -- a highly streamlined customs arrangement managed by Britain, or a new customs partnership with the EU -- that it said could \"negate the need for a customs border\".\n\nThe government will set out its proposed solutions for the border between Northern Ireland and Ireland in detail on Wednesday.\n\nThe position papers are intended to flesh out the government's Brexit vision and show a united stance over the future relationship after rifts emerged among ministers.\n\n(Additional reporting by Kylie MacLellan;

This would be because the UK's regime would \"align precisely\" with the EU's, for goods that will be consumed in the EU.\n\nHowever, the UK would continue to operate its own checks on goods coming from outside the EU - and the government said safeguards would be needed to prevent goods entering the EU that had not complied with its rules.\n\nAn alternative scenario the government is proposing would involve the UK extending customs checks to EU arrivals - but under a \"highly streamlined arrangement\" to minimise disruption at ports and airports.\n\nIt said it would seek to make the existing system of customs checks \"even more efficient\", for example using number plate recognition technology at ports, which could be linked to customs declarations for what the vehicles are carrying, meaning the vehicles do not have to be manually stopped and checked.\n\nThe UK would also allow some traders to do self assessment, calculating their own customs duties.\n\nHowever, the government acknowledged this option would still involve \"an increase in administration\" compared with being in the existing customs union.\n\nMinisters said the use of interim arrangements would mean businesses would only have to adjust once to the new arrangements.\n\nAll of this will have to be negotiated with the EU - and the two sides have not yet even started discussing trade matters.\n\nOther obstacles - including the size of the UK's \"divorce bill\" - need to be agreed first.\n\nDavid Davis, Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union, said he envisioned the interim customs system being \"as close as we can to the current arrangements\", but with the UK able to negotiate and sign its own international trade deals.\n\nSpeaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, he did not rule out the UK paying to be part of the arrangement, saying he was not going to conduct negotiations on air.\n\nAnd he said he did not believe the European Court of Justice would be the arbiter of the temporary arrangement, adding that the government would publish proposals on \"international arbitration\" next week.\n\nMr Davis businesses were worried about \"the infamous cliff edge\" - the UK leaving the EU without replacement trade and customs deals.\n\nHe added that the period should be \"something like two years, maybe a bit shorter\" but said the transition period had \"to be done by the election\", which has to take place by 2022 at the latest.\n\nA European Commission spokesman said: \"We will now study the UK position paper on customs carefully in the light of the European Council guidelines and the council's negotiating directives.\n\n\"The next negotiation round will start in the week of 28 August.\n\n\"We take note of the UK's request for an implementing period and its preferences as regards the future relationship, but we will only address them once we have made sufficient progress on the terms of the orderly withdrawal.\n\n\"An agreement on a future relationship between the EU and the UK can only be finalised once the UK has become a third country.\n\n\"As Michel Barnier has said on several occasions, 'frictionless trade' is not possible outside the single market and customs union.\"\n\nThe EU is also working on a position paper on the customs union.\n\nMeanwhile Guy Verhofstadt, the European Parliament's chief Brexit negotiator, has tweeted: \"To be in & out of the Customs Union & \"invisible borders\" is a fantasy.

It will be the clearest insight yet into the details of what Prime Minister Theresa May, Brexit Secretary David Davis, and the rest of the Cabinet hope to achieve in divorce talks with the EU.\n\nThe paper is expected to express the government's desire to leave the customs union but seek to negotiate a totally \"new\" customs relationship which is as \"frictionless\" as possible. The British side hopes the EU will agree to a bespoke, time-limited customs arrangement, which will protect the economy from the effects of a \"cliff-edge\" Brexit and allow businesses to carry on as normal, according to multiple reports.\n\nThis will be viewed as a victory for Chancellor Philip Hammond, who has urged colleagues to embrace a softer Brexit based on transitional arrangements. The plans will likely anger hard Brexiteers, including those on the Tory backbenches, who want to see a clean divorce which isn't delayed by a transitional period. An unnamed Cabinet minister last month accused Hammond and his sympathisers of trying to \"f--- up\" and \"frustrate\" Brexit.\n\nThe government also wants to be able to negotiate trade deals with countries around the world during this proposed transitional period. Full custom union members are prohibited from doing trade deals with countries outside the EU.\n\nThe EU has made it clear on several occasions it will not discuss future trade relations with Britain until significant progress has been made on issues like the rights of citizens and the money the UK must pay in financial obligations, or the divorce bill as it has become known.\n\nHowever, the feeling within government is British negotiators will struggle to make progress when talks resume later this month unless the British side has a clear understanding of what it wants post-Brexit trade relations to look like.\n\nThe Confederation of British Industry (CBI) welcomed the government's plan for a transitional customs union arrangement, describing the position paper as \"encouraging\" in a statement released on Tuesday morning.\n\nCBI Deputy Director General Josh Hardie said: \"Companies will welcome the progress government has made today in publishing these papers. Over the past year, businesses have been providing policymakers with the evidence, ideas and solutions to make a success of Brexit.\n\n\"So it's encouraging to see that these papers propose a time-limited interim period and a customs system that is as barrier-free as possible.\"\n\nThe Labour Party has attacked the proposals as \"incoherent\" and urged the government to retain the \"same basic terms\" of customs union membership.\n\n\"Labour is clear that we need to retain the benefits of the customs union and avoid a cliff-edge for the British economy,\" a spokesperson said. \"That means committing now to strong transitional arrangements on the same basic terms we currently enjoy -- including the single market and customs union.\"\n\nThe Liberal Democrats dismissed the plans as merely delaying the inevitable \"pain\" of an extreme Brexit. The party's Brexit Spokesperson Tom Brake said: \"Even if they were agreed to by the EU, these proposals will only delay the economic pain caused by leaving the customs union.\n\n\"We still face the prospect of more red tape for businesses, longer queues at our borders, and higher prices for consumers once the transition comes to an end.\"\n\nBrake added: \"The only way to ensure 'free and frictionless' trade with the EU is to remain a full member of the Customs Union and Single Market. It doesn't matter how it's dressed up or how long it's postponed, the government's extreme Brexit will end up leaving Britain poorer.\"\n\nJack Taylor / Getty\n\nThe customs union is a central part of the 28-nation bloc's apparatus which means member states trade freely with each other and have all agreed to charge the same tariff on imports from outside of the bloc. This means countries importing goods into the EU pay the same tariff regardless of which member states they are importing to. Members of the customs union are prohibited from negotiating their own trade deals with countries elsewhere in the world.\n\nMay's government has accepted Britain will leave the customs union when the two-year Article 50 period expires in March 2019. Opponents of this plan warn leaving the customs union would unleash economic and political chaos, like heavy tariffs being imposed on goods; long queues at customs; and the return of a hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland. A position paper on the Irish border dilemma is expected to be published this month.\n\nThe Cabinet is keen to avoid chaos and so aims to negotiate a transitional customs arrangement which will allow Britain to continue having close relations with the customs union for an interim period as a non-EU member state.\n\nOnce the transitional period is over, Britain will seek to negotiate a \"highly streamlined\" long-term customs arrangement with the EU or a new \"partnership\" with no customs border at all, the paper is set to add.\n\nThe EU has warned Britain it will not be able to negotiate a \"cherry-picked\" transition deal and will be expected to adhere to EU rules if it wishes to enjoy a privileged relationship with institutions like the customs union.\n\n\"If you want the advantages you of a single market and customs union, you have to take the obligations,\" EU Parliament chief Brexit negotiator Guy Verhofstadt said earlier this year.", "id": "9250869", "details": {}, "date":

"eng-3358827", "body": "Theresa May is expected to be back in Downing Street this week as ministers prepare to flesh out their negotiating position on Brexit.\n\nThe return of the Prime Minister, who has spent three weeks on holiday in Italy with her husband Philip, coincides with the publication this week of a series of new position papers on Brexit - including one on the fraught issue of the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic.\n\nIt is thought that it will include an offer of continued free movement for Irish nationals in and out of the UK once Britain has left the EU in March 2019.\n\nThere will then be a further series of papers in the run up to the European Council in Brussels in October, setting out the Government's vision of Britain's future relations with the EU, including the crucial issue of the post-Brexit customs arrangements.\n\nThe move comes amid complaints from Brussels about a lack of clarity about the British negotiating position.\n\nEU chief negotiator Michel Barnier is reported to have warned his first two rounds of talks with Brexit Secretary David Davis, covering the opening issues of the Irish border, the rights of EU citizens in the UK, and Britain's \"divorce bill\", had made limited progress.\n\nMinisters hope the release of the position papers will convince the EU side that they will be ready to move on to the next phase of the negotiations, including a new free trade deal with the bloc, in the autumn.\n\nMr Davis said: \"I've launched this process because with time of the essence, we need to get on with negotiating the bigger issues around our future partnership to ensure we get a deal that delivers a strong UK and a strong EU.\n\n\"It's what businesses across Europe have called on both sides to do and will demonstrate that the UK is ready for the job.\"\n\nMeanwhile The Times said the slow progress so far had led to complaints in Whitehall that senior officials were now trying to rush through decisions in an attempt to break the policy logjam.\n\nThere were said to be concerns that Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood and the Permanent Secretary at the Department for Exiting the EU were railroading through issues at a time when many ministers were away, leading to poor decision-making.\n\nAt the end of a difficult summer, marked by speculation over a possible leadership challenge and jostling for position among senior ministers over Brexit, there was some respite for the Prime Minister with an apparent truce between two of the leading protagonists.\n\nChancellor Philip Hammond, who favours a \"soft\", pro-business Brexit, and the Brexiteer International Development Secretary Liam Fox signed up to a joint statement at the weekend agreeing that there would have to be a transition period after Britain has left the EU.\n\nThey agreed that while the measure was necessary to ensure there was no \"cliff-edge\" break for businesses, it would be time-limited and that Britain would leave the EU single market and the customs union when it left the bloc.\n\nThe move was criticised by the Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable, who accused the Chancellor of caving in to the demands of the hardline Brexiteers.\n\nCopyright (c) Press Association Ltd. 2017, All Rights Reserved.", "id": "8978840", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-13", "title": "Theresa May heads back into Brexit battle",

someone would bring in cheap goods and then sell them on.\n\n\"But we should be able to have an arrangement by which we can do the negotiation , sign it off, but not enter (it) into effect.\"\n\nMr Davis also refused to rule out paying for the temporary deal, while officials admitted the European Court of Justice's role in enforcing customs union rules during the interim period would be subject to negotiations.\n\nPressed on whether the UK would have to pay, Mr Davis said: \"I am not going to do the negotiation on air.\n\n\"What we are not going to do, let's be clear, we are not going to continue the \u00a310 billion a year net contributions we currently have.\"\n\nThe partnership paper is the first in a series of documents the Government hopes to publish in the coming weeks in order to inform Brexit negotiations.\n\nBut Mr Barnier insisted a new customs relationship cannot be discussed until agreement is reached on phase one of the talks.\n\nHe tweeted: \"The quicker #UK & EU27 agree on citizens, settling accounts and #Ireland, the quicker we can discuss customs & future relationship.\"\n\nA Commission spokesman echoed Mr Barnier's words and drew attention to his previous statement that frictionless trade is not possible outside the single market and customs union.\n\nThe spokesman said Brussels would study the customs paper \"carefully\", adding: \"We take note of the UK's request for an implementing period and its preferences as regards the future relationship, but we will only address them once we have made sufficient progress on the terms of the orderly withdrawal.\n\n\"An agreement on a future relationship between the EU and the UK can only be finalised once the UK has become a third country.\n\n\"As Michel Barnier has said on several occasions, 'frictionless trade' is not possible outside the single market and customs union.\"\n\nThe EU is also working on a position paper on the customs union, following a tranche of documents published before the summer on issues such as citizens' rights and nuclear materials, he said.\n\nFormer Ukip leader and leading Brexit-backer Nigel Farage criticised the plan for temporary arrangements.\n\n\"Under the plan revealed by David Davis today, we would not be able to sign that trade deal until President Trump was nearing the end of his second term,\" he told the BBC.\n\n\"This is not what we voted for - we voted to leave, not for transitional arrangements.\"\n\nThe Government paper also outlined preparations for a \"no deal\" scenario, with a Customs Bill to be brought forward in Autumn.\n\nThe legislation is required in any case to ensure a new customs regime is in place after the expected departure in March 2019 as the UK leaves the jurisdiction of EU law.\n\nBut it will also give Britain the power to operate standalone customs, VAT and excise systems in the event of no deal being agreed, with EU countries being treated the same as those outside the bloc.\n\nThe paper explained: \"Customs duty and import VAT would be due on EU imports. Traders would need to be registered. Traders exporting to the EU would have to submit an export declaration, and certain goods may require an export licence.\n\n\"The EU would also apply the customs rules and VAT to imports from the UK that it applies to non-EU countries. The Government is actively considering ways in which to mitigate the impacts of such a scenario.\"\n\nSign up to our Daily newsletter", "id": "9311452", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-15", "title":

The EU said the two sides must first make progress on the rights of expatriates, Britain's border with EU member Ireland and a financial settlement, the lack of progress on which Davis said had made the EU's chief negotiator \"quite cross\".\n\nMay's government says the divorce settlement will be shaped by the future relationship.\n\nWhile welcoming the proposals, the European Commission, the EU's executive, again said it would not budge from its stance that progress on the divorce needed to be made first. Guy Verhofstadt, the European Parliament's Brexit point-man, underlined the distance between the two sides.\n\n\"To be in and out of the customs union and 'invisible borders' is a fantasy,\" he said on Twitter. \"First need to secure citizens rights and a financial settlement\"\n\nPROPOSALS\n\nIn what it described as the first of a series of \"future partnership papers\", Britain outlined two possible approaches to a new customs relationship with the EU after leaving the bloc and its customs union. It described a \"highly streamlined customs arrangement\" that would borrow from existing systems while expanding the use of technology, or a new customs partnership that could mirror the EU's requirements for imports from the rest of the world.\n\nBritain also wants an interim customs agreement to allow the freest possible trade of goods by removing the threat of costly logjams at borders and to enable businesses to adapt to any future customs arrangement after leaving the bloc in March 2019.\n\nDavis said Britain should not have to pay to have a temporary customs union with the EU. Any transitional period would most likely last for two years and must be over by the time of the next British election, due in 2022, he said.\n\nBut May's government, which hopes that the publication of its thinking will paper over the cracks between ministers on Brexit, will also demand that Britain should be able to negotiate deals with other countries during the interim period - a potential sticking point with the EU.\n\nOpposition politicians criticised the government for wanting to have \"their cake and eat it\".\n\nTURKISH ARRANGEMENT?\n\nCountries that are part of the EU's customs union are not allowed to negotiate bilateral trade deals, and May's government has said Brexit means Britain must leave the customs union. But Turkey, while not an EU member, is part of a separate customs union for industrial goods and can still negotiate bilateral trade deals.\n\nBritain said that \"while the government has looked at precedents set by customs agreements between other countries, it is not seeking to replicate another country's model\". The government said that, by sorting out the customs arrangements, Britain and the bloc could avoid a \"hard border\"with EU member state Ireland, something that officials fear could reignite tensions between Irish nationalists and unionists in British-ruled Northern Ireland.\n\nThe government will set out its proposed solutions for the border between Northern Ireland and Ireland in detail on Wednesday.\n\n\"Our proposals are ambitious, and rightly so,\" finance minister Philip Hammond said in a statement. \"They set out arrangements that would allow UK businesses to continue to trade with their European partners in the future, while expanding their markets beyond the EU.\"", "id": "9278501", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-15", "title": "UK's post-Brexit customs proposals are 'a fantasy': EU's Brexit coordinator, Europe News & Top Stories -

The persistent uncertainty - 14 months after Britain voted to leave the EU - is weighing on the economy.\n\nTrade Secretary Liam Fox and Treasury chief Philip Hammond wrote in the Sunday Telegraph that in 2019 Britain will leave both the EU's single market in goods and services and its customs union.\n\nThe single market ensures tariff-less trade in goods and services and is linked closely by the EU with other rights, such as the right of EU citizens to cross borders. The customs union allows goods to move within the EU without checks, but also imposes tariffs on imports from outside the EU.

someone would bring in cheap goods and then sell them on.\n\n\"But we should be able to have an arrangement by which we can do the negotiation , sign it off, but not enter (it) into effect.\"\n\nMr Davis also refused to rule out paying for the temporary deal, while officials admitted the European Court of Justice's role in enforcing customs union rules during the interim period would be subject to negotiations.\n\nPressed on whether the UK would have to pay, Mr Davis said: \"I am not going to do the negotiation on air.\n\n\"What we are not going to do, let's be clear, we are not going to continue the \u00a310 billion a year net contributions we currently have.\"\n\nThe partnership paper is the first in a series of documents the Government hopes to publish in the coming weeks in order to inform Brexit negotiations.\n\nBut Mr Barnier insisted a new customs relationship cannot be discussed until agreement is reached on phase one of the talks.\n\nHe tweeted: \"The quicker #UK & EU27 agree on citizens, settling accounts and #Ireland, the quicker we can discuss customs & future relationship.\"\n\nA Commission spokesman echoed Mr Barnier's words and drew attention to his previous statement that frictionless trade is not possible outside the single market and customs union.\n\nThe spokesman said Brussels would study the customs paper \"carefully\", adding: \"We take note of the UK's request for an implementing period and its preferences as regards the future relationship, but we will only address them once we have made sufficient progress on the terms of the orderly withdrawal.\n\n\"An agreement on a future relationship between the EU and the UK can only be finalised once the UK has become a third country.\n\n\"As Michel Barnier has said on several occasions, 'frictionless trade' is not possible outside the single market and customs union.\"\n\nThe EU is also working on a position paper on the customs union, following a tranche of documents published before the summer on issues such as citizens' rights and nuclear materials, he said.\n\nFormer Ukip leader and leading Brexit-backer Nigel Farage criticised the plan for temporary arrangements.\n\n\"Under the plan revealed by David Davis today, we would not be able to sign that trade deal until President Trump was nearing the end of his second term,\" he told the BBC.\n\n\"This is not what we voted for - we voted to leave, not for transitional arrangements.\"\n\nThe Government paper also outlined preparations for a \"no deal\" scenario, with a Customs Bill to be brought forward in Autumn.\n\nThe legislation is required in any case to ensure a new customs regime is in place after the expected departure in March 2019 as the UK leaves the jurisdiction of EU law.\n\nBut it will also give Britain the power to operate standalone customs, VAT and excise systems in the event of no deal being agreed, with EU countries being treated the same as those outside the bloc.\n\nThe paper explained: \"Customs duty and import VAT would be due on EU imports. Traders would need to be registered. Traders exporting to the EU would have to submit an export declaration, and certain goods may require an export licence.\n\n\"The EU would also apply the customs rules and VAT to imports from the UK that it applies to non-EU countries.

It dates back to 1958 and is what Britain signed up to when we joined the then EEC back in 1973.\n\nIt also differs in that it only covers tariffs, not non-tariff barriers such as standards and regulations, which businesses say are just as important as tariffs in determining where they export to.\n\nThe Government also says it hopes to start negotiating new trade deals with non-EU nations while the temporary arrangements are in place. This could cause problems, because under the EU treaty members are not allowed to negotiate trade deals with third parties - only the EU can do that.\n\nBut the Government argues that the prohibition relates to signatories of the EU treaty, and once Britain has left the EU it is no longer bound by its provisions, even if it is still within the customs union for a limited time.\n\nThe Government will argue that it should be able to start talking with other states during the temporary arrangements so long as nothing is signed or implemented until the period is over. In practice the length of time it takes to negotiate trade deals means any new deals are unlikely to be finalised before Britain leaves the customs union.\n\nNestl\u00e9 is now selling Walnut Whip - without the nuts - after prices soar\n\nThe purpose behind our temporary membership of the customs union after Brexit would be to allow extra time to negotiate our new trading arrangement with our former EU partners. This means deciding what tariffs if any will apply on goods imported from and exported to the EU, as well as discussing how passing through customs can be made as quick and easy as possible.\n\nThere's also the thorny question of non-tariff barriers - those differences in standards and regulations that the single market is designed to remove. The EU will be concerned at the impact of diverging standards and regulations in Britain and will probably seek to block them at least during the temporary customs union phase, and reduce their impact afterwards.\n\nMany people think it will be impossible to conclude a deal with the EU before the March 2019 deadline for Britain's departure - especially as the EU is insisting that the details of Britain's departure are thrashed out before its future relationship with the union is discussed.\n\nThis is why the Government has raised the idea of temporary membership of the customs union in the two or three years immediately after 2019. In the absence of a new trade deal - which most people agree could take years to negotiate - this would at least avoid the 'cliff edge' that economists and business people fear as British companies suddenly find themselves outside the tariff wall of the Customs Union.\n\nThe single market is the cornerstone of what the EU is all about. Under its rules people, goods, capital and services are allowed to move as freely as possible between the 28 member states.\n\nMargaret Thatcher signed Britain up to the single market when she put her name to the Single European Act back in 1986. The idea was to boost economic growth by removing the remaining barriers to trade that still existed within the European Economic Community (EEC) that Britain joined in 1973.\n\nThe single market is Britain's biggest trading partner, accounting for 45% of UK exports and 50% of imports. Membership of the single market allows British companies to trade across the 28 member states without restrictions, and Britons to live and work anywhere in the EU.\n\nRemainers would like the UK to remain part of the single market, but this could only happen if we accepted freedom of movement and the all the regulations that come with membership.\n\nSo soft Brexiteers prefer to talk about access to the single market under a special arrangement such as that enjoyed by Norway or Switzerland Both can trade freely with the EU, without tariffs, but have to accept freedom of movement and make some level of contribution to the EU budget.\n\nMost commentators felt that concern over immigration was at the heart of the Leave vote in June 2016 - and Theresa May made regaining control of it the cornerstone of her position on Brexit.\n\nEnding freedom of movement means leaving the single market, and the Conservatives pledged to reduce net migration to tens of thousands per year in their 2017 election manifesto.\n\nJane Barlow/PA Wire\n\nWhat the EU wants to discuss first is arrangements for its citizens who live in the UK, and settling Britain's outstanding debts, which could amount to tens of billions of pounds.\n\nSome hard Brexiteers say Britain shouldn't pay a penny, but most politicians accept that the UK should honour any financial commitments it has already entered into, even if this means paying a contribution into the EU budget after we have left.\n\nIf Britain continues to stay in the customs union, even if only for a short period, it may also have to pay a contribution to the EU. Brexit Secretary David Davis refused to be drawn on whether Britain would pay, saying it was something that would have to be part of the negotiations.\n\nDaniel Leal-Olivas/PA Wire\n\nBusiness groups have welcomed today's announcement. Janet Jones, FSB Wales Policy chair, said: \"Today's commitment from the Government would give small businesses in Wales the time they need to prepare for new customs arrangements, which is very welcome. But it is essential that this interim deal is negotiated as soon as possible with the EU Commission, to give businesses the certainty to keep investing in the UK.\n\n\"We also welcome the aspiration that negotiation on Free Trade Agreements globally will be able to begin once we have left the EU. Whilst 63% of our small businesses across the UK would prioritise an FTA with the EU, 49% would prioritise an FTA with the US and 28% with China.\n\n\"Beyond the interim period it is essential that new customs arrangements achieve the most frictionless trade with small businesses as possible. Our UK-wide research shows that non-tariff barriers are just as important as tariff barriers in determining where small businesses export to.\n\n\"Many Welsh businesses trade within the EU Single Market and so engagement with small businesses is essential to develop a new customs relationship with the EU that enhances trade and successfully capitalises upon the opportunities offered by digital technology.\"\n\nJosh Hardie, CBI deputy director-general, said: \"Companies will welcome the progress Government has made today in publishing these papers. Over the past year, businesses have been providing policymakers with the evidence, ideas and solutions to make a success of Brexit.\n\n\"So it's encouraging to see that these papers propose a time-limited interim period and a customs system that is as barrier-free as possible.\n\n\"We at the CBI have always been clear that new ideas on crucial issues like this should be brought to the table quickly. But the clock is ticking and what matters now is giving companies the confidence to continue investing as quickly as possible.\"\n\n\"Business wants to see as frictionless a customs system as possible, with a strong emphasis on digital systems that make it easier to trade.\n\n\"But to secure frictionless trade, negotiations on regulation, tariff and non-tariff barriers will have to take place. All efforts should be made to deliver a single-step transition, so that businesses don't have to adapt twice.\"", "id": "9466046", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-16", "title": "What is the customs union and why does it matter if we stay post-Brexit?

Any transitional period would most likely last for two years and must be over by the time of the next British election, due in 2022.\n\nBut Ms May's government, which hopes that the publication of its thinking will paper over the cracks between ministers on Brexit, will also demand that Britain should be able to negotiate deals with other countries during the interim period - a potential sticking point with the EU.\n\nOpposition politicians criticised the government for wanting to have \"their cake and eat it\", while pro-Brexit campaigners said Britain was taking a \"defeatist attitude\" by accepting it could not implement new trade deals during the interim period.", "id": "9419144", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-16", "title": "Britain proposes  new customs deal", "image": "https://cdn-attachments.timesofmalta.com/default-article-image.png", "extractedDates": [{"textStart": 2482, "date": "2019-03-", "amb": false, "textEnd": 2492}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-16", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 5, "id": "76", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": null, "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 3, "id": "112932", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Twitter"}, "id": "302546", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter"}, {"label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "id": "303064", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union"}, {"label": {"eng": "European Commission"}, "id": "303458", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Commission"}, {"label": {"eng": "Executive (government)"}, "id": "303670", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_(government)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Fantasy"}, "id": "303768", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fantasy"}, {"label": {"eng": "European Parliament"}, "id": "303907", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Parliament"}, {"label": {"eng": "Theresa May"}, "id": "304328", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theresa_May"}, {"label": {"eng": "Customs"}, "id": "304875", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customs"}, {"label": {"eng": "International trade"}, "id": "307061", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_trade"}, {"label": {"eng": "Divorce"}, "id": "309436", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divorce"}, {"label": {"eng": "Customs union"}, "id": "382637", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customs_union"}, {"label": {"eng": "Guy Verhofstadt"}, "id": "388307", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guy_Verhofstadt"}, {"label": {"eng": "Invisibility"}, "id": "414673", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invisibility"}, {"label": {"eng": "European Union Customs Union"}, "id": "470058", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union_Customs_Union"}, {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom withdrawal from the European Union"}, "id": "1268836", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_withdrawal_from_the_European_Union"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 139, "label": "dmoz/Society/Government", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Government"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 140, "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 147, "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Customer Management", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Customer_Management"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 550, "label": "dmoz/Society/Future", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Future"}], "time": "06:56:00"}

Democrats, a minor opposition party that is calling for a second referendum that could allow Britain to stay in the EU, said the proposal for an interim arrangement \"will only delay the economic pain

"storyUri": "eng-3358827", "body": "A government plan to copy European customs controls after Brexit has run into intense scepticism in Brussels and London, with ministers being accused of making unrealistic promises in pursuit of \"frictionless trade\".\n\nThe long-awaited policy paper proposes to keep the UK in a near identical customs union with the EU for an unspecified period after departure while it seeks to negotiate a permanent arrangement that will also \"mirror\" much of the existing system.\n\nThe paper is designed to ease the concerns of those worried about border chaos, although the compromise proposal would prevent early implementation of other international trade deals and was criticised as premature by EU negotiators.\n\n\"We take note of the UK's request for an implementing period and its preferences as regards the future relationship, but we will only address them once we have made sufficient progress on the terms of the orderly withdrawal,\" a European commission spokesman said on Tuesday.\n\nUnderlining the difficulties facing the UK as it negotiates its way outside of Europe, the spokesman added: \"As [the EU's chief negotiatior] Michel Barnier has said on several occasions, 'frictionless trade' is not possible outside the single market and customs union.\"\n\nThe Brexit secretary, David Davis, insisted the plan would avoid a \"cliff-edge for businesses and individuals\" and promised \"the freest and most frictionless system possible\".\n\n\"The way we approach the movement of goods across our border will be a critical building block for our independent trade policy,\" he said. \"An interim period would mean businesses only need to adjust once to the new regime and would allow for a smooth and orderly transition.\"\n\nBusiness leaders responded favourably to the plan, with the CBI welcoming it as a \"critical first step forward\".\n\nWhitehall officials have been forced to walk a tightrope between concerns about the economic impact of leaving the EU customs union and the desire for greater international trade freedom.\n\nYet explanatory briefings by government officials revealed that the intention was for this interim phase to involve a new, temporary customs union with the EU that would be substantially the same as now.\n\nThe government paper said this would be a \"new and time-limited customs union between the UK and EU customs union based on a shared external tariff and without customs processes and duties between the UK and the EU\".\n\nOfficials confirmed that while this would technically involved leaving the existing EU customs union after March 2019, it would be close enough to existing arrangements that Britain would only be able to negotiate, rather than implement, new trade deals with non-EU countries.\n\nThis contradicts confident promises made by the international trade secretary, Liam Fox, and the chancellor, Philip Hammond, in a joint article that was heralded as a victory for the former's ambition to show the benefits of an independent trade policy long before the next election.\n\n\"In March 2019 the United Kingdom ... will leave the customs union and be free to negotiate the best trade deals around the world as an independent, open, trading nation,\" they wrote in the Sunday Telegraph.\n\nThe notion of a long interim period was attacked on Tuesday by both sides of the Brexit debate. \"This is dither and delay,\" said the former Ukip leader Nigel Farage. \"It shows a lack of decisive leadership and it lowers our standing in the world.\"\n\n\"The UK government wants to be out of the customs union but in a customs union,\" said Peter Mandelson, a prominent remain campaigner. \"It is all delusional semantics, trying to square a circle for the Tory party but not a basis for serious negotiation.\"\n\nWhitehall officials refused to say whether new trade deals could be signed during this interim phase, and stressed that implementation was impossible until after the UK moved to its final customs arrangement.\n\nBut even the two scenarios outlined by the government for this end-state position could still involve substantial overlap with EU customs procedures to try to minimise chaos at ports.\n\nThe more ambitious of the two options outlined in Tuesday's paper was called a \"new customs partnership\" and \"would involve the UK mirroring the EU's requirements for imports from the rest of the world where their final destination is the EU\".\n\nOfficials hope this would remove the need for all customs checks with the EU because UK exports would also be exempt from tariffs under the planned free trade agreement - though all such promises are subject to extensive negotiation with other member states.\n\nThe other option envisaged by the government after the interim stage would be a form of the current customs arrangements with countries outside the EU but rely heavily on new technology, such as number plate recognition, to try to avoid physical checks at the border.\n\nOfficials conceded that both options would entail significant new red tape for business as they would involve shifting the reporting burden on to exporters at the point of departure rather than building new lorry parks and border posts.\n\nDespite Britain's 44 years inside the EU, that could prove a tough sell, as some EU member states see the UK as a weak link in the chain on customs enforcement. The British government is fighting a \u20ac2bn (\u00a31.8bn) fine for negligence after EU anti-fraud investigators accused the UK of failing to stop Chinese criminal gangs evading customs duties on clothes and shoes.\n\nFox struck a defiant note in a statement to accompany the strategy paper, insisting \"leaving the customs union will allow us to operate a fully independent trade policy in Britain's national interest\".\n\n\"We will seek a new customs arrangement that ensures that trade between the UK and the EU remains as frictionless as possible and allows us to forge new trade relationships with our partners in Europe and around the world.\"\n\nDavis, the UK's chief Brexit negotiator, also tried to make a virtue of the government's lack of clarity on what it wanted from the negotiations.\n\n\"You will find it difficult sometimes to read what we intend,\" he told BBC's Today programme. \"That's deliberate. I'm afraid in negotiations you do have constructive ambiguity from time to time.\"", "id": "9337681", "details": {"liCnt": 24}, "date": "2017-08-15", "title": "Two-stage Brexit strategy derided by UK

Any transitional period would most likely last for two years and must be over by the time of the next British election, due in 2022, he said.\n\nBut May's government, which hopes that the publication of its thinking will paper over the cracks between ministers on Brexit, will also demand that Britain should be able to negotiate deals with other countries during the interim period - a potential sticking point with the EU.\n\nOpposition politicians criticized the government for wanting to have \"their cake and eat it.\"\n\nTURKISH ARRANGEMENT?\n\nCountries that are part of the EU's customs union are not allowed to negotiate bilateral trade deals, and May's government has said Brexit means Britain must leave the customs union.\n\nBut Turkey, while not an EU member, is part of a separate customs union for industrial goods and can still negotiate bilateral trade deals.\n\nBritain said that \"while the government has looked at precedents set by customs agreements between other countries, it is not seeking to replicate another country's model.\"\n\nThe government said that, by sorting out the customs arrangements, Britain and the bloc could avoid a \"hard border\" with EU member state Ireland, something that officials fear could reignite tensions between Irish nationalists and unionists in British-ruled Northern Ireland.\n\nThe government will set out its proposed solutions for the border between Northern Ireland and Ireland in detail on Wednesday.\n\n\"Our proposals are ambitious, and rightly so,\" finance minister Philip Hammond said in a statement.\n\n\"They set out arrangements that would allow UK businesses to continue to trade with their European partners in the future, while expanding their markets beyond the EU.\"", "id": "9274227", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-15", "title": "Real thing or just \"fantasy\"?

It seems that Germany will use the Customs Union update between the EU and Turkey as a weapon. But the very next day following Merkel's statements, Turkey's European Union Minister \u00d6mer \u00c7elik said, \"It is an unfortunate explanation. It is necessary to underscore that a European country should not give instructions to the EU. It is a statement that will create a weakness for the EU, made by those who want to weaken the union. Turkey may have problems with the EU members. But these problems should not be reduced to the countries themselves. It causes a change in the genetics of the union. The EU commission should not allow the problem between Turkey and Germany to reflect on the European Union. This is contrary to the basic mechanism of the EU. The Customs Union is not something we want unilaterally anyway. This is about increasing free trade. The Customs Union update is treated like a prize and a favor to Turkey. We are willing to continue if this progresses advances within a win-win framework. We will execute the decisions taken by our Cabinet of Ministers concerning this Customs Union issue attended by our Ministry of Economy. We are not in a hurry regarding the Customs Union. This was supposed to accelerate.\"\n\nWhat \u00d6mer \u00c7elik now says is, in all respects, a statement that will put Germany in a difficult situation. Germany cannot make statements on behalf of the EU, disregarding the EU institutions. Germany cannot take its internal affairs to EU platforms. It's only one side of it. The second aspect of this matter, on the other hand, is that the Customs Union is a win-win process for both the EU and Turkey, which has been observed since 1996. Setting aside the Customs Union update, even if Turkey exits from the Customs Union, it will be at the expense of Germany rather than Turkey.\n\nIf Turkey is out of the Customs Union, most of the German firms that invest in Turkey will be harmed. Merkel should look around first before making statements. A country like Germany cannot be ruled out with such ranting. Germany should stop hiding G\u00fclenist Terror Group (FET\u00d6) members and take the U.K. as an example here.\n\nBritain is undergoing the Brexit process and must make several special Customs Union agreements with Turkey. In fact, if Turkey exits from the Customs Union, it will make special Customs Union agreements with many more countries, emerging from this situation with profit. In this sense, Merkel is trying to sink Germany. In this case, German-based global companies must oppose Merkel's irrational policy. They should keep in mind that they are not guests in Turkey, but hosts. And they will be more comfortable here than Germany. For example, a consortium led by a German company won the recent wind power contract. Turkey is, in this regard, a much safer country than Germany.\n\nIn conclusion, we can say that by doing so, Merkel encourages racism, leaves Germany alone and harms German companies and the German people. It is also a noteworthy and very important achievement that Turkey and Britain oppose this racist approach in unison.

If the UK were to leave the customs union without a new arrangement in place it will lead to new costs and bureaucracy for companies selling directly to Britain or exporting through Britain to the EU.\n\nThe British government's first position papers on its approach to Brexit, published on Tuesday, is of vital interest to Ireland. It deals with the issue of the customs union, which sets the rules for trade in goods, and this is central to the future debate on the Border and also vital to companies here who trade with the UK . A separate paper on the Irish border and the North will be published on Wednesday.\n\nWhat is a customs union and why all the fuss?\n\nThe EU customs union allows goods to move freely around the member states. This means that goods made in any one country can circulate freely and be sold in any of the other 26 member states without any border formalities, checks or special taxes. The customs union also allows goods coming in from outside the union to circulate freely, once they have cleared the customs checks and paid any tariffs the first time they enter the EU. It is thus a central and vital part of economic life.\n\nWhat has the British government proposed?\n\nFirstly, it proposes a transition period after the UK leaves the EU to give time for new trading arrangements between the two sides to be negotiated. During this period, Britain's goal would be to keep trade arrangements as similar as possible to how they now operate. The second key part of the plan is a desire by Britain to maintain as free as possible trade with the EU in the long-term, after the transition period ends. This could be achieved, it says, by negotiating a permanent new customs union agreement with the EU, or by establishing customs borders, but having them as seamless as possible.\n\nBut this weekend all the talk was of Britain leaving the EU customs union and the need for a border on the island of Ireland?\n\nYes, and this may still happen. However, today's statement is something of a victory for those in the British cabinet who support a softer Brexit. The document proposes that Britain would leave the EU customs union when it leaves the EU in March 2019, but that Britain sees one options as being a new temporary customs union between it and the EU that would then be put in place for a transition period of up to two years. There is more than a touch of semantics here to cover over the cracks in the British cabinet.\n\nHow would the transition period work?\n\nThe risk is of Britain leaving the EU at the end of March 2019 with no agreement on what happens next. Were this to happen, customs checks would immediately be needed between Britain and the EU - including at the Irish border. There would be a serious risk of disruption to trade as all this was sorted out. This is the so-called \" cliff-edge\" Brexit.\n\nThe idea of a transition period - which London suggests might last around two to three years - is to give time after Britain leaves for the two sides to negotiate new trade arrangements for the long-term.\n\nCould Britain not stay in the existing customs union, at least during the transition?\n\nIt could and it would make things a lot simpler. But for now it says it will not.There are political sensitivities here, particularly because of the \" Brexit means Brexit\" group in the British cabinet. Britain also says that leaving the existing EU customs union would allow it to start negotiating trade deals with other countries - such as the US - during the transition period.\n\nThis is likely to be a delicate point with the EU negotiators. So would be the rules to operate during the transition period and in any permanent customs union. Britain is trying to retain the benefits of customs union membership while also having freedom to negotiate new deals and set its own rules - which the EU will see as looking to have its cake and eat it, too.\n\nAnd then for the long term?\n\nThe British paper suggests that two possible routes could be explored. One would be a permanent new customs union between the UK and the EU. This would not be straightforward to negotiate, as EU producers would be wary in particular of access to their markets for goods coming from outside the union. London proposes special checks on goods coming through Britain which were intended to go on to EU markets, but it is not clear whether this is workable.Such a deal, Britain says, could reduce the need for customs formalities, but whether it could be negotiated is very questionable.\n\nThe second long-term option, the paper suggests, would be to reintroduce a border, but make it as \"seamless and frictionless\" as possible. A range of approaches are set out to try to cut the bureaucracy of customs and excise, though the document concedes that trade with the EU will not be as free as it now is. This would mean some kind of checks on goods crossing the Irish border, though the document says that London is committed to avoiding a \" hard Border\" and to exploring additional measures to allow this.\n\nBritain is expected to propose the continuation of the existing common travel area which would mean free movement of people across the Border would continue. These details are set to be released on Wednesday from London, and will be closely watched.\n\nWhere will Ireland stand?\n\nIdeally, we would want the UK to stay in the existing customs union, removing the need for border checks on the movement of goods, but the document rules this out. Some kind of new customs union would be Ireland's second choice, though whether this could be negotiated, whether it would cover all goods and whether some checks would still be needed are all open questions.\n\nThe worst outcome for Ireland is for the UK to leave the customs union and for no new arrangement to be put in place. This would mean a Border would return on the island and also leading to new costs and bureaucracy for companies selling directly to Britain or exporting through Britain to the EU.\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nThe negotiators have agreed that progress is required on three key issues before talks on a new trade deal. These are \" Irish issues\" - the border, the common travel area and the Good Friday agreement - the mutual rights of citizens, and the British financial exit bill.

detailed proposals on the future partnership.\n\nThe government said it would seek to agree a \"time-limited period of implementation\" after leaving the EU to provide certainty for businesses and allow new customs arrangements to be set up.\n\nThe Department for Exiting the EU said Britain wanted to be able to sign free trade agreements with third countries during this period, although these would only be implemented at the end of it.\n\nThe proposal was welcomed by the Confederation of British Industry, Britain's big business lobby, but opposition parties dismissed it as \"fantasy.\"\n\nBrexit minister David Davis told BBC radio that the transition period could last \"something like two years\" and would have to be over by the time of the next general election, which is set for 2022.\n\nBritain says its membership of the EU customs union, which currently allows for the tariff-free movement of goods, will end along with its membership of the single market when it leaves the bloc in March 2019.\n\nAfter that \"one possible approach would be a temporary customs union between the UK and the EU,\" the Brexit ministry said in a statement, ahead of the publication of the full paper later on Tuesday.\n\nExperts have warned it will be extremely difficult to negotiate a new EU-UK free trade agreement before Britain leaves the bloc -- particularly as Brussels has so far refused even to start trade talks.\n\nIt says there must be broad agreement first on three key issues -- Britain's financial settlement, the issue of expatriate rights, and the question of the border between British-controlled Northern Ireland and Ireland.\n\nAsked about the divorce bill on Tuesday, Davis said that Britain would meet \"any real international obligations\" but added that \"there won't be a number by October or November\".\n\nBritain will publish its proposals on the Northern Ireland border issue on Wednesday, ahead of the third round of Brexit negotiations in Brussels

partnership paper\", published on Tuesday by the Department for Exiting the European Union (DExEU).\n\nThe plan is designed to keep the Cabinet united after disagreements over whether the UK should remain in the customs union.\n\nIt confirms the UK will ultimately leave the system but proposes a \"temporary customs union between the UK and the EU\" as a \"possible approach\" to getting a \"smooth and orderly\" transfer.\n\nThe customs union allows goods to travel across the EU free of tariffs and checks.\n\nRemaining part of this system would restrict Britain's ability to sign independent trade deals with non-EU countries, with a common external tariff applied outside the zone.\n\nTurkey already has its own customs union with the EU for industrialised goods, which enables participation in complex manufacturing supply chains.\n\n:: Brexit: Hammond and Fox pledge fixed transition to avoid 'cliff-edge'\n\nSpeaking to Sky News last month, International Trade Secretary Liam Fox said there was a difference between \"the\" customs union and \"a\" customs union - though he cautioned against using Turkey as a model.\n\nDExEU says the interim customs arrangements would be \"time-limited\" so businesses can adapt to a post-Brexit system.\n\nNo timeframe is mentioned, although some Cabinet ministers have suggested it will have to expire before the next general election in 2022.\n\nThere has been criticism of the Government's preparedness to introduce the sorts of customs systems and checks required after Brexit.\n\nThe National Audit Office was hugely critical of HMRC in a recent report.\n\n:: Brexit tension brewing over Irish border plans\n\nLabour's shadow Brexit secretary, Sir Keir Starmer, branded the customs proposals \"incoherent and inadequate\" and \"designed to gloss over deep and continuing divisions within the Cabinet\".\n\nHe said: \"Businesses, trade unions and the country need certainty about our future trading and customs arrangements.\n\n\"They also need a pragmatic and considered approach that delivers the best deal for Britain.\n\n\"Instead, the Cabinet remain split on key issues and cannot decide between two very different but equally unachievable options.\n\n\"The first proposal suggests 'a new customs border with the EU' could be introduced without disrupting trade; the second suggests a new borderless customs partnership could somehow be agreed while Britain also signs external trade deals.\n\n\"These fantastical and contradictory proposals provide no guidance for negotiators or certainty for businesses.\n\n\"The proposals also make it less likely that necessary transitional arrangements will be in place by March 2019.\n\n\"Labour is clear that we need to retain the benefits of the customs union and avoid a cliff-edge for the British economy.\n\n\"That means committing now to strong transitional arrangements on the same basic terms we currently enjoy - including the single market and the customs union.\"\n\n:: When PM's holiday's over will things get better?\n\nIt is not clear whether the EU will respond to the paper, having agreed with the UK to first deal with issues of the so-called Brexit bill, Ireland (Other OTC: IRLD - news) and citizens' rights during negotiations before moving on to the future EU-UK relationship.\n\nOutlining a position on customs arrangements does, however, help bring some clarity to the position of the border with Ireland.\n\nA further Government paper on the issue of Ireland's border will be published on Wednesday.", "id": "9424787",

That means businesses need to have confidence that there will not be a cliff-edge when we leave the EU in just over 20 months' time,\" they wrote.\n\n\"That is why we believe a time-limited interim period will be important to further our national interest and give business greater certainty - but it cannot be indefinite; it cannot be a back door to staying in the EU.\n\n\"We are both clear that during this period the UK will be outside the customs union and will be a 'third country', not a party to EU treaties.\"\n\nPrime Minister Theresa May will hope the intervention of the two Ministers will cool temperatures in the Tory ranks amid divisions over Brexit and speculation of a possible leadership challenge when MPs return to Westminster in September. From this week, the Government is to start\n\npublishing a new series of detailed papers setting out its negotiating position on a range of key issues, amid criticism from Brussels of a lack of clarity about what it wants from the talks.\n\nThey will start with one covering the thorny issues of the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic to be followed in the autumn by a second series looking at the future relationship with the EU, including post-Brexit customs arrangements.\n\nMinisters hope it will be enough to persuade the EU's chief negotiator Michel Barnier that sufficient progress has been made on the opening issues of the Irish border, the rights of EU citizens in the UK and Britain's \"divorce bill\" to move on to the second phase of talks including a new trade deal.\n\nMeanwhile the leading Conservative Remainer Anna Soubry warned the Prime Minister that she needed to face down the \"hard Brexiteers\" in the Conservative ranks if she wanted to hold on to her position in No 10.\n\nThe former Business Minister indicated she could be prepared to join with politicians from other parties to stop the country \"staggering recklessly\" towards a hard break with Brussels.\n\n\"Could I ever see myself joining with like-minded people who want to save our country from such an appalling fate?

Any transitional period would most likely last for two years and must be over by the time of the next British election, due in 2022, he said.\n\nBut May's government, which hopes that the publication of its thinking will paper over the cracks between ministers on Brexit, will also demand that Britain should be able to negotiate deals with other countries during the interim period - a potential sticking point with the EU.\n\nOpposition politicians criticised the government for wanting to have \"their cake and eat it\".\n\nTURKISH ARRANGEMENT?\n\nCountries that are part of the EU's customs union are not allowed to negotiate bilateral trade deals, and May's government has said Brexit means Britain must leave the customs union.\n\nBut Turkey, while not an EU member, is part of a separate customs union for industrial goods and can still negotiate bilateral trade deals.\n\nBritain said that \"while the government has looked at precedents set by customs agreements between other countries, it is not seeking to replicate another country's model\".\n\nThe government said that, by sorting out the customs arrangements, Britain and the bloc could avoid a \"hard border\" with EU member state Ireland, something that officials fear could reignite tensions between Irish nationalists and unionists in British-ruled Northern Ireland.\n\nThe government will set out its proposed solutions for the border between Northern Ireland and Ireland in detail on Wednesday.\n\n\"Our proposals are ambitious, and rightly so,\" finance minister Philip Hammond said in a statement.\n\n\"They set out arrangements that would allow UK businesses to continue to trade with their European partners in the future, while expanding their markets beyond the EU.\"\n\n(Additional reporting by Kylie MacLellan;

While Britain would \"simplify\" processes, negotiate waivers and increase automation to prevent disruption at ports, \"there will remain an increase in administration compared with being inside the customs union,\" the department said.\n\nThe second proposal, called a \"new customs partnership with the EU,\" imagines no need for an EU-U.K. customs border, because the U.K, would mirror EU requirements for imports where the final destination of those goods is the EU.\n\nThat would require a \"robust enforcement mechanism\" to ensure goods that don't comply with EU trade policy stay in the U.K. The government put forward two mechanisms: a tracking process to track all goods and components, and a repayment mechanism -- whereby importers pay whichever is higher of the EU or U.K. tariffs and claim a refund should the end destination be the one with the lower tariffs.\n\n\"This is an innovative and untested approach that would take time to develop and implement,\" the Brexit Department said, adding that it wants to \"explore\" the approach with businesses to understand the complexities involved.\n\nRegardless of the EU talks, the U.K. will need to legislate for a new customs regime to be in place before March 2019, and make changes to sales tax and excise regimes. That's because current rules governing customs are mainly in EU law, and current U.K. customs law is \"insufficient,\" the department said.\n\nThe government intends to put a customs bill through Parliament before Brexit that will also include provisions for standalone customs arrangements in case it fails to reach a deal with the EU. \"It is only prudent that the government prepares for every eventuality,\" it said. \"This is not the government's preferred outcome.\"\n\nIndustry lobby groups have repeatedly warned against the potential for a \"cliff edge\" of duties, border controls and regulatory uncertainty on commerce with the U.K.'s biggest market the day after Brexit. They expressed relief before the full proposals were unveiled on Tuesday.\n\n\"Business wants to see as frictionless a customs system as possible,\" Confederation of British Industry Deputy Director-General Josh Hardie said in a statement. \"All efforts should be made to deliver a single-step transition, so that businesses don't have to adapt twice.\"\n\nThe road map, though, will be likely to run into opposition from the EU, given the U.K.'s suggestion it be allowed to line up trade accords with other countries during the interim period, something remaining fully inside the customs union would prevent.\n\nA European Commission spokesman said the bloc welcomes the U.K.'s detailing of its position as a \"positive step\" and predicted it would allow the talks to progress. But he added that the EU would only turn to future relations once \"we have made sufficient progress on the terms of the orderly withdrawal\" and that any agreement \"can only be finalized once the U.K. has become a third country.\"\n\nKeir Starmer, the opposition Labour Party's Brexit spokesman, called the proposals \"fantastical and contradictory.\"\n\nFailure to maintain something akin to the status quo could prove costly for the British. The current arrangement saves U.K. exporters from paying tariffs on goods sold to the EU. Countries outside the region and lacking a free-trade accord with it pay about 10 percent on shipments of cars alone.\n\nA customs union-like relationship would help clear up the matter of how to police the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said earlier this month that a new customs union should be designed to avoid the need for controls on the 310-mile (500-kilometer) frontier which forms the EU's only land link with the U.K.\n\nThe Irish issue will be detailed more fully by the British on Wednesday when they publish another paper that will express a commitment to keeping a \"seamless and frictionless\" border on the island.", "id": "9270607", "details": {"liCnt": 8}, "date": "2017-08-15", "title": "U.K. Business Faces More Red Tape Under Brexit Customs Plans", "image":

from Brussels.\n\nThe government said it would seek to agree a \"time-limited period of implementation\" after leaving the EU to provide certainty for businesses and allow new customs arrangements to be set up.\n\nThe Department for Exiting the EU said Britain wanted to be able to sign free trade agreements with third countries during this period, although these would only be implemented at the end of it.\n\nBrexit minister David Davis told BBC radio that the transition period could last \"something like two years\" and would have to be over by the time of the next general election, which is set for 2022.\n\nThe proposal was welcomed by the Confederation of British Industry, Britain's big business lobby, but opposition parties dismissed it as \"fantasy.\"\n\nThe European Commission, the EU's executive arm, said it would \"take note\" of the proposals but would not negotiate on the future relationship with Britain before other issues are resolved.\n\n\"'Frictionless trade' is not possible outside the single market and customs union,\" it said in a statement.\n\nBritain says its membership of the EU customs union, which currently allows for the tariff-free movement of goods, will end along with its membership of the single market when it leaves the bloc in March 2019.\n\nAfter that \"one possible approach would be a temporary customs union between the UK and the EU,\" the Brexit ministry said in a statement, ahead of the publication of the full paper later on Tuesday.\n\nExperts have warned it will be extremely difficult to negotiate a new EU-UK free trade agreement before Britain leaves the bloc -- particularly as Brussels has so far refused even to start trade talks.\n\nIt says there must be broad agreement first on three key issues -- Britain's financial settlement, the issue of expatriate rights, and the question of the border between British-controlled Northern Ireland and Ireland.\n\nAsked about the divorce bill on Tuesday, Davis said that Britain would meet \"any real international obligations\" but added that \"there won't be a number by October or November.\"\n\nBritain will publish its proposals on the Northern Ireland border issue on Wednesday, ahead of the third round of Brexit negotiations in Brussels at the end of the month.\n\nThe CBI's deputy director Josh Hardie said the government's proposal of a customs transition period was \"encouraging.\"\n\n\"The clock is ticking and what matters now is giving companies the confidence to continue investing as quickly as possible,\" he said.\n\nBut opposition Labour lawmaker Chris Leslie, from the campaign group Open Britain, said the proposal represented \"wishful thinking of the highest order.\"\n\n\"It is a fantasy to pretend we can have the freest and most frictionless trade possible with our largest partner when the government remain intent on pulling Britain out of the customs union,\" he said. -- AFP", "id": "9383888", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-15",

Ministers said the plans would mean the \"freest and most frictionless possible trade\" with the rest of Europe and could include a \"temporary customs union\" after Brexit to prevent border problems as the UK leaves the EU.\n\nBusinesses have called for clarity since the UK said it was leaving the customs union - the EU's tariff-free trading area - as part of Brexit. The customs union document is the first of a series of papers to be published by the UK government on key negotiation issues.\n\nOn Wednesday it is expected to set out proposals for the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.\n\nCountries in the customs union don't impose tariffs - taxes on imports - on each other's goods. Every country inside the union levies the same tariffs on imports from abroad.\n\nThe UK's departure from the EU's customs union was confirmed at the weekend in a joint article by Chancellor Philip Hammond and Trade Secretary Liam Fox.\n\nAccording to the newly-published government paper, the UK could ask Brussels to establish a \"temporary customs union\" after it leaves the EU in March 2019. But during this period, it would also expect to be able to negotiate its own international trade deals, something it cannot do as an EU customs union member.\n\nOnce this period expires, the UK will look to agree either a \"highly streamlined\" border with the EU, or a new \"partnership\" with no customs border at all. The government said the interim arrangements would mean businesses would only have to adjust once to the new arrangements.\n\nAll of this will have to be negotiated with the EU - and the two sides have not yet even started discussing trade matters. Other obstacles - including the size of the UK's \"divorce bill\" - need to be agreed first.\n\nKeir Starmer, Labour's shadow Brexit secretary, said the proposals were \"incoherent and inadequate\" and were designed to \"gloss over deep and continuing divisions within the cabinet\". He added \"These fantastical and contradictory proposals provide no guidance for negotiators or certainty for businesses\".\n\nLiberal Democrat Brexit spokesman Tom Brake said the plan would \"only delay the economic pain caused by leaving the customs union. We still face the prospect of more red tape for businesses, longer queues at our borders and higher prices for consumers once the transition comes to an end.\"\n\nHowever, the CBI, which represents British businesses, said the proposal was \"encouraging\". Its deputy director general, Josh Hardie, added: \"The clock is ticking and what matters now is giving companies the confidence to continue investing as quickly as possible.\"", "id": "9311480",

"body": "Britain will seek a \"temporary customs union\" with the European Union after Brexit, the government said on Tuesday (Aug 15) as it prepared to publish its first detailed proposals on the future partnership.\n\nThe government said it would seek to agree a \"time-limited period of implementation\" after leaving the EU to provide certainty for businesses and allow new customs arrangements to be set up.\n\nThe Department for Exiting the EU said Britain wanted to be able to sign free trade agreements with third countries during this period, although these would only be implemented at the end of it.\n\nThe proposal was welcomed by the Confederation of British Industry, Britain's big business lobby, but opposition parties dismissed it as \"fantasy\".\n\nBrexit minister David Davis told BBC radio that the transition period could last \"something like two years\" and would have to be over by the time of the next general election, which is set for 2022.\n\nBritain says its membership of the EU customs union, which currently allows for the tariff-free movement of goods, will end along with its membership of the single market when it leaves the bloc in March 2019.\n\nAfter that \"one possible approach would be a temporary customs union between the UK and the EU,\" the Brexit ministry said in a statement, ahead of the publication of the full paper later on Tuesday.\n\nExperts have warned it will be extremely difficult to negotiate a new EU-UK free trade agreement before Britain leaves the bloc - particularly as Brussels has so far refused even to start trade talks.\n\nIt says there must be broad agreement first on three key issues - Britain's financial settlement, the issue of expatriate rights, and the question of the border between British-controlled Northern Ireland and Ireland.\n\nAsked about the divorce bill on Tuesday, Davis said that Britain would meet \"any real international obligations\" but added that \"there won't be a number by October or November\".\n\nBritain will publish its proposals on the Northern Ireland border issue on Wednesday, ahead of the third round of Brexit negotiations in Brussels at the end of the month.\n\nThe CBI's deputy director Josh Hardie said the government's proposal of a customs transition period was \"encouraging\".\n\n\"The clock is ticking and what matters now is giving companies the confidence to continue investing as quickly as possible,\" he said.\n\nBut opposition Labour lawmaker Chris Leslie, from the campaign group Open Britain, said the proposal represented \"wishful thinking of the highest order\".\n\n\"It is a fantasy to pretend we can have the freest and most frictionless trade possible with our largest partner when the government remain intent on pulling Britain out of the customs union,\" he said.", "id": "9250332", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-15", "title": "UK to seek 'temporary customs union' after Brexit", "image": null, "extractedDates":

Doing so is our shared duty,\" Davis said.\n\n\"The united desire to avoid unnecessary disruption or a disorderly exit for the United Kingdom from the European Union is a strong foundation for the negotiations.\"\n\nThe paper, and in particular the interim proposal, has been welcomed by business groups.\n\nAllie Renison, head of EU and trade policy at the Institute of Directors, said: \"There will be a great sigh of relief amongst businesses in the UK to see the government taking a pragmatic approach to transition as we look at how best to Brexit.\n\n\"Replicating as far as possible our current customs arrangements with the EU for this interim period is crucial to allow necessary time to develop long term solutions - particularly for the Irish border.\n\n\"We look forward to finally engaging on the detail of both short- and long-term negotiating options with our own Government and crucially, the EU.\"\n\nMiles Celic, chief executive of TheCityUK, said: \"An interim customs period with the EU to allow businesses the time to adjust once a new customs relationship is agreed is vital to ensuring a smooth and orderly Brexit. This is a key concern for the customers and clients our industry serves.\"\n\nDavis also said that he wants a customs agreement that will create a \"stronger, fairer and more prosperous UK\" and ensure that there is no return to Ireland-Northern Ireland borders. To achieve this, he is willing to take two approaches: creating a \"highly streamlined customs arrangement\", reducing and removing barriers to trade; or launching a \"new customs partnership with the EU, based on aligning our customs approaches\".\n\nHenry Newman, director of Open Europe, told City A.M. that the positioning of the UK, in this paper and others to be published, was \"long overdue\". He said that it could give the UK a boost in negotiations, adding: \"The person who gets the first draft in is always at an advantage.\"\n\nJosh Hardie, the CBI's deputy director general, said: \"Companies will welcome the progress government has made today in publishing these papers. Over the past year, businesses have been providing policymakers with the evidence, ideas and solutions to make a success of Brexit.\n\n\"So it's encouraging to see that these papers propose a time-limited interim period and a customs system that is as barrier-free as possible.\"\n\nRead more: Trade the Customs Union for deals that benefit the developing world", "id": "9250870", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-14", "title": "Davis lays cards on the table: Brexit secretary sets out customs vision", "image": "http://www.cityam.com/assets/uploads/main-image/full_width_article_body_image/belgium-britain-eu-brexit-815879342-5992184c1781a.jpg", "extractedDates": [{"imp": true, "textStart": 54, "date": "2017-08-28", "amb": false, "textEnd": 63}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-15", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 5, "id": "76", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Northern Ireland"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 2, "id": "85555", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland", "label": {"eng": "Northern Ireland"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "Kingdom of Belgium"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Brussels"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 3, "id": "102303", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brussels", "label": {"eng": "Brussels"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": null, "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 2, "id": "112932", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}, "id": "302718", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer"}, {"label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "id": "303064", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union"}, {"label": {"eng": "Trade"}, "id": "303410", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade"}, {"label": {"eng": "Customs"}, "id": "304875", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customs"}, {"label": {"eng": "Institute of Directors"}, "id": "365841", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institute_of_Directors"}, {"label": {"eng": "Customs union"}, "id": "382637", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customs_union"}, {"label": {"eng": "Trade barrier"}, "id": "399704", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_barrier"}, {"label": {"eng": "City A.M."}, "id": "400124", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_A.M."}, {"label": {"eng": "Open Europe"}, "id": "429226", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Europe"}, {"label": {"eng": "TheCityUK"}, "id": "485429", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TheCityUK"}, {"label": {"eng": "Republic of Ireland\u2013United Kingdom border"}, "id": "536741", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Ireland\u2013United_Kingdom_border"}, {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom withdrawal from the European Union"}, "id": "1268836", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_withdrawal_from_the_European_Union"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 108, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 140, "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 147, "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Customer Management", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Customer_Management"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 259, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Marketing", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Marketing"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 270, "label": "dmoz/Business/International Business and Trade/Services", "uri": "dmoz/Business/International_Business_and_Trade/Services"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 585, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Home and Garden/Furniture", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Home_and_Garden/Furniture"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 682, "label": "dmoz/Business/Customer Service", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Customer_Service"}], "time": "19:41:00"}

Industry lobby groups welcomed the suggestion, having fretted about a \"cliff edge\" which would see crippling duties and bureaucracy come into force the day after Brexit.\n\nPotentially pushing its luck, Brexit Secretary David Davis's department also said it wants to be allowed to spend the transition lining up trade deals with other countries. Full participation in the customs union prevents that, and EU officials have warned Britain against trying to cherry-pick the best bits of EU membership, as well as saying that \"frictionless\" trade is not possible once outside the bloc.\n\nThe EU signaled on Tuesday that the U.K. will need to be patient. Chief negotiator Michel Barnier said on Twitter that the sides first need to agree on citizens' rights, a financial settlement and Ireland's border. That's unlikely to happen before October at the earliest.\n\nGuy Verhofstadt, the European Parliament's point person, was less diplomatic. \"To be in & out of the Customs Union & 'invisible borders' is a fantasy,\" he tweeted.\n\nAs well as suggesting a short-term fix, Britain detailed two proposals for how a border with the EU may be managed in the long run, arguing both sides have an interest in avoiding paperwork and traffic gridlock. Yet it admitted that exporters and importers are likely to face new requirements -- a change of tone from those who campaigned to leave the EU because of the red tape it imposed. Economics consultancy Oxera estimated the proposed customs checks could end up costing 1 billion pounds a year.\n\nUnder the first suggestion, dubbed \"a highly streamlined customs arrangement,\" Britain would extend customs declaration requirements currently in place for other nations to EU trade. While it would seek to \"simplify\" processes, negotiate waivers and increase the use of technology to prevent disruption at ports, \"there will remain an increase in administration compared with being inside the customs union,\" the Brexit department said.\n\nAnother problem is that such a \"virtual border\" could take years to build. The U.K.'s public-spending watchdog said in July there is no guarantee the government's new customs system will be operational by March 2019.\n\nUnder the second proposal, called a \"new customs partnership with the EU,\" there would be no need for an EU-U.K. customs border because each side would enforce the other's customs rules, negating the need for a frontier.\n\nSuch an arrangement would be unique in the world, but would still require a \"robust enforcement mechanism\" to ensure goods that don't comply with EU trade policy stay in the U.K.\n\n\"It's a positive that the government is now trying to get on the front foot, particularly on avoiding disruption to businesses,\" said Mats Persson, a former government adviser now head of international trade at consultancy EY. \"The big asks -- the ability to negotiate new free-trade agreements during the transition and a virtual EU-U.K. border in future -- will be a formidable task to negotiate, but it's not impossible.\"\n\nMujtaba Rahman, an analyst at Eurasia Group, said much will depend on how much May is willing to pay to leave the bloc. \"A lot still hinges on money,\" he said. \"This will determine whether the U.K. can unlock discussions on the future -- and these options -- in October,\" when EU leaders next meet.\n\nThe government intends to put a bill through Parliament that will include provisions for imposing taxes on EU goods in case a deal can't be made. \"It is only prudent that the government prepares for every eventuality,\" it said. \"This is not the government's preferred outcome.\"\n\nTuesday's blueprint for customs was hailed as a victory for Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond, who spent the summer building a consensus among ministers for a smooth Brexit via a transitional period. It may also go some way to soothing concerns within the EU that the first two rounds of talks have made little headway and that the U.K. was ill-prepared.\n\nLobby groups welcomed the proposals too, although they urged the government to go further to safeguard trade beyond Brexit.\n\n\"The commitment from government to explore a customs union for the interim period is a critical first step forward,\" Confederation of British Industry Deputy Director-General Josh Hardie said in a statement. \"This clarity is vital for businesses making long-term investment decisions today.\"\n\nTheCityUK, which represents the finance sector, said the government must conduct \"urgent\" talks to support services, which make up a larger share of the U.K. economy.\n\nOpen Britain, a group that lobbies for close ties with the EU, accused May's government of \"having our cake and eating it,\" while the opposition Labour Party's former business spokesman Chuka Umunna said ministers are \"offering a red-tape bombshell for British business.\"", "id": "9311438", "details": {"liCnt": 4}, "date": "2017-08-15", "title": "Britain Details Vision for Post-Brexit Customs Deal With EU",

If the UK were to leave the customs union without a new arrangement in place it will lead to new costs and bureaucracy for companies selling directly to Britain or exporting through Britain to the EU.\n\nThe British government's first position papers on its approach to Brexit, published on Tuesday, is of vital interest to Ireland. It deals with the issue of the customs union, which sets the rules for trade in goods, and this is central to the future debate on the Border and also vital to companies here who trade with the UK . A separate paper on the Irish border issue will be published on Wednesday.\n\nWhat is a customs union and why all the fuss?\n\nThe EU customs union allows goods to move freely around the member states. This means that goods made in any one country can circulate freely and be sold in any of the other 26 member states without any border formalities, checks or special taxes. The customs union also allows goods coming in from outside the union to circulate freely, once they have cleared the customs checks and paid any tariffs the first time they enter the EU. It is thus a central and vital part of economic life.\n\nWhat has the British government proposed?\n\nFirstly, it proposes a transition period after the UK leaves the EU to give time for new trading arrangements between the two sides to be negotiated. During this period, Britain's goal would be to keep trade arrangements as similar as possible to how they now operate. The second key part of the plan is a desire by Britain to maintain as free as possible trade with the EU in the long-term, after the transition period ends. This could be achieved, it says, by negotiating a permanent new customs union with the EU, or by establishing customs borders, but having them as seamless as possible.\n\nBut this weekend all the talk was of Britain leaving the EU customs union and the need for a border on the island of Ireland?\n\nYes, and this may still happen. However, today's statement is something of a victory for those in the British cabinet who support a softer Brexit. The document proposes that Britain would leave the EU customs union when it leaves the EU in March 2019, but that Britain sees one options as being a new temporary customs union between it and the EU that would then be put in place for a transition period of up to two years. There is more than a touch of semantics here to cover over the cracks in the British cabinet.\n\nHow would the transition period work?\n\nThe risk is of Britain leaving the EU at the end of March 2019 with no agreement on what happens next. Were this to happen, customs checks would immediately be needed between Britain and the EU - including at the Irish border. There would be a serious risk of disruption to trade as all this was sorted out.\n\nThe idea of a transition period - which London suggests might last around two years - is to give time after Britain leaves for the two sides to negotiate new trade arrangements for the long-term.\n\nCould Britain not stay in the existing customs union, at least during the transition?\n\nIt could and it would make things a lot simpler. But there are political sensitivities here, particularly because of the \" Brexit means Brexit\" group in the British cabinet. Britain also says that leaving the existing EU customs union would allow it to start negotiating trade deals with other countries - such as the US - during the transition period.\n\nThis is likely to be a delicate point with the EU negotiators. So would be the rules to operate during the transition period and in any permanent customs union. Britain is trying to retain the benefits of customs union membership while also having freedom to negotiate new deals and set its own rules - which the EU will see as looking to have its cake and eat it, too.\n\nAnd then for the long term?\n\nThe British paper suggests that two possible routes could be explored. One would be a permanent new customs union between the UK and the EU. This would not be straightforward to negotiate, as EU producers would be wary in particular of access to their markets for goods coming from outside the union. But it could reduce the need for customs formalities. The second long-term option, the paper suggests, would be to reintroduce a border, but make it as \"seamless and frictionless\" as possible. This would mean some kind of checks on goods crossing the Irish border.\n\nBritain is expected to propose the continuation of the existing common travel area which would mean free movement of people across the Border would continue. These details are set to be released on Wednesday from London, and will be closely watched.\n\nWhere will Ireland stand?\n\nIdeally, we would want the UK to stay in the existing customs union, removing the need for border checks on the movement of goods. Some kind of new customs union would be Ireland's second choice, though whether this would cover all goods and whether some checks would still be needed would be open to question.\n\nThe worst outcome for Ireland is for the UK to leave the customs union and for no new arrangement to be put in place.

"eng-3358827", "body": "Britain will not be able to enact post-Brexit free trade deals with countries like the United States until proposed temporary customs arrangements with the European Union end, David Davis has admitted.\n\nThe Brexit Secretary published plans for a time-limited transition period to ensure businesses on both sides of the Channel only have to adapt once to rule changes on the import and export of goods.\n\nThe \"future partnership paper\" also contained two potential options for a long-term deal once the interim period expires.\n\nThe more ambitious option, described as \"innovative and unprecedented\", would see Britain \"mirroring\" Brussels tariffs for goods that will eventually enter the EU to avoid the need for a UK-EU customs border.\n\nAlternatively, a \"streamlined\" approach would see the UK negotiate agreements with the EU to reduce trade barriers and harness technology to avoid long queues at ports.\n\nBut European Parliament Brexit coordinator Guy Verhofstadt said \"invisible borders\" are a \"fantasy\", while European Commission chief negotiator Michel Barnier said talks on customs could not begin until there was agreement on the so-called \"divorce bill\", citizens rights and the Irish border.\n\nBefore any new customs deal is negotiated and implemented, Britain will seek to avoid a \"cliff-edge\" for businesses by putting in place temporary arrangements that are broadly similar to the EU's customs union.\n\nThe adoption of this approach is likely to be seen as a victory for Chancellor Philip Hammond, who favours a \"softer\" pro-business Brexit.\n\nMr Davis admitted that during this period, which he said would last \"something like two years\", the UK will not be able to do business under new free trade agreements with countries like the US or Australia.\n\nAsked whether the UK could enact new free trade deals during the temporary period, Mr Davis told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"No, negotiate and sign.\n\n\"You couldn't have an arrangement whereby we have unfettered access to the European market but also the right to bring in raw materials from outside.\n\n\"Because you'd have what they call arbitrage - someone would bring in cheap goods and then sell them on.\n\n\"But we should be able to have an arrangement by which we can do the negotiation, sign it off, but not enter (it) into effect.\"\n\nMr Davis also refused to rule out paying for the temporary deal, while officials admitted the European Court of Justice's role in enforcing customs union rules during the interim period would be subject to negotiations.\n\nPressed on whether the UK would have to pay, Mr Davis said: \"I am not going to do the negotiation on air.\n\n\"What we are not going to do, let's be clear, we are not going to continue the \u00a310 billion a year net contributions we currently have.\"\n\nThe partnership paper is the first in a series of documents the Government hopes to publish in the coming weeks in order to inform Brexit negotiations.\n\nBut Mr Barnier insisted a new customs relationship cannot be discussed until agreement is reached on phase one of the talks.\n\nHe tweeted: \"The quicker \u00a3UK & EU27 agree on citizens, settling accounts and \u00a3Ireland, the quicker we can discuss customs & future relationship.\"\n\nA Commission spokesman echoed Mr Barnier's words and drew attention to his previous statement that frictionless trade is not possible outside the single market and customs union.\n\nThe spokesman said Brussels would study the customs paper \"carefully\", adding: \"We take note of the UK's request for an implementing period and its preferences as regards the future relationship, but we will only address them once we have made sufficient progress on the terms of the orderly withdrawal.\n\n\"An agreement on a future relationship between the EU and the UK can only be finalised once the UK has become a third country.\n\n\"As Michel Barnier has said on several occasions, 'frictionless trade' is not possible outside the single market and customs union.\"\n\nThe EU is also working on a position paper on the customs union, following a tranche of documents published before the summer on issues such as citizens' rights and nuclear materials, he said.\n\nFormer Ukip leader and leading Brexit-backer Nigel Farage criticised the plan for temporary arrangements.\n\n\"Under the plan revealed by David Davis today, we would not be able to sign that trade deal until President Trump was nearing the end of his second term,\" he told the BBC.\n\n\"This is not what we voted for - we voted to leave, not for transitional arrangements.\"", "id": "9343269", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-15", "title": "Post-Brexit free trad deals on hold, admits Davis -

It does not say which the government prefers, calling them \"two broad approaches the UK could adopt\" depending on negotiations with the EU.\n\nUnder one, a \"highly streamlined customs arrangement\", the UK and EU would use \"technology-based solutions\" to make it easier for businesses to satisfy new requirements and procedures when moving goods across the border.\n\nUnder the other, the UK would sign a \"new customs partnership\" with the EU that would eliminate the need for a border - for example mirroring EU requirements for imports from the rest of the world where the final destination is the EU.\n\nInternational Trade Secretary Dr Liam Fox said leaving the customs union would allow Britain to generate \"fully independent trade policy\".\n\n\"We will seek a new customs arrangement that ensures that trade between the UK and the EU remains as frictionless as possible and allows us to forge new trade relationships with our partners in Europe and around the world,\" he said.\n\nA European Commission spokesman they would study the UK position paper ahead of the next round of negotiations at the end of August.\n\nHowever they do not want to start talking about customs plans until they have made more progress on talks over the \"divorce bill\" - an agreement on the Brexit financial settlement as well as issues including the rights of EU citizens in the UK.\n\n\"We take note of the UK's request for an implementing period and its preferences as regards the future relationship, but we will only address them once we have made sufficient progress on the terms of the orderly withdrawal,\" the spokesman said.\n\n\"An agreement on a future relationship between the EU and the UK can only be finalised once the UK has become a third country...

It will be the clearest insight yet into the details of what Prime Minister Theresa May, Brexit Secretary David Davis, and the rest of the Cabinet hope to achieve in divorce talks with the EU.\n\nThe paper is expected to express the government's desire to leave the customs union but seek to negotiate a totally \"new\" customs relationship which is as \"frictionless\" as possible. The British side hopes the EU will agree to a bespoke, time-limited customs arrangement, which will protect British business from the effects of a \"cliff-edge\" Brexit, according to multiple reports.\n\nThis will be viewed as a victory for Chancellor Philip Hammond, who has urged colleagues to embrace a softer Brexit based on transitional arrangements. The plans will likely anger hard Brexiteers, including those on the Tory backbenchers, who want to see a clean divorce which isn't delayed by a transitional period. An unnamed Cabinet minister last month accused Hammond and his sympathisers of trying to \"f--- up\" and \"frustrate\" Brexit.\n\nThe government also wants to be able to negotiate trade deals with countries around the world during this proposed transitional period. Full custom union members are prohibited from doing trade deals with countries outside the EU.\n\nThe EU has made it clear on several occasions it will not discuss future trade relations with Britain until significant progress has been made on issues like the rights of citizens and the money the UK must pay in financial obligations, or the divorce bill as it has become known.\n\nHowever, the feeling within government is British negotiators will struggle to make progress when talks resume later this month unless the British side has a clear understanding of what it wants post-Brexit trade relations to look like.\n\nThe Confederation of British Industry (CBI) welcomed the government's plan for a transitional customs union arrangement, describing the position paper as \"encouraging\" in a statement released on Tuesday morning.\n\nCBI Deputy Director General Josh Hardie said: \"Companies will welcome the progress government has made today in publishing these papers. Over the past year, businesses have been providing policymakers with the evidence, ideas and solutions to make a success of Brexit.\n\n\"So it's encouraging to see that these papers propose a time-limited interim period and a customs system that is as barrier-free as possible.\"\n\nThe Labour Party has attacked the proposals as \"incoherent\" and urged the government to retain the \"same basic terms\" of customs union membership.\n\n\"Labour is clear that we need to retain the benefits of the customs union and avoid a cliff-edge for the British economy,\" a spokesperson said. \"That means committing now to strong transitional arrangements on the same basic terms we currently enjoy -- including the single market and customs union.\"\n\nThe Liberal Democrats dismissed the plans as merely delaying the inevitable \"pain\" of an extreme Brexit. The party's Brexit Spokesperson Tom Brake said: \"Even if they were agreed to by the EU, these proposals will only delay the economic pain caused by leaving the customs union.\n\n\"We still face the prospect of more red tape for businesses, longer queues at our borders, and higher prices for consumers once the transition comes to an end.\"\n\nBrake added: \"The only way to ensure 'free and frictionless' trade with the EU is to remain a full member of the Customs Union and Single Market. It doesn't matter how it's dressed up or how long it's postponed, the government's extreme Brexit will end up leaving Britain poorer.\"\n\nJack Taylor / Getty\n\nThe customs union is a central part of the 28-nation bloc's apparatus which means member states trade freely with each other and have all agreed to charge the same tariff on imports from outside of the bloc. This means countries importing goods into the EU pay the same tariff regardless of which member states they are importing to. Members of the customs union are prohibited from negotiating their own trade deals with countries elsewhere in the world.\n\nMay's government has accepted Britain will leave the customs union when the two-year Article 50 period expires in March 2019. Opponents of this plan warn leaving the customs union would unleash economic and political chaos, like heavy tariffs being imposed on goods; long queues at customs; and the return of a hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland. A position paper on the Irish border dilemma is expected to be published this month.\n\nThe Cabinet is keen to avoid chaos and so aims to negotiate a transitional customs arrangement which will allow Britain to continue having close relations with the customs union for an interim period as a non-EU member state.\n\nOnce the transitional period is over, Britain will seek to negotiate a \"highly streamlined\" long-term customs arrangement with the EU or a new \"partnership\" with no customs border at all, the paper is set to add.\n\nThe EU has warned Britain it will not be able to negotiate a \"cherry-picked\" transition deal and will be expected to adhere to EU rules if it wishes to enjoy a privileged relationship with institutions like the customs union.\n\n\"If you want the advantages you of a single market and customs union, you have to take the obligations,\" EU Parliament chief Brexit negotiator Guy Verhofstadt said earlier this year.", "id": "9218291", "details": {"liCnt": 5},

The government said it would seek to agree a \"time-limited period of implementation\" after leaving the EU to provide certainty for businesses and allow new customs arrangements to be set up.\n\nThe Department for Exiting the EU said Britain wanted to be able to sign free trade agreements with third countries during this period, although these would only be implemented at the end of it. Brexit minister David Davis told BBC radio that the transition period could last \"something like two years\" and would have to be over by the time of the next general election, which is set for 2022. The proposal was welcomed by the Confederation of British Industry, Britain's big business lobby, but opposition parties dismissed it as \"fantasy\".\n\nThe European Commission, the EU's executive arm, said it would \"take note\" of the proposals but would not negotiate on the future relationship with Britain before other issues are resolved.\n\n\"'Frictionless trade' is not possible outside the single market and customs union,\" it said in a statement. Britain says its membership of the EU customs union, which currently allows for the tariff-free movement of goods, will end along with its membership of the single market when it leaves the bloc in March 2019. After that \"one possible approach would be a temporary customs union between the UK and the EU,\" the Brexit ministry said in a statement, ahead of the publication of the full paper later yesterday. Experts have warned it will be extremely difficult to negotiate a new EU-UK free trade agreement before Britain leaves the bloc - particularly as Brussels has so far refused even to start trade talks. It says there must be broad agreement first on three key issues - Britain's financial settlement, the issue of expatriate rights, and the question of the border between British-controlled Northern Ireland and Ireland. Asked about the divorce bill yesterday, Davis said that Britain would meet \"any real international obligations\" but added that \"there won't be a number by October or November\". Britain will publish its proposals on the Northern Ireland border issue today, ahead of the third round of Brexit negotiations in Brussels at the end of the month.\n\nThe CBI's deputy director Josh Hardie said the government's proposal of a customs transition period was \"encouraging\".\n\n\"The clock is ticking and what matters now is giving companies the confidence to continue investing as quickly as possible,\" he said. But opposition Labour lawmaker Chris Leslie, from the campaign group Open Britain, said the proposal represented \"wishful thinking of the highest order\".\n\n\"It is a fantasy to pretend we can have the freest and most frictionless trade possible with our largest partner when the government remain intent on pulling Britain out of the customs union,\" he said.\n\nThe Liberal Democrats, a minor opposition party that wants a second referendum that could allow Britain to stay in the EU, said the proposal for an interim arrangement \"will only delay the economic pain caused by leaving the customs union\".", "id": "9359591", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-15", "title": "UK to seek 'temporary customs union' after Brexit", "image":

It would in effect give negotiators breathing space to figure out a new system that under which Britain trades with its European neighbours.\n\nBut what is the customs union and why is it so important? Our colleagues at Wales Online took a look\n\nThe customs union is the arrangement under which goods can be traded within the EU without tariffs, while goods imported from outside the EU face tariff barriers that are common to all member states.\n\nIt's different to the single market in that only covers trade in goods, not movement of people, capital or services. It dates back to 1958 and is what Britain signed up to when we joined the then EEC back in 1973.\n\nIt also differs in that it only covers tariffs, not non-tariff barriers such as standards and regulations, which businesses say are just as important as tariffs in determining where they export to.\n\nThe Government also says it hopes to start negotiating new trade deals with non-EU nations while the temporary arrangements are in place. This could cause problems, because under the EU treaty members are not allowed to negotiate trade deals with third parties - only the EU can do that.\n\nBut the Government argues that the prohibition relates to signatories of the EU treaty, and once Britain has left the EU it is no longer bound by its provisions, even if it is still within the customs union for a limited time.\n\nThe Government will argue that it should be able to start talking with other states during the temporary arrangements so long as nothing is signed or implemented until the period is over. In practice the length of time it takes to negotiate trade deals means any new deals are unlikely to be finalised before Britain leaves the customs union.\n\nTheresa May urged to cancel Donald Trump's state visit after Charlottesville response\n\nThe purpose behind our temporary membership of the customs union after Brexit would be to allow extra time to negotiate our new trading arrangement with our former EU partners. This means deciding what tariffs if any will apply on goods imported from and exported to the EU, as well as discussing how passing through customs can be made as quick and easy as possible.\n\nThere's also the thorny question of non-tariff barriers - those differences in standards and regulations that the single market is designed to remove. The EU will be concerned at the impact of diverging standards and regulations in Britain and will probably seek to block them at least during the temporary customs union phase, and reduce their impact afterwards.\n\nMany people think it will be impossible to conclude a deal with the EU before the March 2019 deadline for Britain's departure - especially as the EU is insisting that the details of Britain's departure are thrashed out before its future relationship with the union is discussed.\n\nThis is why the Government has raised the idea of temporary membership of the customs union in the two or three years immediately after 2019. In the absence of a new trade deal - which most people agree could take years to negotiate - this would at least avoid the 'cliff edge' that economists and business people fear as British companies suddenly find themselves outside the tariff wall of the Customs Union.\n\nThe single market is the cornerstone of what the EU is all about. Under its rules people, goods, capital and services are allowed to move as freely as possible between the 28 member states.\n\nMargaret Thatcher signed Britain up to the single market when she put her name to the Single European Act back in 1986. The idea was to boost economic growth by removing the remaining barriers to trade that still existed within the European Economic Community (EEC) that Britain joined in 1973.\n\nThe single market is Britain's biggest trading partner, accounting for 45% of UK exports and 50% of imports. Membership of the single market allows British companies to trade across the 28 member states without restrictions, and Britons to live and work anywhere in the EU.\n\nRemainers would like the UK to remain part of the single market, but this could only happen if we accepted freedom of movement and the all the regulations that come with membership.\n\nSo soft Brexiteers prefer to talk about access to the single market under a special arrangement such as that enjoyed by Norway or Switzerland Both can trade freely with the EU, without tariffs, but have to accept freedom of movement and make some level of contribution to the EU budget.\n\nAristocrat jailed for offering money on Facebook for someone to kill Brexit campaigner Gina Miller\n\nMost commentators felt that concern over immigration was at the heart of the Leave vote in June 2016 - and Theresa May made regaining control of it the cornerstone of her position on Brexit.\n\nEnding freedom of movement means leaving the single market, and the Conservatives pledged to reduce net migration to tens of thousands per year in their 2017 election manifesto.\n\nWhat the EU wants to discuss first is arrangements for its citizens who live in the UK, and settling Britain's outstanding debts, which could amount to tens of billions of pounds.\n\nSome hard Brexiteers say Britain shouldn't pay a penny, but most politicians accept that the UK should honour any financial commitments it has already entered into, even if this means paying a contribution into the EU budget after we have left.\n\nIf Britain continues to stay in the customs union, even if only for a short period, it may also have to pay a contribution to the EU. Brexit Secretary David Davis refused to be drawn on whether Britain would pay, saying it was something that would have to be part of the negotiations.\n\nBusiness groups have welcomed today's announcement. Janet Jones, FSB Wales Policy chair, said: \"Today's commitment from the Government would give small businesses in Wales the time they need to prepare for new customs arrangements, which is very welcome. But it is essential that this interim deal is negotiated as soon as possible with the EU Commission, to give businesses the certainty to keep investing in the UK.\n\n\"We also welcome the aspiration that negotiation on Free Trade Agreements globally will be able to begin once we have left the EU. Whilst 63% of our small businesses across the UK would prioritise an FTA with the EU, 49% would prioritise an FTA with the US and 28% with China.\n\n\"Beyond the interim period it is essential that new customs arrangements achieve the most frictionless trade with small businesses as possible. Our UK-wide research shows that non-tariff barriers are just as important as tariff barriers in determining where small businesses export to.\n\n\"Many Welsh businesses trade within the EU Single Market and so engagement with small businesses is essential to develop a new customs relationship with the EU that enhances trade and successfully capitalises upon the opportunities offered by digital technology.\"\n\nHow you can keep hold of your EU citizenship rights after Brexit\n\nJosh Hardie, CBI deputy director-general, said: \"Companies will welcome the progress Government has made today in publishing these papers. Over the past year, businesses have been providing policymakers with the evidence, ideas and solutions to make a success of Brexit.\n\n\"So it's encouraging to see that these papers propose a time-limited interim period and a customs system that is as barrier-free as possible.\n\n\"We at the CBI have always been clear that new ideas on crucial issues like this should be brought to the table quickly. But the clock is ticking and what matters now is giving companies the confidence to continue investing as quickly as possible.\"\n\n\"Business wants to see as frictionless a customs system as possible, with a strong emphasis on digital systems that make it easier to trade.\n\n\"But to secure frictionless trade, negotiations on regulation, tariff and non-tariff barriers will have to take place. All efforts should be made to deliver a single-step transition, so that businesses don't have to adapt twice.\"", "id": "9495073", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-16", "title": "What is the customs

It also makes clear Britain intends to forge ahead with trade talks with other countries, but acknowledges that any new arrangements would have to respect the EU's transition terms.\n\nThe Czech secretary of state for EU affairs, Ale\u0161 Chmela\u0159, suggested his government would not tolerate the UK being able to make trade deals during a transition period.\n\n\"I do believe it is not possible to have the same advantages and less obligations in general,\" he told the Guardian. \"This is a very clear thing, And it applies also with the custom union and any other deal that is somehow bound with it. So with any step in terms of market integration, market access, there is a set of obligations. This is very clear.\"\n\nMichel Barnier, the EU's chief negotiator, used the publication of the UK customs paper to increase the pressure on London to settle Brexit divorce issues.\n\n\"The quicker #UK & EU27 agree on citizens, settling accounts and #Ireland, the quicker we can discuss customs & future relationship,\" he tweeted.\n\nThe EU has insisted that the UK must make \"sufficient progress\" on these three issues before it will open talks on trade and the future relationship - a timetable the UK's Brexit minister, David Davis, accepted at the start of Brexit negotiations in June.\n\nBarnier will report to EU leaders in October on whether the UK has made \"sufficient progress\" to allow opening trade talks.\n\nThe policy paper reveals the UK government is looking at two models on customs, both of which replicate the status quo to a significant extent. The first is described as \"a highly streamlined customs arrangement\" , which would require technology to ease the flow of goods over borders and securing a waiver on key paperwork. The second is described as \"a new customs partnership with the EU\", where the UK would adopt EU rules on imports heading to the bloc.\n\nGuy Verhofstadt, the European parliament's lead co-ordinator on Brexit, gave the proposals a cool response. \"To be in & out of the customs union & 'invisible borders' is a fantasy,\" he tweeted. He also echoed Barnier's line that the UK needed to secure a deal on citizens rights' and the financial settlement, before embarking on trade talks.\n\nA European commission spokesman added that the EU was working on its own paper on \"customs issues\" ahead of the next round of Brexit talks at the end of August.\n\n\"We see the UK's publication of a series of position papers as a positive step towards now really starting phase one of the negotiations. The clock is ticking and this will allow us to make progress,\" he said.\n\n\"We will now study the UK position paper on customs carefully in the light of the European council guidelines and the council's negotiating directives,\" he added, referring to the negotiating red lines drawn up by EU leaders that was turned into a technical document by senior officials and ministers.\n\n\"We take note of the UK's request for an implementing period and its preferences as regards the future relationship, but we will only address them once we have made sufficient progress on the terms of the orderly withdrawal,\" the spokesman said.\n\n\"An agreement on a future relationship between the EU and the UK can only be finalised once the UK has become a third country.\"\n\nHe added: \"As Michel Barnier has said on several occasions, 'frictionless trade' is not possible outside the single market and customs union.\"", "id": "9288032", "details": {"liCnt": 50}, "date": "2017-08-15", "title": "European minister pours cold water on UK interim trade hopes", "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/723e041e1dee42266dc137d0c134e9506fbd7485/0_128_2839_1704/master/2839.jpg?w=1200&h=630&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=crop&crop=faces%2Centropy&bm=normal&ba=bottom%2Cleft&blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly91cGxvYWRzLmd1aW0uY28udWsvMjAxNi8wNi8wNy9vdmVybGF5LWxvZ28tMTIwMC05MF9vcHQucG5n&s=6c824d161c6bfebd907e4b527b3930ea", "extractedDates": [{"textStart": 556, "date": "2019-03-", "amb": false, "textEnd": 566}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-15", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 4, "id": "76", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 3, "id": "86522", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Twitter"}, "id": "302546", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter"}, {"label": {"eng": "European Union law"}, "id": "303046", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union_law"}, {"label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "id": "303064", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union"}, {"label": {"eng": "Trade"}, "id": "303410", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade"}, {"label": {"eng": "European Commission"}, "id": "303458", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Commission"}, {"label": {"eng": "European Parliament"}, "id": "303907", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Parliament"}, {"label": {"eng": "European Council"}, "id": "303919", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Council"}, {"label": {"eng": "Government of the United Kingdom"}, "id": "304310", "score": 4, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_the_United_Kingdom"}, {"label": {"eng": "Customs"}, "id": "304875", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customs"}, {"label": {"eng": "Michel Barnier"}, "id": "314716", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michel_Barnier"}, {"label": {"eng": "Customs union"}, "id": "382637", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customs_union"}, {"label": {"eng": "Guy Verhofstadt"}, "id": "388307", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guy_Verhofstadt"}, {"label": {"eng": "2007 enlargement of the European Union"}, "id": "439092", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007_enlargement_of_the_European_Union"}, {"label": {"eng": "European Union Customs Union"}, "id": "470058", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union_Customs_Union"}, {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom withdrawal from the European Union"}, "id": "1268836", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_withdrawal_from_the_European_Union"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 108, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 140, "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 722, "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Commodities and Futures", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Commodities_and_Futures"}], "time": "13:37:00"}

proposals on the future partnership.\n\nThe government said it would seek to agree a \"time-limited period of implementation\" after leaving the EU to provide certainty for businesses and allow new customs arrangements to be set up.\n\nThe Department for Exiting the EU said Britain wanted to be able to sign free trade agreements with third countries during this period, although these would only be implemented at the end of it.\n\nThe proposal was welcomed by the Confederation of British Industry, Britain's big business lobby, but opposition parties dismissed it as \"fantasy\".\n\nBrexit minister David Davis told BBC radio that the transition period could last \"something like two years\" and would have to be over by the time of the next general election, which is set for 2022.\n\nBritain says its membership of the EU customs union, which currently allows for the tariff-free movement of goods, will end along with its membership of the single market when it leaves the bloc in March 2019.\n\nAfter that \"one possible approach would be a temporary customs union between the UK and the EU,\" the Brexit ministry said in a statement, ahead of the publication of the full paper later on Tuesday.\n\nExperts have warned it will be extremely difficult to negotiate a new EU-UK free trade agreement before Britain leaves the bloc, particularly as Brussels has so far refused even to start trade talks.\n\nIt says there must be broad agreement first on three key issues, Britain's financial settlement, the issue of expatriate rights, and the question of the border between British-controlled Northern Ireland and Ireland.\n\nAsked about the divorce bill on Tuesday, Davis said that Britain would meet \"any real international obligations\" but added that \"there won't be a number by October or November\".\n\nBritain will publish its proposals on the Northern Ireland border issue on Wednesday, ahead of the third round of Brexit negotiations in Brussels at the end of the month.\n\nThe CBI's deputy director Josh Hardie said the government's proposal of a customs transition period was \"encouraging\".\n\n\"The clock is ticking and what matters now is giving companies the confidence to continue investing as quickly as possible,\" he said.\n\nBut opposition Labour lawmaker Chris Leslie, from the campaign group Open Britain, said the proposal represented \"wishful thinking of the highest order\".\n\n\"It is a fantasy to pretend we can have the freest and most frictionless trade possible with our largest partner when the government remain intent on pulling Britain out of the customs union,\" he said.\n\nThe Liberal Democrats, a minor opposition party that is calling for a second referendum that could allow Britain to stay in the EU, said the proposal for an interim arrangement \"will only delay the economic pain caused by leaving the customs union\".", "id": "9236729", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-15", "title": "  UK to seek temporary customs

The first in a series of papers, published today, focuses on the EU customs union.\n\nIt's an agreement that includes all EU member states and a number of related territories that enables goods to travel freely between countries.\n\n\"Countries in the customs union don't impose tariffs - taxes on imports - on each other's goods,\" says the BBC.\n\n\"Every country inside the union levies the same tariffs on imports from abroad. So, for example, a ten per cent tariff is imposed on some cars imported from outside the customs union, while 7.5 per cent is imposed on roasted coffee.\"\n\nThe customs union is separate from the single market, which is a broader agreement across the EU and several other states to enable free movement of people, money, goods and services.\n\nIn addition to the main customs union there are several individual customs union agreements in place between the EU and certain third party countries like Turkey for certain classes of goods.\n\nIn an article for the Sunday Telegraph at the weekend, once-warring Cabinet ministers Philip Hammond and Liam Fox declared a truce by jointly announcing that Britain would definitely leave the single market and customs union in March 2019.\n\nIt was a move designed to \"cheer Brexit supporters\" after months of infighting and was broadly seen as a major concession by Chancellor Hammond.\n\nToday's paper signals that \"Hammond has the upper hand\", claims The Times, as it sets out plans for the \"present customs arrangements to stay in place for an 'interim period' that could last for up to three years\".\n\nIn black and white, the UK government wants to ensure businesses \"only have to change their processes once\", says the BBC, when the UK moves to a new relationship with the EU after the \"transitional period\".\n\nDuring that period, the government still wants a new arrangement, but one that continues a \"close association with the customs union\" or even enters a new \"temporary customs union\".\n\nSo the UK will be outside the main customs union - enabling the government to say it has delivered on a clean break in March 2019 - but businesses will have very little disruption to their operations for several years to come.\n\n\"It should look and feel the same for business,\" one Whitehall official told the Financial Times. \"This is all about giving business what they asked for,\" another told The Times.\n\nBusinesses would have the certainty of knowing they can trade with the EU for many years without disruption, enabling them to continue to invest now.\n\nThat's why the Confederation of British Industry, among other business groups, welcomed it.\n\nLonger term, the paper sets out plans for the \"freest and most frictionless possible trade\" with the rest of Europe.\n\nOptions to achieve this include a new \"customs partnership \" that \"would align UK and EU customs approaches to dispense with any customs border\", says the FT, or effectively a \"virtual border\" using vehicle recognition software and \"trusted trader schemes\".\n\nThese are both complex and may take years to realise, but the prize would be streamlining the estimated five-fold increase in customs declarations at UK borders to 255 million a year, says Bloomberg.\n\nThe scale of demand could put a strain on UK customs operations, leave goods stranded at borders and jeopardise valuable trade - in addition to an estimated cost of \u00a31bn a year to check the country of origin of goods entering the country.\n\nFirst and foremost: the EU.\n\nAs the UK is indicating that it will leave the main customs union and strike a more bespoke deal, it will need the consent of a majority of the remaining 27 EU member states.\n\nThe EU's chief negotiator Michel Barnier says no progress can be made on trade matters until the two sides are closer to resolving the Brexit \"divorce bill\", rights of EU and UK citizens, as well as the border issue between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic.\n\nHe has indicated that trade talks won't start before the autumn, which leaves a race against time to reassure businesses who need to make decisions on where to invest in the medium term.\n\nThen there's the political cost.\n\nFirst, it's unclear whether the UK will be able to sign third-party trade deals during the transition. Its paper says the UK wants the right to sign deals that would kick in once the period expires, but The Times' Whitehall source conceded \"we need to talk to the EU about that\".\n\nThere will almost certainly be requirements for the UK to continue to pay \"pretty serious money\" into the EU budget and to accept some \"compromise on sovereignty\" in the form of a \"role for the European courts\" during the interim, adds the paper.\n\nAll of which is anathema to some Brexiters and is therefore likely to face heavy resistance, especially from within the Conservative ranks.", "id": "9307768",

The second envisages a new \"customs partnership\" that would \"negate the need for a customs border between the U.K. and the EU,\" according to the statement. Further details are due to be published later Tuesday. EU officials have warned however that Britain won't be able to achieve frictionless trade with the bloc once it leaves.\n\nThe department said that in an interim period, after Brexit but before the long-term arrangements come into force, \"One possible approach would be a temporary customs union between the U.K. and the EU.\"\n\nSuch a time-limited period of implementation would ensure that businesses only have to adjust once to a new customs relationship, it said.\n\nThe department added that it will on Wednesday publish proposals for managing the border between EU member Ireland and Northern Ireland after Brexit. The paper \"will make clear the commitment to maintain a seamless and frictionless border with no return to the hard borders of the past,\" it said.\n\nThe publication of the U.K. government's negotiating position on these issues highlight an increasing push by the British government to set out its view of a future EU-U.K. relationship. Talks resume in late August, with both sides hoping to make significant progress by the time EU leaders next meet in October.\n\nWhile the U.K. paper focuses on future customs arrangements, the EU has said it won't discuss the future relationship until it sees sufficient progress on a trio of issues: the Irish border, the rights of EU and U.K. citizens after Brexit, and a settlement of the U.K.'s past financial commitments to the bloc that haven't yet been paid.\n\nPost-Brexit customs arrangements present particular challenges. U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May has said the U.K. will leave both the EU's single market for goods and services, which sets common rules and standards, and the bloc's customs union, which levies common tariffs on imports.\n\nTwo government ministers -- Treasury chief Philip Hammond, who campaigned to stay in the EU, and trade secretary Liam Fox, who campaigned to leave -- declared at the weekend that the U.K. wouldn't stay either in the single market or customs union during the planned \"interim\" period meant to enable an orderly transition to a new economic relationship.\n\nExiting the customs union -- as well as leaving any subsequent interim customs-union agreement with the EU -- is essential if the U.K. is to enter into its own free-trade deals, which pro-Brexit lawmakers say is one of the principal benefits of withdrawal.\n\nSome EU officials have acknowledged the benefits of some kind of transitional access to the EU's customs union for Britain after its scheduled departure in March 2019. They note that both British and European ports, airports and other transport hubs are unlikely to be ready to process the large-scale customs checks required if it were to exit abruptly.\n\nYet Michel Barnier, the EU's top Brexit negotiator, has repeatedly warned the U.K. that it can't expect to exit from the EU and maintain the economic benefits of membership of the single market and the customs union, a point EU officials believe isn't clearly understood in some quarters in the U.K.\n\n\"I have heard some people in the U.K. argue that one can leave the single market and build a customs union to achieve frictionless trade.

prepared to publish its first detailed proposals on the future partnership.\n\nThe government said it would seek to agree a \"time-limited period of implementation\" after leaving the EU to provide certainty for businesses and allow new customs arrangements to be set up.\n\nThe Department for Exiting the EU said Britain wanted to be able to sign free trade agreements with third countries during this period, although these would only be implemented at the end of it.\n\nThe proposal was welcomed by the Confederation of British Industry, Britain's big business lobby, but opposition parties dismissed it as \"fantasy\".\n\nBrexit minister David Davis told BBC radio that the transition period could last \"something like two years\" and would have to be over by the time of the next general election, which is set for 2022.\n\nBritain says its membership of the EU customs union, which currently allows for the tariff-free movement of goods, will end along with its membership of the single market when it leaves the bloc in March 2019.\n\nAfter that \"one possible approach would be a temporary customs union between the UK and the EU,\" the Brexit ministry said in a statement, ahead of the publication of the full paper later on Tuesday.\n\nExperts have warned it will be extremely difficult to negotiate a new EU-UK free trade agreement before Britain leaves the bloc -- particularly as Brussels has so far refused even to start trade talks.\n\nIt says there must be broad agreement first on three key issues -- Britain's financial settlement, the issue of expatriate rights, and the question of the border between British-controlled Northern Ireland and Ireland.\n\nAsked about the divorce bill on Tuesday, Davis said that Britain would meet \"any real international obligations\" but added that \"there won't be a number by October or November\".\n\nBritain will publish its proposals on the Northern Ireland border issue on Wednesday, ahead of the third round of Brexit negotiations in Brussels at the end of the month.\n\n'Encouraging' proposal\n\nThe CBI's deputy director Josh Hardie said the government's proposal of a customs transition period was \"encouraging\".\n\n\"The clock is ticking and what matters now is giving companies the confidence to continue investing as quickly as possible,\" he said.\n\nBut opposition Labour lawmaker Chris Leslie, from the campaign group Open Britain, said the proposal represented \"wishful thinking of the highest order\".\n\n\"It is a fantasy to pretend we can have the freest and most frictionless trade possible with our largest partner when the government remain intent on pulling Britain out of the customs union,\" he said.\n\nThe Liberal Democrats, a minor opposition party that is calling for a second referendum that could allow Britain to stay in the EU, said the proposal for an interim arrangement \"will only delay the economic pain caused by leaving the customs union\".", "id":

single market when it leaves the bloc in March 2019. -- Reuters picLONDON, Aug 15 -- Britain will seek a \"temporary customs union\" with the European Union after Brexit, the government said today as it prepared to publish its first detailed proposals on the future partnership.\n\nThe government said it would seek to agree a \"time-limited period of implementation\" after leaving the EU to provide certainty for businesses and allow new customs arrangements to be set up.\n\nThe Department for Exiting the EU said Britain wanted to be able to sign free trade agreements with third countries during this period, although these would only be implemented at the end of it.\n\nThe proposal was welcomed by the Confederation of British Industry, Britain's big business lobby, but opposition parties dismissed it as \"fantasy\".\n\nBrexit minister David Davis told BBC radio that the transition period could last \"something like two years\" and would have to be over by the time of the next general election, which is set for 2022.\n\nBritain says its membership of the EU customs union, which currently allows for the tariff-free movement of goods, will end along with its membership of the single market when it leaves the bloc in March 2019.\n\nAfter that \"one possible approach would be a temporary customs union between the UK and the EU,\" the Brexit ministry said in a statement, ahead of the publication of the full paper later on Tuesday.\n\nExperts have warned it will be extremely difficult to negotiate a new EU-UK free trade agreement before Britain leaves the bloc -- particularly as Brussels has so far refused even to start trade talks.\n\nIt says there must be broad agreement first on three key issues -- Britain's financial settlement, the issue of expatriate rights, and the question of the border between British-controlled Northern Ireland and Ireland.\n\nAsked about the divorce bill today, Davis said that Britain would meet \"any real international obligations\" but added that \"there won't be a number by October or November\".\n\nBritain will publish its proposals on the Northern Ireland border issue tomorrow, ahead of the third round of Brexit negotiations in Brussels at the end of the month.\n\n'Encouraging' proposal\n\nThe CBI's deputy director Josh Hardie said the government's proposal of a customs transition period was \"encouraging\".\n\n\"The clock is ticking and what matters now is giving companies the confidence to continue investing as quickly as possible,\" he said.\n\nBut opposition Labour lawmaker Chris Leslie, from the campaign group Open Britain, said the proposal represented \"wishful thinking of the highest order\".\n\n\"It is a fantasy to pretend we can have the freest and most frictionless trade possible with our largest partner when the government remain intent on pulling Britain out of the customs union,\" he said.\n\nThe Liberal Democrats, a minor opposition party that is calling for a second referendum that could allow Britain to stay in the EU, said the proposal for an interim arrangement \"will only delay the economic pain caused by leaving the customs union\". -- AFP", "id": "9241639", "details": {}, "date":

They sell us 290 billion euro. So there are a lot of things there.'\n\nAsked whether Britain would have to pay to stay in the customs union, he said: 'Well, I don't think ... well, what happens in that sort of interim period you will have to leave me to negotiate, I'm afraid, how we do it, but the aim is to bring to an end these huge \u00a310billion-a-year payments, bring that to an end now.\n\n'We are still haggling with them over what we may owe them in the short term but we are going to bring the overall thing to an end.\n\n'This is something that is in both sides' interest. Now you are right, there will be political pushback and that's what the negotiations will be about.'\n\nThe government plans would allow the UK to begin 'negotiating bold new trade relationships around the world' as soon as the country leaves the EU in March 2019.\n\nBut he is asking Brussels to keep in place current customs rules that prevent goods having to be checked as they go between Britain and the EU for an interim period, which could last up to two or three years.\n\nSuch a deal, where the UK mimics the EU's tariffs and rules on customs, would give more time for a smooth switch to the new trading regime, which would benefit businesses on both sides of the Channel.\n\nMinisters have been warned about the strain ports could be put under if they face a sudden increase in bureaucracy for dealing with goods entering and leaving the country.\n\nMinisters say that during the temporary customs arrangement, the country must be allowed to begin developing a trade policy that makes it 'more outward-looking than ever before' as soon as possible.\n\nBut under EU rules, member states are forbidden from striking their own trade deals with other countries. The Government will insist that it is allowed to begin this work as soon as it leaves the EU, even if the current EU customs regime remains in place on a temporary basis. But Brussels may put ministers under pressure to promise that these new deals will only come into force at the end of the interim period.\n\nIn the longer term, the government says it is seeking 'the most frictionless customs arrangement anywhere', with minimal checks and paperwork on goods going between the EU and UK.\n\nMr Davis (pictured with EU Chief Brexit Negotiator Michel Barnier) will argue Britain must be allowed to begin developing a trade policy that makes it 'more outward-looking than ever before'\n\nOne option being put forward by Mr Davis would see the UK manage a new customs border with administration streamlined to the 'fullest extent possible' using technology.\n\nHe will also float plans for a customs partnership with the EU that would negate the need for a customs border between the UK and the rest of the bloc.\n\nNegotiations on future customs arrangements are not due to be discussed during the next round of Brexit talks to be held in Brussels at the end of this month.\n\nThe European Commission has said progress first needs to be made on agreeing the divorce bill before work can begin on the future relationship between the EU and UK.\n\nBut Downing Street said it was pushing forward with setting out its plans in order to help businesses both in Britain and across the continent.\n\nThe Prime Minister's spokesman said yesterday: 'We have had the first round of the negotiations and those talks have shown that many of the withdrawal questions can only be settled in light of the future partnership. So now is the time to set out our approach to that partnership to inform the negotiations and to provide citizens and business at home and across Europe with a deeper understanding of our thinking.'\n\nBusiness leaders last night welcomed the Government's plan to minimise disruption to trade.\n\nJosh Hardie, deputy director-general of the Confederation of British Industry, said he was encouraged that the papers propose a time-limited interim period and a customs system that is as barrier-free as possible.\n\nHe added: 'All efforts should be made to deliver a single-step transition, so that businesses don't have to adapt twice.'\n\nBut Labour MP Chris Leslie, a leading supporter of the Open Britain campaign group, accused ministers of 'wanting to have their cake and eat it'.\n\nHe said: 'It is a fantasy to pretend we can have the freest and most frictionless trade possible with our largest partner when the Government remain intent on pulling Britain out of the customs union.'\n\nDowning Street last night announced that Theresa May will embark on a visit to Japan at the end of this month in a bid to boost Britain's post-Brexit trade.\n\nThe Prime Minister, who is currently in Switzerland on holiday, will be received by emperor Akihito and the Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe.\n\nMrs May will be accompanied on the trip by business leaders from a range

The policy paper duly outlines two possible approaches: a \"highly streamlined customs arrangement\" building on existing systems but with innovative measures, and a second option of a \"new customs partnership\" which would remove the need for a UK-EU customs border and in the minister's words would be \"entirely novel and therefore untested\".\n\nAny transitional period would most likely last for two years but possibly slightly less, Davis has said, and must be over by the time of the UK's next scheduled general election in 2022.\n\nIn interviews on Tuesday, Davis would not be drawn on whether Britain would pay the EU for a temporary customs deal, saying he would not negotiate on air, although he did tell ITV \"no, I don't think so\".\n\nBusinesses have long called for clarity over the UK's future relationship with the EU, and the main employers' organisation the CBI said it was encouraged by the government's proposal. The Institute of Directors said there would be a \"great sigh of relief\" among UK businesses.\n\nRead the CBItweets</a> response to the Customs Union partnerships papers <a href=\"https://t.co/K2WPVQ48Rv\">https://t.co/K2WPVQ48Rv</a></p> -- The CBI (CBItweets) August 15, 2017\n\nBrussels' position from the outset has been that the UK's divorce settlement - the so-called exit bill, as well as citizens' rights and the future of the Irish border - must be sorted before future trade arrangements can be negotiated.\n\nThe European Union has said it will study the proposals carefully but will only consider the question of an implementation period once sufficient progress has been made on Britain's withdrawal. The Commission's chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier emphasised these priorities in a new tweet coinciding with the publication of the UK's policy paper.\n\nThe quicker #UK & EU27 agree on citizens, settling accounts and #Ireland, the quicker we can discuss customs & future relationship. -- Michel Barnier (@MichelBarnier)\n\nAugust 15, 2017\n\nThe EU has always warned that Britain cannot \"cherry-pick\" the advantages of EU membership which involve accepting the union's main principles. Under the rules of the Customs Union, members trade without customs impositions and charge the same tariffs on imports - and cannot negotiate their own trade deals outside the EU. One of the UK's key Brexit objectives is to be free to pursue its own trade deals.\n\nThe European Parliament's Brexit coordinator Guy Verhofstadt tweeted to imply that Britain's proposals were a \"fantasy\", interpreting them as an attempt to be both in and out of the Customs Union.\n\nTo be in & out of the Customs Union & \"invisible borders\" is a fantasy. First need to secure citizens rights & a financial settlement -- Guy Verhofstadt (@GuyVerhofstadt)\n\nAugust 15, 2017\n\nEarlier, former EU Trade Commissioner Karel De Gucht described the proposals as \"very problematic\", suggesting that the EU may only accept similar customs arrangements for several years on its terms - which would mean the UK paying contributions and abiding by decisions of the European Court of Justice.\n\nUK opposition figures have also criticised the government's proposals.

The arrangement would prevent the worst case cliff-edge scenario for businesses by allowing tariff free trade between the UK and EU to continue until a new trade deal is struck.\n\nThe paper is the first in a series to be published over the coming months, outlining broadly what the UK seeks to achieve in the ongoing Brexit negotiations on matters such as trade and the border with Ireland. The paper also describes the UK's intended customs relationship with the EU following the transition period as an arrangement that will permit trade with the EU to be as frictionless as possible. The government said it hoped for either \"a new customs partnership with the EU...in a way that removes the need for a UK-EU customs border\", or a new \"highly streamlined customs arrangement...leaving as few additional requirements on EU trade as possible\".\n\nIf the EU agrees to the temporary customs union, the UK intends it to last the duration of the transition period\n\nIf the EU agrees to the temporary customs union, the UK intends it to last the duration of the transition period, around three years. However, the EU has repeatedly said any terms of the UK's departure will only be discussed when the immediate arrangements following the decoupling have been agreed upon. This will include settling on a figure for the UK's divorce bill. In a series of interviews about the publication of the paper, David Davis, the UK's Brexit Secretary, admitted that he does not expect a figure to have been reached until at least October.\n\nThe proposed temporary customs union will be popular with UK advocates of a smooth Brexit transition, but is likely to face opposition from Europe since it would essentially allow the UK to cherry pick the advantages of the single market, while negotiating new trade deals with non EU countries. Since all EU members must trade with other countries under the same terms and tariffs, the UK is seeking an advantage in international trade beyond EU member countries, while hoping to maintain all the benefits of single market membership.", "id": "9285966", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-15", "title": "UK seeks temporary customs deal to dodge Brexit cliff edge", "image": "https://www.worldfinance.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/daves-600x450.jpg", "extractedDates": [{"imp": true, "textStart": 79, "date": "2017-08-15", "amb": false, "textEnd": 88}, {"textStart": 258, "date": "2019-03-", "amb": false, "textEnd": 268}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-15", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 5, "id": "76", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": null, "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 3, "id": "112932", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": null, "score": 1, "id": "303048", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "id": "303064", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union"}, {"label": {"eng": "Trade"}, "id": "303410", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade"}, {"label": {"eng": "Member state of the European Union"}, "id": "303880", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_state_of_the_European_Union"}, {"label": {"eng": "Government of the United Kingdom"}, "id": "304310", "score": 4, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_the_United_Kingdom"}, {"label": {"eng": "Customs"}, "id": "304875", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customs"}, {"label": {"eng": "Free trade"}, "id": "307357", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_trade"}, {"label": {"eng": "Border"}, "id": "308560", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Border"}, {"label": {"eng": "Tariff"}, "id": "309353", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tariff"}, {"label": {"eng": "Trade agreement"}, "id": "313703", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_agreement"}, {"label": {"eng": "Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs"}, "id": "324735", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary_of_State_for_Foreign_and_Commonwealth_Affairs"}, {"label": {"eng": "Single market"}, "id": "326525", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_market"}, {"label": {"eng": "Customs union"}, "id": "382637", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customs_union"}, {"label": {"eng": "European Union Customs Union"}, "id": "470058", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union_Customs_Union"}, {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom withdrawal from the European Union"}, "id": "1268836", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_withdrawal_from_the_European_Union"}, {"label": {"eng": "Cherry picking"}, "id": "1268934", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cherry_picking"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 108, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 140, "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 269, "label": "dmoz/Business/International Business and Trade", "uri": "dmoz/Business/International_Business_and_Trade"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 479, "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day Trading", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day_Trading"}], "time": "13:28:00"}

It would in effect give negotiators breathing space to figure out a new system that under which Britain trades with its European neighbours.\n\nBut what is the customs union and why is it so important? Our colleagues at Wales Online took a look\n\nCustoms union\n\nThe customs union is the arrangement under which goods can be traded within the EU without tariffs, while goods imported from outside the EU face tariff barriers that are common to all member states.\n\nIt's different to the single market in that only covers trade in goods, not movement of people, capital or services. It dates back to 1958 and is what Britain signed up to when we joined the then EEC back in 1973.\n\nIt also differs in that it only covers tariffs, not non-tariff barriers such as standards and regulations, which businesses say are just as important as tariffs in determining where they export to.\n\nNew trade deals\n\nThe Government also says it hopes to start negotiating new trade deals with non-EU nations while the temporary arrangements are in place. This could cause problems, because under the EU treaty members are not allowed to negotiate trade deals with third parties - only the EU can do that.\n\nBut the Government argues that the prohibition relates to signatories of the EU treaty, and once Britain has left the EU it is no longer bound by its provisions, even if it is still within the customs union for a limited time.\n\nThe Government will argue that it should be able to start talking with other states during the temporary arrangements so long as nothing is signed or implemented until the period is over. In practice the length of time it takes to negotiate trade deals means any new deals are unlikely to be finalised before Britain leaves the customs union.\n\nNew trading arrangements with the EU\n\nThe purpose behind our temporary membership of the customs union after Brexit would be to allow extra time to negotiate our new trading arrangement with our former EU partners. This means deciding what tariffs if any will apply on goods imported from and exported to the EU, as well as discussing how passing through customs can be made as quick and easy as possible.\n\nThere's also the thorny question of non-tariff barriers - those differences in standards and regulations that the single market is designed to remove. The EU will be concerned at the impact of diverging standards and regulations in Britain and will probably seek to block them at least during the temporary customs union phase, and reduce their impact afterwards.\n\nThe timescale\n\nMany people think it will be impossible to conclude a deal with the EU before the March 2019 deadline for Britain's departure - especially as the EU is insisting that the details of Britain's departure are thrashed out before its future relationship with the union is discussed.\n\nThis is why the Government has raised the idea of temporary membership of the customs union in the two or three years immediately after 2019. In the absence of a new trade deal - which most people agree could take years to negotiate - this would at least avoid the 'cliff edge' that economists and business people fear as British companies suddenly find themselves outside the tariff wall of the Customs Union.\n\nSingle market\n\nThe single market is the cornerstone of what the EU is all about. Under its rules people, goods, capital and services are allowed to move as freely as possible between the 28 member states.\n\nMargaret Thatcher signed Britain up to the single market when she put her name to the Single European Act back in 1986. The idea was to boost economic growth by removing the remaining barriers to trade that still existed within the European Economic Community (EEC) that Britain joined in 1973.\n\nThe single market is Britain's biggest trading partner, accounting for 45% of UK exports and 50% of imports. Membership of the single market allows British companies to trade across the 28 member states without restrictions, and Britons to live and work anywhere in the EU.\n\nRemainers would like the UK to remain part of the single market, but this could only happen if we accepted freedom of movement and the all the regulations that come with membership.\n\nSo soft Brexiteers prefer to talk about access to the single market under a special arrangement such as that enjoyed by Norway or Switzerland Both can trade freely with the EU, without tariffs, but have to accept freedom of movement and make some level of contribution to the EU budget.\n\nFreedom of movement\n\nMost commentators felt that concern over immigration was at the heart of the Leave vote in June 2016 - and Theresa May made regaining control of it the cornerstone of her position on Brexit.\n\nEnding freedom of movement means leaving the single market, and the Conservatives pledged to reduce net migration to tens of thousands per year in their 2017 election manifesto.\n\nDivorce settlement\n\nWhat the EU wants to discuss first is arrangements for its citizens who live in the UK, and settling Britain's outstanding debts, which could amount to tens of billions of pounds.\n\nSome hard Brexiteers say Britain shouldn't pay a penny, but most politicians accept that the UK should honour any financial commitments it has already entered into, even if this means paying a contribution into the EU budget after we have left.\n\nIf Britain continues to stay in the customs union, even if only for a short period, it may also have to pay a contribution to the EU. Brexit Secretary David Davis refused to be drawn on whether Britain would pay, saying it was something that would have to be part of the negotiations.\n\nWhat business says\n\nBusiness groups have welcomed today's announcement. Janet Jones, FSB Wales Policy chair, said: \"Today's commitment from the Government would give small businesses in Wales the time they need to prepare for new customs arrangements, which is very welcome. But it is essential that this interim deal is negotiated as soon as possible with the EU Commission, to give businesses the certainty to keep investing in the UK.\n\n\"We also welcome the aspiration that negotiation on Free Trade Agreements globally will be able to begin once we have left the EU. Whilst 63% of our small businesses across the UK would prioritise an FTA with the EU, 49% would prioritise an FTA with the US and 28% with China.\n\n\"Beyond the interim period it is essential that new customs arrangements achieve the most frictionless trade with small businesses as possible. Our UK-wide research shows that non-tariff barriers are just as important as tariff barriers in determining where small businesses export to.\n\n\"Many Welsh businesses trade within the EU Single Market and so engagement with small businesses is essential to develop a new customs relationship with the EU that enhances trade and successfully capitalises upon the opportunities offered by digital technology.\"\n\nJosh Hardie, CBI deputy director-general, said: \"Companies will welcome the progress Government has made today in publishing these papers. Over the past year, businesses have been providing policymakers with the evidence, ideas and solutions to make a success of Brexit.\n\n\"So it's encouraging to see that these papers propose a time-limited interim period and a customs system that is as barrier-free as possible.\n\n\"We at the CBI have always been clear that new ideas on crucial issues like this should be brought to the table quickly. But the clock is ticking and what matters now is giving companies the confidence to continue investing as quickly as possible.\"\n\n\"Business wants to see as frictionless a customs system as possible, with a strong emphasis on digital systems that make it easier to trade.\n\n\"But to secure frictionless trade, negotiations on regulation, tariff and non-tariff barriers will have to take place. All efforts should be made to deliver a single-step transition, so that businesses don't have to adapt twice.\"", "id": "9491783", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-16", "title": "What is the customs

someone would bring in cheap goods and then sell them on.\n\n\"But we should be able to have an arrangement by which we can do the negotiation , sign it off, but not enter (it) into effect.\"\n\nMr Davis also refused to rule out paying for the temporary deal, while officials admitted the European Court of Justice's role in enforcing customs union rules during the interim period would be subject to negotiations.\n\nPressed on whether the UK would have to pay, Mr Davis said: \"I am not going to do the negotiation on air.\n\n\"What we are not going to do, let's be clear, we are not going to continue the \u00a310 billion a year net contributions we currently have.\"\n\nThe partnership paper is the first in a series of documents the Government hopes to publish in the coming weeks in order to inform Brexit negotiations.\n\nBut Mr Barnier insisted a new customs relationship cannot be discussed until agreement is reached on phase one of the talks.\n\nHe tweeted: \"The quicker #UK & EU27 agree on citizens, settling accounts and #Ireland, the quicker we can discuss customs & future relationship.\"\n\nA Commission spokesman echoed Mr Barnier's words and drew attention to his previous statement that frictionless trade is not possible outside the single market and customs union.\n\nThe spokesman said Brussels would study the customs paper \"carefully\", adding: \"We take note of the UK's request for an implementing period and its preferences as regards the future relationship, but we will only address them once we have made sufficient progress on the terms of the orderly withdrawal.\n\n\"An agreement on a future relationship between the EU and the UK can only be finalised once the UK has become a third country.\n\n\"As Michel Barnier has said on several occasions, 'frictionless trade' is not possible outside the single market and customs union.\"\n\nThe EU is also working on a position paper on the customs union, following a tranche of documents published before the summer on issues such as citizens' rights and nuclear materials, he said.\n\nFormer Ukip leader and leading Brexit-backer Nigel Farage criticised the plan for temporary arrangements.\n\n\"Under the plan revealed by David Davis today, we would not be able to sign that trade deal until President Trump was nearing the end of his second term,\" he told the BBC.\n\n\"This is not what we voted for -

In a joint Sunday Telegraph article, Philip Hammond and Liam Fox stressed any deal would not be indefinite or a \"back door\" to staying in the EU.\n\nTheir comments are being seen as an attempt to show unity between rival sides in Theresa May's cabinet. It comes as ministers start to set out their detailed aims for Brexit.\n\nA series of papers are being published, including one this week covering what will happen to the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic after the UK has left the EU.\n\nWriting in the Sunday Telegraph, Mr Hammond and Mr Fox said the UK definitely will leave both the customs union and the single market when it exits the EU in March 2019.\n\nThey said a \"time-limited\" transition period would \"further our national interest and give business greater certainty\" - but warned it would not stop Brexit.\n\n\"We are both clear that during this period the UK will be outside the single market and outside the customs union and will be a 'third-country' not party to EU treaties,\" they said.\n\nThey said the UK's borders \"must continue to operate smoothly\", that goods bought on the internet \"must still cross borders\", and \"businesses must still be able to supply their customers across the EU\" in the weeks and months after Brexit.\n\nThe two leading politicians said the government wanted to ensure \"there will not be a cliff-edge when we leave the EU\".\n\nMeanwhile, former Labour Foreign Secretary David Miliband has called for politicians on all sides to unite to fight back against the \"worst consequences\" of Brexit. He described the outcome of last year's referendum as an \"unparalleled act of economic self-harm\".\n\nWriting in the Observer, he said: \"People say we must respect the referendum. We should.

Also, for the time being, the customs union deal with Turkey will not be changed or updated,\" Merkel said on Aug. 16 when asked about ties with Turkey during a live interview on YouTube.\n\nTurkey's EU minister Omer Celik on Thursday identified Merkel's recent statement as \"unfortunate\" and \"an outcome of rising tensions between the two countries.\"\n\nBilateral problems between Turkey and Germany should not cast a shadow on European Union affairs, he said, urging the EU institutions not to \"allow Germany to turn this into an EU matter.\"\n\n\"It is not right for an EU-member country to behave like instructing EU institutions,\" the presidential spokesperson Ibrahim Kalin told reporters on the same day.\n\n\"The customs union agreement is built upon a win-win principle. Here we talk about a relationship which is based on the benefit of both Turkey and European countries. When it is precluded, postponed or canceled, not just Turkey, all European countries will get harm,\" he stated.\n\nThe Customs Union agreement between Turkey and the EU entered into force in 1995 and covers all industrial goods but does not include agriculture, services or public procurement.\n\nThe European Commission announced in December that it had asked the European Council for a mandate to launch talks with Turkey to upgrade the existing EU-Turkey Customs Union.\n\nEU officials earlier informed Ankara that the European Council may launch negotiations on the Customs Union in fall, after the German elections, but there is no new notification yet, a Turkish official who asked to remain anonymous told Xinhua.\n\nMerkel's remarks came one day after German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel suggested that his government's economic pressure on Turkey \"is working.\"\n\nIn July, the German government said it might cut off export insurance guarantees and other forms of economic cooperation in Turkey and warned its citizens for traveling to the country over the arrest of German human rights activists.\n\nMerkel said the warnings issued by her government \"had gotten Turkey thinking, but these are not enough.\"\n\nAs a sign of detente, Turkey last week has given permission for a group of German lawmakers to visit their troops at a NATO airbase in Konya province in September following the postponement of an earlier visit.\n\nAt the beginning of July, Germany began withdrawing its forces from Incirlik Air Base in southern Turkey, after Ankara refused German parliament members from visiting them.\n\nGermany is critical for the Turkish government's post-coup crackdown, in which 50,000 people have been detained and over 150,000 sacked or suspended from the judiciary, journalism, academia and other public services.\n\nSeveral dozens of military personnel and diplomats applied for asylum in Germany, while Turkey demanded, in vain, for their extradition after July 15 coup attempt last year.\n\nAt the weekend, Turkey issued a diplomatic note to German Foreign Ministry for probe and extradition of Adil Oksuz, a theology lecturer suspected of playing a major role in the failed coup.\n\nTurkish media reports suggested that Oksuz was seen in Frankfurt and Ulm and given a temporary residence permit by Germany's Baden-Wurttemberg state, but there has been no official confirmation from Turkish authorities if they have communicated reliable intelligence information.\n\n\"None of our allies can harbor a killer.

So, for example, a ten per cent tariff is imposed on some cars imported from outside the customs union, while 7.5 per cent is imposed on roasted coffee.\"\n\nThe customs union is separate from the single market, which is a broader agreement across the EU and several other states to enable free movement of people, money, goods and services.\n\nIn addition to the main customs union there are several individual customs union agreements in place between the EU and certain third party countries like Turkey for certain classes of goods.\n\nIn an article for the Sunday Telegraph at the weekend, once-warring Cabinet ministers Philip Hammond and Liam Fox declared a truce by jointly announcing that Britain would definitely leave the single market and customs union in March 2019.\n\nIt was a move designed to \"cheer Brexit supporters\" after months of infighting and was broadly seen as a major concession by Chancellor Hammond.\n\nToday's paper signals that \"Hammond has the upper hand\", claims The Times, as it sets out plans for the \"present customs arrangements to stay in place for an 'interim period' that could last for up to three years\".\n\nIn black and white, the UK government wants to ensure businesses \"only have to change their processes once\", says the BBC, when the UK moves to a new relationship with the EU after the \"transitional period\".\n\nDuring that period, the government still wants a new arrangement, but one that continues a \"close association with the customs union\" or even enters a new \"temporary customs union\".\n\nSo the UK will be outside the main customs union - enabling the government to say it has delivered on a clean break in March 2019 - but businesses will have very little disruption to their operations for several years to come.\n\n\"It should look and feel the same for business,\" one Whitehall official told the Financial Times. \"This is all about giving business what they asked for,\" another told the Times.\n\nBusinesses would have the certainty of knowing they can trade with the EU for many years without disruption, enabling them to continue to invest now.\n\nThat's why the Confederation of British Industry, among other business groups, welcomed it.\n\nLonger term, the paper sets out plans for the \"freest and most frictionless possible trade\" with the rest of Europe.\n\nOptions to achieve this include a new \"customs partnership \" that \"would align UK and EU customs approaches to dispense with any customs border\", says the FT, or effectively a \"virtual border\" using vehicle recognition software and \"trusted trader schemes\".\n\nThese are both complex and may take years to realise, but the prize would be streamlining the estimated five-fold increase in customs declarations at UK borders to 255 million a year, says Bloomberg.\n\nThe scale of demand could put a strain on UK customs operations, leave goods stranded at borders and jeopardise valuable trade - in addition to an estimated cost of \u00a31bn a year to check the country of origin of goods entering the country.\n\nFirst and foremost: the EU.\n\nAs the UK is indicating that it will leave the main customs union and strike a more bespoke deal, it will need the consent of a majority of the remaining 27 EU member states.\n\nThe EU's chief negotiator Michel Barnier says no progress can be made on trade matters until the two sides are closer to resolving the Brexit \"divorce bill\" arrangements for EU and UK citizens, as well as the border issue between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic.\n\nHe has indicated that trade talks won't start before the autumn, which leaves a race against time to reassure businesses who need to make decisions on where to invest in the medium term.\n\nThen there's the political cost.\n\nFirst, it's unclear whether the UK will be able to sign third party trade deals during the transition. Its paper says the UK wants the right to sign deals that would kick in once the period expires, but the Times' Whitehall source conceded \"we need to talk to the EU about that\".\n\nThere will almost certainly be requirements for the UK to continue to pay \"pretty serious money\" into the EU budget and to accept some \"compromise on sovereignty\" in the form of a \"role for the European courts\" during the interim, adds the Times.\n\nAll of which is anathema to some Brexiters and is therefore likely to face heavy resistance, especially from within the Conservative ranks.", "id": "9261231",

But Brussels has insisted that progress must be made on divorce arrangements first.\n\n\"We need to get on with negotiating the bigger issues around our future partnership to ensure we get a deal that delivers a strong UK and EU,\" Brexit Minister David Davis said in a statement.\n\nBritain's call to move forward with Brexit talks came as finance minister Philip Hammond and trade minister Liam Fox presented a united front that there should be a time-limited transition period - signalling a truce between rival factions in Prime Minister Theresa May's cabinet.\n\nDavis's Brexit department said it was preparing to publish several papers, including plans for a new customs arrangement and a proposal on how to resolve the difficulties of a non-physical border between Ireland and Northern Ireland.\n\n\"We've been crystal clear that issues around our withdrawal and our future partnership are inextricably linked,\" a source in Britain's Brexit department said.\n\n\"These papers show we are ready to broaden out the negotiations.\"\n\nTalks so far have focused on how much Britain should pay to leave the EU, what rights British and EU citizens will have, and how to manage a land border to the bloc in Ireland. The two sides will be looking for a solution to those issues at the next round of talks due at the end of this month.\n\nThe decision to announce the publication of papers on its plans indicates Britain's desire to counter criticism from Brussels about its approach to the talks.\n\nIn July, EU officials said progress was difficult not because Britain had unacceptable demands, but because it had no position at all on many issues. EU negotiators have warned that an already-tight timetable could be delayed ahead of a scheduled March 2019 exit.\n\nA British paper focused on \"issues unique to Northern Ireland and Ireland\" is expected ahead of the talks, but no further details of the proposal were provided on Sunday.\n\nThe Sunday Telegraph reported that Britain was seeking a \"Schengen area\" between Britain and Ireland, which would allow free movement of people and a \"light-touch customs regime\" across the border of the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland. The Brexit department declined to comment on the story.\n\nThe report, which cited an unnamed source in the Brexit department, said that Irish citizens would be able to work freely in the UK, and British citizens would work freely in Ireland.

On the other, the U.K., now so keen to give certainty to its restive businesses and industries, that it is has started making formal proposals for its future relationship with the EU -- this week on customs arrangements -- before the EU is prepared to talk about them.\n\nThe bloc responded with a curt statement noting the U.K.'s 14-page customs position paper, but making it very clear that chief negotiator Michel Barnier and the EU27 think the Brits have jumped the gun.\n\nThe fact a customs paper was published at all -- with accompanying statements from David Davis, the Brexit secretary; Liam Fox, the international trade secretary; and Chancellor Philip Hammond -- marks a new-found unity of purpose within the British Cabinet. Despite louder noises from Remain supporters such as former Davis aide James Chapman, who is critical of his former boss (calling Davis lazy and a liar on Twitter) and pushing the formation of a new pro-EU party, the British government is showing signs of unity.\n\nThe opposing camps in Prime Minister Theresa May's team can both claim some victory with the government's negotiating position -- Hammond has secured his meaningful transition period to smooth Britain's exit from the bloc, Fox has his desire to move ahead with international trade deals sanctioned. Whether that unity can deliver the shift in the EU's slow and steady approach to talks that the British government is pushing for, remains to be seen.\n\nAccording to one senior Cabinet figure, speaking to POLITICO on condition of anonymity, the EU's response to the paper was \"no surprise.\" The Cabinet doesn't know whether they will be successful in what has become a mini-campaign to speed up the negotiation, the minister added.\n\nMore position papers addressing the future relationship with the EU will be published in the coming weeks. By publishing a new position paper on Northern Ireland and the border on Wednesday -- heavily informed by Tuesday's customs paper -- the Brits want to underline their case that so-called exit issues can't be separated from discussions about future relations between the U.K. and the remaining 27 EU countries.\n\nSince last year's referendum, discord in the U.K. has contrasted sharply with consensus on the Continent, where the remaining 27 EU countries seem largely focused elsewhere. In Germany, Chancellor Angela Merkel has embarked on her reelection campaign, while in France the new president, Emmanuel Macron, is working to push his agenda forward amid crumbling poll numbers.\n\nThe European Commission insists that Barnier's mandate for the negotiations does not extend beyond its three opening priorities -- Britain's so-called divorce bill, the rights of EU citizens in the U.K (and vice versa) and the Northern Irish border. So it seems unlikely the EU will engage on any of the U.K.'s future relationship position papers until after the October European Council summit, at the earliest.\n\nThe customs paper makes two proposals for the future terms of trade in goods between the U.K. and the EU.\n\nBoth scenarios have two things in common. First, they would only come into force after a transition period that replicates almost exactly the terms of the EU customs union, thus avoiding a cliff edge for U.K. business.\n\nSecond, under both scenarios the U.K. will have an independent trade policy, allowing Fox to carry on negotiating and, he hopes, eventually signing and implementing free-trade agreements with non-EU countries.\n\nFox pushed hard in Cabinet discussions for the U.K. to have the ability to work on trade deals as soon as it leaves the EU in 2019, government officials said. However, he will be unable to implement them during a transition period in which the U.K. will maintain, according to the position paper, a \"close association\" with the EU customs union. That closeness to the status quo was welcomed by the U.K. business lobby, who have been championed by Hammond, along with Business Secretary Greg Clark, in Cabinet discussions this summer.\n\nThe compromise should not surprise people, said Conservative MP James Cleverly, a parliamentary private secretary -- or ministerial assistant -- in the Home Office, who campaigned for Brexit.\n\n\"A lot of people painted the people who have been campaigning for Brexit as stark ideologues, but actually the vast majority are pragmatists. We want to leave the EU because on the whole it has more disadvantages than advantages. But we are not trying to smash the shop up,\" he said.\n\n\"We are not trying to do it in a way that will ultimately be damaging. I am happy we are being realistic and that we are giving business certainty,\" he said.\n\nThe proposals have gone down well among one of the key factions in Theresa May's party: Brexit-supporting Conservative MPs.\n\nSuella Fernandes, chairman of the European Research Group, which coordinates pro-Brexit Tory backbenchers, welcomed the paper.\n\n\"[It] makes it crystal clear that the government is committed to leaving the EU customs union and single market,\" she said. \"A time-limited implementation period during which the U.K. rises up to its new free-trade agreements is also welcome so that U.K. businesses are supported in adapting to new arrangements. The opportunity for the U.K. to be a champion of global free trade, boost investment, jobs and prosperity is exciting and one we should all seize.\"\n\nTo some of course, that stance translates as having cake and eating it.\n\n\"As Michel Barnier has said on several occasions, 'frictionless trade' is not possible outside the single market and customs union,\" the EU's statement said, referring to its chief Brexit negotiator.\n\nFrustration with the EU's reluctance to address what it classifies as \"future relationship issues\" is beginning to filter through to the business lobby. Businesses plan to lobby the Commission to speed up talks in the hope of an early transition deal that would provide certainty in forward planning.\n\nHaving previously felt ignored in the Brexit discussion, since the general election and the ejection of Theresa May's gatekeeper chiefs of staff, Nick Timothy and Fiona Hill, business and industry voices are being heard more readily, one senior business figure said, speaking on condition of anonymity.\n\nThe Confederation of British Industry, the Federation of Small Business and the Institute of Directors broadly welcomed the government's detailed customs paper Tuesday. Josh Hardie, deputy director general of the CBI, said the government's aims were \"the right ones\" and turned the spotlight onto the EU.\n\n\"Much will rest on the negotiation, and -- as the paper acknowledges -- EU customs systems will need to adapt too. There is clear interest on both sides in avoiding a cliff-edge and keeping trade flowing, not just at Dover, but Rotterdam, Calais and Antwerp too,\" he said.\n\nAllie Renison, the IoD's head of EU and trade policy, said that while there was an onus on the U.K. to get its house in order on withdrawal matters, the EU could also do more to hasten progress.\n\n\"The government still needs to work to ensure sufficient progress is made on citizens' rights and any financial settlement, and we are hopeful that the EU will treat an interim deal on trade with the same sense of urgency,\" she said.\n\nAt the moment, that seems a faint hope. The EU is likely to look skeptically upon the U.K.'s proposal to negotiate and even sign external trade deals during a transition period. Plus, any customs deal would eventually have to be ratified by all member countries, adding a further barrier.\n\nKarel de Gucht, a former EU commissioner for trade, spoke for many at the Commission when he told BBC Radio 4's Today program that while a transition is in the \"mutual interest\" of both parties, the U.K's proposals for Liam Fox to be negotiating bilateral deals with the U.S., China and others while inside the security of a European customs union were \"very problematic.\"\n\n\"Technically you could do it ... but politically it's very difficult,\" he said. \"We would keep Great Britain warm and in the meantime Great Britain would be undercutting us.\"\n\nUltimately, customs is only one aspect of a broader negotiation, and agreement on a transition would depend on the U.K. agreeing to EU single market rules and ECJ rulings throughout, de Gucht said.\n\nFor now, the Brits are focused on persuading de Gucht's former colleagues to start that discussion.", "id": "9389589",

It confirms the UK will ultimately leave the system but proposes a \"temporary customs union\" to ensure a \"smooth and orderly\" transfer.\n\nThe move marks a victory for those advocating a smooth transition deal rather than a \"cliff edge\" feared by businesses. It is hoped the temporary measure will avert border chaos and calm businesses worried by the effects of leaving the bloc.\n\nThe customs union allows goods to travel across the EU free of tariffs and checks. Remaining part of the system would restrict Britain's ability to sign trade deals with non-EU countries.\n\nBrexit secretary David Davis has also insisted the government would \"negotiate and sign\" agreements with other countries once the EU withdrawal is complete, whatever the nature of any transitional period after 2019.\n\nHowever, former EU trade commissioner Karel De Gucht has warned that Brussels will find Britain's proposals \"very problematic.\"\n\nThe Belgian, who was European commissioner for trade between 2010 and 2014, suggested the EU would accept the status quo on customs for several years only on its terms. They would be Britain abiding by decisions of the European Court of Justice, paying contributions, and not seeking to sign trade deals with third countries.\n\nDe Gucht told the BBC the EU would not concede the benefits of a \"temporary benefits union\" if that meant \"keeping Britain warm\" for preferential agreements with non-EU countries in future years.\n\nDavis told the BBC Britain \"should be able to have an arrangement whereby we can do the negotiation, sign it off, but not enter it into effect.\" He insists the law is on Britain's side, because the \"duty of sincere cooperation\" - the bar on customs union members negotiating other deals - would lapse with EU withdrawal.\n\nThe stance is likely to guarantee confrontation with the EU's chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, once talks resume at the end of the month.\n\nIt is also possible that the EU will refuse to discuss the plan at all, having insisted the UK must first settle its priorities - citizens' rights, the so-called divorce bill and the Northern Ireland border.\n\nDavis has not ruled out Britain making some payments to the EU after 2019 as part of the transitional deal now being sought.\n\nHe insisted, however, that it would not be the \"current \u00a310 billion [US$12.9 billion] a year.\" That appears to rule out the \u00a336 billion, three-year financial settlement thought to be under discussion.\n\nScottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has dismissed the UK government's plan for a post-Brexit customs deal with the EU as a \"daft 'have cake and eat it' approach.\"\n\nIn a tweet, she said the UK should \"commit to staying in the single market and customs union, period.\"", "id": "9285430", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-15", "title": "EU likely to deny Britain's hopes for free trade, former commissioner warns -

They have repeatedly warned against the potential for duties, border controls and regulatory uncertainty on commerce with the UK's biggest market the day after Brexit.\n\nThe road map, though, will likely run into opposition from the EU, given the UK's suggestion it be allowed to line up trade accords with other countries during the interim period, something remaining fully inside the customs union would prevent. The EU has repeatedly warned the UK against cherry picking the advantages of membership and said that it won't be able to enjoy frictionless trade outside its ranks.\n\n\"We've got to have some sort of a transition arrangement for a year or two,\" Brexit Secretary David Davis told BBC Television on Tuesday. The interim agreement \"would be as close as we can to the current arrangements\" while giving Britain the freedom to negotiate new trade deals, he said on BBC Radio 4.\n\nWhile the bloc's 27 other governments have said they are open to a post-Brexit implementation phase, they first want to resolve matters such as citizens' rights and a financial settlement. Divorce talks are set to resume in Brussels on Aug. 28 and the EU's lead negotiator, Michel Barnier, has complained of a lack of progress in the first two rounds.\n\nMr Davis would not be drawn on the cost to Britain of its proposed customs arrangements, and said the cost of the divorce bill was still under discussion.\n\n\"We are putting up some proposals, we're not saying here's the price list to go with these proposals,\" Mr Davis told BBC Radio 4. \"At this stage were not going to commit, there won't be a number by October.\"\n\nThe UK is showing more of its hand after a summer in which members of Prime Minister Theresa May's cabinet forged a consensus around supporting a transitional period following Brexit, although differences remain over how long it should run. Tuesday's blueprint will be seen as a victory for Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond, who has advocated as smooth a departure as possible from the EU.\n\nThe Brexit department said the interim period it imagines would enable both sides of the Channel to establish future customs arrangements to ease border crossings. The UK's public-spending watchdog warned last month of a \"horror show\" if new systems were not in place by the time of Brexit.\n\nFailure to maintain something akin to the status quo could prove costly for the British. The current arrangement saves UK exporters from paying tariffs on goods sold to the EU. Countries outside the region and lacking a free-trade accord with it pay about 10 per cent on shipments of cars alone.\n\nPotentially more expensive are non-tariff barriers. Customs checks at a UK-EU border such as proving the origin of goods could cost \u00a31 billion (S$1.77 billion) a year and snarl traffic in both directions, according to a July report by Oxera, an economic consultancy.\n\nThe customs office calculates that in two years' time there will be 255 million declarations per year based on current levels of trade with the EU, up from 55 million now. Carmakers worry such bureaucracies would hurt their ability to ship vehicles and source inputs in a timely fashion, while retailers risk watching goods perish at borders.\n\n\"Business wants to see as frictionless a customs system as possible,\" Confederation of British Industry Deputy Director-General Josh Hardie said in a statement. \"All efforts should be made to deliver a single-step transition, so that businesses don't have to adapt twice.\" TheCityUK, which represents the finance sector, said the government must conduct \"urgent\" talks to support services, which make up a larger share of the UK economy.\n\nOpen Britain, a group that lobbies for close ties with the EU, accused Ms May's government of \"having our cake and eating it.\" \"It is a fantasy to pretend we can have the freest and most frictionless trade possible with our largest partner when the government remain intent on pulling Britain out of the customs union,\" said Chris Leslie, a lawmaker in the opposition Labour Party.\n\nMr Barnier warned in July that it was \"not possible\" for Britain to enjoy as easy trade with the EU as it does now, pointing to the need to comply with tax returns and test animal products among other obstacles.\n\nA customs union-like relationship would help clear up the matter of how to police the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said earlier this month that a new customs union should be designed to avoid the need for controls on the 500-kilometre frontier which forms the EU's only land link with the UK\n\nThe Irish issue will be detailed more fully by the British on Wednesday when they publish another paper that will express a commitment to keeping a \"seamless and frictionless\" border on the island.\n\nThe UK said ultimately it would like as few as hurdles as possible to trading with the EU. One model it proposed would use technology and agreements to ease the transfer of goods. Another would allow each side to enforce the other's customs rules, negating the need for a border.\n\n\"I make no apologies for being ambitious,\" Mr Davis told BBC Radio 4.", "id": "9242066",

something it cannot do as an EU customs union member.\n\nOnce this period expires, the UK will look to agree either a 'highly streamlined' border with the EU or a new 'partnership' with no customs border at all.\n\nThe government said the interim arrangements would mean businesses would only have to adjust once to the new arrangements.\n\nAll of this will have to be negotiated with the EU - and the two sides have not yet even started discussing trade matters.\n\nKeir Starmer, the Labour Party's shadow Brexit secretary, said the proposals were \"incoherent and inadequate\" and were designed to \"gloss over deep and continuing divisions within the cabinet\".\n\n\"These fantastical and contradictory proposals provide no guidance for negotiators or certainty for businesses,\" he added.", "id": "9252515", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-15", "title": "Brexit: UK proposes 'temporary customs union' | EU Government News", "image": "http://www.paneuropeannetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Brexit-\u00a9-English-PEN.jpg", "extractedDates": [{"imp": true, "textStart": 552, "date": "2017-08-16", "amb": false, "textEnd": 561}, {"textStart": 822, "date": "2019-03-", "amb": false, "textEnd": 832}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-15", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 5, "id": "76", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "Republic of Ireland"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 3, "id": "101", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Ireland", "label": {"eng": "Republic of Ireland"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Northern Ireland"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 3, "id": "85555", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland", "label": {"eng": "Northern Ireland"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "Kingdom of Belgium"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Brussels"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 3, "id": "102303", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brussels", "label": {"eng": "Brussels"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": null, "score": 3, "id": "303048", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "id": "303064", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union"}, {"label": {"eng": "Trade"}, "id": "303410", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade"}, {"label": {"eng": "Minister (government)"}, "id": "303435", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minister_(government)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Government of the United Kingdom"}, "id": "304310", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_the_United_Kingdom"}, {"label": {"eng": "Customs"}, "id": "304875", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customs"}, {"label": {"eng": "International trade"}, "id": "307061", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_trade"}, {"label": {"eng": "Border"}, "id": "308560", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Border"}, {"label": {"eng": "Labour Party (UK)"}, "id": "311306", "score": 1, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Customs union"}, "id": "382637", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customs_union"}, {"label": {"eng": "Keir Starmer"}, "id": "419610", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keir_Starmer"}, {"label": {"eng": "Customs area"}, "id": "436702", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customs_area"}, {"label": {"eng": "European Union Customs Union"}, "id": "470058", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union_Customs_Union"}, {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom withdrawal from the European Union"}, "id": "1268836", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_withdrawal_from_the_European_Union"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 63, "label": "dmoz/Society/Work", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Work"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 140, "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 143, "label": "dmoz/Reference/Education/Colleges and Universities", "uri": "dmoz/Reference/Education/Colleges_and_Universities"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 147, "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Customer Management", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Customer_Management"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 270, "label": "dmoz/Business/International Business and Trade/Services", "uri": "dmoz/Business/International_Business_and_Trade/Services"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 887, "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Labor Movement", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Labor_Movement"}], "time": "10:14:00"}

If this has happened in the U.K., it is the equivalent of the regiment of the army marching down the Whitehall, shooting people on Westminster Bridge, trying to kill the queen and the prime minister, bombing parliament while it was sitting, and taking over the BBC,\" Duncan said.\n\nAccording to the U.K. minister, explaining the events of last year's July 15 in this manner helped people, especially of the U.K., understand what Turkey has experienced.\n\n\"I, and the U.K., have tried to explain to other countries and other ministers the need to understand how traumatic and seismic this experience was in Turkey and it threatened the entire stability and existence of the state,\" Duncan stated.\n\nDuncan also said that the response to those who threatened people and government, and who were guilty of planning, plotting and implementing the coup attempt must be \"tough and firm,\" but, at the same time, actions must be \"fair and properly judicial.\"\n\nFET\u00d6, led by its U.S.-based leader Fetullah G\u00fclen attempted to bring down Turkey's democratically elected government through a coup attempt on July 15, 2016, which was successfully thwarted after millions of people took to the streets and defended democracy. A total of 249 people were killed and nearly 2,200 people were injured during the coup attempt.\n\nDuring the night, G\u00fclen-linked soldiers ran over people with tanks, directly shot at them and bombed many governmental buildings including the Parliament, the Presidential Complex and the headquarters of National Intelligence Organization (M\u0130T).\n\nIstanbul's iconic July 15 Martyrs' Bridge, known as Bosporus Bridge before the coup attempt, saw one of the bloodiest scenes of the night as many were killed on the bridge in addition to scores of wounded unarmed citizens who stood against the coup.\n\nThe terror group is also accused of orchestrating a long-running campaign to infiltrate Turkish state institutions, including the military, judiciary and police.\n\nMeanwhile, EU Minister \u00c7elik commented on reports that claim Adil \u00d6ks\u00fcz, one of the suspected masterminds of the failed coup attempt, was spotted in Germany.\n\n\"The Adil \u00d6ks\u00fcz issue is very clear. We are friends with Germany, allies. We are expecting an attitude [from Germany] adequate to the historical depth of our relations and today's partnership,\" \u00c7elik said, adding that no friends of Turkey's can harbor a killer.\n\n\u00c7elik also responded to German Chancellor Angela Merkel's refusal to enter into talks with Ankara on upgrading the existing Customs Union.\n\nAccording to \u00c7elik, bilateral setbacks with some particular EU member states may exist, but they should not harm Turkey-EU relations in any way.\n\n\"If this is the case, the EU will stop being a political union, and will turn into a federal union. This is an issue related to the recent tension between Germany and Turkey. The EU institutions should not allow Germany to make it an EU issue,\" \u00c7elik added.\n\nThe EU minister also said that upgrading the Customs Union was not a \"one-sided desire,\" adding that the offer initially came from the EU itself.\n\n\"[Upgrading Customs Union] is a win-win situation. Look at the impact analysis reports published by the EU, both Turkey and the EU will benefit from upgrading the Customs Union. The EU is acting as if upgrading the Customs Union was a favor, this is extremely wrong. There is no rush, and no one-sided desire,\" \u00c7elik said.\n\nRelations between Turkey and Germany, home to three million ethnic Turks, have been badly strained, particularly since the failed coup attempt a year ago against Turkey's democratically elected government by the G\u00fclenist Terror Group (FET\u00d6).

Prime Minister Theresa May wants an accord before leaving.\n\n\"We've been crystal clear that issues around our withdrawal and our future partnership are inextricably linked, and the negotiations so far have reinforced that view,\" the Department for Exiting the EU said in the statement released on Sunday. \"These papers show we are ready to broaden out the negotiations.\"\n\nA series of broader \"future partnership\" papers will also be published in the run-up to the October negotiating session. The first of these will set out proposals for a new customs agreement, it said.\n\nEU leaders will meet in Brussels on 19 October, then again on 14 December.

He estimated to the BBC \"something like two years, maybe a bit shorter\", and said it would end by 2022 at the latest.\n\nThe paper also sets out two alternatives for a permanent customs arrangement with the EU. It does not say which the government prefers, calling them \"two broad approaches the UK could adopt\" depending on negotiations with the EU.\n\nUnder one, a \"highly streamlined customs arrangement\", the UK and EU would use \"technology-based solutions\" to make it easier for businesses to satisfy new requirements and procedures when moving goods across the border.\n\nUnder the other, the UK would sign a \"new customs partnership\" with the EU that would eliminate the need for a border - for example mirroring EU requirements for imports from the rest of the world where the final destination is the EU.\n\nInternational Trade Secretary Dr Liam Fox said leaving the customs union would allow Britain to generate \"fully independent trade policy\".\n\n\"We will seek a new customs arrangement that ensures that trade between the UK and the EU remains as frictionless as possible and allows us to forge new trade relationships with our partners in Europe and around the world,\" he said.\n\nA European Commission spokesman they would study the UK position paper ahead of the next round of negotiations at the end of August.\n\nHowever they do not want to start talking about customs plans until they have made more progress on talks over the \"divorce bill\" - an agreement on the Brexit financial settlement as well as issues including the rights of EU citizens in the UK.\n\n\"We take note of the UK's request for an implementing period and its preferences as regards the future relationship, but we will only address them once we have made sufficient progress on the terms of the orderly withdrawal,\" the spokesman said.\n\n\"An agreement on a future relationship between the EU and the UK can only be finalised once the UK has become a third country... 'frictionless trade' is not possible outside the single market and customs union.\"\n\nThe EU is also working on a position paper on the customs union.\n\nMr Davis said during the transition period Britain would be able to negotiation new trade deals.\n\n\"We should be able to have an arrangement where we can do the negotiations, sign it off, but not enter into effect,\" he said.\n\nBut former European commissioner for trade Karel de Gucht told the BBC he doubted the EU would agree to a temporary customs union if it also meant Britain could start working on other trade deals.\n\nOtherwise the EU would effectively be agreeing to help the UK undercut EU tariffs, he said.\n\nInstead, he predicted, the EU would want the UK to stay in the customs union on its own terms: paying contributions to the EU budget and not seeking to sign other trade deals.\n\n\"It's a quagmire, you know,\" he said.\n\nIreland's EU commissioner Phil Hogan told the Financial Times that Dublin could block a customs deal unless the problem of the Northern Ireland border was satisfactorily solved.\n\n\"There's a high level of delusion in London at the moment about what is required to be done,\" Mr Hogan said.\n\nThe government is expected to publish its plan for the border on Wednesday.\n\nThe customs plan is being seen as a concession towards a 'soft Brexit' that has been sought by companies and other groups worried about the impact of a rushed exit from Europe.\n\nThe Federation of Small Businesses said it \"would give small businesses the time they need to prepare for new customs arrangements, which is very welcome\".\n\nBut the official Leave campaign called it a \"Brexit betrayal\", saying it was a \"stitch-up to delay global trade for years\".\n\n\"When 17.4 million voted Leave last year we wanted to control our destiny as a trading nation,\" the Leave.EU Twitter account said. \"This new plan is a disgrace!\"\n\nWhen 17.4m voted Leave last year we wanted to control our destiny as a trading nation.

UK ministers have set out plans for an \"ambitious new customs arrangement\" with the EU after the UK leaves.\n\nThis could include a \"temporary customs union\" after March 2019 to prevent border problems during the process. However, the first minister said the UK \"should commit to staying in the single market and customs union, period\".\n\nThe customs arrangements document is the first in a series of papers to be published by the Westminster government on key negotiation issues. Businesses had called for clarity since the UK announced it was leaving the EU's tariff-free trading area.\n\nMinisters said the plans would mean the \"freest and most frictionless possible trade\" with the rest of Europe.\n\nThe newly-published paper says the UK could ask Brussels to establish a \"temporary customs union\" after it leaves the EU in March 2019. During this period it would also expect to be able to negotiate its own international trade deals, which it cannot currently do as a customs union member.\n\nOnce any temporary arrangement expired, the paper says the UK would look to agree either a \"highly streamlined\" border with the EU or a new \"partnership\" with no customs border at all.\n\nThe plan has drawn a mixed response, with Labor's shadow Brexit secretary Keir Starmer calling it \"incoherent and inadequate\" and \"fantastical and contradictory\". However, the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) said it was \"encouraging\", and the Institute of Directors said it was \"hugely positive step\".\n\nGuy Verhofstadt, the European Parliament's Brexit negotiator, tweeted that the idea of \"invisible borders\" was \"a fantasy\".\n\nMs Sturgeon posted an initial reaction to the customs union plan on Twitter, saying: \"Seems UK gov is back to its daft 'have cake and eat it' approach to Brexit. They should commit to staying in single market and customs union, period.\"\n\nSpeaking in Montrose, where the Scottish government's cabinet held a meeting prior to a public discussion event, the SNP leader said that the plan \"would almost be laughable\" if the issues involved were not so serious.\n\nShe said: \"You've got the UK government appearing to say that they don't want to say in 'the' customs union, but they want to stay in 'a' customs union, which would be pretty much identical to the European customs union that we're in already. It's nonsensical and ridiculous.\n\n\"I think it increasingly makes the UK government look like a bit of a laughing stock.\n\n\"I wish we weren't leaving the EU, but if the UK is leaving the EU then the common sense thing to do is to stay in the single market and to stay in the customs union. Because that will mean we can continue to export goods and services and continue to travel freely like we can today\".", "id": "9463638", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-16", "title": "UK post-Brexit

The EU will have to decide whether it would accept such an arrangement.\n\nEven British businesses, which welcomed the clarity, said they needed more detail, and the auto industry urged the government to ensure that the country retained full participation in the EU's single market during a transition.\n\nBritain said on Tuesday it would seek a \"temporary customs union\" with the European Union after Brexit, in an opening gambit for trade negotiations that received a cool response from Brussels.\n\nLabour's shadow Brexit Secretary Sir Keir Starmer branded the customs proposals \"incoherent and inadequate\" and \"designed to gloss over deep and continuing divisions within the Cabinet\".\n\nThe second approach embraces a new customs partnership with the EU by aligning the UK's approach to the customs border in a way that removes the need for a UK-EU customs border.\n\nOn Tuesday, UK civil service officials refused to say whether new deals could be signed during this interim phase, and stressed that implementation was impossible until after the UK moved to its final customs arrangement.\n\nFILE - A Thursday July 20, 2017 file photo of the European Union chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier gesturing as he addresses the media after a week of negotiations at European Union headquarters in Brussels.

"The British government will propose a new interim UK-EU customs union to help prevent chaos at borders after Brexit.\n\nThe proposal is contained in the first of a series of 'future partnership papers' to be published today.\n\nThe paper repeats the aim of avoiding a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic.\n\nWhile confirming the UK's exit from the EU's customs union after Brexit, the paper proposes a \"temporary customs union between the UK and the EU\" as a \"possible approach\" to getting a \"smooth and orderly\" transfer to a post-Brexit customs regime.\n\nAt the moment, all goods and parts travel across the EU free of both tariffs and checks as part of the bloc's customs union.\n\nRemaining in the EU's customs union would restrict Britain's ability to sign independent trade deals with non-EU countries, with a common external tariff applied outside the zone.\n\nTurkey already has its own customs union with the EU for industrialised goods, which enables participation in complex manufacturing supply chains.\n\nSpeaking to Sky News last month, Britain's International Trade Secretary Liam Fox said there was a difference between \"the\" customs union and \"a\" customs union - but cautioned against using Turkey as a model.\n\nThe British government said the interim customs arrangements will be \"time-limited\" to allow for businesses to adapt to a post-Brexit system.\n\nNo actual timeframe has been mentioned, although some Cabinet ministers have suggested it will have to expire before the next scheduled general election in 2022.\n\nThe EU will have to agree to any interim arrangement and especially to the establishment of a temporary customs union.\n\nThe Labour party's shadow Brexit Secretary Sir Keir Starmer branded the customs proposals \"incoherent and inadequate\" and \"designed to gloss over deep and continuing divisions within the Cabinet.\"\n\nIt is not clear whether the EU will respond to the paper, having agreed with the UK to first deal with issues of the so-called Brexit bill, Ireland and citizens' rights during negotiations before moving on to the future EU-UK relationship.\n\nOutlining a position on customs arrangements does, however, help bring some clarity to the situation regarding the border in Ireland.\n\nA further Government paper on the border issue will be published on Wednesday.", "id": "9216630", "details":

No one has bothered to tell him that this Schrodinger's Customs Union would never practically be able to work\n\nWhat a comedown. A year on from the Brexit referendum and we're not talking about new exciting free trade deals. We're not contemplating national rejuvenation. Happy chat of sunlit uplands has dried up.\n\nInstead we find ourselves poring over the mind-numbing details of customs arrangements. Worse, we're not discussing making customs better. We're talking solely about mitigating damage.\n\nBut first let's recap where we are today. Being in the EU's customs union means there are zero bureaucratic barriers on UK goods exports to Europe. A business in Worthing can send a product to Warsaw as easily as it can to Wolverhampton.\n\nBrexit Secretary: UK wants temporary EU customs deal\n\nIf we leave the customs union, that all changes. Goods crossing the UK border would have to pay tariffs and Value Added Tax, and prove compliance with local EU standards. All shipments would have to be recorded and checked.\n\nThis will significantly increase the cost of UK trade with Europe - easily our biggest trading partner - and considerably slow down the movement of goods. That is why trading UK businesses are terrified about the prospect, particularly the likes of car manufacturers which have deeply integrated Continental supply chains.\n\nYet Theresa May's Government still insists we must leave the customs union in 2019, following their own hardline interpretation of the Brexit referendum result. But how?\n\nIn a new position paper, the Government moots two possible destinations for the UK outside the EU customs union. The first is that future, unspecified, \"technology-based solutions\" will allow for \"streamlined\" trade between Britain and the UK, despite all the bureaucratic requirements listed above.\n\nThe second is that the UK and EU can essentially create a customs union with the EU that is simultaneously not a customs union (as we understand it, at least). This Schrodinger's Cat scenario will allow the UK to sign new bilateral tariff-cutting trade deals with other countries while also maintaining the integrity of the borders of the EU's customs union. All of this can be politely summed up as \"magical unrealism\".\n\nIn pictures: European Parliament Brexit discussions 12 show all In pictures: European Parliament Brexit discussions 1/12\n\nEuropean commission member in charge of Brexit negotiations with Britain, French Michel Barnier listens at the President of the European Commission Jean-Claude Juncker speaking at the European Parliament in Strasbourg\n\nGetty Images\n\n2/12\n\nFrank-Walter Steinmeier, President of the Federal Republic of Germany, delivers his speech at the European Parliament in Strasbourg\n\nEPA\n\n3/12\n\nEuropean Union's chief Brexit negotiator Guy Verhofstadt, President of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe (ALDE), addresses the European Parliament during a debate on Brexit priorities and the upcomming talks on the UK's withdrawal from the EU\n\nReuters\n\n4/12\n\nMichel Barnier, European Chief Negotiator for Brexit reacts during a meeting at the European Parliament in Strasbourg\n\nEPA\n\n5/12\n\nMember of the European Parliament and former leader of the anti-EU UK Independence Party (UKIP) Nigel Farage wears socks with Union Jack flag at the European Parliament in Strasbourg\n\nGetty Images\n\n6/12\n\nNigel Farage, United Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP) member and MEP, addresses the European Parliament during a debate on Brexit priorities and the upcoming talks on the UK's withdrawal from the EU\n\nReuters\n\n7/12\n\nEuropean commission member in charge of Brexit negotiations with Britain, French Michel Barnier gestures during speeches at the European Parliament in Strasbourg\n\nGetty\n\n8/12\n\nThe President of the European Commission Jean-Claude Juncker (L) speaks with European commission member in charge of Brexit negotiations with Britain, French Michel Barnier at the European Parliament in Strasbourg\n\nGetty\n\n9/12\n\nEuropean Union's chief Brexit negotiator Guy Verhofstadt, President of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe (ALDE), addresses the European Parliament during a debate on Brexit priorities and the upcomming talks on the UK's withdrawal from the EU\n\nReuters\n\n10/12\n\nGetty\n\n11/12\n\nGerman president Frank-Walter Steinmeier delivers a speech during a plenary session at the European Parliament in Strasbourg\n\nGetty Images\n\n12/12\n\nThe European Parliament in Strasbourg, eastern France\n\nGetty Images\n\nYet ministers have not retreated entirely into fantasy. They have, at least, grasped that their magical unrealism will not be ready by 2019. So they have bowed to an \"interim...close association\" with the EU customs union, while the magical unrealism is cooked up.\n\nThey want to quit the EU customs union in 2019 but to then instantly enter a new one for a temporary period of time. The objective is to reassure all UK firms that there will be no customs cliff-edge.\n\nWhy not simply stay in the existing customs union for an interim period rather than try to create a new one? Because, for legal reasons, that would preclude the Trade Secretary, Liam Fox, from being able to negotiate new trade deals with the likes of America and New Zealand - and for some reason giving Fox something to do has also been judged by the Government to be an inviolable imperative stemming from the referendum result.\n\nIt is unknown whether the EU would accept this interim customs proposal, but there are good reasons to suspect they will not. And, even if they did, the bigger problem is that a temporary new customs union in 2019 still isn't enough to avoid a cliff-edge for UK firms.\n\nEven if the EU agrees to the transition and the UK and EU successfully recreate a new temporary union, there will still be major trade frictions. Turkey has a customs union with the EU but Turkish imports still have to be checked at the border to ensure compliance with EU standards. There are long queues of lorries at the Turkish-Bulgarian border.\n\nCan these impediments be minimised? The UK could agree to a no-tariff arrangement for the transition. The UK Trade Policy Observatory at Sussex says it's possible that some standards checks could be performed at factories and that VAT charges could be levied inside the border too.\n\nSwitzerland and Norway, which are both outside the EU customs union, have launched a \"registered exporters\" scheme and allow for a degree of self-certification by firms. These fixes could marginally reduce administrative burdens for UK exporters.\n\nYet the crucial point is that agreeing in principle to a temporary tariff-free customs union is actually the simple part. Negotiating the terms of the temporary transition will be almost as difficult and politically fraught as settling on a permanent new arrangement.\n\nHow, for instance, will the interim scheme be policed? The Government's position paper is entirely silent on such details. David Davis says there is \"constructive ambiguity\" in the Government's position. Sadly, it is more likely they are simply making it up as they go along.\n\nEU set to block UK's temporary customs union plea to stop Brexit border chaos, warns former commissioner\n\nYet the clock is ticking. There are now just 14 months before EU national parliaments will need to see any interim plan to vote on by the March 2019 Brexit deadline.\n\nBrexiteers are sensing the day of accountability for their project approaching. The hardline backbencher Bernard Jenkin gave a BBC interview earlier this week in which he castigated not ministerial incompetence, nor his own side's undeliverable pledges, for the looming customs fiasco, but EU vindictiveness and unreasonableness.\n\nIt is a line we can expect to hear much more of as the edifice of the Brexiteers' promises - on customs and everything else - crumbles in the coming months. The self-preservation blame game has begun.\n\nMore about: Brexit Customs Union transition deal Reuse content", "id": "9305628", "details": {"liCnt": 20}, "date": "2017-08-15", "title": "Sadly, it's

All efforts should be made to deliver a single-step transition, so that businesses don't have to adapt twice.\"\n\nAdam Marshall, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce, said most businesses were more concerned about future customs arrangements with the EU than future trade deals.\n\nHe added: \"At this stage, it is critically important to keep a number of different options open in order to achieve this goal.\n\n\"While we await the detail of the government's customs position paper, and the reactions of EU negotiators, business is clear that a smooth transition to new arrangements is needed, and multiple adjustment costs must be avoided.\n\n\"In the long term, we should aim to avoid imports and exports being subjected to two sets of customs checks, and to ensuring the smoothest possible future trade relationship between the UK and EU.\"\n\nRead More Top stories", "id": "9221059", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-15", "title": "Transitional plans to ease trade

allow Irish citizens to work freely in the UK, and British citizens would work freely in Ireland.\n\nCitizens of other EU countries could access the UK over the Irish Border but would not be able to work in Britain without a work permit.\n\nThe idea is being carefully studied by Irish officials but does create a Border which Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has said he does not want.\n\nThe UK's Brexit department said it will reveal more details of its favoured customs arrangement and a proposal on how to resolve the difficulties of a non-physical Border between Ireland and Northern Ireland.\n\n\"We've been crystal clear that issues around our withdrawal and our future partnership are inextricably linked,\" a source in Britain's Brexit department said.\n\nBritain appears on track for a so-called 'hard Brexit' after chancellor Philip Hammond and International Trade Secretary Liam Fox wrote a joint article saying the UK would not be staying in the EU by a \"back door\".\n\n\"We are both clear that during this period the UK will be outside the customs union and will be a 'third country', not a party to EU treaties,\" they said.\n\nThe contribution of Mr Hammond is seen as significant as he is believed to favour a soft Brexit that would have safeguards in place for businesses.\n\nAlong with a new paper on Irish issues, the UK government is preparing to release papers to address \"continuity in the availability of goods for the EU and the UK\" and \"confidentiality and access to official documents\".\n\nIt then wants the EU to move forward to the next phase of the Brexit negotiations which will deal with the future relationship been the UK and member states.\n\n\"We need to get on with negotiating the bigger issues around our future partnership to ensure we get a deal that delivers a strong UK and EU,\" Brexit Minister David Davis said in a statement.\n\nBrussels has insisted that progress must be made on divorce arrangements first, including how much the UK will pay before leaving.\n\nThe EU's chief negotiator Michel Barnier is due to meet Mr Davis for a new round of negotiations at the end of August.\n\nAmid talks of in-fighting within Mrs May's cabinet, pro-Brexit Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson welcomed the joint article from Mr Hammond and Mr Fox, saying it was the \"right way forward\".", "id": "9004653", "details": {}, "date":

He estimated to the BBC \"something like two years, maybe a bit shorter\", and said it would end by 2022 at the latest.\n\nThe paper also sets out two alternatives for a permanent customs arrangement with the EU. It does not say which the government prefers, calling them \"two broad approaches the UK could adopt\" depending on negotiations with the EU.\n\nUnder one, a \"highly streamlined customs arrangement\", the UK and EU would use \"technology-based solutions\" to make it easier for businesses to satisfy new requirements and procedures when moving goods across the border.\n\nUnder the other, the UK would sign a \"new customs partnership\" with the EU that would eliminate the need for a border - for example mirroring EU requirements for imports from the rest of the world where the final destination is the EU.\n\nInternational Trade Secretary Dr Liam Fox said leaving the customs union would allow Britain to generate \"fully independent trade policy\".\n\n\"We will seek a new customs arrangement that ensures that trade between the UK and the EU remains as frictionless as possible and allows us to forge new trade relationships with our partners in Europe and around the world,\" he said.\n\nA European Commission spokesman they would study the UK position paper ahead of the next round of negotiations at the end of August.\n\nHowever they do not want to start talking about customs plans until they have made more progress on talks over the \"divorce bill\" - an agreement on the Brexit financial settlement as well as issues including the rights of EU citizens in the UK.\n\n\"We take note of the UK's request for an implementing period and its preferences as regards the future relationship, but we will only address them once we have made sufficient progress on the terms of the orderly withdrawal,\" the spokesman said.\n\n\"An agreement on a future relationship between the EU and the UK can only be finalised once the UK has become a third country... 'frictionless trade' is not possible outside the single market and customs union.\"\n\nThe EU is also working on a position paper on the customs union.\n\nMr Davis said during the transition period Britain would be able to negotiation new trade deals.\n\n\"We should be able to have an arrangement where we can do the negotiations, sign it off, but not enter into effect,\" he said.\n\nBut former European commissioner for trade Karel de Gucht told the BBC he doubted the EU would agree to a temporary customs union if it also meant Britain could start working on other trade deals.\n\nOtherwise the EU would effectively be agreeing to help the UK undercut EU tariffs, he said.\n\nInstead, he predicted, the EU would want the UK to stay in the customs union on its own terms: paying contributions to the EU budget and not seeking to sign other trade deals.\n\n\"It's a quagmire, you know,\" he said.\n\nIreland's EU commissioner Phil Hogan told the Financial Times that Dublin could block a customs deal unless the problem of the Northern Ireland border was satisfactorily solved.\n\n\"There's a high level of delusion in London at the moment about what is required to be done,\" Mr Hogan said.\n\nThe government is expected to publish its plan for the border on Wednesday.\n\nThe customs plan is being seen as a concession towards a 'soft Brexit' that has been sought by companies and other groups worried about the impact of a rushed exit from Europe.\n\nThe Federation of Small Businesses said it \"would give small businesses the time they need to prepare for new customs arrangements, which is very welcome\".\n\nBut the official Leave campaign called it a \"Brexit betrayal\", saying it was a \"stitch-up to delay global trade for years\".\n\n\"When 17.4 million voted Leave last year we wanted to control our destiny as a trading nation,\" the Leave.EU Twitter account said. \"This new plan is a disgrace!\"\n\nWhen 17.4m voted Leave last year we wanted to control our destiny as a trading nation.

It is now official government policy.\"\n\nLabour's Shadow Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union Keir Starmer said the government's plans were \"incoherent and inadequate proposals designed to gloss over deep and continuing divisions within the cabinet\".\n\nAnd anti-Brexit Labour MP Chris Leslie told Politico the government had returned \"to the territory of wanting to have their cake and eat it\".\n\n\"It is a fantasy to pretend we can have the freest and most frictionless trade possible with our largest partner when the government remain intent on pulling Britain out of the customs union,\" he said.\n\n\"This is wishful thinking of the highest order.\"", "id": "9277661", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-15", "title": "UK reveals not one, but two options for

It was also accompanied by criticisms from the EU's chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, who claimed the UK needs to provide further \"clarification\" on issues such as its financial obligations before Brexit talks can progress.\n\nOfficials in Brussels have made it clear that it is unwilling to begin negotiating a new trade relationship with the UK until an agreement is reached on the future rights of EU nationals, and the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic.\n\nHowever, ministers will set out their ambitions for a new customs arrangement with the EU in a position paper today, including details of an 'interim\" period which could include a \"temporary customs union\".\n\n\"This time-limited period of implementation will provide certainty for businesses in the UK and the EU and would ensure that businesses only have to adjust once to a new customs relationship,\" a spokesman said.\n\n\"During this interim period, which will be negotiated with Brussels, Britain will look to negotiate bold new trade relationships around the world.\"\n\nThe Government will also set out its solutions to avoid a hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland. The Irish premier Leo Varadkar has stressed he does not want to see an \"economic barrier\" between the two nations, while Theresa May has pledged there will be \"no return to the borders of the past\".\n\nHowever, it is widely expected that the Government will stick with plans to use smart technology and spot checks to monitor the flow of goods between the two countries after 2019. The Irish foreign minister Simon Coveney is said to have expressed concerns about this approach.\n\nThe position papers come as a campaign by Labour supporters to get the party to commit to the continuation of free movement gains momentum, with members drawing up a motion to debate at party conference in the autumn.\n\nThe pro-Brexit campaign group Leave.EU has also ramped up its efforts to encourage voters to de-select Philip Hammond and Amber Rudd, with chairman Arron Banks, accusing them of \"meddling\" in the Brexit process.", "id": "9176662", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-14",

It also said it had looked at customs agreements between other countries but was not seeking to replicate another country's model.\n\nBritain said such a system would:\n\n- ensure businesses declare goods for import or export and provide the revenue and customs department with documentation including customs declarations, safety and security information\n\n- enable the government to verify a declaration has been made and ensure any duties have been paid\n\n- require new systems to be put in place on both the UK and EU sides, as well as Britain making improvements to its domestic regime\n\n- reduce the risk of delays at ports by using technology such as pre-arrival notification of consignments, linked to customs declarations and vehicle registration numbers, so vehicles do not need to stop at the border\n\n- replicate existing cooperation with the EU on data sharing and customs cooperation to reduce security risks and improve targeting of inspections\n\n- reduce the time and cost of complying with customs procedures through measures such as self-assessment, allowing traders to calculate their own customs duties and speeding up authorisation through greater automation\n\n- involve looking to agree simplified systems for moving goods across borders including:\n\na) a continued waiver from the requirement to submit entry and exit declarations for goods moving between UK and EU\n\nb) membership of the Common Transit Convention, meaning goods could travel from the UK through the EU to the rest of the world, and vice versa, without paying EU duties\n\n2) \"A NEW CUSTOMS PARTNERSHIP WITH THE EU\"\n\nThis would see Britain align its approach to customs with the EU in a way that removed the need for a UK-EU customs border. One such option would be for Britain to mirror the EU's requirements for imports from the rest of the world where the final destination is the EU.\n\nThe government acknowledged this was an untested approach which would take time to implement.\n\nBritain said that under such a system:\n\n- it would need to apply the same tariffs as the EU and the same treatment on rules of origin for goods arriving in the UK before heading on to the EU\n\n- mirroring the EU's customs approach at its external border would ensure all goods entering the bloc via the UK have paid the correct EU duties\n\n- the need to introduce customs procedures between Britain and the EU would be removed, so goods moving between the two would be treated as they are now for customs purposes\n\n- Britain could apply its own tariffs and trade policy to UK exports and imports from other countries\n\n- Britain would require a \"robust enforcement mechanism\" to ensure goods that do not comply with EU trade policy stay in Britain\n\nNEW LEGISLATION\n\nAs rules governing customs mostly come under EU law, the government said Britain would introduce new domestic legislation via a customs bill later this year.\n\nThis legislation would seek to ensure British law remains as consistent as possible with EU law, but will also give the government powers to operate standalone customs, tax and excise systems in the event Britain and the EU fail to reach a deal.\n\nNO DEAL SCENARIO\n\nBritain said that while it hoped to reach a negotiated agreement with the EU, it was also looking at ways to mitigate the impact of not reaching a deal. It said that it expected a \"no deal\" scenario would mean:\n\n- Britain would treat trade with the EU as it currently treats trade with non-EU countries and apply customs duties and import tax on EU imports\n\n- Britain would require traders to be registered, with those exporting to the EU needing to submit export declarations and some goods may need export licences\n\n- The EU would apply the same customs rules and tax to imports from Britain that it applies to non-EU countries\n\n(Reporting by Kylie MacLellan;

negotiations.\"\n\nMinisters have been warned about the strain ports could be put under if they face a big increase in bureaucracy for dealing with goods entering and leaving the country.\n\nThe proposals for new customs arrangements to allow trade with the EU are being outlined in the first of a series of \"future partnership papers\" being released by the Government.\n\nAlthough negotiations on a new system are not scheduled to start for some time, the Government said setting out its aims showed the UK's \"desire to ensure our exit from the EU is smooth, orderly and successful\".\n\nOne option being put forward by Mr Davis for new arrangements would see the UK manage a new customs border with administration streamlined to the \"fullest extent possible\".\n\nThe Brexit Secretary will also float plans for a customs partnership with the EU that would negate the need for a customs border between the UK and the rest of the bloc.\n\nA position paper on the fraught issue of the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic will be published on Wednesday, ahead of the third round of Brexit negotiations in Brussels at the end of the month.\n\nSir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, called the proposals \"incoherent and inadequate\" in response to pleas for certainty from British businesses.\n\n\"Instead, the Cabinet remain split on key issues and cannot decide between two very different but equally unachievable options,\" he said.\n\n\"The first proposal suggests 'a new customs border with the EU' could be introduced without disrupting trade; the second suggests a new borderless customs partnership could somehow be agreed while Britain also signs external trade deals.\n\n\"These fantastical and contradictory proposals provide no guidance for negotiators or certainty for businesses.\n\n\"The proposals also make it less likely that necessary transitional arrangements will be in place by March 2019.\"\n\nIt comes after Chancellor Philip Hammond and International Trade Secretary Liam Fox said the UK would pull out of both the single market and the customs union in 2019.\n\nLabour former shadow chancellor Chris Leslie, a leading supporter of the Open Britain campaign group, said: \"It looks like the new unified position in the Cabinet is to return the Government to the territory of wanting to have their cake and eat it.\n\n\"Ministers claim we can leave the customs union and yet still achieve 'the most frictionless customs agreement anywhere in the world' but with absolutely no detail about how such a miraculous new system will be achieved.\n\n\"It is a fantasy to pretend we can have the freest and most frictionless trade possible with our largest partner when the Government remain intent on pulling Britain out of the customs union.\"\n\nTom Brake, the Liberal Democrats Brexit spokesman, said the Government's \"extreme Brexit will end up leaving Britain poorer\".\n\nHe added: \"Even if they were agreed to by the EU, these proposals will only delay the economic pain caused by leaving the customs union.\n\n\"We still face the prospect of more red tape for businesses, longer queues at our borders and higher prices for consumers once the transition comes to an end.\"", "id": "9214255", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-15", "title": "Britain could keep EU customs arrangements for interim period,

Wait and see.\"\n\nMr Davis also told ITV's Good Morning Britain: \"We sell them, the Europeans, about 230 billion euro of goods and services a year.\n\n\"They sell us 290 billion euro. So there are a lot of things there.\"\n\nAsked whether Britain would have to pay to stay in the customs union, he said: \"Well, I don't think ... well, what happens in that sort of interim period you will have to leave me to negotiate, I'm afraid, how we do it, but the aim is to bring to an end these huge \u00a310 billion-a-year payments, bring that to an end now.\n\n\"We are still haggling with them over what we may owe them in the short term but we are going to bring the overall thing to an end.\n\n\"This is something that is in both sides' interest.\"\n\nSecuring future trade deals outside the EU could also be on the cards under the new plans, Mr Davis said.\n\nHe told Today: \"There's a legal position here.\n\n\"The reason we can't sign now is because of something called the duty of sincere cooperation, it's written into the treaty, and it's not related to the customs union, it's related to the overall treaty.\n\n\"Once in 2019 when we leave, that legal duty goes away.\n\n\"Now we will still be responsible around it but our view is there is no legal basis for saying we can't do it, we are talking about it to other countries, we are just not signing.\"\n\nThe proposals for new customs arrangements to allow trade with the EU are being outlined in the first of a series of \"future partnership papers\" being released by the Government.\n\nOne option being put forward by Mr Davis for new arrangements would see the UK manage a new customs border with administration streamlined to the \"fullest extent possible\".\n\nThe Brexit Secretary will also float plans for a customs partnership with the EU which would negate the need for a customs border between the UK and the rest of the bloc.\n\nHe said the negotiations were going \"fine\" and EU leaders were less hostile than they had been previously.\n\nMr Davis told ITV: \"The simple truth is we want to come out of this better but they (the Europeans) want to come out of it better too.\n\n\"There was a terror early on that we would be the first of many countries breaking off.\n\n\"After the victory of (President Emmanuel) Macron in France, that terror is reduced.\n\n\"They are no longer quite so afraid so the punishment battalion side is now reducing.\"\n\nA European Commission spokesman said: \"We will now study the UK position paper on customs carefully in the light of the European Council guidelines and the council's negotiating directives.\n\n\"The next negotiation round will start in the week of 28 August.\n\n\"We take note of the UK's request for an implementing period and its preferences as regards the future relationship, but we will only address them once we have made sufficient progress on the terms of the orderly withdrawal.\n\n\"An agreement on a future relationship between the EU and the UK can only be finalised once the UK has become a third country.\n\n\"As Michel Barnier has said on several occasions, 'frictionless trade' is not possible outside the Single Market and Customs Union.\"\n\nThe EU is also working on a position paper on the customs union, following a tranche of documents published before the summer on issues such as citizens' rights and nuclear

They will rightly want to stop dodgy chicken and other products coming in via the UK.\n\n\"The bottom line is we're either in the customs union or not - you can't be half pregnant.\n\n\"The only way to prevent barriers to trade with the EU is to stay in the Customs Union and Single Market.\"\n\nHis comments echoed those of Labour's former Shadow Chancellor Chris Leslie, who branded the paper's suggestions as \"wishful thinking of the highest order\".\n\nThe Open Britain supporter said: \"It looks like the new unified position in the Cabinet is to return the Government to the territory of wanting to have their cake and eat it.\n\n\"Ministers claim we can leave the Customs Union and yet still achieve 'the most frictionless customs agreement anywhere in the world' but with absolutely no detail about how such a miraculous new system will be achieved.\n\n\"It is a fantasy to pretend we can have the freest and most frictionless trade possible with our largest partner when the Government remain intent on pulling Britain out of the Customs Union.\"\n\nLeading business groups welcomed the report for providing much needed clarity in an area of concern for companies across the UK.\n\nJosh Hardie, CBI Deputy Director-General, said: \"It's encouraging to see that these papers propose a time-limited interim period and a customs system that is as barrier-free as possible.\n\n\"We at the CBI have always been clear that new ideas on crucial issues like this should be brought to the table quickly.\n\n\"But the clock is ticking and what matters now is giving companies the confidence to continue investing as quickly as possible.\"\n\nHardie added: \"To secure frictionless trade, negotiations on regulation, tariff and non-tariff barriers will have to take place.

In effect it would give negotiators a breathing space to put together the new system that under which Britain trades with its European neighbours.\n\nBut what is the customs union and why is it so important?\n\nCustoms union\n\nThe customs union is the arrangement under which goods can be traded within the EU without tariffs, while goods imported from outside the EU face tariff barriers that are common to all member states.\n\nIt's different to the single market in that only covers trade in goods, not movement of people, capital or services. It dates back to 1958 and is what Britain signed up to when we joined the then EEC back in 1973. It also differs in that it only covers tariffs, not non-tariff barriers such as standards and regulations, which businesses say are just as important as tariffs in determining where they export to.\n\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8Cancel Play now New trade deals\n\nThe Government also says it hopes to start negotiating new trade deals with non-EU nations while the temporary arrangements are in place. This could cause problems, because under the EU treaty members are not allowed to negotiate trade deals with third parties - only the EU can do that.\n\nBut the Government argues that the prohibition relates to signatories of the EU treaty, and once Britain has left the EU it is no longer bound by its provisions, even if it is still within the customs union for a limited time.\n\nThe Government will argue that it should be able to start talking with other states during the temporary arrangements so long as nothing is signed or implemented until the period is over. In practice the length of time it takes to negotiate trade deals means any new deals are unlikely to be finalised before Britain leaves the customs union.\n\nNew trading arrangements with the EU\n\nThe purpose behind our temporary membership of the customs union after Brexit would be to allow extra time to negotiate our new trading arrangement with our former EU partners. This means deciding what tariffs if any will apply on goods imported from and exported to the EU, as well as discussing how passing through customs can be made as quick and easy as possible.\n\nThere's also the thorny question of non-tariff barriers - those differences in standards and regulations that the single market is designed to remove. The EU will be concerned at the impact of diverging standards and regulations in Britain and will probably seek to block them at least during the temporary customs union phase, and reduce their impact afterwards.\n\nThe timescale\n\nMany people think it will be impossible to conclude a deal with the EU before the March 2019 deadline for Britain's departure - especially as the EU is insisting that the details of Britain's departure are thrashed out before its future relationship with the union is discussed.\n\nThis is why the Government has raised the idea of temporary membership of the customs union in the two or three years immediately after 2019. In the absence of a new trade deal - which most people agree could take years to negotiate - this would at least avoid the 'cliff edge' that economists and business people fear as British companies suddenly find themselves outside the tariff wall of the Customs Union.\n\nSingle market\n\nThe single market is the cornerstone of what the EU is all about. Under its rules people, goods, capital and services are allowed to move as freely as possible between the 28 member states.\n\nMargaret Thatcher signed Britain up to the single market when she put her name to the Single European Act back in 1986. The idea was to boost economic growth by removing the remaining barriers to trade that still existed within the European Economic Community (EEC) that Britain joined in 1973.\n\nThe single market is Britain's biggest trading partner, accounting for 45% of UK exports and 50% of imports. Membership of the single market allows British companies to trade across the 28 member states without restrictions, and Britons to live and work anywhere in the EU.\n\nRemainers would like the UK to remain part of the single market, but this could only happen if we accepted freedom of movement and the all the regulations that come with membership.\n\nSo soft Brexiteers prefer to talk about access to the single market under a special arrangement such as that enjoyed by Norway or Switzerland Both can trade freely with the EU, without tariffs, but have to accept freedom of movement and make some level of contribution to the EU budget.\n\nFreedom of movement\n\nMost commentators felt that concern over immigration was at the heart of the Leave vote in June 2016 - and Theresa May made regaining control of it the cornerstone of her position on Brexit.\n\nEnding freedom of movement means leaving the single market, and the Conservatives pledged to reduce net migration to tens of thousands per year in their 2017 election manifesto.\n\nDivorce settlement\n\nWhat the EU wants to discuss first is arrangements for its citizens who live in the UK, and settling Britain's outstanding debts, which could amount to tens of billions of pounds.\n\nSome hard Brexiteers say Britain shouldn't pay a penny, but most politicians accept that the UK should honour any financial commitments it has already entered into, even if this means paying a contribution into the EU budget after we have left.\n\nIf Britain continues to stay in the customs union, even if only for a short period, it may also have to pay a contribution to the EU. Brexit Secretary David Davis refused to be drawn on whether Britain would pay, saying it was something that would have to be part of the negotiations.\n\nWhat business says\n\nBusiness groups have welcomed today's announcement. Janet Jones, FSB Wales Policy chair, said: \"Today's commitment from the Government would give small businesses in Wales the time they need to prepare for new customs arrangements, which is very welcome. But it is essential that this interim deal is negotiated as soon as possible with the EU Commission, to give businesses the certainty to keep investing in the UK.\n\n\"We also welcome the aspiration that negotiation on Free Trade Agreements globally will be able to begin once we have left the EU. Whilst 63% of our small businesses across the UK would prioritise an FTA with the EU, 49% would prioritise an FTA with the US and 28% with China.\n\n\"Beyond the interim period it is essential that new customs arrangements achieve the most frictionless trade with small businesses as possible. Our UK-wide research shows that non-tariff barriers are just as important as tariff barriers in determining where small businesses export to.\n\n\"Many Welsh businesses trade within the EU Single Market and so engagement with small businesses is essential to develop a new customs relationship with the EU that enhances trade and successfully capitalises upon the opportunities offered by digital technology.\"\n\nJosh Hardie, CBI deputy director-general, said: \"Companies will welcome the progress Government has made today in publishing these papers. Over the past year, businesses have been providing policymakers with the evidence, ideas and solutions to make a success of Brexit.\n\n\"So it's encouraging to see that these papers propose a time-limited interim period and a customs system that is as barrier-free as possible.\n\n\"We at the CBI have always been clear that new ideas on crucial issues like this should be brought to the table quickly. But the clock is ticking and what matters now is giving companies the confidence to continue investing as quickly as possible.\"\n\n\"Business wants to see as frictionless a customs system as possible, with a strong emphasis on digital systems that make it easier to trade.\n\n\"But to secure frictionless trade, negotiations on regulation, tariff and non-tariff barriers will have to take place. All efforts should be made to deliver a single-step transition, so that businesses don't have to adapt twice.\"", "id": "9259133", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-15", "title": "What is the customs

There have been fears that without a deal on future arrangements, chaos could ensue at British ports.\n\nIn interviews on Tuesday, Davis would not be drawn on whether Britain would pay the EU for a temporary customs deal, saying he would not negotiate on air, although he did tell ITV \"no, I don't think so\".\n\nBrussels' position from the outset has been that the UK's divorce settlement - the so-called exit bill, as well as citizens' rights and the future of the Irish border - must be sorted before future trade arrangements can be negotiated.\n\nBusinesses have long called for clarity over the UK's future relationship with the EU, and the main employers' organisation the CBI said it was encouraged by the government's proposal. The Institute of Directors said there would be a \"great sigh of relief\" among UK businesses.\n\nRead the CBItweets</a> response to the Customs Union partnerships papers <a href=\"https://t.co/K2WPVQ48Rv\">https://t.co/K2WPVQ48Rv</a></p> -- The CBI (CBItweets) August 15, 2017\n\nThe European Union has said it will study the proposals carefully but will only consider the question of an implementation period once sufficient progress has been made on Britain's withdrawal.\n\nThe EU has always warned that Britain cannot \"cherry-pick\" the advantages of EU membership which involve accepting the union's main principles. Under the rules of the Customs Union, members trade without customs impositions and charge the same tariffs on imports - and cannot negotiate their own trade deals outside the EU. One of the UK's key Brexit objectives is to be free to pursue its own trade deals.\n\nFormer EU Trade Commissioner Karel De Gucht described the plans as \"very problematic\", suggesting that the EU may only accept similar customs arrangements for several years on its terms - which would mean the UK paying contributions and abiding by decisions of the European Court of Justice.\n\nUK opposition figures have criticised the government's proposals. Labour's shadow Brexit secretary Keir Starmer said they were \"incoherent and inadequate\", \"fantastical and contradictory\".\n\nSo Ministers ask EU if can have-cake-and-eat-it; we leave 'the' Customs Union & ask for...'a' customs union!

arrangement\" including \"innovative measures\" to achieve minimal disruption to trade, or a second option of a new customs partnership which would be \"entirely novel and therefore untested\".\n\nAny transitional period would most likely last for two years, he has said, and must be over by the time of the UK's next scheduled general election in 2022.\n\nTheresa May's government has promised to

Thank you.\n\nThe big picture\n\nA cabinet truce appears to have been concluded on the terms of a post-Brexit transitional arrangement, with the chancellor, Philip Hammond, and the international trade secretary, Liam Fox, agreeing that the UK will be \"outside the customs union\" and \"a 'third country', not party to the EU treaties\" for a \"time-limited\" period.\n\nThe two ministers' joint article for the Sunday Telegraph on the arrangement the UK wants to bridge the gap between Brexit day and the start a future trading deal with the bloc follows a fortnight of public sniping by both sides of the soft-hard Brexit divide while Theresa May has been away.\n\nHammond and his supporters backed a gradual transition period in which the UK-EU relationship would be \"similar in many ways\" to what it is now, while Fox and his allies said anything resembling continued free movement and membership of the single market and customs union would not be what the country voted for.\n\nWhile it is unclear how it might work in practice (and how the EU could agree to it), the plan is seen as a victory for the Brexiters: leaving the customs union should leave Fox free to conclude trade deals with non-EU countries from the moment Britain leaves in March 2019, without having to wait till the transition is over - possibly three years later.\n\nAs predicted last week, the Brexit secretary, David Davis, is now expected to publish a government position paper on Britain's hopes for a future customs deal this week, as well as a document on the future status of the border in Northern Ireland. As the prime minister's spokesman put it:\n\nThe first round of the negotiation has shown that many of the withdrawal questions can only be settled in the light of our future partnership. So now is the time to set out our approach to that partnership, to inform the upcoming negotiations, and to provide citizens and businesses at home and across Europe with a deeper understanding of our thinking.\n\nThe view from Europe\n\nEurope - and particularly Brussels - is, if anything, even more on holiday than it was last week. But there was good news from Spain where the foreign minister, Alfonso Dastis, said Madrid would not seek to block a Brexit agreement by attempting to regain sovereignty over Gibraltar.\n\nHis comments followed rising tension after the EU 27's negotiation guidelines suggested Spain would be given a veto on whether the Brexit deal could be applied to \"the Rock\", which was ceded to Britain in 1713.\n\nDastis told Spain's ABC newspaper he placed \"great importance\" on the issue, \"which takes the form of a Spanish demand for the completion of our territorial integrity\", but would not block a Brexit deal in order to secure it.\n\nWe will try to convince the Gibraltarians that joint sovereignty is a route worth exploring and that it would benefit them, too. But what I don't want to do is jeopardise an EU-UK agreement by subjecting it to a need to alter Gibraltar's status at the same time. I won't make an agreement between the EU and the United Kingdom conditional on recovering sovereignty over Gibraltar.\n\nMeanwhile, back in Westminster\n\nA former Tory business minister, Anna Soubry, warned the party could split if May insists on pursuing a hard Brexit. Soubry she would be willing to resign from the Tories and join up with \"like-minded people\" if the government opts for a Brexit that she felt would \"destroy the lives and livelihoods\" of her constituents.\n\nShe urged the prime minister to avoid that by refusing to let \"Brexit ideologues\" dictate government policy. Labour's former foreign secretary David Miliband sounded a similar warning, calling for politicians from all parties to work together to prevent the government from driving the country \"off a cliff\".\n\nMiliband said Brexit was an \"unparalleled act of economic self-harm\" and suggested it was up to MPs of all political colours to fight back against its worst consequences - and to demand another vote on the terms of a final settlement, either by referendum or in parliament.\n\nJames Chapman, a former aide to both David Davis and George Osborne, said two serving cabinet ministers had expressed interest in his idea of forming a centrist political party aimed principally at blocking Brexit.\n\nIn a series of tweets, Chapman, also a former political editor of the Daily Mail, had earlier said Brexit would be a \"calamity\" and that Boris Johnson and other leading Brexit campaigners should be jailed for claiming there would be an extra \u00a3350m a week for the NHS after the UK left the European Union.\n\nYou should also know ... UK retirees are rushing to settle in Europe before Brexit, financial advisers say. Britain is \"falling behind on counter-terrorism\" as EU links are loosened. Nationwide sounds a note of caution over lending in the run-up to Brexit. Morgan Stanley predicts pound-euro parity by early next year. The UK trade deficit widens as the fall in sterling fails to improve export sales. The government will sign a deal with the Scottish government on Holyrood's post-Brexit powers before the repeal bill, a minister says. The UK property market slowdown is blamed on Brexit-related political uncertainty. The Bank of England warns that Brexit will put a strain on its regulatory resources. The president of the supreme court calls for clarity on the UK status of ECJ rulings after Brexit. Read these\n\nIn the Guardian, John Springford of the Centre for European reform said Philip Hammond and Liam Fox's Brexit transition plan (see above) was a pipe dream the EU could never agree to:\n\nIt is the EU that will decide the nature of the transition Britain will get ... If Britain wanted a very simple agreement that kept trade tariff-free but lacked any of the single-market rules that tackle important non-tariff barriers to trade, a transition wouldn't be needed: the whole thing could be wrapped up quickly. But any agreement comprehensive enough to be economically tolerable for Britain will take much longer to negotiate. And during the transition period itself, the 27 will insist that all EU rights and obligations continue. If it disagrees, Britain will need to go over the cliff-edge and try to negotiate a trade deal from outside the single market.\n\nRemainers will get nowhere by continuing to shout \"Told you so\", writes Anne McElvoy, also in the Guardian. There is a strong case against Brexit, she says, but it must be made without condescending to those who voted for it:\n\nOf course people should state very strongly when they think ideas are foolish or risky. But one sort of inflation that Brexit has definitely unleashed is the verbal variety. The word \"catastrophe\" is deployed so routinely that it makes me wonder what description would be reserved for, say, nuclear war (not as fanciful as it looked until recently) or the immolation of Syria.\n\nAnd Gina Miller, the lead claimant in the successful legal fight to allow parliament to vote on triggering article 50, argues that a transitional arrangement will not be the answer for this country - we need to extend the exit timetable:\n\nMany politicians are settling on the idea that Britain needs a transitional arrangement beyond March 2019. This would certainly be preferable to a cliff-edge scenario. But as a matter of principle and practicality, it will simply be impossible to negotiate ... The difficulty arises because it would be almost impossible to negotiate a transitional arrangement without knowing or having agreed what we want our long-term relationship with the EU to look like. This is also the basic question that the EU would rightly ask: what are we seeking to transition to? What Britain should be aiming for instead is an extension of the withdrawal period.\n\nTweet of the week\n\nJames Chapman launches his incendiary campaign to overturn Brexit:", "id": "9216753", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-15", "title": "Brexit weekly briefing: Hammond and Fox call a truce on customs union", "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/37f5e9b5e0cde390e7bf104509a2408ac068aeae/0_0_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=1200&h=630&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=crop&crop=faces%2Centropy&bm=normal&ba=bottom%2Cleft&blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly91cGxvYWRzLmd1aW0uY28udWsvMjAxNi8wNi8wNy9vdmVybGF5LWxvZ28tMTIwMC05MF9vcHQucG5n&s=1f81d7d96818000ad304572be77cc228", "extractedDates": [{"textStart": 1789, "freq": 2, "date": "2019-03-", "amb": false, "textEnd": 1799}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-15", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 5, "id": "67", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 5, "id": "76", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "Gibraltar"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 4, "id": "82", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gibraltar", "label": {"eng": "Gibraltar"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Northern Ireland"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 3, "id": "85555", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland", "label": {"eng": "Northern Ireland"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Euro"}, "id": "302536", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro"}, {"location": null, "score": 5, "id": "303048", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "id": "303064", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union"}, {"label": {"eng": "The Guardian"}, "id": "303358", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Guardian"}, {"label": {"eng": "Pound sterling"}, "id": "304022", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_sterling"}, {"label": {"eng": "Theresa May"}, "id": "304328", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theresa_May"}, {"label": {"eng": "Philip Hammond"}, "id": "304608", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Hammond"}, {"label": {"eng": "George Osborne"}, "id": "305289", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Osborne"}, {"label": {"eng": "Daily Mail"}, "id": "307492", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Mail"}, {"label": {"eng": "Veto"}, "id": "308439", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veto"}, {"label": {"eng": "Labour Party (UK)"}, "id": "311306", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Scottish Government"}, "id": "315582", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Government"}, {"label": {"eng": "Boris Johnson"}, "id": "326861", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boris_Johnson"}, {"label": {"eng": "Liam Fox"}, "id": "330676", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liam_Fox"}, {"label": {"eng": "David Miliband"}, "id": "375823", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Miliband"}, {"label": {"eng": "Customs union"}, "id": "382637", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customs_union"}, {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom withdrawal from the European Union"}, "id": "1268836", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_withdrawal_from_the_European_Union"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 108, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 140, "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral"}], "time": "06:00:00"}

But an alternative proposal for a \"streamlined customs arrangement\" would, the Government admits in its \"future partnership paper\", result in \"an increase in administration compared with being inside the EU customs union\".\n\nThe Welsh Government said it was \"unacceptable\" there had been no attempt to seek its input into the paper before it was finalised. It is also concerned there has been \"insufficient attention to the implication for trade with the Irish Republic using Welsh ports\".\n\nThe UK Government has also said it will levy customs duty and VAT on EU imports if no deal can be reached - and that UK exporters would also face new requirements.\n\nThe paper states: \"In this scenario, without any further facilitations or agreements, the UK would treat trade with the EU as it currently treats trade with non-EU countries. Customs duty and import VAT would be due on EU imports.\n\n\"Traders would need to be registered. Traders exporting to the EU would have to submit an export declaration, and certain goods may require an export licence.\n\n\"The EU would also apply the customs rules and VAT to imports from the UK that it applies to non-EU countries.\"\n\nLeading Labour pro-EU MP Chuka Umunna was unimpressed by the proposals, saying: \"They might promise frictionless trade, but they are offering a red tape bombshell for British business.\"\n\nPlaid Cymru claimed the \"notion that the British Government can have a transition period in which it retains the perks of remaining in the EU customs union whilst negotiating alternative deals with third countries is at best na\u00efve and at worst deluded\".\n\nHere are the key points from the proposals:\n\n1 .The UK Government wants to avoid a 'cliff-edge for businesses and individuals on both sides'.\n\nIn order to avoid chaos and disruption when the UK leaves the EU in March 2019, the Government argues there should be a \"time-limited interim period\" of \"continued close association with the EU customs union\". This could involve a \"new and time-limited customs union\".\n\nThe idea is that it would provide time for technology to be put in place to ensure the future customs regime is \"as smooth as possible\". A goal is to ensure \"businesses and people in the UK and the EU only have to adjust once to a new customs relationship\".\n\n2. An unprecedented customs partnership could be agreed.\n\nIt is hoped this could be done \"in a way that removes the need for a UK-EU customs border\".\n\nThe paper states: \"By mirroring the EU's customs approach at its external border, we could ensure that all goods entering the EU via the UK have paid the correct EU duties. This would remove the need for the UK and the EU to introduce customs processes between us, so that goods moving between the UK and the EU would be treated as they are now for customs purposes.\"\n\nBritain could apply its own tariffs on goods that were intended for the UK market.\n\nThe Government admits this is an \"untested\" approach and that there may be a need for a \"tracking mechanism, where imports to the UK were tracked until they reached an end user, or a repayment mechanism, where imports to the UK paid whichever was the higher of the UK's or the EU's tariff rates and traders claimed a refund for the difference between the two rates when the goods were sold to an end user in the country charging lower tariffs.\"\n\n3. The Government wants to avoid delays at ports such as Holyhead.\n\nIt seeks to simplify the requirements for moving goods across borders.\n\nOne possibility is that a continued waiver from the requirement to submit entry and exit declarations for goods moved between the EU and the UK could be negotiated.\n\nAnother is that goods being moved between the UK and the rest of the world could travel through the European Union without EU duties having to be paid through membership of the Common Transit Convention (CTC). The Government argues this would provide \"cash-flow benefits to traders, and would make border clearances easier at key ports and airports, such as Dover and Holyhead.\"\n\nA further option is for \"a technology-based solution for roll-on, roll-off ports which could consist of pre-arrival notification of consignments on a port IT system, linked to customs declarations and vehicle registration numbers so that vehicles were not required to stop at the border, enabling traffic to flow smoothly\".\n\n4. The Government has ruled out staying in the existing customs union.\n\nThe Government is emphatic that this is not possible, stating: \"To achieve our objectives on trading independently with both the EU and the rest of the world, we will need to establish a new customs arrangement with the EU outside of the EU customs union.\"\n\n5. There are big ambitions to boost the export of services.\n\nThe Government states: \"The share of services in total UK exports has increased from around 27% in 1990 to 45% in 2016 - the largest share of any of the G7 economies. To capitalise fully on those opportunities, the UK will need an independent trade policy, with the freedom to set for ourselves the terms of our trade with the world.\"\n\n6. There will be action to ensure businesses do not get a raw deal.\n\nThe Government insists it will \"protect our businesses from unfair anti-competitive practices,\" stating: \"When countries do not play by the rules or take an unfair advantage, we will act swiftly to ensure that trade remains fair and that markets are kept open. We, like many of our partners, believe that providing a safety net for domestic businesses if they suffer harm as a result of unfair trading practices is an important part of supporting the free trade agenda.\"\n\n7. The Government says future free trade deals will not put public services at risk.\n\nThis has been a key concern. Campaigners have warned that a free trade deal with the UK could lead to lower environmental standards and stop a future government rolling back the use of the private sector in the NHS.\n\nThe Government's paper rejects such fears, stating: \"We will maintain our high level of standards and protect our public services. As we leave the EU, the Government will continue to maintain our high standards for consumers, employees, the environment and animal welfare.\n\n\"The Government will also ensure that decisions about how public services including the NHS are delivered for UK citizens, are made by UK governments and not by our trade partners.\"\n\n8. Avoiding a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic is a priority.\n\nThe paper states: \"The border between Northern Ireland and Ireland is the UK's only land border. We must avoid a return to a hard border, and trade and everyday movements across the land border must be protected as part of the UK-EU deal...\n\n\"The Government has made clear that the answer to avoiding a hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland cannot be to impose a new customs border between Northern Ireland and Great Britain. We should avoid any approach that would create new barriers to doing business within the UK (including between Northern Ireland and Great Britain).\"\n\n9. Discussions with the Welsh Government will take place (but there is unhappiness in Cardiff).\n\nThe paper notes that customs is the responsibility of Westminster but it says the UK Government is \"committed\" to working with the devolved administrations to \"understand the practical impact of new customs arrangements in different parts of the UK\" including the \"implications for ports in Wales\".\n\nHowever, a Welsh Government spokeswoman said: \"We welcome the fact that the UK Government is at last starting to set out its thinking on key issues in a little more detail. We particularly welcome the recognition that there will need to be an interim or transitional period with as little change as possible in terms of practical customs arrangements, something we have been pressing for since the publication of our White Paper, Securing Wales' Future.\n\n\"At the same time, while we recognise that this is a discussion paper and is intended as the basis for consultation, we think it is unacceptable that once again, there has been no attempt to seek input to the document from ourselves and the other devolved administrations in advance of finalising it.\n\n\"While we need time to consider the issues raised, we are disappointed that there is no economic analysis of the costs and benefits of establishing an independent trade policy and no consideration of the option of entering a new customs union with the EU post-Brexit. We also believe there is insufficient attention to the implication for trade with the Irish Republic using Welsh ports of the twin requirements of avoiding a hard border on the island of Ireland and avoiding any customs border between Northern Ireland and Britain.\"\n\nPlaid Cymru MP Hywel Williams said: \"In their first collision with reality, the hard-line Brexiteers have finally conceded that a deal must be struck and a transitional deal put in place. The British Government's position paper, however, does sound the loudest of alarm bells.\n\n\"The notion that the British Government can have a transition period in which it retains the perks of remaining in the EU customs union whilst negotiating alternative deals with third countries is at best na\u00efve and at worst deluded. It's highly unlikely that the EU will even contemplate agreeing to this - and the two sides have not yet even started discussing future trade matters...\n\n\"The two options for future trading arrangements put forward by the Government once this period expires are both as damaging as one another for Wales. There should quite rightly be no hard border between the Republic of Ireland and the UK.\n\n\"However, the reality of both positions in the British Government's paper means that the onus of the self-admitted 'increase in administration' will now lie on ports in Wales. I doubt Ministers in Whitehall have given any consideration to the financial, infrastructural and practical implications this will have on our nation, let alone how it will impact on policing and security requirements there.\n\n\"Plaid Cymru has been clear and consistent in its view that we must maintain single market and customs union membership and that Welsh jobs and trade must not be endangered by Brexit. This position paper is by definition in clear contradiction to our policy.\"\n\nLabour Shadow Brexit Secretary Keir Starmer said: \"The Government's proposals are ambiguous, unachievable and offer no viable solutions.\n\n\"The first proposal for a streamlined customs arrangements is code for a hard-edged exit from the Customs Union, which will inevitably involve a border between the UK and any trading partner, including the EU27. This will mean delays and costs for UK businesses, especially manufacturing. The Government appear to be relying on unspecified technological solutions to reduce these burdens, but they can't suggest how and when these new systems could be in place or how much they might cost.\n\n\"The second proposal is in David Davis's own words 'untested'. That's because it is, in truth, a half-in half-out proposal without any clarity about how the Government plan to negotiate or deliver it. This will almost certainly entail considerable new bureaucratic burdens for British businesses, including complicated \"tracking and repayment mechanisms\".\n\n\"We've seen today that the Government still has no viable plan to deliver frictionless trade with our largest market and closest allies. They are, as ever, putting jobs and the economy through their chaotic handling of Brexit.\"", "id": "9317255", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-15", "title": "Government plans for post-Brexit trade 'a

The Government will insist that it is allowed to begin this work as soon as it leaves the EU, even if the current EU customs regime remains in place on a temporary basis. But Brussels may put ministers under pressure to promise that these new deals will only come into force at the end of the interim period.\n\nIn the longer term, Mr Davis will say he is seeking 'the most frictionless customs arrangement anywhere', with minimal checks and paperwork on goods going between the EU and UK.\n\nOne option being put forward by Mr Davis would see the UK manage a new customs border with administration streamlined to the 'fullest extent possible' using technology.\n\nHe will also float plans for a customs partnership with the EU that would negate the need for a customs border between the UK and the rest of the bloc.\n\nNegotiations on future customs arrangements are not due to be discussed during the next round of Brexit talks to be held in Brussels at the end of this month.\n\nThe European Commission has said progress first needs to be made on agreeing the divorce bill before work can begin on the future relationship between the EU and UK.\n\nBut Downing Street said it was pushing forward with setting out its plans in order to help businesses both in Britain and across the continent.\n\nMr Davis (pictured with EU Chief Brexit Negotiator Michel Barnier) will argue Britain must be allowed to begin developing a trade policy that makes it 'more outward-looking than ever before'\n\nThe Prime Minister's spokesman said yesterday: 'We have had the first round of the negotiations and those talks have shown that many of the withdrawal questions can only be settled in light of the future partnership. So now is the time to set out our approach to that partnership to inform the negotiations and to provide citizens and business at home and across Europe with a deeper understanding of our thinking.'\n\nBusiness leaders last night welcomed the Government's plan to minimise disruption to trade.\n\nJosh Hardie, deputy director-general of the Confederation of British Industry, said he was encouraged that the papers propose a time-limited interim period and a customs system that is as barrier-free as possible.\n\nHe added: 'All efforts should be made to deliver a single-step transition, so that businesses don't have to adapt twice.'\n\nBut Labour MP Chris Leslie, a leading supporter of the Open Britain campaign group, accused ministers of 'wanting to have their cake and eat it'.\n\nHe said: 'It is a fantasy to pretend we can have the freest and most frictionless trade possible with our largest partner when the Government remain intent on pulling Britain out of the customs union.'\n\nDowning Street last night announced that Theresa May will embark on a visit to Japan at the end of this month in a bid to boost Britain's post-Brexit trade.\n\nThe Prime Minister, who is currently in Switzerland on holiday, will be received by emperor Akihito and the Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe.\n\nMrs May will be accompanied on the trip by business leaders from a range of sectors.\n\nFormer Ukip donor Arron Banks has written to every voter in Philip Hammond and Amber Rudd's constituencies to try to get them deselected.\n\nThe Chancellor, MP for Runnymede and Weybridge, and the Home Secretary, MP for Hastings and Rye, favour a 'softer Brexit' than tycoon Mr Banks, chairman of the campaign group Leave.EU.", "id": "9193641", "details": {}, "date":

Likewise, separate agreements are in place with Andorra, San Marino and Turkey.\n\nThe agreement states that those involved are exempt from import tariffs on goods arriving from other members of the EU. Likewise, items moving between two member states do not require customs checks.\n\nThis is what allows a UK citizen to order an item from France without paying additional duty fees, for example.\n\nA customs agreement proposes that all parties impose a common external tariff when trading with countries outside of the union.\n\nThe purpose of this agreement is to encourage the trade of goods between members of the Customs Union.\n\nThe HM Treasury have recently published a paper on \"Future customs arrangements\", which outlines the British government's plans to continue to provide \"free and frictionless trade\" following Britain's exit from the EU.\n\nAny future customs agreement will depend largely on the stance of EU negotiators. However, Britain is hopeful of securing a good deal. The plan is for the UK to continue to operate within the EU Customs Union throughout a transitional period.\n\nBoth the UK and EU Member States would benefit from time to fully implement the new customs arrangements in order to avoid a cliff-edge for businesses and individuals on both sides. The Government believes a model of close association with the EU Customs Union for a time-limited interim period could achieve this.\n\nSecretary of state for exiting the European Union, David Davis, has said this transition should take no more than two years, providing time for Britain to streamline and integrate a new approach.\n\nThe paper proposes two ideas. The first proposal calls for a \"highly streamlined customs arrangement\".

Leon Neal/AFP\n\nLONDON, United Kingdom - Britain could seek a temporary customs union with the European Union after Brexit, the government said Tuesday, August 15, as it prepared to publish its first detailed proposals on the future partnership.\n\nBritain says its membership of the EU customs union, which currently allows for the tariff-free movement of goods, will end along with its membership of the single market when it leaves the bloc in March 2019.\n\nThe Department for Exiting the EU said it will seek to agree a \"time-limited period of implementation\" to provide certainty for businesses and allow for new customs arrangements to be set up.\n\n\"One possible approach would be a temporary customs union between the UK and the EU,\" it said in a statement, ahead of the publication of the full paper later on Tuesday.\n\nExperts have warned it will be extremely difficult to negotiate a new EU-UK free trade agreement before Britain leaves the bloc - particularly as Brussels has so far refused even to start trade talks.\n\nIt says there must be broad agreement first on 3 key issues - Britain's financial settlement, the issue of expatriate rights, and the question of the border between British-controlled Northern Ireland and Ireland.\n\nBritain will publish its proposals on the border issue on Wednesday, August 16, ahead of the third round of Brexit negotiations in Brussels at the end of the month.\n\nOfficials in London believe the border is inextricably linked to the customs issue.\n\nAfter Brexit, the Irish border will be Britain's only land border with the EU.\n\nThere are fears that the reintroduction of physical checkpoints could upset the fragile balance of peace in Northern Ireland.\n\nBritain's membership of the EU customs union precludes it from striking its own trade deals, and the government made clear Tuesday that such freedom was crucial to its post-Brexit plans.\n\n\"During this interim period, which will be negotiated with Brussels, Britain will look to negotiate bold new trade relationships around the world,\" it said.\n\nThe statement added: \"Our goal is to secure as frictionless trade as possible with the EU alongside the ability to forge trade deals around the world.\"\n\nHowever, opposition Labour lawmaker Chris Leslie, from the campaign group Open Britain, said the proposal represented \"wishful thinking of the highest order\".\n\n\"It is a fantasy to pretend we can have the freest and most frictionless trade possible with our largest partner when the government remain intent on pulling Britain out of the customs union,\" he said. -

Before the UK-EU Brexit talks resume at the end of this month, the government wants to repair the damage caused by summer headlines about Brexit splits.\n\nHammond has spent the last few weeks arguing strongly for a lengthy Brexit transitional period, to the delight of pro-Europeans, and earlier this summer he hinted that he was considering an arrangement that would in effect keep the UK in the customs union, and therefore unable to sign bilateral trade deals with non-EU countries, for the period between Brexit and the final settlement coming into force.\n\nFox, who was alarmed at the prospect of heading an international trade department unable to strike trade deals possibly for the rest of this parliament, admitted last month that there was \"still a discussion to be had\" on this issue (FT paywall). But, in their article in the Sunday Telegraph, Fox and Hammond revealed that this matter has been resolved.\n\n\"We respect the will of the British people - in March 2019 the United Kingdom will leave the European Union,\" they wrote. \"We will leave the customs union and be free to negotiate the best trade deals around the world as an independent, open, trading nation ... When we've left the customs union, we will build up on [relationships with other countries] by negotiating as an independent nation with the freedom to sign bilateral free trade agreements.\"\n\nVince Cable, the Lib Dem leader, said the article showed that it was not Hammond who \"calls in the shots\" in the cabinet over Brexit. He said: \"Over the summer we heard that Philip Hammond was courageously fighting off the more extreme Brexiteers. Supposedly he was looking for a compromise to keep Britain within the customs union and single market as long as possible.\n\n\"The rebellion didn't last very long. He has now teamed up with one of the more extreme and ideological supporters of a hard Brexit.\"\n\nDavid Jones, the pro-leave Tory who was the Brexit minister until the general election, told the BBC that Hammond had \"rowed back from his previous position\". Richard Corbett, the deputy leader of Labour MEPs, said Hammond had \"caved in\" and that the government was now aiming for the most damaging version of Brexit.\n\nEarlier this summer, Fox made his own concession over Brexit, accepting that a transitional period lasting two or three years might be necessary. Previously he had been downplaying the need for such a lengthy interim stage.\n\nIn their article, Fox and Hammond said: \"We are also clear that during this period our borders must continue to operate smoothly; goods bought on the internet must still cross borders, businesses must still be able to supply their customers across the EU, and our innovative, world-leading companies must be able to hire the talent they need, including from within the EU.\"\n\nBut they did not explain how these aims would be achieved. Nor did they say how long a transitional period would last, or what payments the UK would continue to make to the EU while it was in place.\n\nTheir article was published as the Conservative MP Anna Soubry said that she and probably other pro-Europeans could leave the party if May insisted on pursuing a hard Brexit.\n\nWriting in the Mail on Sunday, Soubry said: \"If the prime minister or her successor (in the event of Theresa standing down) is not prepared to confront the ideologues, I gravely fear that the party could split - and that would change Britain's political landscape completely.\"\n\nBut Soubry, who has become the most vocal pro-European among Tory MPs, was careful in her article to avoid saying what would constitute the \"hard Brexit\" that she could not accept.", "id": "8942157", "details": {"liCnt": 3}, "date": "2017-08-13", "title": "Hammond accused of giving ground to pro-hard Brexit Tories", "image":

"eng-3358827", "body": "The EU's customs union means members charge the same tariff on goods coming from other countries\n\nThe UK has set out the \"ambitious new customs arrangement\" it wants to secure with the EU after Brexit.\n\nMinisters said the plans would mean the \"freest and most frictionless possible trade\" with the rest of Europe.\n\nThis could include a \"temporary customs union\" after Brexit to prevent border problems as the UK leaves the EU.\n\nBusinesses have called for clarity since the UK said it was leaving the customs union - the EU's tariff-free trading area - as part of Brexit.\n\nThe customs union document is the first of a series of papers to be published by the UK government on key negotiation issues.\n\nOn Wednesday it is expected to set out proposals for the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.\n\nCountries in the customs union don't impose tariffs - taxes on imports - on each other's goods.\n\nEvery country inside the union levies the same tariffs on imports from abroad.\n\nSo, for example, a 10% tariff is imposed on some cars imported from outside the customs union, while 7.5% is imposed on roasted coffee.\n\nOther goods - such as soap or slate - have no tariffs.\n\nThe UK's departure from the EU's customs union was confirmed at the weekend in a joint article by Chancellor Philip Hammond and Trade Secretary Liam Fox.\n\nAccording to the newly-published government paper, the UK could ask Brussels to establish a \"temporary customs union\" after it leaves the EU in March 2019.\n\nBut during this period, it would also expect to be able to negotiate its own international trade deals - something it cannot do as an EU customs union member.\n\nOnce this period expires, the UK will look to agree either a \"highly streamlined\" border with the EU, or a new \"partnership\" with no customs border at all.\n\nThe government said the interim arrangements would mean businesses would only have to adjust once to the new arrangements.\n\nAll of this will have to be negotiated with the EU - and the two sides have not yet even started discussing trade matters.\n\nOther obstacles - including the size of the UK's \"divorce bill\" - need to be agreed first.\n\nKeir Starmer, Labour's shadow Brexit secretary, said the proposals were \"incoherent and inadequate\" and were designed to \"gloss over deep and continuing divisions within the cabinet\".\n\n\"These fantastical and contradictory proposals provide no guidance for negotiators or certainty for businesses,\" he added.\n\nLiberal Democrat Brexit spokesman Tom Brake said the plan would \"only delay the economic pain caused by leaving the customs union\".\n\n\"We still face the prospect of more red tape for businesses, longer queues at our borders and higher prices for consumers once the transition comes to an end.\"\n\nHowever, the CBI, which represents British businesses, said the proposal was \"encouraging\".\n\nIts deputy director general, Josh Hardie, added: \"The clock is ticking and what matters now is giving companies the confidence to continue investing as quickly as possible.\"\n\nAdam Fleming, BBC Brussels reporter, said the UK was seeking a customs union agreement \"that will keep things broadly the same for an interim period - an attempt to reassure business\".\n\n\"Firms will be told they'll only have to change their processes once,\" he said.\n\n\"In Brussels, EU negotiators are likely to stick to their position that that the future relationship can't be considered until agreement has been reached on their priority issues - the rights of citizens, a financial settlement and the Irish border.\"\n\nBBC political correspondent Ben Wright said the UK government was \"straining to show that it does have a route-map for Brexit\".\n\nHe said ministers were also attempting to \"subtly\" put the issue onto the negotiating table sooner than Brussels wants.\n\n\"They want to hustle EU negotiators into talking about trade much sooner than Brussels intends,\" our correspondent said.", "id": "9217943", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-15", "title": "Brexit: UK suggests 'temporary customs union' with

It also said it had looked at customs agreements between other countries but was not seeking to replicate another country's model.\n\nBritain said such a system would:\n\n- ensure businesses declare goods for import or export and provide the revenue and customs department with documentation including customs declarations, safety and security information\n\n- enable the government to verify a declaration has been made and ensure any duties have been paid\n\n- require new systems to be put in place on both the UK and EU sides, as well as Britain making improvements to its domestic regime\n\n- reduce the risk of delays at ports by using technology such as pre-arrival notification of consignments, linked to customs declarations and vehicle registration numbers, so vehicles do not need to stop at the border\n\n- replicate existing cooperation with the EU on data sharing and customs cooperation to reduce security risks and improve targeting of inspections\n\n- reduce the time and cost of complying with customs procedures through measures such as self-assessment, allowing traders to calculate their own customs duties and speeding up authorisation through greater automation\n\n- involve looking to agree simplified systems for moving goods across borders including:\n\na) a continued waiver from the requirement to submit entry and exit declarations for goods moving between UK and EU\n\nb) membership of the Common Transit Convention, meaning goods could travel from the UK through the EU to the rest of the world, and vice versa, without paying EU duties\n\n2) \"A NEW CUSTOMS PARTNERSHIP WITH THE EU\"\n\nThis would see Britain align its approach to customs with the EU in a way that removed the need for a UK-EU customs border. One such option would be for Britain to mirror the EU's requirements for imports from the rest of the world where the final destination is the EU.\n\nThe government acknowledged this was an untested approach which would take time to implement.\n\nBritain said that under such a system:\n\n- it would need to apply the same tariffs as the EU and the same treatment on rules of origin for goods arriving in the UK before heading on to the EU\n\n- mirroring the EU's customs approach at its external border would ensure all goods entering the bloc via the UK have paid the correct EU duties\n\n- the need to introduce customs procedures between Britain and the EU would be removed, so goods moving between the two would be treated as they are now for customs purposes\n\n- Britain could apply its own tariffs and trade policy to UK exports and imports from other countries\n\n- Britain would require a \"robust enforcement mechanism\" to ensure goods that do not comply with EU trade policy stay in Britain\n\nNEW LEGISLATION\n\nAs rules governing customs mostly come under EU law, the government said Britain would introduce new domestic legislation via a customs bill later this year.\n\nThis legislation would seek to ensure British law remains as consistent as possible with EU law, but will also give the government powers to operate standalone customs, tax and excise systems in the event Britain and the EU fail to reach a deal.\n\nNO DEAL SCENARIO\n\nBritain said that while it hoped to reach a negotiated agreement with the EU, it was also looking at ways to mitigate the impact of not reaching a deal. It said that it expected a \"no deal\" scenario would mean:\n\n- Britain would treat trade with the EU as it currently treats trade with non-EU countries and apply customs duties and import tax on EU imports\n\n- Britain would require traders to be registered, with those exporting to the EU needing to submit export declarations and some goods may need export licences\n\n- The EU would apply the same customs rules and tax to imports from Britain that it applies to non-EU countries\n\n(This article has not been edited by DNA's editorial team and is auto-generated from an agency feed.)", "id": "9276929", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-15", "title": "FACTBOX-Britain's proposals for post-Brexit customs agreement with EU", "image": null, "extractedDates": [{"textStart": 304, "date": "2019-03-", "amb": false, "textEnd": 314}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-15", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 5, "id": "76", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "European Union law"}, "id": "303046", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union_law"}, {"label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "id": "303064", "score": 4, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union"}, {"label": {"eng": "Export"}, "id": "303403", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Export"}, {"label": {"eng": "Trade"}, "id": "303410", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade"}, {"label": {"eng": "Member state of the European Union"}, "id": "303880", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_state_of_the_European_Union"}, {"label": {"eng": "Tax"}, "id": "304014", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax"}, {"label": {"eng": "Customs"}, "id": "304875", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customs"}, {"label": {"eng": "International trade"}, "id": "307061", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_trade"}, {"label": {"eng": "Import"}, "id": "307363", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Import"}, {"label": {"eng": "Tariff"}, "id": "309353", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tariff"}, {"label": {"eng": "Schengen Area"}, "id": "309629", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schengen_Area"}, {"label": {"eng": "Trade agreement"}, "id": "313703", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_agreement"}, {"label": {"eng": "Excise"}, "id": "315026", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excise"}, {"label": {"eng": "Customs union"}, "id": "382637", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customs_union"}, {"label": {"eng": "Withdrawal from the European Union"}, "id": "410168", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Withdrawal_from_the_European_Union"}, {"label": {"eng": "European Union Customs Union"}, "id": "470058", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union_Customs_Union"}, {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom withdrawal from the European Union"}, "id": "1268836", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_withdrawal_from_the_European_Union"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 140, "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 147, "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Customer Management", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Customer_Management"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 269, "label": "dmoz/Business/International Business and Trade", "uri": "dmoz/Business/International_Business_and_Trade"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 585, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Home and Garden/Furniture", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Home_and_Garden/Furniture"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 682, "label": "dmoz/Business/Customer Service", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Customer_Service"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 828, "label": "dmoz/Business/International Business and Trade/Import and Export", "uri": "dmoz/Business/International_Business_and_Trade/Import_and_Export"}], "time": "12:39:00"}

"storyUri": "eng-3358827", "body": "The plans, published on Tuesday, provide the first detailed look at the UK's negotiating strategy and also reveal new reporting requirements for businesses as a way to minimise delays at international borders and avoid the need to build extra physical infrastructure.\n\nThe government has put forward two mechanisms: a process to track all goods and components, and a repayment mechanism - whereby importers pay whichever is higher of the EU or UK tariffs and claim a refund should the end destination be the one with lower tariffs.\n\n\"This is an innovative and untested approach that would take time to develop and implement,\" the Brexit Department said, adding that it wants to \"explore\" the approach with businesses to understand the complexities involved.\n\nThe compromises are outlined in a long-awaited policy paper on future customs arrangements that promises \"the freest and most frictionless system possible\" via a complex series of modifications to the existing system.\n\n\"The approaches we are setting out today will benefit both the EU and UK and avoid a cliff-edge for businesses and individuals on both sides,\" according to UK Brexit secretary David Davis.\n\n\"The way we approach the movement of goods across our border will be a critical building block for our independent trade policy,\" he added.\n\n\"An interim period would mean businesses only need to adjust once to the new regime and would allow for a smooth and orderly transition.\"\n\nBut explanatory briefings by British government officials revealed that the UK government's intention is for this interim phase to involve a new, temporary, customs union with the EU that would be substantially the same as now.\n\nThe paper said this would be a \"new and time-limited customs union between the UK and EU customs union based on a shared external tariff and without customs processes and duties between the UK and the EU\".\n\nOfficials confirmed while this would technically involve leaving the existing EU customs union after March 2019, it would be close enough to existing arrangements that Britain would only be able to negotiate, rather than implement, new trade deals with third-party countries.\n\nThis contradicts confident promises made by trade secretary Liam Fox and the chancellor, Philip Hammond, in a joint article published on Sunday.\n\nThe article was heralded as a victory for the international trade secretary's ambitions to show the benefits of an independent trade policy long before the next election.\n\n\"In March 2019 the United Kingdom will leave the customs union and be free to negotiate the best trade deals around the world as an independent, open, trading nation,\" they wrote in the Sunday Telegraph.\n\n\"When we've left the customs union, we will build on these relationships by negotiating as an independent nation with the freedom to sign bilateral free trade agreements.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, UK civil service officials refused to say whether new deals could be signed during this interim phase, and stressed that implementation was impossible until after the UK moved to its final customs arrangement.\n\nBut even the two scenarios outlined by the government for this end state position could still involve substantial overlap with EU customs procedures to try to minimise chaos at the ports.\n\nThe second, and more ambitious, of two options outlined in Tuesday's paper was called a \"new customs partnership\" and \"would involve the UK mirroring the EU's requirements for imports from the rest of the world where their final destination is the EU\".\n\nOfficials hope this would remove the need for all customs checks with the EU because UK exports would also be exempt from tariffs under the planned free trade agreement - though all such promises are subject to extensive negotiation with other member states.\n\nThe other option envisaged by the government after the interim stage would be a form of the current customs arrangements with countries outside the EU but rely heavily on new technology, such as number plate recognition, to try to avoid physical checks at the border.\n\nOfficials conceded that both these options would entail significant new red tape for business as they would entail shifting the reporting burden on to exporters at the point of departure rather than building new lorry parks and border posts.\n\nMr Fox struck a defiant note in a statement to accompany the new strategy paper, insisting \"leaving the customs union will allow us to operate a fully independent trade policy in Britain's national interest.\"\n\n\"We will seek a new customs arrangement that ensures that trade between the UK and the EU remains as frictionless as possible and allows us to forge new trade relationships with out partners in Europe and around the world\".", "id": "9283495", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-15", "title": "Brexit: UK to 'mirror' existing EU customs system", "image":

immediate ability to implement new trade deals.\n\nThis first detailed look at Whitehall's negotiating strategy also reveals new reporting requirements for businesses as a way to minimise delays at international borders and avoid the need to build extra physical infrastructure.\n\nThe compromises are outlined in a long-awaited policy paper on future customs arrangements that promises \"the freest and most frictionless system possible\" via a complex series of modifications to the existing system.\n\n\"The approaches we are setting out today will benefit both the EU and UK and avoid a cliff-edge for businesses and individuals on both sides,\" said the Brexit secretary, David Davis.\n\n\"The way we approach the movement of goods across our border will be a critical building block for our independent trade policy,\" he added. \"An interim period would mean businesses only need to adjust once to the new regime and would allow for a smooth and orderly transition.\"\n\nBut explanatory briefings by government officials revealed that the government's intention is for this interim phase to involve a new, temporary, customs union with the EU that would be substantially the same as now.\n\nThe government paper said this would be a \"new and time limited customs union between the UK and EU customs union based on a shared external tariff and without customs processes and duties between the UK and the EU\".\n\nOfficials confirmed that while this would technically involved leaving the existing EU customs union after March 2019, it would be close enough to existing arrangements that Britain would only be able to negotiate, rather than implement, new trade deals with third-party countries.\n\nThis contradicts confident promises made by Fox and the chancellor, Philip Hammond, in a joint article published on Sunday that was heralded as a victory for the international trade secretary's ambitions to show the benefits of an independent trade policy long before the next election.\n\n\"In March 2019 the United Kingdom ... will leave the customs union and be free to negotiate the best trade deals around the world as an independent, open, trading nation,\" they wrote in the Sunday Telegraph. \"When we've left the customs union, we will build on these relationships by negotiating as an independent nation with the freedom to sign bilateral free trade agreements.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, Whitehall officials refused to say whether new deals could be signed during this interim phase, and stressed that implementation was impossible until after the UK moved to its final customs arrangement.\n\nBut even the two scenarios outlined by the government for this end state position could still involve substantial overlap with EU customs procedures to try to minimise chaos at the ports.\n\nThe second, and more ambitious, of two options outlined in Tuesday's paper was called a \"new customs partnership\" and \"would involve the UK mirroring the EU's requirements for imports from the rest of the world where their final destination is the EU\".\n\nOfficials hope this would remove the need for all customs checks with the EU because UK exports would also be exempt from tariffs under the planned free trade agreement - though all such promises are subject to extensive negotiation with other member states.\n\nThe other option envisaged by the government after the interim stage would be a form of the current customs arrangements with countries outside the EU but rely heavily on new technology, such as number plate recognition, to try to avoid physical checks at the border.\n\nOfficials conceded that both these options would entail significant new red tape for business as they would entail shifting the reporting burden on to exporters at the point of departure rather than building new lorry parks and border posts.\n\nLiam Fox struck a defiant note in a statement to accompany the new strategy paper, insisting \"leaving the customs union will allow us to operate a fully independent trade policy in Britain's national interest.\"\n\n\"We will seek a new customs arrangement that ensures that trade between the UK and the EU remains as frictionless as possible and allows us to forge new trade relationships with out partners in Europe and around the world\".", "id": "9265844", "details": {"liCnt": 40}, "date": "2017-08-15",

It also said it had looked at customs agreements between other countries but was not seeking to replicate another country's model.\n\nBritain said such a system would:\n\n- ensure businesses declare goods for import or export and provide the revenue and customs department with documentation including customs declarations, safety and security information\n\n- enable the government to verify a declaration has been made and ensure any duties have been paid\n\n- require new systems to be put in place on both the UK and EU sides, as well as Britain making improvements to its domestic regime\n\n- reduce the risk of delays at ports by using technology such as pre-arrival notification of consignments, linked to customs declarations and vehicle registration numbers, so vehicles do not need to stop at the border\n\n- replicate existing cooperation with the EU on data sharing and customs cooperation to reduce security risks and improve targeting of inspections\n\n- reduce the time and cost of complying with customs procedures through measures such as self-assessment, allowing traders to calculate their own customs duties and speeding up authorisation through greater automation\n\n- involve looking to agree simplified systems for moving goods across borders including:\n\na) a continued waiver from the requirement to submit entry and exit declarations for goods moving between UK and EU\n\nb) membership of the Common Transit Convention, meaning goods could travel from the UK through the EU to the rest of the world, and vice versa, without paying EU duties\n\n2) \"A NEW CUSTOMS PARTNERSHIP WITH THE EU\"\n\nThis would see Britain align its approach to customs with the EU in a way that removed the need for a UK-EU customs border. One such option would be for Britain to mirror the EU's requirements for imports from the rest of the world where the final destination is the EU.\n\nThe government acknowledged this was an untested approach which would take time to implement.\n\nBritain said that under such a system:\n\n- it would need to apply the same tariffs as the EU and the same treatment on rules of origin for goods arriving in the UK before heading on to the EU\n\n- mirroring the EU's customs approach at its external border would ensure all goods entering the bloc via the UK have paid the correct EU duties\n\n- the need to introduce customs procedures between Britain and the EU would be removed, so goods moving between the two would be treated as they are now for customs purposes\n\n- Britain could apply its own tariffs and trade policy to UK exports and imports from other countries\n\n- Britain would require a \"robust enforcement mechanism\" to ensure goods that do not comply with EU trade policy stay in Britain\n\nNEW LEGISLATION\n\nAs rules governing customs mostly come under EU law, the government said Britain would introduce new domestic legislation via a customs bill later this year.\n\nThis legislation would seek to ensure British law remains as consistent as possible with EU law, but will also give the government powers to operate standalone customs, tax and excise systems in the event Britain and the EU fail to reach a deal.\n\nNO DEAL SCENARIO\n\nBritain said that while it hoped to reach a negotiated agreement with the EU, it was also looking at ways to mitigate the impact of not reaching a deal. It said that it expected a \"no deal\" scenario would mean:\n\n- Britain would treat trade with the EU as it currently treats trade with non-EU countries and apply customs duties and import tax on EU imports\n\n- Britain would require traders to be registered, with those exporting to the EU needing to submit export declarations and some goods may need export licences\n\n- The EU would apply the same customs rules and tax to imports from Britain that it applies to non-EU countries\n\n(Reporting by Kylie MacLellan; Editing by Gareth Jones)", "id": "9276657", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-15", "title": "Britain's proposals for post-Brexit customs agreement with EU", "image": null, "extractedDates": [{"imp": true, "textStart": 8, "date": "2017-08-15", "amb": false, "textEnd": 14}, {"textStart": 388, "date": "2019-03-", "amb": false, "textEnd": 398}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-15", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 5, "id": "76", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 4, "id": "86522", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "European Union law"}, "id": "303046", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union_law"}, {"label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "id": "303064", "score": 4, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union"}, {"label": {"eng": "Export"}, "id": "303403", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Export"}, {"label": {"eng": "Trade"}, "id": "303410", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade"}, {"label": {"eng": "Member state of the European Union"}, "id": "303880", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_state_of_the_European_Union"}, {"label": {"eng": "Tax"}, "id": "304014", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax"}, {"label": {"eng": "Customs"}, "id": "304875", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customs"}, {"label": {"eng": "International trade"}, "id": "307061", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_trade"}, {"label": {"eng": "Import"}, "id": "307363", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Import"}, {"label": {"eng": "Border"}, "id": "308560", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Border"}, {"label": {"eng": "Tariff"}, "id": "309353", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tariff"}, {"label": {"eng": "Schengen Area"}, "id": "309629", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schengen_Area"}, {"label": {"eng": "Trade agreement"}, "id": "313703", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_agreement"}, {"label": {"eng": "Excise"}, "id": "315026", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excise"}, {"label": {"eng": "Customs union"}, "id": "382637", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customs_union"}, {"label": {"eng": "Withdrawal from the European Union"}, "id": "410168", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Withdrawal_from_the_European_Union"}, {"label": {"eng": "European Union Customs Union"}, "id": "470058", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union_Customs_Union"}, {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom withdrawal from the European Union"}, "id": "1268836", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_withdrawal_from_the_European_Union"}], "location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "type": "place"}, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 140, "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 147, "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Customer Management", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Customer_Management"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 269, "label": "dmoz/Business/International Business and Trade", "uri": "dmoz/Business/International_Business_and_Trade"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 585, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Home and Garden/Furniture", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Home_and_Garden/Furniture"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 682, "label": "dmoz/Business/Customer Service", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Customer_Service"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 828, "label": "dmoz/Business/International Business and Trade/Import and Export", "uri": "dmoz/Business/International_Business_and_Trade/Import_and_Export"}], "time": "12:38:00"}

"isDuplicate": false, "storyUri": "eng-3358827", "body": "Theresa May is expected to arrive back in Downing Street on Thursday as ministers spend the week fleshing out details of their hopes for Britain's future with the EU after Brexit.\n\nThe Government will spell out its aims for new customs arrangements after the UK has quit the bloc in documents released by Brexit Secretary David Davis.\n\nA position paper on the fraught issue of the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic is also due to be published later this week.\n\nIt comes as Mrs May i s expected to be back at her desk on Thursday after holidays in Europe totalling around three weeks.\n\nThe Prime Minister enjoyed a break in Italy lasting nearly a week at the end of July and is now away with husband Philip in Switzerland.\n\nThe Government has faced complaints from Brussels over a lack of clarity on the British negotiating position on Brexit.\n\nDowning Street said it was clear the talks had shown that the divorce could only be settled with in light of the future relationship with the EU.\n\nThe Prime Minister's official spokesman said: \"We had the first rounds of the negotiation and those talks have shown that many of the withdrawal questions can only be settled in light of the future partnership, so now is the time to set out our approach to that partnership to inform the upcoming negotiations and to provide citizens and businesses at home and across Europe with a deeper understanding of our thinking.\"\n\nEU chief negotiator Michel Barnier is reported to have warned his first two rounds of talks with Mr Davis, covering the opening issues of the Irish border, the rights of EU citizens in the UK, and Britain's \"divorce bill\", had made limited progress.\n\nMeanwhile, The Times said the slow progress so far had led to complaints in Whitehall that senior officials were now trying to rush through decisions in an attempt to break the policy logjam.\n\nThere were said to be concerns that Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood and the Permanent Secretary at the Department for Exiting the EU were railroading issues through at a time when many ministers were away, leading to poor decision-making.\n\nBut following a summer marked by speculation over a possible leadership challenge and jostling for position among senior ministers over Brexit, there was some respite for the Prime Minister with an apparent truce between two of the leading protagonists.\n\nChancellor Philip Hammond, who favours a \"soft\", pro-business Brexit, and the Brexiteer International Development Secretary Liam Fox signed up to a joint statement at the weekend agreeing that there would have to be a transition period after Britain has left the EU.\n\nThey agreed that while the measure was necessary to ensure there was no \"cliff-edge\" break for businesses, it would be time-limited and that Britain would leave the EU single market and the customs union when it left the bloc.\n\nSenior Conservative MP Bernard Jenkin welcomed unity in the Cabinet and questioned why the EU would not treat the UK the same as other countries who have no free trade deal with the bloc but have agreements over aviation services, customs facilitation and product recognition.\n\nMr Jenkin, chairman of the Public Administration and Constitutional Affairs Committee, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"Why wouldn't they afford us the same kind of reasonable arrangements unless they want to punish us?\n\n\"And if they want to punish us, should we be intimidated by their determination to punish us?\n\n\"Are they such a dysfunctional and destructive organisation that they would punish themselves as well as us by imposing such a ridiculous scenario - and of course they won't.\"\n\nCopyright (c) Press Association Ltd. 2017, All Rights Reserved.", "id": "9086488", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-14", "title": "Theresa May heads back as ministers flesh out aims for

That's the sort of thing I would expect.\"\n\nHe insisted the law was on Britain's side, because the \"duty of sincere co-operation\" - the bar on customs union members negotiating other deals - would lapse with EU withdrawal.\n\n\"Once 2019 comes around and we leave, that legal duty goes away,\" the Brexit Secretary argued.\n\nThe stance appears to guarantee a confrontation when the exit negotiations resume with Michel Barnier, the EU's chief negotiator, at the end of the month.\n\nIt is certain to provoke fresh accusations that the Government is trying to \"have their cake and eat it\" in the exit talks. In a later interview, on LBC radio, Mr Davis admitted: \"Michel's getting quite cross with us.\"\n\nIt is also possible that the EU will refuse to discuss the plan at all - having insisted the UK must first settle its priorities; citizens' rights, the so-called \"divorce bill\" and the Northern Ireland border.\n\nIn the interview, Mr Davis was careful not to rule out Britain making some payments to the EU after 2019, as part of the transitional deal now being sought.\n\nHowever, he insisted it would not be the current \"\u00a310bn a year\" - appearing to rule out the \u00a336bn, three-year financial settlement thought to be under discussion.\n\nAnd he rejected suggestions that Britain had failed to put forward proposals until 14 months after the EU referendum, saying of the negotiation: \"It's going incredibly well.\"\n\nMr Davis also rejected suggestions that Britain would have to make significant concessions to get what it wants, insisting: \"The benefit goes two ways.\"\n\nArguing huge customs queues would also damage EU businesses, he added: \"I make no apology for being ambitious.

Aug. 15 (Xinhua) -- Opposition politicians in Britain on Tuesday criticised government proposals for an interim trading deal with the European Union (EU), but business leaders welcomed the proposals, saying that if accepted by Brussels, it would avoid a \"cliff edge\" in March 2019 when Britain leaves the EU.\n\nBrexit Secretary David Davis wants a tariff-free interim customs arrangement to start when Britain ends its EU membership.\n\nIt would mean current exporting and importing arrangements would continue virtually unchanged to enable a permanent deal to eventually be agreed by both sides.\n\nThe new paper was released as the first in a series of documents to be published in order to outline Britain's position on major issues of Brexit.\n\nLabour's Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, described Davis's proposals as \"incoherent and inadequate,\" saying they were designed to gloss over deep and continuing divisions within British Prime Minister Theresa May's cabinet.\n\n\"Businesses, trade unions and the country need certainty about our future trading and customs arrangements,\" Starmer said. \"Instead, the cabinet remain split on key issues and cannot decide between two very different but equally unachievable options.\"\n\nThe first proposal which suggests \"a new customs border with the EU\" could be introduced without disrupting trade; the second suggests a new borderless customs partnership could somehow be agreed while Britain also signs external trade deals.\n\n\"These fantastical and contradictory proposals provide no guidance for negotiators or certainty for businesses,\" he said. \"The proposals also make it less likely that necessary transitional arrangements will be in place by March 2019.\"\n\nFor his part, Nicola Sturgeon, first minister of the Scottish Parliament and leader of the Scottish Nationalist Party, said, \"It seems the UK government is back to its daft 'have your cake and eat it' approach to Brexit.\n\nSturgeon added that the British government should commit to staying in the EU single market and the customs union.\n\nOne of the strongest attacks came from Nigel Farage, founder and former leader of UKIP, the party set up to campaign for Britain to leave the EU.\n\nFarage, who sits as a British member in the European Parliament said: \"We might find ourselves 10 years down the road from Brexit having not got what we wanted.\"\n\n\"There's no doubt that during this transitional period, the free movement of people will continue, the European Court of Justice will go on having judgements over British business and, of course, we'll go on paying a membership fee,\" Farage said. \"None of those things are acceptable to Brexit voters in any way at all.\"\n\nTom Blake, Brexit spokesman for the minority Liberal Democrat party. said the government's customs union proposal would delay the economic pain caused by leaving the customs union.\n\nBlake said: \"We still face the prospect of more red tape for businesses, longer queues at our borders and higher prices for consumers once the transition comes to an end.\"\n\nBusiness leaders in Britain, however, broadly welcomed the official proposals, saying it will avoid a feared \"cliff edge\" if no post-2019 export and import arrangements are in place.\n\nJosh Hardie, deputy director-general of the Confederation of British Industry (CBI), said: \"Companies will welcome the progress the government has made today in publishing these papers.\"\n\n\"It's encouraging to see that these papers propose a time-limited interim period and a customs system that is as barrier-free as possible,\" he said.\n\nHardie said business wants to see as frictionless a customs system as possible, with a strong emphasis on digital systems that make it easier to trade.\n\nNew round of talks between the British government and EU negotiators are due to resume at the end of this month.", "id": "9309836", "details": {}, "date":

But it will also seek the right to negotiate other trade deals, a possible sticking point in the talks. According to excerpts of a government document to be published on Tuesday setting out Britain's strategy, the government will say one option to minimise friction when it leaves the bloc in March 2019 would be to introduce a temporary customs union which should be \"time-limited\". That would provide certainty for businesses, the government said, aiming to address a main concern of companies who fear the introduction of customs checks will cause expensive delays. \"Ministers will announce an intention to seek an 'interim' period with the EU of close association with the customs union that would allow for a smooth and orderly transfer to the new regime,\" the government said in a statement ahead of publication of the first in a series of \"future partnership papers\". \"One possible approach would be a temporary customs union between the UK and the EU ... During this interim period, which will be negotiated with Brussels, Britain will look to negotiate bold new trade relationships around the world.\" Businesses welcomed the proposals, but the Confederation of British Industry also warned the government that \"the clock is ticking and what matters now if giving companies the confidence to continue investing as quickly as possible\". Prime Minister Theresa May and her government are keen to move the talks with the EU forward to tackle the future relationship rather than focusing only on their divorce, and have promised to publish a series of policy documents this week. But after being criticised by some EU officials for being ill-prepared for the first rounds of negotiations, the government's demand to secure trade deals while participating in a temporary customs union may cause further problems. \"It looks like the new unified position in the cabinet is to return the government to the territory of wanting to have their cake and eat it,\" said Chris Leslie, a pro-EU campaigner and member of Britain's opposition Labour Party. Countries that are part of the EU's customs union are not allowed to negotiate bilateral trade deals and May's government has said Brexit means Britain must leave the customs union. But Turkey, while not an EU member, is part of a separate customs union for industrial goods and can still negotiate bilateral trade deals. It was not clear whether Britain was pursuing a similar arrangement to Turkey. The government said that by sorting out the customs arrangements, Britain and the bloc could avoid a \"hard border\" with EU member state Ireland, something which officials fear could reignite tensions between Irish nationalists and unionists. It proposed two different ways -- a highly streamlined customs arrangement managed by Britain, or a new customs partnership with the EU, which could \"negate the need for a customs border\". Its proposals on a future customs arrangement are set out in one of several position papers intended to flesh out the government's Brexit vision and show a united stance over the future relationship after rifts emerged among ministers. On Wednesday, the government will set out its solutions for the border between Northern Ireland and Ireland.

Supposedly he was looking for a compromise to keep Britain within the customs union and single market as long as possible,\" he said.\n\n\"The rebellion didn't last very long. He has now teamed up with one of the more extreme and ideological supporters of a 'hard Brexit'. It is now painfully clear who calls the shots in the Cabinet; it isn't the Chancellor.\"\n\nIn contrast, the joint move was welcomed by the pro-Brexit Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson who said it was the \"right way forward\".\n\n\"Create certainty and great new European relationship. Get job done + on with Global Britain,\" he wrote on Twitter.\n\nIn their article, Mr Hammond and Dr Fox said a transition period was needed to give businesses confidence they would be able to carry on trading normally.\n\n\"That is why we believe a time-limited interim period will be important to further our national interest and give business greater certainty - but it cannot be indefinite; it cannot be a back door to staying in the EU,\" they wrote.\n\n\"We are both clear that during this period the UK will be outside the customs union and will be a 'third country', not a party to EU treaties.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the leading Conservative Remainer Anna Soubry indicated she could be prepared to join with politicians from other parties to stop the country \"staggering recklessly\" towards a hard break with Brussels.\n\n\"Could I ever see myself joining with like-minded people who want to save our country from such an appalling fate? And has that moment arrived yet?\" she wrote in an article for The Mail on Sunday.\n\n\"The answer to the first question is 'it is not impossible'; the answer to the second is 'no'. But I would be betraying my principles if I did not make it clear that country must always come before party.\"\n\nBrexit Secretary David Davis said exactly how the transitional arrangements would work had still to be determined.\n\n\"By triggering Article 50 in March of this year we leave in March 2019, what the transition period will look like is down to the negotiations,\" he said during a surprise appearance at Alex Salmond's show at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe.\n\nHowever Labour MP Ben Bradshaw, a supporter of the Open Britain campaign, said that without membership of the single market and the customs union, the country would be worse off.\n\n\"Pulling Britain out of the single market and the customs union in 2019 will drive our economy over a cliff edge, putting jobs and family finances at risk,\" he said.\n\n\"Nobody voted to be poorer last year but that is exactly what will happen if the Government continues to put Eurosceptic dogma ahead of the national interest.\"\n\nCopyright (c) Press Association Ltd. 2017, All Rights Reserved.", "id": "8948606", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-13", "title": "Philip Hammond accused of surrender to hard line

Speculation is mounting that Mr Davis's proposal will hit the UK with a significant bill.\n\nIn a string of media interviews, the senior Tory said he would not discuss negotiations \"on air\" but failed to rule out that there would be a price to pay for maintaining Britain's place in a temporary customs union.\n\nHe told LBC radio: \"The aim is to say [International Trade Secretary] Liam Fox wants to start signing deals with the rest of the world but we want to keep for a short while an arrangement whereby we can sell to you and you can sell to us unfettered at the customs border.\"\n\nAsked if the UK would be happy to pay for that privilege, he said: \"I'm not going to do those negotiations on air.\n\n\"As you well know we're having a long haggle on the money at the moment. It's the tenser part of the negotiations that's going on.\"\n\nHe told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"What we are not going to do, let's be clear, we are not going to continue the \u00a310 billion a year net contributions we currently have.\"\n\nPushed on whether money could be part of the negotiations, he said: \"I didn't say that. Wait and see.\" Mr Davis said because the EU exports \u20ac290 billion worth of goods and services to the UK, the proposal is in Brussels' interest and to their benefit.\n\nEU leaders are yet to respond to Mr Davis's suggestion.\n\nHe said: \"This is an ambitious aim but we think we can deliver it. It's also going to take some tough times.\n\n\"I think there's going to be some hardball on both sides. We'll get through it. We can see strong reasons for them wanting to deliver it too. There is no legal basis to say we can't do it.\"\n\nBritain will only be able to legally implement new trade deals after it has left the EU in 2019 and once the proposed transitional period comes to an end. Mr Davis said this could be under two years.\n\nKarel de Gucht, European commissioner for trade between 2010 and 2014, told the BBC it was technically possible for the UK to sign its own trade deals and implement them after a transitional period. However, he said \"politically it's very difficult\" because Britain would be \"undercutting\" the EU at the same time.\n\nHe said: \"It would be trying to get preferential tariffs with other nations, different from the common EU tariff in the transitional period.\"\n\nMr Davis said EU negotiations were going \"incredibly well\" so far, and suggested the amount of money Britain may have to pay the EU to leave -- the so-called Brexit divorce bill -- could be known after November.\n\nCriticism that the Government has been unclear on where it is heading with Brexit was dismissed by Mr Davis as \"constructive ambiguity\" and a natural feature of a negotiation.\n\nThe proposals for new customs arrangements immediately after Brexit were outlined in the first of a series of \"future partnership\" papers being released by the Government.\n\nOne option being put forward for a transitional period would see the UK manage a new customs border with administration streamlined by using new technologies.\n\nThe other plan floated is for a customs partnership with the EU which would entirely negate the need for a customs border between the UK and the rest of the bloc.\n\nThe European Commission has so far issued a lukewarm reaction to Mr Davis's proposals. A spokesman said Britain's vision for \"frictionless trade\" was not possible outside the single market and customs union.\n\nAlthough their officials have taken note of Britain's request for a transitional period, the Commission will only address the request when progress is made on the terms of withdrawal.", "id": "9258549", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-15", "title": "David Davis refuses to rule out UK paying to strike trade deals", "image": "https://www.standard.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/08/15/11/brexit.jpg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-15", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 5, "id": "76", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "Kingdom of Belgium"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Brussels"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 3, "id": "102303", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brussels", "label": {"eng": "Brussels"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "BBC"}, "id": "302926", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC"}, {"label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "id": "303064", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union"}, {"label": {"eng": "Export"}, "id": "303403", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Export"}, {"label": {"eng": "Trade"}, "id": "303410", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade"}, {"label": {"eng": "European Commission"}, "id": "303458", "score": 1, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Commission"}, {"label": {"eng": "Member state of the European Union"}, "id": "303880", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_state_of_the_European_Union"}, {"label": {"eng": "Customs"}, "id": "304875", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customs"}, {"label": {"eng": "Tariff"}, "id": "309353", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tariff"}, {"label": {"eng": "Today (BBC Radio 4)"}, "id": "312757", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Today_(BBC_Radio_4)"}, {"label": {"eng": "BBC Radio 4"}, "id": "329154", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_Radio_4"}, {"label": {"eng": "Liam Fox"}, "id": "330676", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liam_Fox"}, {"label": {"eng": "Customs union"}, "id": "382637", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customs_union"}, {"label": {"eng": "European Commissioner"}, "id": "439077", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Commissioner"}, {"label": {"eng": "European Union Customs Union"}, "id": "470058", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union_Customs_Union"}, {"label": {"eng": "Karel De Gucht"}, "id": "761228", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karel_De_Gucht"}, {"label": {"eng": "Constructive ambiguity"}, "id": "1126495", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructive_ambiguity"}, {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom withdrawal from the European Union"}, "id": "1268836", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_withdrawal_from_the_European_Union"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 108, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 139, "label": "dmoz/Society/Government", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Government"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 140, "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 269, "label": "dmoz/Business/International Business and Trade", "uri": "dmoz/Business/International_Business_and_Trade"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 479, "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day Trading", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day_Trading"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 722, "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Commodities and Futures", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Commodities_and_Futures"}], "time": "10:33:00"}

revealed this morning her summer break would be extended into its fourth week.\n\nShe had been expected to return from her trips to the continent this morning ahead the publication of papers outlining the UK's position on crucial EU issues.\n\nBut Number 10 told reporters she was not yet back in work - but claimed the PM's vacation was not longer than previously planned because she had worked in middle of it.\n\nMrs May broke off from her three-week trip to attend the Passchendaele centenary commemorations in Belgium a fortnight ago.\n\nSo despite leaving on July 21, aides insist she will still have only taken 15 working days off by the time she gets back behind her desk in Downing Street.\n\nIt comes as ministers prepare to flesh out their negotiating position on the fraught issue of the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic.\n\nThe document on the Government's stance is expected to include an offer of continued free movement for Irish nationals in and out of the UK once Britain has left the EU in March 2019.\n\nThere will then be a further series of papers in the run up to the European Council in Brussels in October, setting out a vision of Britain's future relations with the EU, including the crucial issue of the post-Brexit customs arrangements.\n\nThe move comes amid complaints from Brussels about a lack of clarity about the British negotiating position.\n\nEU chief negotiator Michel Barnier is reported to have warned his first two rounds of talks with Brexit Secretary David Davis, covering the opening issues of the Irish border, the rights of EU citizens in the UK, and Britain's \"divorce bill\", had made limited progress.\n\nMinisters hope the release of the position papers will convince the EU side that they will be ready to move on to the next phase of the negotiations, including a new free trade deal with the bloc, in the autumn.\n\nMeanwhile a report in The Times said the slow progress so far had led to complaints in Whitehall that senior officials were now trying to rush through decisions in an attempt to break the policy logjam.\n\nThere were said to be concerns that Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood and the Permanent Secretary at the Department for Exiting the EU were railroading through issues at a time when many ministers were away, leading to poor decision-making.\n\nBut there was better news foe the PM yesterday when at the end of a difficult summer marked by a damaging rift among senior ministers over Brexit, there was an apparent truce between two of the leading protagonists.\n\nChancellor Philip

partnership.\n\nBritain says its membership of the EU customs union, which currently allows for the tariff-free movement of goods, will end along with its membership of the single market when it leaves the bloc in March 2019.\n\nThe Department for Exiting the EU said it will seek to agree a \"time-limited period of implementation\" to provide certainty for businesses and allow for new customs arrangements to be set up.\n\n\"One possible approach would be a temporary customs union between the UK and the EU,\" it said in a statement, ahead of the publication of the full paper later on Tuesday.\n\nExperts have warned it will be extremely difficult to negotiate a new EU-UK free trade agreement before Britain leaves the bloc -- particularly as Brussels has so far refused even to start trade talks.\n\nIt says there must be broad agreement first on three key issues -- Britain's financial settlement, the issue of expatriate rights, and the question of the border between British-controlled Northern Ireland and Ireland.\n\nBritain will publish its proposals on the border issue on Wednesday, ahead of the third round of Brexit negotiations in Brussels at the end of the month.\n\nOfficials in London believe the border is inextricably linked to the customs issue.\n\nAfter Brexit, the Irish border will be Britain's only land border with the EU.\n\nThere are fears that the reintroduction of physical checkpoints could upset the fragile balance of peace in Northern Ireland.\n\nBritain's membership of the EU customs union precludes it from striking its own trade deals, and the government made clear Tuesday that such freedom was crucial to its post-Brexit plans.\n\n\"During this interim period, which will be negotiated with Brussels, Britain will look to negotiate bold new trade relationships around the world,\" it said.\n\nThe statement added: \"Our goal is to secure as frictionless trade as possible with the EU alongside the ability to forge trade deals around the world.\"\n\nHowever, opposition Labour lawmaker Chris Leslie, from the campaign group Open Britain, said the proposal represented \"wishful thinking of the highest order\".\n\n\"It is a fantasy to pretend we can have the freest and most frictionless trade possible with our largest partner when the government remain intent on pulling Britain out of the customs union,\" he said.",

Supposedly he was looking for a compromise to keep Britain within the customs union and single market as long as possible,\" he said.\n\n\"The rebellion didn't last very long. He has now teamed up with one of the more extreme and ideological supporters of a 'hard Brexit'. It is now painfully clear who calls the shots in the Cabinet; it isn't the Chancellor.\"\n\nREAD MORE - David Davis wins over nationalists at Alex Salmond Fringe show\n\nIn contrast, the joint move was welcomed by the pro-Brexit Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson who said it was the \"right way forward\".\n\n\"Create certainty and great new European relationship. Get job done + on with Global Britain,\" he wrote on Twitter.\n\nIn their article, Mr Hammond and Dr Fox said a transition period was needed to give businesses confidence they would be able to carry on trading normally.\n\n\"That is why we believe a time-limited interim period will be important to further our national interest and give business greater certainty - but it cannot be indefinite; it cannot be a back door to staying in the EU,\" they wrote.\n\n\"We are both clear that during this period the UK will be outside the customs union and will be a 'third country', not a party to EU treaties.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the leading Conservative Remainer Anna Soubry indicated she could be prepared to join with politicians from other parties to stop the country \"staggering recklessly\" towards a hard break with Brussels.\n\n\"Could I ever see myself joining with like-minded people who want to save our country from such an appalling fate? And has that moment arrived yet?\" she wrote in an article for The Mail on Sunday.\n\n\"The answer to the first question is 'it is not impossible'; the answer to the second is 'no'. But I would be betraying my principles if I did not make it clear that country must always come before party.\"\n\nBrexit Secretary David Davis said exactly how the transitional arrangements would work had still to be determined.\n\n\"By triggering Article 50 in March of this year we leave in March 2019, what the transition period will look like is down to the negotiations,\" he said during a surprise appearance at Alex Salmond's show at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe.\n\nHowever Labour MP Ben Bradshaw, a supporter of the Open Britain campaign, said that without membership of the single market and the customs union, the country would be worse off.\n\n\"Pulling Britain out of the single market and the customs union in 2019 will drive our economy over a cliff edge, putting jobs and family finances at risk,\" he said.\n\n\"Nobody voted to be poorer last year but that is exactly what will happen if the Government continues to put Eurosceptic dogma ahead of the national

arrangement\" it wants to secure with the EU after Brexit.\n\nMinisters said the plans would mean the \"freest and most frictionless possible trade\" with the rest of Europe.\n\nThis could include a \"temporary customs union\" after Brexit to prevent border problems as the UK leaves the EU.\n\nBusinesses have called for clarity since the UK said it was leaving the customs union - the EU's tariff-free trading area - as part of Brexit.\n\nThe customs union document is the first of a series of papers to be published by the UK government on key negotiation issues.\n\nOn Wednesday it is expected to set out proposals for the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.\n\nCountries in the customs union don't impose tariffs - taxes on imports - on each other's goods.\n\nEvery country inside the union levies the same tariffs on imports from abroad.\n\nSo, for example, a 10% tariff is imposed on some cars imported from outside the customs union, while 7.5% is imposed on roasted coffee.\n\nOther goods - such as soap or slate - have no tariffs.\n\nThe UK's departure from the EU's customs union was confirmed at the weekend in a joint article by Chancellor Philip Hammond and Trade Secretary Liam Fox.\n\nAccording to the newly-published government paper, the UK could ask Brussels to establish a \"temporary customs union\" after it leaves the EU in March 2019.\n\nBut during this period, it would also expect to be able to negotiate its own international trade deals - something it cannot do as an EU customs union member.\n\nOnce this period expires, the UK will look to agree either a \"highly streamlined\" border with the EU, or a new \"partnership\" with no customs border at all.\n\nThe government said the interim arrangements would mean businesses would only have to adjust once to the new arrangements.\n\nAll of this will have to be negotiated with the EU - and the two sides have not yet even started discussing trade matters.\n\nOther obstacles - including the size of the UK's \"divorce bill\" - need to be agreed first.\n\nKeir Starmer, Labour's shadow Brexit secretary, said the proposals were \"incoherent and inadequate\" and were designed to \"gloss over deep and continuing divisions within the cabinet\".\n\n\"These fantastical and contradictory proposals provide no guidance for negotiators or certainty for businesses,\" he added.\n\nLiberal Democrat Brexit spokesman Tom Brake said the plan would \"only delay the economic pain caused by leaving the customs union\".\n\n\"We still face the prospect of more red tape for businesses, longer queues at our borders and higher prices for consumers once the transition comes to an end.\"\n\nHowever, the CBI, which represents British businesses, said the proposal was \"encouraging\".\n\nIts deputy director general, Josh Hardie, added: \"The clock is ticking and what matters now is giving companies the confidence to continue investing as quickly as possible.\"\n\nAdam Fleming, BBC Brussels reporter, said the UK was seeking a customs union agreement \"that will keep things broadly the same for an interim period - an attempt to reassure business\".\n\n\"Firms will be told they'll only have to change their processes once,\" he said.\n\n\"In Brussels, EU negotiators are likely to stick to their position that that the future relationship can't be considered until agreement has been reached on their priority issues - the rights of citizens, a financial settlement and the Irish border.\"\n\nBBC political correspondent Ben Wright said the UK government was \"straining to show that it does have a route-map for Brexit\".\n\nHe said ministers were also attempting to \"subtly\" put the issue onto the negotiating table sooner than Brussels wants.\n\n\"They want to hustle EU negotiators into talking about trade much sooner than Brussels intends,\" our correspondent said.", "id": "9204408", "details": {"liCnt": 122},

It operates under the pretence that we can leave the biggest free trade bloc on earth, which buys nearly half of everything we sell as a country, without damaging the economy or putting jobs at risk. And it assumes that we can negotiate the same benefits as being in the EU customs union while leaving it. This just isn't tenable. I believe, along with many MPs from across the House of Commons, that the only way to retain these benefits is to stay within the customs union.\n\nThese discussions about customs arrangements might sound technical and dull, but they are of vital importance. British exports to the EU are worth over \u00a3200bn a year to our economy, supporting millions of jobs. As part of the customs union, these exports are completely free and frictionless. Our companies do not need to pay tariffs when they export to Europe, meaning that selling a British car in Berlin is as simple as selling it in Birmingham. And they do not face time-consuming, costly customs checks on every product they sell to the EU.\n\nThe government's position paper seems to be pretending that these benefits can be retained despite leaving the customs union. They say that they are seeking to achieve \"the most frictionless customs arrangement anywhere in the world\". Well, Britain is already a part of that, and it is called the customs union. The idea that Britain can leave that organisation, negotiate the exact same benefits as membership, and then go around negotiating new trade deals with other countries, is just nonsense.\n\nThe European Union has been quite clear about this. In response to the government's paper, the European Commission stated the fact that \"frictionless trade is not possible outside the single market and customs union\". Guy Verhofstadt, the European Parliament's point person on Brexit, dismissed the Government's plan as \"a fantasy\". I want Britain to get the best deal possible, one that ensures that our economy is undamaged and jobs are not lost. But for that to happen, we need to adopt positions based on the reality of the negotiation, rather than wish lists that are dismissed the moment they are released.\n\nIt is true that the government has effectively conceded we will stay in the customs union for a transitional period, likely to last two years, after we are meant to leave the EU in March 2019. This is a welcome victory for the realists in cabinet, like Philip Hammond, and a defeat for those who until recently were talking of a clean break at the end of the Article 50 period. But all this proposal does is shift the cliff edge for businesses back from 2019 to 2021. As to the future of UK-EU customs after that point, the government's proposals are incredibly vague, and seem to rely on new technology emerging to minimise customs checks on goods passing across the Channel. Transition is a stay of execution, but nothing more than that.\n\nWe should be absolutely clear that the only way to preserve free and frictionless trade with the European Union is continued membership of the customs union, as well as the single market. Only that can ensure that Brexit will not damage our economy and put jobs at risk. As a matter of urgency, the government must change course and put these options back on the table in the Brexit negotiations.", "id": "9310015", "details": {"liCnt": 20}, "date": "2017-08-15",

In reality, certainly since the 2017 General Election, this has meant remaining in the Customs Union or something as close to it as possible, preferably in the long run but certainly during any implementation period, after the UK leaves the EU.\n\n\"That message has been central to the many discussions that BIFA has had with those in Government and we welcome the fact that the document acknowledges the work put in by ourselves and other trade associations to help increase awareness of the issues and potential impact of the introduction of tariff and non-tariff barriers.\"\n\nThe document outlines two basic options for the future EU-UK customs arrangements. One that is highly streamlined, keeping the additional requirements for EU-UK trade to a minimum, but which from reading the document does imply that some form of customs declaration will be required.\n\nThe second, which is more closely aligned to BIFA's current policy proposes a new customs partnership with the EU, which is very radical and has not been tried before. This would remove the need for customs processes at the border, although there would be a need to align UK and EU customs procedures.\n\nKeen adds: \"The second option would certainly resolve the Dover Straits issue, as well as that of Northern/Southern Ireland trade.\n\n\"Unfortunately, what the paper cannot address is the fact that, so far, the EU has made clear it will not discuss Britain's future trading relationship - including customs arrangements - until it has reached agreement on several key issues, including the terms of the financial payments Britain will make on exit, the rights of citizens, and the future status of the border in Northern Ireland.\n\n\"To accommodate any of the proposals laid out in today's paper, EU negotiators would have to change that stance and it will be interesting to see if that happens, or whether those on the EU side of negotiations determine that the UK is trying to have its cake and eat it.\n\n\"Commentators suggest that in seeking a customs union agreement that will keep things broadly the same for an interim period, the UK government is attempting to reassure UK businesses that undertake visible trade with Europe.\n\n\"As always, the devil is in the detail. BIFA will continue to work with government to find out more details on how today's proposals will avoid the imposition of tariffs, border checks, Customs declarations and bureaucracy for UK businesses trading within the EU, as well as BIFA members, which provide the logistics services that underpin the UK's visible trade.\"", "id": "9715576", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-15", "title": "Freight forwarders want more detail on Customs proposals", "image": null, "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 5, "id": "76", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Northern Ireland"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 2, "id": "85555", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland", "label": {"eng": "Northern Ireland"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": null, "score": 1, "id": "303048", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "id": "303064", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union"}, {"label": {"eng": "Trade"}, "id": "303410", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade"}, {"label": {"eng": "Government of the United Kingdom"}, "id": "304310", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_the_United_Kingdom"}, {"label": {"eng": "Customs"}, "id": "304875", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customs"}, {"label": {"eng": "Logistics"}, "id": "308152", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistics"}, {"label": {"eng": "Border"}, "id": "308560", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Border"}, {"label": {"eng": "Tariff"}, "id": "309353", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tariff"}, {"label": {"eng": "Trade association"}, "id": "324766", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_association"}, {"label": {"eng": "Single market"}, "id": "326525", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_market"}, {"label": {"eng": "Freight forwarder"}, "id": "332729", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freight_forwarder"}, {"label": {"eng": "Eurasian Customs Union"}, "id": "340949", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurasian_Customs_Union"}, {"location": null, "score": 2, "id": "355615", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strait_of_Dover", "label": {"eng": "Strait of Dover"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Customs union"}, "id": "382637", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customs_union"}, {"label": {"eng": "Non-tariff barriers to trade"}, "id": "395939", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-tariff_barriers_to_trade"}, {"label": {"eng": "British Independent Film Awards"}, "id": "497602", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Independent_Film_Awards"}, {"label": {"eng": "British International Freight Association"}, "id": "497603", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_International_Freight_Association"}, {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom withdrawal from the European Union"}, "id": "1268836", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_withdrawal_from_the_European_Union"}, {"label": {"eng": "Southern Ireland (1921\u201322)"}, "id": "1334574", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Ireland_(1921\u201322)"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 108, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 269, "label": "dmoz/Business/International Business and Trade", "uri": "dmoz/Business/International_Business_and_Trade"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 479, "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day Trading", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day_Trading"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 722, "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Commodities and Futures", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Commodities_and_Futures"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 723, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Trading", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Trading"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 900, "label": "dmoz/Business/Transportation and Logistics/Freight Forwarding", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Transportation_and_Logistics/Freight_Forwarding"}], "time": "15:17:00"}

It is one of the three key priority strand-one negotiating topics on which \"substantial progress\" needs to be made if talks on the trade issue are to open in October.\n\nThe customs paper from the UK's Department for Exiting the European Union (DExEU) is one of 12 detailing the UK's negotiating positions expected ahead of October.\n\nIt makes clear that the UK will leave both the EU single market and customs union, but suggests two possible forms of tailor-made customs relationships to replace them.\n\nThe paper's case for a transition period to allow both the EU and the UK to avoid a Brexit cliff-face in 2019 has been welcomed by business interests.\n\nUnder the proposals, Britain would leave the existing EU customs union, but would maintain a \"close association\" for a limited period in order to give both sides time to put in place new border checks and infrastructure.\n\nBut such a close association would only be possible, EU officials say, if the UK did not seek during that period to forge bilateral trade relationships with others.\n\nThe UK paper proposes two long-term options to replace the customs union: \"The Highly Streamlined Customs Arrangement\" and the \"New Customs Partnership with the EU.\"\n\nThe \"streamlined\" model would see the UK manage a new customs border with the EU, unilaterally simplifying requirements on EU goods entering the country as much as possible and providing border \"facilitations\" to reduce and remove trade barriers.\n\n\"The UK would put in place new negotiated and potentially unilateral facilitations to reduce and remove barriers to trade; and implement technology-based solutions to make it easier to comply with customs procedures,\" the paper says.\n\nSuch technology-based solutions - ranging from expansion of \"trusted trader\" schemes to number-plate recognition cameras - have been floated as means of creating a frictionless border in Ireland, although Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney recently warned they should not be seen as a solution.\n\nThe UK position paper admits the streamlined option would entail \"an increase in administration\". It may also require firms to do self-assessments of their own customs duties.\n\nThe \"partnership\" approach would mean preserving an internal border-free EU and UK with the latter imposing at the old external border the EU's tariffs, standards and rules on goods imported to trade within the broader EU.\n\nMeanwhile, it would impose its own regime on goods imported solely for the purposes of trading within the UK. That would allow the UK to begin to forge new bilateral trade relationships with third countries, the ostensible purpose of Brexit.\n\nThis complicated double import policing system would require considerable bureaucracy, customs mechanisms never used before, and a degree of trust by member states that may be difficult to achieve - as the paper puts it, \"an innovative and untested approach\".\n\nWere it deemed feasible, the partnership approach would be the closest approximation to what has been called a \"soft\" Brexit and might have an appeal to Ireland in not requiring any customs checks on the Border.\n\nBut the paper has not gone down well. In Brussels, officials have promised to study the proposals while the opposition at Westminster dismissed them.\n\n\"These are incoherent and inadequate proposals designed to gloss over deep and continuing divisions within the cabinet,\" Labour's shadow secretary of state for exiting the European Union, Keir Starmer, said in a statement.", "id": "9336117", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-15", "title": "UK position paper dashes hopes of a soft Brexit", "image": "https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3187831.1502821118!/image/image.jpg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-15", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 5, "id": "76", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 4, "id": "86522", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": null, "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 4, "id": "112932", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Police"}, "id": "302532", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police"}, {"label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "id": "303064", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union"}, {"label": {"eng": "Trade"}, "id": "303410", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade"}, {"label": {"eng": "Minister (government)"}, "id": "303435", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minister_(government)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Member state of the European Union"}, "id": "303880", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_state_of_the_European_Union"}, {"label": {"eng": "Customs"}, "id": "304875", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customs"}, {"label": {"eng": "Internal market"}, "id": "305938", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_market"}, {"label": {"eng": "Import"}, "id": "307363", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Import"}, {"label": {"eng": "Tariff"}, "id": "309353", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tariff"}, {"label": {"eng": "Schengen Area"}, "id": "309629", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schengen_Area"}, {"label": {"eng": "Bureaucracy"}, "id": "309958", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bureaucracy"}, {"label": {"eng": "Simon Coveney"}, "id": "350915", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_Coveney"}, {"label": {"eng": "Customs union"}, "id": "382637", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customs_union"}, {"label": {"eng": "Trade barrier"}, "id": "399704", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_barrier"}, {"label": {"eng": "European Union Customs Union"}, "id": "470058", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union_Customs_Union"}, {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom withdrawal from the European Union"}, "id": "1268836", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_withdrawal_from_the_European_Union"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 108, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 140, "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 147, "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Customer Management", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Customer_Management"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 269, "label": "dmoz/Business/International Business and Trade", "uri": "dmoz/Business/International_Business_and_Trade"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 315, "label": "dmoz/Business/Materials/Pulp and Paper", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Materials/Pulp_and_Paper"}], "time": "18:24:00"}

"Ministers hope they will be able to negotiate and complete trade deals with other countries during any Brexit transitional period.\n\nBut they accept they won't be able to implement them.\n\nSpeaking as the Brexit Secretary David Davis revealed future customs proposals with the EU, Government officials refused to be drawn on whether a third country trade deal could actually be signed.\n\nThis appeared to contradict an earlier promise made by Chancellor Philip Hammond and International Trade Secretary Liam Fox, who wrote in the Sunday Telegraph that once EU membership ends in March 2019, the UK would be an \"independent nation with the freedom to sign bilateral free trade agreements\".\n\nMr Davis told Sky News a temporary customs arrangement with the EU will be \"in both sides' interests\" but any transition period should not exceed two years.\n\nHe said any interim customs union was there to avoid a \"cliff-edge\" for manufacturers after Brexit.\n\nMr Davis estimated the transition period would be roughly two years - with the deadline of the next General Election in 2022 as the \"absolute maximum\".\n\nThe document sets out two broad approaches to a possible customs deal.\n\nOne aims to continue some existing arrangements the UK has with the EU, using technology to make custom requirements \"as frictionless as possible\".\n\nThe second option is without precedent, which would involve the UK mirroring the EU's requirements for imports where the final destination is the EU.\n\nThe Government also says it has contingency plans in place to deal with the possibility of no agreement.\n\nBut there are increasing concerns that all the Government's possible options mean businesses will be hit with extra red tape and increased costs.\n\nFor example, proposals for goods that do not comply with the EU's trade policy would need a \"tracking mechanism\" where traders could claim \"refunds\" if tariff trades differ.\n\nThe British Irish Chamber of Commerce responded saying it was cautious about the feasibility of some proposals being put forward in London on simplifying new trade barriers with Europe.\n\nJohn McGrane, director of the association, said the ideas were a constructive contribution to the negotiations.\n\n\"The recognition of the need for an interim period to allow for the adoption of new systems and infrastructures will be welcomed by businesses who have long warned of the dangers of leaving the Customs Union without such a transition phase,\" he said.\n\n\"It is important that this phase is as close to the status quo as possible with minimum disruption caused by tariff and non-tariff barriers.\"\n\nChief EU negotiator Michel Barnier said the two sides needed to agree on key divorce issues before moving on to the future relationship - sticking to the EU's preferred timetable.\n\nA European Commission spokesman said the UK position paper on customs would be examined carefully.\n\n\"We take note of the UK's request for an implementing period and its preferences as regards the future relationship, but we will only address them once we have made sufficient progress on the terms of the orderly withdrawal,\" the spokesman said.\n\n\"An agreement on a future relationship between the EU and the UK can only be finalised once the UK has become a third country.\n\n\"As (EU chief negotiator) Michel Barnier has said on several occasions, 'frictionless trade' is not possible outside the single market and customs union.\"\n\nGuy Verhofstadt, the European parliament's Brexit coordinator,

REUTERS / Francois Lenoir\n\nLONDON -- The UK government's proposed customs arrangements would not create \"frictionless\" trade following Brexit even if implemented in full, an expert on the customs union has told Business Insider.\n\nJoe Owens, a senior researcher at the Institute for Government, said if Britain remained a member of the customs union checks would still be required on borders as it would no longer be a member of the EU's single market.\n\nOwens said \"even if we stay in the customs union, that does not eliminate the need for checks\" because of regulation differences between the EU and an independent UK.\n\nOn Tuesday the Department for Exiting the EU (DExEU) published an official position paper on the future customs arrangement between the EU and the UK after Brexit.\n\nIt laid out plans for a transitional customs deal designed to prevent cross-border business coming to a standstill when Britain leaves the EU in March 2019, followed by a \"new\" and \"frictionless\" long-term customs arrangement, which DExEU Secretary David Davis hopes will come into effect in mid-2019.\n\nThe EU has repeatedly insisted that the UK cannot expect to enjoy \"frictionless trade\" if it is outside both the customs union and single market, despite the claims of ministers like Brexit Secretary David Davis and Trade Secretary Liam Fox. A European Commission spokesperson said on Tuesday: \"frictionless trade not possible outside the single market and customs union.\"\n\nOwens told BI that Theresa May's government will not be able to negotiate a \"frictionless\" trade relationship with the EU if the relationship is any less than Britain being a full member of both the customs union and single market.\n\nOwens said: \"If the UK and the EU diverge on their regulations in areas from agriculture, product standards around cars etc, that is a source of potential friction and the introduction of checks.\"\n\nThe introduction of checks could cause problems on the Irish border, as some kind of system of regulation would need to be introduced.\n\nOwens' remarks echoed those of Professor Anand Menon, Director at research group UK In A Changing Europe.\n\nSpeaking to BI on Tuesday, Menon, a professor of European politics at King's College London, said: \"If you're outside the single market, you'll almost certainly have to impose checks anyway... It's not true that because the Turks are in a customs union with the EU they don't have checks on their border.\"\n\nThe paper, which can be read in full here, outlines two options for the future customs arrangements:\n\nOwens said that the first option, the \"highly streamlined customs arrangement\" seems like the \"more traditional option.\"\n\n\"If you were to say 'we are leaving the single market and we're leaving the customs union and we want trade with the EU to be as frictionless as possible, what can I do?' this is the more obvious answer based on what happens now and precedent elsewhere,\" he said.\n\nOn the other hand, a new customs partnership is \"a more speculative and complicated\" option, according to Owens. \"It is really not clear how it would work in practice.\"\n\nMenon told BI that the government's decision to publish position papers this month \"seems like a sign of weakness,\" but Owens said that the EU \"will welcome the clarity on what the UK is actually looking for.\"\n\n\"Setting that out is probably quite helpful for them, it doesn't mean they're going to get onto the negotiations but presumably it would be useful for informing their thinking,\" Owens said.\n\nThe proposal of a transition period shows that \"there is a realisation that this is a huge and time-consuming task to change a customs system.\"\n\nHe said: \"The transition period loses its value the longer it takes to agree,\" as businesses and EU countries need reassurance, but it \"gets easier to negotiate the longer you leave it,\" as the cliff-edge approaches.", "id": "9427563", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-16", "title": "Customs union expert: The government's Brexit plans would never create 'frictionless' trade", "image":

Supposedly he was looking for a compromise to keep Britain within the customs union and single market as long as possible,\" he said.\n\n\"The rebellion didn't last very long. He has now teamed up with one of the more extreme and ideological supporters of a 'hard Brexit'. It is now painfully clear who calls the shots in the Cabinet; it isn't the Chancellor.\"\n\nIn contrast, the joint move was welcomed by the pro-Brexit Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson who said it was the \"right way forward\".\n\n\"Create certainty and great new European relationship. Get job done + on with Global Britain,\" he wrote on Twitter.\n\nIn their article, Mr Hammond and Dr Fox said a transition period was needed to give businesses confidence they would be able to carry on trading normally.\n\n\"That is why we believe a time-limited interim period will be important to further our national interest and give business greater certainty - but it cannot be indefinite; it cannot be a back door to staying in the EU,\" they wrote.\n\n\"We are both clear that during this period the UK will be outside the customs union and will be a 'third country', not a party to EU treaties.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the leading Conservative Remainer Anna Soubry indicated she could be prepared to join with politicians from other parties to stop the country \"staggering recklessly\" towards a hard break with Brussels.\n\n\"Could I ever see myself joining with like-minded people who want to save our country from such an appalling fate? And has that moment arrived yet?\" she wrote in an article for The Mail on Sunday.\n\n\"The answer to the first question is 'it is not impossible'; the answer to the second is 'no'. But I would be betraying my principles if I did not make it clear that country must always come before party.\"\n\nBrexit Secretary David Davis said exactly how the transitional arrangements would work had still to be determined.\n\n\"By triggering Article 50 in March of this year we leave in March 2019, what the transition period will look like is down to the negotiations,\" he said during a surprise appearance at Alex Salmond's show at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe.\n\nHowever Labour MP Ben Bradshaw, a supporter of the Open Britain campaign, said that without membership of the single market and the customs union, the country would be worse off.\n\n\"Pulling Britain out of the single market and the customs union in 2019 will drive our economy over a cliff edge, putting jobs and family finances at risk,\" he said.\n\n\"Nobody voted to be poorer last year but that is exactly what will happen if the Government continues to put Eurosceptic dogma ahead of the national interest.\"", "id": "8953070", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-13", "title": "Philip Hammond accused of surrender to hard line Brexiteers over single market", "image": "http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/northern-ireland/article36026720.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/PANews%20BT_P-369bd278-44ef-442f-af79-1667f9a4fb04_I1.jpg", "extractedDates": [{"textStart": 3339, "date": "2019-03-", "amb": false, "textEnd": 3349}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-13", "concepts": [], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 63, "label": "dmoz/Society/Work", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Work"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 140, "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 143, "label": "dmoz/Reference/Education/Colleges and Universities", "uri": "dmoz/Reference/Education/Colleges_and_Universities"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 151, "label": "dmoz/Business/Marketing and Advertising", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Marketing_and_Advertising"}], "time": "18:35:00"}

But they also want an easing out period, and at the same time they believe they should be allowed sidle up to other countries to hammer out side deals.\n\nThe ink on the position paper had barely dried when the demands were dubbed a \"fantasy\" by the European Parliament's Brexit co-ordinator, Guy Verhofstadt.\n\nOn Twitter, Mr Verhofstadt said: \"To be in & out of the Customs Union & 'invisible borders' is a fantasy. First need to secure citizens rights & a financial settlement.\"\n\nWhile Mr Verhofstadt may have signalled the need to prioritise other issues ahead of the customs union, there is no doubt that whatever agreement is reached in relation to this will have a significant impact on this country.\n\nThe customs union has meant that Ireland and the other 27 states in the EU have enjoyed free trade between countries and have also imposed the same tariff on imports from outside the EU.\n\nFor a small country like Ireland, being part of the customs union has meant being a member of a bloc of 500m people, which undoubtedly wields significant leverage in bargaining with other nations.\n\nCurrently the EU is in the middle of such negotiations with the US on the controversial Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership agreement and on a similar deal with Japan.\n\nUnderstandably, Britain would like to keep the cushy tariff-free deal between itself and all other EU countries that comes with being signed up to the customs union.\n\nThey have asked for an interim customs agreement with the EU for approximately two years after the 2019 Brexit talks deadline.\n\nThis would help soften the blow for UK businesses when Britain finally leaves.\n\nBut in a greedy move they also want to negotiate other trade deals in parallel with this -- current rules bar members of the EU customs union from making their own deals outside the bloc.\n\nEssentially, Britain could hammer out new deals with countries like Brazil to import their beef -- which under the EU customs union incurs a 20% tariff -- meaning they could import Brazilian beef at a far cheaper rate than their EU counterparts.\n\nIreland's agri-food sector, meanwhile, has a high dependence on the British market, with 40% of exports destined for the UK market annually.\n\nIrish farmers have already been severely hit by the impacts of Brexit and an influx of cheaper Brazilian beef into the UK would be a further and possibly fatal blow to many working in the agri-food industry here.\n\nThe fact that the UK is finally putting forward and publishing proposals -- 14 months after its citizens voted to leave the European Union -- has to be welcomed.\n\nThe detail of those proposals, however, will have to be toned down before a Brexit deal is reached.", "id": "9408709", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-16", "title": "Britain

The government will also ensure that decisions about how public services including the NHS are delivered for UK citizens, are made by UK governments and not by our trade partners.\"\n\nThe statement echoes promises made earlier this summer by the Defra Secretary Michael Gove, who promised to deliver a 'Green Brexit' that will uphold the UK's environmental standards.\n\nThe paper sets out a vision for the UK's trading relationship with the EU after 2019, when it is scheduled to leave the trading bloc.\n\nIt reveals plans to adopt a transitional arrangement including some form of temporary membership of the Customs Union that leaves the UK free to negotiate new free trade agreements with other countries.\n\nThe government hopes this new arrangement would eventually transition into either a \"streamlined\" customs agreement between the EU and UK that seeks to simplify and remove as many trade barriers as possible between the two parties, or a brand new customs partnership between the EU and the UK that \"removes the need for a UK-EU customs border\".\n\nThe paper also stresses the government's future approach to trade will align with its forthcoming Industrial Strategy, which is widelty expected to focus on boosting markets for clean tech innovations such as electric cars, offshore wind, and battery storage.\n\n\"The approaches we are setting out today will benefit both the EU and UK and avoid a cliff-edge for businesses and individuals on both sides,\" Brexit secretary, David Davis, said in a statement.\n\n\"The way we approach the movement of goods across our border will be a critical building block for our independent trade policy. An interim period would mean businesses only need to adjust once to the new regime and would allow for a smooth and orderly transition.\"\n\nUnder a \"streamlined\" arrangement the UK and the EU would develop new technologies to speed the passage of goods and services through UK and EU ports. The briefing paper said the UK is already developing a new electronic Customs Declaration Service, set to be finished for January 2019, to enable more streamlined customs checks.\n\nBut the government still warns the new plan will result in \"an increase in administration\" compared with being inside the EU Customs Union.\n\nAlternatively, a new customs partnership would involve the UK \"acting in partnership with the EU\" to operate a regime for imports that \"aligns precisely\" with the EU's external customs border. This would apply to goods for consumption in the EU market, even if they are part of a UK supply chain first.\n\nThe proposed partnership would in effect create a two-tier system, where goods passing through UK supply chains for EU import or export face EU standard duties and checks, whereas UK exports and imports from other countries destined only for the UK would be subject to UK-only rules.\n\nHowever, such a system would require a \"robust enforcement mechanism\" to make sure UK-only goods do not find their way to Europe, the government acknowledged. Potential solutions could involve tracking mechanism to trace goods through the supply chain to an end user, or a refund system where traders could claim a rebate on higher tariffs once goods have reached their end user, the government suggests.\n\nGreen trade experts have warned exiting the Customs Union could allow the UK to sign new trade deals with other markets, but could also result in significant challenges for clean tech firms and green businesses. Specifically, experts have warned UK firms could find themselves having to adhere to EU environmental standards if they export to the bloc, while also facing competition from other markets where lower standards are accepted.\n\nThe EU has yet to declare whether either of the government's customs proposals are achievable from its perspective. However, the government warns that without a deal on customs arrangements it will be forced to implement a standalone system for customs, VAT and excise. \"This is not the government's preferred outcome to the negotiations, but it is essential that the UK is prepared for all possible outcomes on customs arrangements,\" the paper warns.\n\nThe proposals received a terse welcome from senior figures in Brussels. Writing on Twitter, chief negotiator Michel Barnier reiterated that the EU team was unwilling to discuss customs issues until the first stage of the talks are completed. \"The quicker #UK & EU27 agree on citizens, settling accounts and #Ireland, the quicker we can discuss customs & future relationship,\" he wrote.\n\nHis comments were echoed by the European Parliament's lead co-ordinator Guy Verhofstadt, who dismissed Davis' suggestion the UK could replicate the benefits of the customs union through a new agreement. \"To be in & out of the Customs Union & \"invisible borders\" is a fantasy,\" he wrote. \"First need to secure citizens rights & a financial settlement.\"", "id": "9311577", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-15", "title": "Government promises to maintain 'high

The first option would see it manage a new customs border with the EU, unilaterally simplifying requirements on EU goods entering the country as much as possible and providing border \"facilitations\" to reduce and remove trade barriers, according to a briefing issued by the U.K.'s Department for Exiting the European Union (DExEU).\n\nUnder the second option, the U.K. and the EU would negotiate a \"new customs partnership,\" aligning their approach to customs -- an option which, the Brexit department briefing said, would negate the need for a customs border. Under both options, the U.K. would be out of any customs union and able to strike its own free-trade deals.\n\nThe position paper is the first of up to 12 expected to be published before October, when the European Council will rule on whether talks on the withdrawal agreement have made sufficient progress to proceed to the next phase -- transition and the future relationship.\n\nHowever, the U.K. has grown increasingly impatient with the EU's sequencing of the Brexit talks, believing withdrawal issues are inextricably linked to the future relationship and transition.\n\nBy publishing its customs proposals now, ahead of a position paper on Northern Ireland later this week, the U.K. is hoping to highlight how the latter issue -- defined by the EU as a withdrawal matter -- cannot be settled without agreement on customs, a future relationship issue.\n\nDuring the customs transition period, if the U.K. were to enter into a customs union with the EU, it would have a common external tariff with the EU, one government official told POLITICO. This would mean the U.K. could not implement any trade deals with other countries until after the transition period.\n\nThe interim period will be time limited, but the precise length would be a matter for the U.K.'s negotiation with the European Commission, the official said.\n\nFurthermore, if the U.K. enters a transition-period customs union with the EU, it would be free to negotiate and even sign free-trade deals with other countries -- a key demand of International Trade Secretary Liam Fox -- but not to bring them into force, officials believe.\n\nIt is hoped that the interim period will reassure businesses already contemplating their future operations in the U.K. while giving them time to adjust to the new post-Brexit regime.\n\nJosh Hardie, deputy director general of the Confederation of British Industry (CBI), welcomed the government's progress in publishing position papers and the proposal of an interim period \"that is as barrier-free as possible.\"\n\n\"Business wants to see as frictionless a customs system as possible, with a strong emphasis on digital systems to make it easier to trade,\" he said.\n\n\"But to secure frictionless trade, negotiations on regulation, tariff and non-tariff barriers will have to take place. All efforts should be made to deliver a single-step transition so that businesses don't have to adapt twice.\"\n\nThe publication of the position paper follows two months of Cabinet disagreements over the course of the Brexit strategy. Chancellor Philip Hammond, seen as an advocate of a \"soft Brexit,\" and Fox, previously an ardent Leave campaigner, presented a united front in a joint article for the Sunday Telegraph asserting that the U.K. would leave the single market and the customs union ahead of a transition phase.\n\nMPs supporting a soft Brexit strategy were critical of the plans.\n\n\"These are incoherent and inadequate proposals designed to gloss over deep and continuing divisions within the cabinet,\" Labour's Shadow Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union Keir Starmer said in a statement. \"Businesses, trade unions and the country need certainty about our future trading and customs arrangements.\n\n\"Instead, the cabinet remain split on key issues and cannot decide between two very different but equally unachievable options. The first proposal suggests 'a new customs border with the EU' could be introduced without disrupting trade; the second suggests a new borderless customs partnership could somehow be agreed while Britain also signs external trade deals,\" the statement said.\n\nLabour MP Chris Leslie, a leading supporter of the Open Britain cross-party campaign group, said the Cabinet's \"new unified position is to return the government to the territory of wanting to have their cake and eat it.\"\n\n\"It is a fantasy to pretend we can have the freest and most frictionless trade possible with our largest partner when the government remain intent on pulling Britain out of the customs union,\" he said.\n\n\"This is wishful thinking of the highest order. The only way to retain genuinely free trade with Europe, and protect the millions of jobs created by it, is to remain a member of the customs union.\"", "id": "9178527", "details": {"liCnt": 97},

The article by the chancellor and the international trade secretary made clear that that is the position of the government.\n\nHe added: \"The customs union as it currently stands has an impact on our ability to make trade deals.\"\n\nHammond appears to have conceded that remaining a member of the customs union is not possible, even as an interim arrangement while a detailed deal is finalised.\n\nThe Department for Exiting the European Union is also expected to publish a separate paper on Northern Ireland later in the week, which will inform the next round of talks as the border with the Republic of Ireland is one of the issues the EU wants resolved early.\n\nAfter the last round of negotiations in Brussels last month, the EU's negotiator, Michel Barnier, expressed some frustration at the lack of detail from the British side - particularly on the financial settlement.\n\nHe said: \"As soon as the UK is ready to clarify the nature of its commitments, we will be prepared to discuss this with the British negotiators ... This week's experience has quite simply shown that we make better progress where our respective positions are clear.\"\n\nDavis initially insisted Britain would like to negotiate a new trade deal alongside the exit terms, describing discussions over the phasing of the talks as \"the row of the summer\" and warning that signing up to a financial settlement early could disadvantage Britain later in the talks.\n\nBut when formal negotiations got under way in June, after the general election wiped out May's comfortable governing majority, Britain quickly signed up to the EU's proposed timetable.", "id": "9187112", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-14", "title": "Brexit: David Davis to set out hoped-for EU customs deal", "image":

"eng-3358827", "body": "Ministers hope they will be able to negotiate and complete trade deals with other countries during any Brexit transitional period.\n\nBut they accept they won't be able to implement them.\n\nSpeaking as the Brexit Secretary David Davis revealed future customs proposals with the EU, Government officials refused to be drawn on whether a third country trade deal could actually be signed.\n\nThis appeared to contradict an earlier promise made by Chancellor Philip Hammond and International Trade Secretary Liam Fox, who wrote in the Sunday Telegraph that once EU membership ends in March 2019, the UK would be an \"independent nation with the freedom to sign bilateral free trade agreements\".\n\nMr Davis told Sky News a temporary customs arrangement with the EU will be \"in both sides' interests\" but any transition period should not exceed two years.\n\nHe said any interim customs union was there to avoid a \"cliff-edge\" for manufacturers after Brexit.\n\nMr Davis estimated the transition period would be roughly two years - with the deadline of the next General Election in 2022 as the \"absolute maximum\".\n\nThe document sets out two broad approaches to a possible customs deal.\n\nOne aims to continue some existing arrangements the UK has with the EU, using technology to make custom requirements \"as frictionless as possible\".\n\nThe second option is without precedent, which would involve the UK mirroring the EU's requirements for imports where the final destination is the EU.\n\nThe Government also says it has contingency plans in place to deal with the possibility of no agreement.\n\nBut there are increasing concerns that all the Government's possible options mean businesses will be hit with extra red tape and increased costs.\n\nFor example, proposals for goods that do not comply with the EU's trade policy would need a \"tracking mechanism\" where traders could claim \"refunds\" if tariff trades differ.\n\nThe British Irish Chamber of Commerce responded saying it was cautious about the feasibility of some proposals being put forward in London on simplifying new trade barriers with Europe.\n\nJohn McGrane, director of the association, said the ideas were a constructive contribution to the negotiations.\n\n\"The recognition of the need for an interim period to allow for the adoption of new systems and infrastructures will be welcomed by businesses who have long warned of the dangers of leaving the Customs Union without such a transition phase,\" he said.\n\n\"It is important that this phase is as close to the status quo as possible with minimum disruption caused by tariff and non-tariff barriers.\"\n\nA European Commission spokesman said the UK position paper on customs would be examined carefully.\n\n\"We take note of the UK's request for an implementing period and its preferences as regards the future relationship, but we will only address them once we have made sufficient progress on the terms of the orderly withdrawal,\" the spokesman said.\n\n\"An agreement on a future relationship between the EU and the UK can only be finalised once the UK has become a third country.\n\n\"As (EU chief negotiator) Michel Barnier has said on several occasions, 'frictionless trade' is not possible outside the single market and customs union.\"\n\nGuy Verhofstadt, the European parliament's Brexit coordinator, tweeted: \"To be in and out of the Customs Union and 'invisible borders' is a fantasy.\n\n\"First need to secure citizens' rights & a financial settlement.\"\n\nLabour's shadow Brexit secretary, Sir Keir Starmer, branded the customs proposals \"incoherent and inadequate\" and \"designed to gloss over deep and continuing divisions within the Cabinet\".", "id": "9270603",

most frictionless possible trade\" with the rest of Europe.\n\nThis could include a \"temporary customs union\" after Brexit to prevent border problems as the UK leaves the EU.\n\nBusinesses have called for clarity since the UK said it was leaving the customs union - the EU's tariff-free trading area - as part of Brexit.\n\nThe customs union document is the first of a series of papers to be published by the UK government on key negotiation issues.\n\nOn Wednesday it is expected to set out proposals for the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.\n\nCountries in the customs union don't impose tariffs - taxes on imports - on each other's goods.\n\nEvery country inside the union levies the same tariffs on imports from abroad.\n\nSo, for example, a 10% tariff is imposed on some cars imported from outside the customs union, while 7.5% is imposed on roasted coffee.\n\nOther goods - such as soap or slate - have no tariffs.\n\nThe UK's departure from the EU's customs union was confirmed at the weekend in a joint article by Chancellor Philip Hammond and Trade Secretary Liam Fox.\n\nAccording to the newly-published government paper, the UK could ask Brussels to establish a \"temporary customs union\" after it leaves the EU in March 2019.\n\nBut during this period, it would also expect to be able to negotiate its own international trade deals - something it cannot do as an EU customs union member.\n\nOnce this period expires, the UK will look to agree either a \"highly streamlined\" border with the EU, or a new \"partnership\" with no customs border at all.\n\nThe government said the interim arrangements would mean businesses would only have to adjust once to the new arrangements.\n\nAll of this will have to be negotiated with the EU - and the two sides have not yet even started discussing trade matters.\n\nOther obstacles - including the size of the UK's \"divorce bill\" - need to be agreed first.\n\nKeir Starmer, Labour's shadow Brexit secretary, said the proposals were \"incoherent and inadequate\" and were designed to \"gloss over deep and continuing divisions within the cabinet\".\n\n\"These fantastical and contradictory

Wait and see.\"\n\nMr Davis also told ITV's Good Morning Britain: \"We sell them, the Europeans, about 230 billion euro of goods and services a year.\n\n\"They sell us 290 billion euro. So there are a lot of things there.\"\n\nAsked whether Britain would have to pay to stay in the customs union, he said: \"Well, I don't think ... well, what happens in that sort of interim period you will have to leave me to negotiate, I'm afraid, how we do it, but the aim is to bring to an end these huge \u00a310 billion-a-year payments, bring that to an end now.\n\n\"We are still haggling with them over what we may owe them in the short term but we are going to bring the overall thing to an end.\n\n\"This is something that is in both sides' interest.\"\n\nSecuring future trade deals outside the EU could also be on the cards under the new plans, Mr Davis said.\n\nHe told Today: \" There's a legal position here.\n\n\"The reason we can't sign now is because of something called the duty of sincere cooperation, it's written into the treaty, and it's not related to the customs union, it's related to the overall treaty.\n\n\"Once in 2019 when we leave, that legal duty goes away.\n\n\"Now we will still be responsible around it but our view is there is no legal basis for saying we can't do it, we are talking about it to other countries, we are just not signing.\"\n\nThe proposals for new customs arrangements to allow trade with the EU are being outlined in the first of a series of \"future partnership papers\" being released by the Government.\n\nOne option being put forward by Mr Davis for new arrangements would see the UK manage a new customs border with administration streamlined to the \"fullest extent possible\".\n\nThe Brexit Secretary will also float plans for a customs partnership with the EU which would negate the need for a customs border between the UK and the rest of the bloc.\n\nHe said the negotiations were going \"fine\" and EU leaders were less hostile than they had been previously.\n\nMr Davis told ITV: \"The simple truth is we want to come out of this better but they (the Europeans) want to come out of it better too.\n\n\"There was a terror early on that we would be the first of many countries breaking off.\n\n\"After the victory of (President Emmanuel) Macron in France, that terror is reduced.\n\n\"They are no longer quite so afraid so the punishment battalion side is now reducing.\"\n\nA European Commission spokesman said: \"We will now study the UK position paper on customs carefully in the light of the European Council guidelines and the council's negotiating directives.\n\n\"The next negotiation round will start in the week of 28 August.\n\n\"We take note of the UK's request for an implementing period and its preferences as regards the future relationship, but we will only address them once we have made sufficient progress on the terms of the orderly withdrawal.\n\n\"An agreement on a future relationship between the EU and the UK can only be finalised once the UK has become a third country.\n\n\"As Michel Barnier has said on several occasions, 'frictionless trade' is not possible outside the Single Market and Customs Union.\"\n\nThe EU is also working on a position paper on the customs union, following a tranche of documents published before the summer on issues such as citizens' rights and nuclear materials, he said.", "id": "9246788", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-15", "title": "UK 'still haggling' with EU over financial terms, David Davis says", "image": "http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/business/uk-world/article36033331.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/PANews%20BT_P-d1e0d6f9-3358-43e7-b4ca-0ac5fe4cb6eb_I1.jpg", "extractedDates": [{"imp": true, "textStart": 3858, "date": "2017-08-28", "amb": false, "textEnd": 3867}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-15", "concepts": [], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 139, "label": "dmoz/Society/Government", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Government"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 140, "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 147, "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Customer Management", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Customer_Management"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 550, "label": "dmoz/Society/Future", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Future"}], "time": "09:39:00"}

About the only thing anyone is clear about as things stand, is that the UK will leave the EU on 29 March 2019. Before that happens, a separation agreement has to be reached.\n\nThe EU chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, wants to try and get all the negotiations on this agreement wrapped up by October 2018, which would allow roughly six months for ratifications.\n\nThis means there are now about 13 and a half months left to negotiate a separation agreement.\n\nWhich is tricky for anyone trying to run a business. Especially a regulated entity, such as a bank or insurance company.\n\nThe Bank of England Governor, Mark Carney said a couple of weeks ago that regulated entities needed 18 months to make their Brexit related decisions about relocating some or all or their business.\n\nAnd eighteen months is longer than the time left to negotiate a Brexit separation agreement.\n\nSo time is the enemy. Its inexorable march also has implications for the British customs regime.\n\nIt is all well and good to talk about no deal being better than a bad deal, or to state, as today's document does, that the UK will leave the EU Customs Union in 2019. But the practical implication of that is that the UK must have a new customs regime - and the systems to back it up - in place for 29 March 2019. 591 days time.\n\nThat is 591 days to design a new customs regime, secure international (not just EU) agreement on it, hire the staff needed, select - and in some cases invent - the technology necessary to implement the design, procure the technology, commission the technology, build the physical infrastructure (including truck parks at ports and border crossings), and legislate the new regime into existence.\n\n591 days and counting down.\n\nJust legislating for a new customs regime will be tricky.\n\nToday's position paper tells us the British government will bring forward a customs bill in the autumn. This will be accompanied by a white paper, which should give us a lot more detail on what they are planning.\n\nThe customs law (needed because customs is almost exclusively an EU competence, and the UK does not have a sufficient legal base for a standalone customs regime), will have to be supported by changes to UK legislation on VAT and excise regimes.\n\nThat is a hefty chunk of parliamentary time in the best of circumstances, without a clock ticking loudly in the background, forcing the pace (and rushed law is usually bad law, according to most seasoned parliamentarians).\n\nBut the fall back position is needed as part of the threats the UK is using in this Brexit negotiation.\n\nHere is what today's paper says about the new powers the Customs Bill will give the British government to make its own rules and apply them to the rest of us:\n\n\"In this scenario, without any further facilitations or agreements, the UK would treat trade with the EU as it currently treats trade with non-EU countries. Customs duty and import VAT would be due on EU imports. Traders would need to be registered.\n\n\"Traders exporting to the EU would have to submit an export declaration, and certain goods may require an export licence. The EU would also apply the customs rules and VAT to imports from the UK that it applies to non-EU countries. The Government is actively considering ways in which to mitigate the impacts of such a scenario. Other EU Member States will also need to make contingency preparations to mitigate the risk of delays resulting from their own customs processes.\"\n\nIn other words, you Irish/French/Belgians/Dutch better get on with making your own preparations for a hard border, or face the consequences from your own disgruntled business community. And that is going to cost money.\n\nIt is going to cost us money. Even though we do not want it, and did not vote for it. But they insist we pay for it.\n\nOnce again, the nastiness surfaces ...\n\nTo avoid such unpleasantness, the British are suggesting two different routes to a new customs arrangement with the EU.\n\nOne relies on a \"streamlined\" version of a hard customs border, using lots of technology. It admits this is untried and untested (and in some cases non-existent). If it all worked, it would ease the queues at border crossings considerably, and there is much to be said for using as much IT as possible in the whole customs/excise/VAT trade flow as possible anyway.\n\nBut the paper clearly states \"there will remain an increase in administration compared with being inside the EU Customs Union\".\n\nYou can \"streamline\" all you like, the fact is Brexit will double the amount of red tape and bureaucracy involved in trading with the UK.\n\nThe other route today's paper proposes is a \"new customs partnership\" with the EU, which would \"align\" the two customs regimes so closely that there is no need for an actual customs border between the UK and the EU.\n\nThis is particularly good for getting around the problem of the Northern Ireland border. The only snag is, it won't work.\n\nNot in the form the UK is suggesting, which is that the UK would \"mirror\" EU customs law for goods that would come into the UK and then go on to the EU.\n\nBut a different regime would apply to goods destined only for the UK market.\n\nThis is tricky enough to implement among honest and noble businesses and traders, but the flip side of the customs coin is smugglers. Criminals infest all border regimes, because there is money to be made.\n\nThis UK proposal would open a gigantic hole in the EU customs defences, creating a massive incentive for customs, excise and VAT criminals to exploit the differences between the EU and UK regimes. It is very rare for governments to propose facilitating revenue loss on such a grand scale.\n\nThe British paper admits this approach is \"unprecedented\" and would be \"challenging\" to implement. Indeed.\n\nHere is what the paper says about trying to manage such a system in practice:\n\n\"There would need to be a robust enforcement mechanism that ensured goods which had not complied with the EU's trade policy stayed in the UK. This could involve, for instance, a tracking mechanism, where imports to the UK were tracked until they reached an end user, or a repayment mechanism, where imports to the UK paid whichever was the higher of the UK's or the EU's tariff rates and traders claimed a refund for the difference between the two rates when the goods were sold to an end user in the country charging lower tariffs.\n\n\"Businesses in supply chains would need to be able to track goods or pass the ability to claim a repayment along their supply chain in order to benefit\".\n\nIs frictionless the first word that springs to mind reading that? How about gangsters paradise? I know its two words, but get used to it - everything is being doubled up by Brexit.\n\nOne piece of good news for Irish exporters in the paper is an indication that Britain will look to membership of the Common Transit Convention, which would mean goods would not have to complete a new customs declaration every time they cross a new border (for example, Holyhead and Dover).\n\nThe British will also publish a Trade Bill in the autumn, and it too will be accompanies by a White Paper. This will also eat into Parliamentary time.\n\nAnd that time is further eroded by the Repeal Bill, the legal action needed to ensure legal continuity after the UK leaves the EU by transforming all EU law into UK law (it is similar to the Minsters and Secretaries Act, the first law introduced by the Oireachtas after independence).\n\nAll this in 591 days, and counting down ...\n\nThe time pressure means the case for a transitional agreement is overwhelming.\n\nBut the hard Brexiters appear to want out at all costs.\n\nLiam Fox, the Trade Secretary, wants above all else to sign new trade deals, but cannot do so until the UK leaves the EU.\n\nPhilip Hammond, Chancellor of the Exchequer wants a \"soft Brexit\" because he is worried about the very damaging effects on the British economy a hard will have.\n\nThe political battle between these two cabinet ministers reflects a split in the UK establishment over which direction policy should take.\n\nAnd Mrs May has been so weakened by a dreadful election result that she lacks the authority to impose direction on her ministers.\n\nIt is telling that on the day the Department for Exiting the EU publishes its first position paper, former Ukip leader Nigel Farage was making himself available to every live television broadcast in Britain (after a quiet period of several months), and the Leave EU campaign funder Aaron Banks started a new campaign to have Mr Hammond removed as an MP (not just a minister), working in Mr Hammond's own constituency.\n\nThe nasty is not just for foreigners ...\n\nThe split in the cabinet is reflected in a policy paper that is trying to promote two different directions of travel. However, it may also offer a way out of sorts.\n\nToday's document is a discussion paper, designed for consultation with business and industrial groups (including foreigners, who have not been shy about making proposals to Department for Exiting the EU in the past few months).\n\nThat consultation process may be the reality check the British government needs to settle this cabinet dispute.\n\nIt may well be British business that gets to decide if ideology of pragmatism gains the upper hand in guiding UK policy as it leaves the EU.\n\nWhich is in 591 days.", "id": "9341143",

Business had been calling for clarity on what type of system the UK wanted to replace the existing arrangements.\n\nThis afternoon, London put forward two models of how post-Brexit customs could look. One is what the UK calls \"a highly streamlined customs arrangement\", which would continue some of the structures currently in place, see the implementation of unilateral processes that would be negotiated and use \"technology-based solutions to make it easier to comply with customs procedures\".\n\nThe second approach put forward by the UK, which London admitted is \"innovative and untested\", would see the country \"align our approach to the customs border in a way that removes the need for a UK-EU customs border\". Under this proposal, London suggested one method could \"involve the UK mirroring the EU's requirements for imports from the rest of the world where their final destination is the EU\".\n\nUnder the UK's proposals, while both sides implement the new customs arrangements, both markets should introduce \"a model of close association\n\nwith the EU Customs Union for a time-limited interim period\".\n\nHowever, during this interim arrangement, the UK would still look to negotiate its own trade deals - which it cannot do as a full member of the EU customs union.\n\nDavid Davis, the UK's Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union, said: \"The approaches we are setting out today will benefit both the EU and UK and avoid a cliff-edge for businesses and individuals on both sides. The way we approach the movement of goods across our border will be a critical building block for our independent trade policy. An interim period would mean businesses only need to adjust once to the new regime and would allow for a smooth and orderly transition.\"\n\nHowever, Guy Verhofstadt, the European Parliament's Brexit coordinator, described the UK's proposals as a \"fantasy\".\n\nTo be in & out of the Customs Union & \"invisible borders\" is a fantasy. First need to secure citizens rights & a financial settlement -- Guy Verhofstadt (@GuyVerhofstadt)\n\nAugust 15, 2017\n\nIan Wright, the director general of UK industry body the Food and Drink Federation, said the \"single point of change\" between pre- and post-Brexit arrangements would \"help to minimise unnecessary disruption for businesses that have established trading relationships with the EU\".\n\nHowever, he added: \"The real challenge will then follow in designing and negotiating a model that maintains these benefits beyond the transition period, delivering the same ease of trading that UK food and drink currently enjoys with the EU27, with zero tariffs and no new regulatory or other non-tariff barriers.\n\n\"As the UK's largest manufacturing sector, our success is inextricably linked to our ability to import and export raw ingredients and finished goods across borders. Nowhere is this more the case than with our Irish neighbours. We will be looking carefully at the detail of the paper and will continue working closely with Government to ensure the future customs model works for UK food and drink manufacturers, allowing them to maintain the quality, choice and value that consumers demand.\"", "id": "9287662", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-15", "title": "UK publishes post-Brexit customs proposals", "image": "https://i4.aroq.com/3/2017-03-31-13-31-istock481822276_cropped_80.jpg", "extractedDates": [{"imp": true, "textStart": 14, "amb": false, "textEnd": 23, "freq": 2, "date": "2017-08-15"}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-15", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 5, "id": "76", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 5, "id": "86522", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Business"}, "id": "302720", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business"}, {"label": {"eng": "Regulation"}, "id": "302997", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation"}, {"label": {"eng": "Technology"}, "id": "302999", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology"}, {"label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "id": "303064", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union"}, {"label": {"eng": "Export"}, "id": "303403", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Export"}, {"label": {"eng": "Trade"}, "id": "303410", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade"}, {"label": {"eng": "Fantasy"}, "id": "303768", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fantasy"}, {"label": {"eng": "European Parliament"}, "id": "303907", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Parliament"}, {"label": {"eng": "Government of the United Kingdom"}, "id": "304310", "score": 4, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_the_United_Kingdom"}, {"label": {"eng": "Customs"}, "id": "304875", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customs"}, {"label": {"eng": "Manufacturing"}, "id": "307067", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manufacturing"}, {"label": {"eng": "Import"}, "id": "307363", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Import"}, {"label": {"eng": "Border"}, "id": "308560", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Border"}, {"label": {"eng": "Tariff"}, "id": "309353", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tariff"}, {"label": {"eng": "Trade association"}, "id": "324766", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_association"}, {"label": {"eng": "Ian Wright"}, "id": "362609", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_Wright"}, {"label": {"eng": "Customs union"}, "id": "382637", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customs_union"}, {"label": {"eng": "Guy Verhofstadt"}, "id": "388307", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guy_Verhofstadt"}, {"label": {"eng": "Commercial policy"}, "id": "394292", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_policy"}, {"label": {"eng": "Non-tariff barriers to trade"}, "id": "395939", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-tariff_barriers_to_trade"}, {"label": {"eng": "Food and Drink Federation"}, "id": "409787", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_and_Drink_Federation"}, {"label": {"eng": "2007 enlargement of the European Union"}, "id": "439092", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007_enlargement_of_the_European_Union"}, {"label": {"eng": "European Union Customs Union"}, "id": "470058", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union_Customs_Union"}, {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom withdrawal from the European Union"}, "id": "1268836", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_withdrawal_from_the_European_Union"}], "location": {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "country"}, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 140, "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 147, "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Customer Management", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Customer_Management"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 269, "label": "dmoz/Business/International Business and Trade", "uri": "dmoz/Business/International_Business_and_Trade"}], "time": "13:37:00"}

"LONDON, Aug. 15 (Xinhua) -- Opposition politicians in Britain on Tuesday criticised government proposals for an interim trading deal with the European Union (EU), but business leaders welcomed the proposals, saying that if accepted by Brussels, it would avoid a \"cliff edge\" in March 2019 when Britain leaves the EU.\n\nBrexit Secretary David Davis wants a tariff-free interim customs arrangement to start when Britain ends its EU membership.\n\nIt would mean current exporting and importing arrangements would continue virtually unchanged to enable a permanent deal to eventually be agreed by both sides.\n\nThe new paper was released as the first in a series of documents to be published in order to outline Britain's position on major issues of Brexit.\n\nLabour's Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, described Davis's proposals as \"incoherent and inadequate,\" saying they were designed to gloss over deep and continuing divisions within British Prime Minister Theresa May's cabinet.\n\n\"Businesses, trade unions and the country need certainty about our future trading and customs arrangements,\" Starmer said. \"Instead, the cabinet remain split on key issues and cannot decide between two very different but equally unachievable options.\"\n\nThe first proposal which suggests \"a new customs border with the EU\" could be introduced without disrupting trade; the second suggests a new borderless customs partnership could somehow be agreed while Britain also signs external trade deals.\n\n\"These fantastical and contradictory proposals provide no guidance for negotiators or certainty for businesses,\" he said. \"The proposals also make it less likely that necessary transitional arrangements will be in place by March 2019.\"\n\nFor his part, Nicola Sturgeon, first minister of the Scottish Parliament and leader of the Scottish Nationalist Party, said, \"It seems the UK government is back to its daft 'have your cake and eat it' approach to Brexit.\n\nSturgeon added that the British government should commit to staying in the EU single market and the customs union.\n\nOne of the strongest attacks came from Nigel Farage, founder and former leader of UKIP, the party set up to campaign for Britain to leave the EU.\n\nFarage, who sits as a British member in the European Parliament said: \"We might find ourselves 10 years down the road from Brexit having not got what we wanted.\"\n\n\"There's no doubt that during this transitional period, the free movement of people will continue, the European Court of Justice will go on having judgements over British business and, of course, we'll go on paying a membership fee,\" Farage said. \"None of those things are acceptable to Brexit voters in any way at all.\"\n\nTom Blake, Brexit spokesman for the minority Liberal Democrat party. said the government's customs union proposal would delay the economic pain caused by leaving the customs union.\n\nBlake said: \"We still face the prospect of more red tape for businesses, longer queues at our borders and higher prices for consumers once the transition comes to an end.\"\n\nBusiness leaders in Britain, however, broadly welcomed the official proposals, saying it will avoid a feared \"cliff edge\" if no post-2019 export and import arrangements are in place.\n\nJosh Hardie, deputy director-general of the Confederation of British Industry (CBI), said: \"Companies will welcome the progress the government has made today in publishing these papers.\"\n\n\"It's encouraging to see that these papers propose a time-limited interim period and a customs system that is as barrier-free as possible,\" he said.\n\nHardie said business wants to see as frictionless a customs system as possible, with a strong emphasis on digital systems that make it easier to trade.\n\nNew round of talks between the British government and EU negotiators are due to resume at the end of this month.\n\nVideo: Abe's misadventure in constitution

But implementing such a complex scheme would take years of preparation.\n\nThe other option proposed is a new customs partnership with the EU, which would do away with a customs border altogether.\n\nAgreeing to such a partnership, which doesn't really exist anywhere in the world, would be quite a concession for the EU as it would give the UK the benefits of being in the customs union while still allowing it to forge trade agreements with non-EU countries, which EU members are not allowed to do.\n\n\"People and businesses in both the UK and the EU would benefit from an interim period.\"\n\nThe government wants an interim or transition period between the UK leaving the EU and the new permanent customs regime coming into effect.\n\nThe paper suggests a time-limited period during which the UK leaves the customs union only to move straight into another temporary customs union with the EU that would operate in pretty much the same way - except, the UK wants to be able to negotiate and sign (but not implement) free trade deals with other countries outside the EU at the same time.\n\n\"The UK would aim to negotiate trade facilitations with the EU and implement unilateral improvements to our domestic regime.\"\n\n\"The promotion of the free flow of trade in both directions between the UK and the EU would also require the EU to implement equivalent arrangements at its borders with the UK.\"\n\nIt is not clear which aspects of the streamlined arrangement would be unilateral and which would need agreement.\n\nThe paper says, in paragraph 29, that the government would make unilateral improvements to its systems, to speed things up at ports.\n\nBut then, in paragraph 30, it says that the EU would have to implement equivalent arrangements.\n\n\"Through membership of the Common Transit Convention (CTC), which simplifies border crossing for goods in transit.\"\n\nThe CTC is the set of rules for moving goods between EU member states and other countries, including Iceland, Norway, Switzerland, Macedonia and Serbia.\n\nIt is supposed to make it easier to move products from one country to another via a third country that is not necessarily an EU member.\n\nFor the UK, the benefit would be that goods could be imported from Asia via the port of Rotterdam, for example, without having to pay EU duties.\n\n\"Negotiating mutual recognition of Authorised Economic Operators (AEOs), enabling faster clearance of AEOs' goods at the border.\"\n\nAEOs are an international kitemark that recognises businesses as regular international traders that are solvent and have a good record of paying customs fees and taxes and keeping proper records.\n\nCompanies holding the designation are allowed to use certain fast-track systems when going through customs.\n\nThe government estimates that 60% of UK imports and 74% of UK exports involve companies with AEO status.\n\n\"Ensure that individuals travelling to the UK from the EU and vice versa can continue to travel with goods for personal use as freely and as smoothly as they do now.\"\n\nThe amount of alcohol and cigarettes that can be brought into the UK from non-EU countries without paying duty is limited - up to four litres of wine and 200 cigarettes.\n\nAfter Brexit, such limits could return for trips to and from the EU.\n\nBut the government is keen to strike an agreement that ensures that does not happen.\n\n\"We acknowledge this is an innovative and untested approach that would take time to develop and implement.\"\n\nThe government says it wants to look into the \"practical complexities\" involved in a customs partnership, but the EU has already repeated its argument that frictionless trade outside the Customs Union and the Single Market is impossible.\n\nWould ministers be happier being \"innovative and untested\" than being courageous?\n\n\"We will continue to discuss these proposals with stakeholders over the summer and will publish a Customs White Paper in advance of the Customs Bill in the autumn.\"\n\nIf negotiations on the future partnership with the EU have not yet begun by the autumn, there may be a few blank spaces in the Customs White Paper that will have to be filled in later.\n\nAnd this week's paper also emphasises that the government will be ready for a \"no deal\" scenario that would necessitate \"standalone customs and excise systems\".\n\n\"This is not the government's preferred outcome,\" the paper says, \"but it is essential that the UK is prepared for all possible outcomes.\"", "id": "9331460", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-15", "title": "Brexit: What is the government's customs union plan?

warned it will be extremely difficult to negotiate a new EU-UK free trade agreement before Britain leaves the bloc -- particularly as Brussels has so far refused even to start trade talks.\n\nIt says there must be broad agreement first on three key issues -- Britain's financial settlement, the issue of expatriate rights, and the question of the border between British-controlled Northern Ireland and Ireland.\n\nBritain will publish its proposals on the border issue on Wednesday, ahead of the third round of Brexit negotiations in Brussels at the end of the month.\n\nOfficials in London believe the border is inextricably linked to the customs issue.\n\nAfter Brexit, the Irish border will be Britain's only land border with the EU.\n\nThere are fears that the reintroduction of physical checkpoints could upset the fragile balance of peace in Northern Ireland.\n\nBritain's membership of the EU customs union precludes it from striking its own trade deals, and the government made clear Tuesday that such freedom was crucial to its post-Brexit plans.\n\n\"During this interim period, which will be negotiated with Brussels, Britain will look to negotiate bold new trade relationships around the world,\" it said.\n\nThe statement added: \"Our goal is to secure as frictionless trade as possible with the EU alongside the ability to forge trade deals around the world.\"\n\nHowever, opposition Labour lawmaker Chris Leslie, from the campaign group Open Britain, said the proposal represented \"wishful thinking of the highest order\".\n\n\"It is a fantasy to pretend we can have the freest and most frictionless trade possible with our largest partner when the government remain intent on pulling Britain out of the customs union,\" he said.", "id": "9202581", "details": {}, "date":

Supposedly he was looking for a compromise to keep Britain within the customs union and single market as long as possible,\" he said.\n\nRelated content\n\n\"The rebellion didn't last very long. He has now teamed up with one of the more extreme and ideological supporters of a 'hard Brexit'. It is now painfully clear who calls the shots in the Cabinet; it isn't the Chancellor.\"\n\nIn contrast, the joint move was welcomed by the pro-Brexit Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson who said it was the \"right way forward\".\n\n\"Create certainty and great new European relationship.

But implementing such a complex scheme would take years of preparation.\n\nThe other option proposed is a new customs partnership with the EU, which would do away with a customs border altogether.\n\nAgreeing to such a partnership, which doesn't really exist anywhere in the world, would be quite a concession for the EU as it would give the UK the benefits of being in the customs union while still allowing it to forge trade agreements with non-EU countries, which EU members are not allowed to do.\n\nInterim period\n\nThe government wants an interim or transition period between the UK leaving the EU and the new permanent customs regime coming into effect.\n\nThe paper suggests a time-limited period during which the UK leaves the customs union only to move straight into another temporary customs union with the EU that would operate in pretty much the same way - except, the UK wants to be able to negotiate and sign (but not implement) free trade deals with other countries outside the EU at the same time.\n\nUnilateral but also equivalent\n\nIt is not clear which aspects of the streamlined arrangement would be unilateral and which would need agreement.\n\nThe paper says, in paragraph 29, that the government would make unilateral improvements to its systems, to speed things up at ports.\n\nBut then, in paragraph 30, it says that the EU would have to implement equivalent arrangements.\n\nCommon Transit Convention\n\nThe CTC is the set of rules for moving goods between EU member states and other countries, including Iceland, Norway, Switzerland, Macedonia and Serbia.\n\nIt is supposed to make it easier to move products from one country to another via a third country that is not necessarily an EU member.\n\nFor the UK, the benefit would be that goods could be imported from Asia via the port of Rotterdam, for example, without having to pay EU duties.\n\nAuthorised Economic Operators\n\nAEOs are an international kitemark that recognises businesses as regular international traders that are solvent and have a good record of paying customs fees and taxes and keeping proper records.\n\nCompanies holding the designation are allowed to use certain fast-track systems when going through customs.\n\nThe government estimates that 60% of UK imports and 74% of UK exports involve companies with AEO status.\n\nThe booze cruise survives?\n\nThe amount of alcohol and cigarettes that can be brought into the UK from non-EU countries without paying duty is limited - up to four litres of wine and 200 cigarettes.\n\nAfter Brexit, such limits could return for trips to and from the EU.\n\nBut the government is keen to strike an agreement that ensures that does not happen.\n\nInnovative and untested\n\nThe government says it wants to look into the \"practical complexities\" involved in a customs partnership, but the EU has already repeated its argument that frictionless trade outside the Customs Union and the Single Market is impossible.\n\nWould ministers be happier being \"innovative and untested\" than being ?\n\nCustoms White Paper\n\nIf negotiations on the future partnership with the EU have not yet begun by the autumn, there may be a few blank spaces in the Customs White Paper that will have to be filled in later.\n\nAnd this week's paper also emphasises that the government will be ready for a \"no deal\" scenario that would necessitate \"standalone customs and excise systems\".\n\n\"This is not the government's preferred outcome,\" the paper says, \"but it is essential that the UK is prepared for all possible outcomes.\"", "id": "9315612", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-15", "title": "Reality check", "image": "http://headlinesnews.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/_97342500_mediaitem97342497.jpg",

The article by the chancellor and the international trade secretary made clear that that is the position of the government,\" adding, \"The customs union as it currently stands has an impact on our ability to make trade deals.\"\n\nHammond appears to have conceded that remaining a member of the customs union is not possible, even as an interim arrangement while a detailed deal is finalised.\n\nThe Department for Exiting the EU is also expected to publish a separate paper, on Northern Ireland, later in the week, which will directly inform the next round of talks, since this is one of the issues the EU wants resolved early.\n\nAfter the last round of negotiations in Brussels last month, the EU's negotiator, Michel Barnier, expressed some frustration at the lack of detail from the British side - particularly on the financial settlement.\n\nHe said: \"As soon as the UK is ready to clarify the nature of its commitments, we will be prepared to discuss this with the British negotiators ... This week's experience has quite simply shown that we make better progress where our respective positions are clear.\"\n\nDavis initially insisted Britain would like to negotiate a new trade deal alongside the exit terms, describing discussions over the phasing of the talks as \"the row of the summer\" and warning that signing up to a financial settlement early could disadvantage Britain later in the talks.\n\nBut when formal negotiations got under way in June, after the general election wiped out Theresa May's comfortable governing majority, Britain quickly signed up to the EU's proposed

before Brexit negotiations resume, Britain raised the stakes by setting out moves to levy VAT and customs duties on EU imports if a deal is not struck over the terms of Britain's departure.\n\nIn the first of a series of papers setting out its negotiating position, the government called for an interim customs agreement with the bloc following Brexit in March 2019.\n\nBritain would negotiate trade deals with other countries during that period under the UK proposal.\n\nMoves to avoid long queues\n\nAfter that time, ministers have raised the idea of Britain doing away with the need for customs checks for goods destined for the bloc by \"mirroring\" EU tariffs.\n\nAlternatively, a \"streamlined\" approach would see the UK negotiate agreements with the EU to reduce trade barriers and use technology to avoid long queues at ports.\n\nBut Mr Verhofstadt responded: \"To be in and out of the Customs Union & 'invisible borders' is a fantasy.\"\n\nMichel Barnier, the European Commission's chief Brexit negotiator, also said future customs arrangements could not be discussed until the issues of citizens' rights, Britain's exit payment and Northern Ireland's status had been settled.\n\nA Commission spokesman said Brussels would study the customs paper carefully.\n\nHe added: \"We take note of the UK's request for an implementing period and its preferences as regards the future relationship, but we will only address them once we have made sufficient progress on the terms of the orderly withdrawal.\"\n\nUK warning of VAT\n\nThe 14-page Whitehall paper, Future Customs Arrangements for the UK, disclosed that legislation would be published to impose new custom duties and VAT tariffs on trade with the EU in case no deal is reached.\n\nThe move will be seen as a warning that Britain is ready to walk away from the negotiating table rather than reach an unacceptable agreement.\n\nDavid Davis, the Brexit Secretary, said an interim customs deal would be \"in both sides' interest\" as he insisted European leaders did not want to punish Britain for voting to leave the bloc.\n\nHe also refused to rule out paying for the temporary arrangement, while officials admitted the European Court of Justice could retain a role in enforcing customs union rules during the interim period.", "id": "9455178", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-15", "title": "European chief

It was not clear whether Britain was pursuing a similar arrangement to Turkey.\n\nThe government said that by sorting out the customs arrangements, Britain and the bloc could avoid a \"hard border\" with EU member state Ireland, something which officials fear could reignite tensions between Irish nationalists and unionists.\n\nIt proposed two different ways -- a highly streamlined customs arrangement managed by Britain, or a new customs partnership with the EU, which could \"negate the need for a customs border\".\n\nIts proposals on a future customs arrangement are set out in one of several position papers intended to flesh out the government's Brexit vision and show a united stance over the future relationship after rifts emerged among ministers.\n\nOn Wednesday, the government

Reuters\n\nLONDON -- Chancellor Philip Hammond and International Trade Secretary Liam Fox have attempted to quell any accusations of a divide within the government over the UK's approach to Brexit.\n\nWriting in a joint article in the Sunday Telegraph, two of Prime Minister Theresa May's most senior ministers said that the UK will seek a transition deal for leaving the EU, but that any deal will not be a \"back door\" to staying in the bloc and would be limited in its time period.\n\n\"We want our economy to remain strong and vibrant through this period of change. That means businesses need to have confidence that there will not be a cliff-edge when we leave the EU in just over twenty months' time,\" the pair write.\n\n\"That is why we believe a time-limited interim period will be important to further our national interest and give business greater certainty - but it cannot be indefinite; it cannot be a back door to staying in the EU.\n\nHammond and Fox have previously been seen to be sitting on two different sides of the Brexit fence. Hammond, who campaigned to remain in the EU prior to last June's vote, has publicly made clear that he favours a softer Brexit numerous times, and is believed to have frequently clashed with May over her approach to leaving the bloc. Fox on the other hand, is a staunch Brexiteer.\n\nHowever, Sunday's joint article appears to be an attempt to put to bed rumours and reports that May's cabinet is deeply divided on what kind of Brexit Britain should be looking at.\n\nIn recent weeks numerous newspapers have reported cabinet splits, with ministers leaking confidential details of meetings in what appeared to be the first stages of a battle to succeed May as PM.\n\nContinuing, the pair write that any transition \"must ensure a smooth and predictable pathway for businesses and citizens alike. We are both clear that during this period the UK will be outside the single market and outside the customs union and will be a 'third-country' not party to EU treaties.\"\n\n\"But we are also clear that during this period our borders must continue to operate smoothly; goods bought on the internet must still cross borders; businesses must still be able to supply their customers across the EU and our innovative, world-leading companies must be able to hire the talent they need, including from within the EU.\"", "id": "8993090", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-13", "title": "Hammond and Fox try to present united cabinet front over Brexit by penning joint Telegraph article", "image": "http://static3.uk.businessinsider.com/image/5990009136194628008b45bc-1190-625/hammond-and-fox-try-to-present-united-cabinet-front-over-brexit-by-penning-joint-telegraph-article.jpg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-14", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 5, "id": "76", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Reuters"}, "id": "302588", "score": 1, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters"}, {"label": {"eng": "Business"}, "id": "302720", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business"}, {"label": {"eng": "Economy"}, "id": "303018", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy"}, {"label": {"eng": "Treaties of the European Union"}, "id": "303039", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaties_of_the_European_Union"}, {"label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "id": "303064", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union"}, {"label": {"eng": "Minister (government)"}, "id": "303435", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minister_(government)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Citizenship"}, "id": "303514", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizenship"}, {"label": {"eng": "Theresa May"}, "id": "304328", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theresa_May"}, {"label": {"eng": "Philip Hammond"}, "id": "304608", "score": 5, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Hammond"}, {"label": {"eng": "International trade"}, "id": "307061", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_trade"}, {"label": {"eng": "Fox Broadcasting Company"}, "id": "308747", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Broadcasting_Company"}, {"label": {"eng": "The Daily Telegraph"}, "id": "317114", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Daily_Telegraph"}, {"label": {"eng": "Single market"}, "id": "326525", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_market"}, {"label": {"eng": "Liam Fox"}, "id": "330676", "score": 5, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liam_Fox"}, {"label": {"eng": "Patrick McLoughlin"}, "id": "355044", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_McLoughlin"}, {"label": {"eng": "Chairman of the Conservative Party"}, "id": "361571", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chairman_of_the_Conservative_Party"}, {"label": {"eng": "Customs union"}, "id": "382637", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customs_union"}, {"label": {"eng": "Withdrawal from the European Union"}, "id": "410168", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Withdrawal_from_the_European_Union"}, {"label": {"eng": "The Sunday Telegraph"}, "id": "460086", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sunday_Telegraph"}, {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom withdrawal from the European Union"}, "id": "1268836", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_withdrawal_from_the_European_Union"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 169, "label": "dmoz/Business/Construction and Maintenance/Materials and Supplies", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Construction_and_Maintenance/Materials_and_Supplies"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 263, "label": "dmoz/Business/News and Media", "uri": "dmoz/Business/News_and_Media"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 269, "label": "dmoz/Business/International Business and Trade", "uri": "dmoz/Business/International_Business_and_Trade"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 270, "label": "dmoz/Business/International Business and Trade/Services", "uri": "dmoz/Business/International_Business_and_Trade/Services"}], "time": "07:00:00"}

negotiations on a new system are not scheduled to start for some time, the Government said setting out its aims showed the UK's \"desire to ensure our exit from the EU is smooth, orderly and successful\".\n\nOne option being put forward by Mr Davis for new arrangements would see the UK manage a new customs border with administration streamlined to the \"fullest extent possible\".\n\nSir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, called the proposals \"incoherent and inadequate\" in response to pleas for certainty from British businesses.\n\nHe said: \"The Cabinet remain split on key issues and cannot decide between two very different but equally unachievable options.\n\n\"The first proposal suggests 'a new customs border with the EU' could be introduced without disrupting trade; the second suggests a new borderless customs partnership could somehow be agreed while Britain also signs external trade deals.\n\n\"These fantastical and contradictory proposals provide no guidance for negotiators or certainty for businesses.\"\n\nIt comes after Chancellor Philip Hammond and International Trade Secretary Liam Fox said the UK would pull out of both the single market and the customs union in 2019.\n\nLabour former shadow chancellor Chris Leslie, a leading supporter of the Open Britain campaign group, said: \"It looks like the new unified position in the Cabinet is to return the Government to the territory of wanting to have their cake and eat it.\n\nHe added: \"It is a fantasy to pretend we can have the freest and most frictionless trade possible with our largest partner when the Government remain intent on pulling Britain out of the customs union.\"\n\nTom Brake, the Liberal Democrats' Brexit spokesman, said the Government's \"extreme Brexit will end up

However, an interim deal would minimise disruption and provide certainty for businesses and individuals if it is agreed early in the process, it said.\n\nWhile the UK will pursue new trade negotiations with other countries after leaving the EU, it would not make any new arrangements with third countries \"which were not consistent with the terms of the interim agreement\", the paper said.\n\nThe paper looks at two potential approaches to creating \"the freest and most frictionless trade possible\" between the UK and the EU, while allowing the UK to create new trade relationships both in Europe and elsewhere.\n\nThe first approach involves what the government has called a \"streamlined customs arrangement\" with as few additional requirements on EU trade as possible.\n\nThe aim would be to continue some existing arrangements between the UK and the EU but to put in place new and potentially unilateral agreements to reduce or remove barriers to trade. Technology would be used to make it easier to comply with customs procedures, the paper said.\n\nThis approach would use the UK's existing third country processes for UK-EU trade, \"building on EU and international precedents, and developing new innovative facilitations to deliver as frictionless a customs border as possible\", it said.\n\nThe second proposed approach is a new customs partnership that would remove the need for a UK-EU customs border. This could involve, for example, the UK mirroring the EU's requirements for imports from the rest of the world.\n\n\"This is of course unprecedented as an approach and could be challenging to implement and we will look to explore the principles of this with business and the EU,\" the paper said.\n\nThe ultimate arrangement will of course depend on negotiations with the EU, it said.\n\nThe government will work with the Scottish and Welsh governments and the Northern Ireland executive on the practical impact of new customs arrangements and on specific issues such as ports and the land border between Northern Ireland and Ireland, it said.\n\nGuy Lougher of Pinsent Masons, the law firm behind Out-Law.com, said: \"The EU has indicated that there must be agreement on three core issues - the exit bill, the rights of citizens and Ireland - before there can be negotiations on wider issues, including the shape of the UK's future trading relationship with the EU. By raising now the very important issue of the future customs arrangement between the EU and the UK, the UK government is hoping to advance discussions on this issue; whether the EU negotiators choose to engage at this stage remains to be seen.\"\n\nFive of the UK's major business organisations signed an open letter to the government in June calling for continued access to the EU single market until the UK's departure is agreed and implemented.\n\nThe British Chambers of Commerce, the Confederation of British Industry, the manufacturers' organisation EEF, the Federation of Small Businesses and the Institute of Directors called on the government to \"engage continuously\" with UK business interests as negotiations take place.\n\nThe organisations called for a tariff-free goods trade agreement between the UK and EU, regulatory equivalence and mutual recognition of standards on an ongoing basis to ensure continued mutual access for both goods and services, and a flexible system for the movement of labour and skills.\n\nA number of other organisations have also warned of the impact of leaving the single market. Last July the head of the Financial Conduct Authority said the country should push for continued access to the single market for financial institutions, while think tank the Institute of Fiscal Studies said the move would depress tax receipts and impact gross domestic product.", "id": "9298778", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-15", "title": "UK aims for transitional customs deal with EU",

All efforts should be made to deliver a single-step transition, so that businesses don't have to adapt twice.\"\n\nDr Adam Marshall, Director General of the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC), also called for a \"smooth transition\", adding: \"For most of the businesses we speak to, clarity on the UK's future customs arrangement with the EU is significantly higher on their priority list than the swift negotiation of new free trade agreements.\n\n\"For that reason, business needs to see the government's resources focused on the conclusion of a successful customs deal with the EU.\n\n\"At this

In particular, they fear a more drawn out period would be likely to require the approval of individual member states' national parliaments - a time-consuming process.\n\nOne senior cabinet minister told the Guardian a long transition was \"not a flier\", because it would not be in line with the referendum result, and was likely to be rejected by the rest of the EU.\n\nThe threat of cumbersome new customs checks is one of the key issues causing anxiety among businesses and senior ministers, alongside fears about intricate manufacturing supply chains being broken and long queues of lorries at cross-border ports when Britain leaves the EU.\n\nOn Sunday, Liam Fox and Philip Hammond, the latter previously regarded as a champion of a \"soft Brexit\", published a joint statement in the Sunday Telegraph saying Britain would be outside the customs union during the post-Brexit transition phase and at that point it would be \"a 'third country', not party to the EU treaties\".\n\nHammond was accused of caving in to the demands of the Brexiters, but the paper will make clear that the government is keen to retain the full benefits of the customs union in the short-term - albeit without formal membership. The EU will have to decide whether it would accept such an arrangement.\n\nTuesday's paper will also set out more details of how the government hopes to achieve frictionless trade with the rest of the EU in the long term: the aim set out by Theresa May in her Lancaster House speech in January.\n\nThe government is examining two options: either a highly streamlined new arrangement \"in which the UK would manage a new customs border\" but would seek to make any checks minimal; or a new customs partnership, which would see Britain replicate the EU's approach so closely that it would \"negate the need for a customs border\".\n\nKeir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, dismissed what he said were \"incoherent and inadequate proposals designed to gloss over deep and continuing divisions within the cabinet\".\n\nThe first proposal suggests a new customs border with the EU could be introduced without disrupting trade - apparently to be managed by the UK, making it the first customs union in the world to be managed by just one country. The second suggests a new borderless customs partnership could somehow be agreed while Britain also signs external trade deals.\n\nThe proposals are being published in advance of the next round of negotiations in Brussels - despite the fact the EU has insisted it won't discuss post-Brexit trade arrangements until a series of other issues, including the financial settlement, are resolved.\n\nThe prime minister's spokesman said the government had concluded from the early talks, which kicked off in earnest last month, that it could not make more progress without a clearer sense of what the future relationship might look like.\n\nHe said: \"We've had the first round of the negotiations, and those talks have shown that many of the withdrawal questions can only be settled in the light of our future partnership. So now is the time to set out our approach to that partnership, to inform the upcoming negotiations, and to provide citizens and businesses at home and across Europe with a deeper understanding of our thinking.\"\n\nIn particular it is difficult to hold substantive talks about the future of the land border between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic - another of the EU's early demands - without knowing what the customs relationship will be. The government will publish further proposals on the Irish issue on Wednesday.\n\nAfter the last round of negotiations in Brussels, Michel Barnier expressed some frustration at the lack of detail from the British side - particularly on the financial settlement. The EU's chief Brexit negotiator said: \"This week's experience has quite simply shown that we make better progress where our respective positions are clear.\"\n\nThe government's critics said the plans were fresh evidence that David Davis and May had not yet accepted the trade-offs it would be necessary to make once talks got under way.\n\nThe Liberal Democrats' Brexit spokesman, Tom Brake, said: \"The only way to ensure 'free and frictionless' trade with the EU is to remain a full member of the customs union and single market.\n\n\"It doesn't matter how it's dressed up or how long it's postponed: the government's extreme Brexit will end up leaving Britain poorer.\"\n\nThe CBI's deputy director, Josh Hardie, welcomed the publication of fresh details of the government's aims for a new customs deal. However he called for rapid progress on a wider trade deal, including what tariffs and other barriers would be imposed on exports to the EU.\n\n\"Business wants to see as frictionless a customs system as possible, with a strong emphasis on digital systems that make it easier to trade,\" he said. \"But to secure frictionless trade, negotiations on regulation, tariff and non-tariff barriers will have to take place. All efforts should be made to deliver a single-step transition, so that businesses don't have to adapt twice.\"", "id": "9171671", "details": {"liCnt": 31}, "date": "2017-08-14", "title": "Theresa May

"body": "Theresa May will press for Britain to enter into a temporary customs deal with the European Union in 2019 to avoid chaos on the day after Brexit as ministers begin to detail their approach to historic withdrawal talks.\n\nBut the government faced charges of \"wanting to have their cake and eat it\" by suggesting the UK could temporarily enjoy the benefits of existing customs arrangements while standing outside the bloc.\n\nIts plan is also likely to run into fierce resistance in Brussels which could object to Britain trying to negotiate its own beneficial trade deals with countries around the world while effectively being part of the EU customs union.\n\nThe government will on Tuesday announce the plan as it starts to flesh out its negotiating stance in talks over Britain's future relationship with the bloc.\n\nMotorway queues\n\nMinisters have been warned that the imposition of customs checks at ports risks economic damage, huge delays and even lengthy motorway queues.\n\nTo avoid that prospect, ministers are proposing an \"interim period\" of \"close association\" between the UK and the EU customs union under which goods can be bought and sold tariff-free.\n\n\"The only way to guarantee 'free and frictionless' trade with the EU is to stay in the customs union and single market.\n\n\"Anything else risks creating more red tape for business, longer queues at our borders and higher prices for consumers.\"\n\nSir Vince Cable, Liberal Democrat leader\n\nOne possible approach, they say, would be to operate a temporary UK-EU customs union.\n\nDuring this period, the government would attempt to hammer out new trade deals with major trading partners, including forging a new relationship with the EU.\n\nIt believes it can broker a \"streamlined\" deal with the bloc, building on the existing lack of tariffs within the union.\n\nThe proposal will be spelt out in the first of several government papers published in coming weeks which will spell out Mrs May's approach to Brexit.\n\nMore time for business\n\nMinisters argue that the move would give businesses more time to prepare for the eventual new customs regime.\n\nThe Department for Exiting the European Union, headed by Brexit Secretary David Davis, said its goal is \"to secure as frictionless trade as possible with the EU alongside the ability to forge trade deals around the world\".\n\nIt said the government wanted to demonstrate Britain's \"desire to ensure our exit from the EU is smooth, orderly and successful\".\n\nThe proposal strikes a different note from the joint declaration by Chancellor Philip Hammond and Liam Fox, the International Trade Secretary, at the weekend that the UK will be \"outside the customs union\" during the transition as it will become a 'third country' not party to the EU treaties\".\n\nJosh Hardie, the CBI's deputy director-general, said: \"It is encouraging to see these papers propose a time-limited interim period and a customs system that is as barrier-free as possible.\n\n\"We at the CBI have always been clear that new ideas on crucial issues like this should be brought to the table quickly.\"\n\n'Wishful thinking'\n\nSir Vince Cable, the Liberal Democrat leader, said: \"The only way to guarantee 'free and frictionless' trade with the EU is to stay in the customs union and single market.\n\n\"Anything else risks creating more red tape for business, longer queues at our borders and higher prices for consumers.\"\n\nThe Labour MP Chris Leslie, of the Open Britain campaign group, accused ministers of \"wishful thinking\".\n\nHe said: \"It looks like the new unified position in the Cabinet is to return the Government to the territory of wanting to have their cake and eat it.\n\n\"Ministers claim we can leave the Customs Union and yet still achieve 'the most frictionless customs agreement anywhere in the world', but with absolutely no detail about how such a miraculous new system will be achieved.\"", "id": "9203960", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-14", "title": "Theresa May sets out plans to avert post-Brexit chaos at ports", "image":

They did not stipulate a likely length of time for any transitional period.\n\nIn their article, Hammond and Fox say: \"We respect the will of the British people; in March 2019 the United Kingdom will leave the European Union.\"\n\nBut they noted that \"We want our economy to remain strong and vibrant through this period of change. That means businesses need to have confidence that there will not be a cliff-edge when we leave the EU in just over 20 months' time.\"\n\nThey further explained \"That is why we believe a time-limited interim period will be important to further our national interest and give business greater certainty, but it cannot be indefinite; it cannot be a back door to staying in the EU.\"\n\nThe two ministers add they are both clear that during any transitional period Britain will be outside the European single market and outside the customs union and will be a \"third-country\" not party to EU treaties.\n\nExplaining what a transitional period would mean, Hammond and Fox said: \"During this period our (British) borders must continue to operate smoothly; goods bought on the internet must still cross borders; businesses must still be able to supply their customers across the EU and our innovative, world-leading companies must be able to hire the talent they need, including from within the EU.\"\n\nOnce any interim period is over, add Hammond and Fox, Britain will want a permanent, treaty-based arrangement with the EU which supports the closest possible relationship with Brussels, retaining close ties of security, trade and commerce.\n\nBrexit negotiations between the EU and Britain's Secretary of State for Leaving the European Union, are scheduled to resume in Brussels later

Well what happens in that interim period you have to leave to me to negotiate.\"\n\nDavis, who embarked on a tour of the broadcasters on Tuesday morning in order to sell the proposals, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the temporary agreement would be in place for a \"shortish period\" that would end before the next election.\n\n\"It's very very hard to say at this point to say exactly how long\", he said. \"I would say the most likely is something like two years, maybe a bit shorter.\"\n\nThe plan, seemingly designed as a compromise to resolve disagreements within the Cabinet, is contained in the Government's first \"future partnership paper\", published on Tuesday by the Department for Exiting the European Union.\n\nIt confirms the UK will ultimately leave the system, as Prime Minister Theresa May has repeatedly stated, but proposes a temporary customs union as a \"possible approach\" to ensuring a \"smooth and orderly\" transfer.\n\nThe customs union allows goods to travel across the EU free of tariffs and checks.\n\nThe proposal could provide assurances to nervy business leaders that Britain may avoid border chaos after leaving the bloc.\n\nThe plan also outlines an alternative scenario, which would see a border managed by the UK as part of a \"highly streamlined customs arrangement\".\n\nThe plans were unveiled just a day after Chancellor Philip Hammond and Secretary of State for International Trade Liam Fox insisted that the UK will leave the customs union after Brexit in a joint article for the Sunday Telegraph.\n\nThe mixed messages and reports of Britain's lack of preparedness in the first round of exit negotiations have put the government under pressure to lay out a clear position before a new round of talks later this month.\n\nLabour's shadow Brexit secretary, Sir Keir Starmer, branded the proposals \"incoherent and inadequate\" and said they were \"designed to gloss over deep and continuing divisions within the Cabinet\".\n\n\"Businesses, trade unions and the country need certainty about our future trading and customs arrangements\", he said.\n\n\"They also need a pragmatic and considered approach that delivers the best deal for Britain. Instead, the Cabinet remain split on key issues and cannot decide between two very different but equally unachievable options\".\n\nLabour's stance on the issue is itself in some doubt, with Starmer and shadow chancellor John McDonnell stressing that all options should remain on the table in contrast to leader Jeremy Corbyn, who stated unequivocally that he would take Britain out of the single market and customs union.", "id": "9250921", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-15", "title": "UK might have to pay for access to interim customs union after Brexit", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/D_jYwQBNdTJ0jEPghGut8Q--/aD0yMjU2O3c9MzM4NDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/http://media.zenfs.com/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/0a1189515c5890cd1e10d7dc101d8192", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-15", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 5, "id": "76", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Business"}, "id": "302720", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business"}, {"label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "id": "303064", "score": 4, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union"}, {"label": {"eng": "Trade"}, "id": "303410", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade"}, {"label": {"eng": "Minister (government)"}, "id": "303435", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minister_(government)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Trade union"}, "id": "303738", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_union"}, {"label": {"eng": "Theresa May"}, "id": "304328", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theresa_May"}, {"label": {"eng": "Philip Hammond"}, "id": "304608", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Hammond"}, {"label": {"eng": "Customs"}, "id": "304875", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customs"}, {"label": {"eng": "ITV (TV network)"}, "id": "306548", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITV_(TV_network)"}, {"label": {"eng": "International trade"}, "id": "307061", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_trade"}, {"label": {"eng": "Border"}, "id": "308560", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Border"}, {"label": {"eng": "Tariff"}, "id": "309353", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tariff"}, {"label": {"eng": "Labour Party (UK)"}, "id": "311306", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Today (BBC Radio 4)"}, "id": "312757", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Today_(BBC_Radio_4)"}, {"label": {"eng": "BBC Radio 4"}, "id": "329154", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_Radio_4"}, {"label": {"eng": "Liam Fox"}, "id": "330676", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liam_Fox"}, {"label": {"eng": "Eurasian Customs Union"}, "id": "340949", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurasian_Customs_Union"}, {"label": {"eng": "Customs union"}, "id": "382637", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customs_union"}, {"label": {"eng": "Keir Starmer"}, "id": "419610", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keir_Starmer"}, {"label": {"eng": "The Sunday Telegraph"}, "id": "460086", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sunday_Telegraph"}, {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom European Union membership referendum, 2016"}, "id": "1062308", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_European_Union_membership_referendum,_2016"}, {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom withdrawal from the European Union"}, "id": "1268836", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_withdrawal_from_the_European_Union"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 63, "label": "dmoz/Society/Work", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Work"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 140, "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 143, "label": "dmoz/Reference/Education/Colleges and Universities", "uri": "dmoz/Reference/Education/Colleges_and_Universities"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 325, "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Banking Services", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Banking_Services"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 887, "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Labor Movement", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Labor_Movement"}], "time": "06:41:00"}

Doing so is our shared duty,\" he said.\n\n\"The united desire to avoid unnecessary disruption or a disorderly exit for the United Kingdom from the European Union is a strong foundation for the negotiations.\"\n\nMinisters have been warned about the strain ports could be put under if they face a big increase in bureaucracy for dealing with goods entering and leaving the country.\n\nThe proposals for new customs arrangements to allow trade with the EU are being outlined in the first of a series of \"future partnership papers\" being released by the Government.\n\nAlthough negotiations on a new system are not scheduled to start for some time, the Government said setting out its aims showed the UK's \"desire to ensure our exit from the EU is smooth, orderly and successful\".\n\nOne option being put forward by Mr Davis for new arrangements would see the UK manage a new customs border with administration streamlined to the \"fullest extent possible\".\n\nThe Brexit Secretary will also float plans for a customs partnership with the EU that would negate the need for a customs border between the UK and the rest of the bloc.\n\nA position paper on the fraught issue of the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic will be published on Wednesday, ahead of the third round of Brexit negotiations in Brussels at the end of the month.\n\nSir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, called the proposals \"incoherent and inadequate\" in response to pleas for certainty from British businesses.\n\n\"Instead, the Cabinet remain split on key issues and cannot decide between two very different but equally unachievable options,\" he said.\n\n\"The first proposal suggests 'a new customs border with the EU' could be introduced without disrupting trade; the second suggests a new borderless customs partnership could somehow be agreed while Britain also signs external trade deals.\n\n\"These fantastical and contradictory proposals provide no guidance for negotiators or certainty for businesses.\n\n\"The proposals also make it less likely that necessary transitional arrangements will be in place by March 2019.\"\n\nIt comes after Chancellor Philip Hammond and International Trade Secretary Liam Fox said the UK would pull out of both the single market and the customs union in 2019.\n\nLabour former shadow chancellor Chris Leslie, a leading supporter of the Open Britain campaign group, said: \"It looks like the new unified position in the Cabinet is to return the Government to the territory of wanting to have their cake and eat it.\n\n\"Ministers claim we can leave the customs union and yet still achieve 'the most frictionless customs agreement anywhere in the world' but with absolutely no detail about how such a miraculous new system will be achieved.\n\n\"It is a fantasy to pretend we can have the freest and most frictionless trade possible with our largest partner when the Government remain intent on pulling Britain out of the customs union.\"\n\nTom Brake, the Liberal Democrats Brexit spokesman, said the Government's \"extreme Brexit will end up leaving Britain poorer\".\n\nHe added: \"Even if they were agreed to by the EU, these proposals will only delay the economic pain caused by leaving the customs union.\n\n\"We still face the prospect of more red tape for businesses, longer queues at our borders and higher prices for consumers once the transition comes to an end.\"", "id": "9179004", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-14", "title": "Britain could keep EU customs arrangements for interim period, Davis says", "image": "http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/northern-ireland/article36028788.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/PANews%20BT_P-b09ea563-73d0-41ea-82df-e2e2b88c3ef9_I1.jpg", "extractedDates": [{"textStart": 3549, "date": "2019-03-", "amb": false, "textEnd": 3559}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-14", "concepts": [], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 108, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 140, "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 147, "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Customer Management", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Customer_Management"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 269, "label": "dmoz/Business/International Business and Trade", "uri": "dmoz/Business/International_Business_and_Trade"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 270, "label": "dmoz/Business/International Business and Trade/Services", "uri": "dmoz/Business/International_Business_and_Trade/Services"}], "time": "23:31:00"}

In such circumstances there is only one choice: hard Brexit and staying in (if Britain's lucky)\n\nObviously there are bigger things in the world right now - Word War Three, the arrival of The Big British Family Cooking Showdown, Leicester City disappointingly losing 4-3 to Arsenal - but I've just noticed that someone's kidnapped the Chancellor of the Exchequer.\n\nThat's right. Philip Hammond, self-appointed leader of the \"reasonable squad\" in the Cabinet, friend to British business, reluctant leaver and supposed bulwark against hard Brexit, has been captured. There was a ransom note at the weekend, penned by himself and Liam Fox. It read as follows: \"We are both clear that during [the transition] the UK will be outside the single market and outside the customs union and will be a 'third-country' not party to EU treaties.\"\n\nSo not actually ransom note, seeing as there's no actual financial way to release him from being handcuffed to Liam Fox; more of a political suicide note. I suppose that just leaves Amber Rudd then.\n\nDon't be taken in by the talk of \"transition\". The transition to hard Brexit will have taken place - instantaneously - when the UK leaves the EU in March 2019. The rest is just another tiresome exercise in wishful thinking, such as the notion that somehow, because we're all grown-ups and the Germans sell lots of cars here and we won the war after all, the EU is obliged to be, well, soft, and offer us more or less what we have now - minus the contributions to the EU budget, minus freedom of movement of labour, minus the European Court, minus those irritating Brussels bureaucrats, minus straight bananas and anything else the British happen to find irksome. Only for a couple of years, true, but quite a soft landing for the British.\n\nPhilip Hammond: Transitional deal expected within three years of leaving EU\n\nIn the words of the Fox-Hammond Cerberus thing, the UK's borders \"must continue to operate smoothly\", goods bought on the internet \"must still cross borders\", and \"businesses must still be able to supply their customers across the EU\" after Brexit. In the coming days we are also promised some \"Position Papers\" on British policy towards the EU talks. These will be entitled: \"Having Your Cake and Eating It - Trading the UK Way\", \"Why Europe Needs Britain More than Britain Needs Europe, Honest. So Do As You're Told\", \"Have You Not Witnessed the Iron Will of the British People?\" and \"We've Got Nukes, You Know\".\n\nIt's worth repeating: the EU is under no obligation to offer the UK any kind of transitional arrangements, sensible as it might be, solely on British terms. It is up for negotiation - and why would they give us a dream deal that the Swedes, Danes, Finns or Dutch (all secret Leave countries, I'm sure) might fancy?\n\nIf Tony Blair is right and the Europeans all want to ditch freedom of movement anyway, then we could easily do a deal, or stay in on much better terms - but where are Blair's mysterious movers and shakers ready to devise a New Europe like he did New Labour? It's all gone a bit quiet, that.\n\nThe EU in fact has a clear negotiating mandate, given to chief talker Michel Barnier, that does acknowledge the possibility of a transitional arrangement, but it is quite tightly drawn, and, contrary to the Fox-Hammond line, requires the UK to agree to the \"acquis\". The \"acquis\" a piece of Euro-jargon which means the UK would construe to be bound by EU rules, presumably including the big ones on freedom of movement and the European Court of Justice. Here's how the EU sees it: \"Should a time-limited prolongation of Union acquis be considered, this would require existing Union regulatory, budgetary, supervisory, judiciary and enforcement instruments and structures to apply. This approach will allow an efficient allocation of the limited time that Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union imposes for the conclusion of the Agreement by avoiding the need to address the same matter several times at different phases of the negotiations.\"\n\nConservatives will never win power again after Brexit 'disaster', former Tory government adviser says\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, the EU also states:\n\n\"The Agreement should set a withdrawal date which is at the latest 30 March 2019 at 00:00 (Brussels time), unless the European Council, in agreement with the United Kingdom, unanimously decides to extend this period in accordance with Article 50(3) of the Treaty on European Union. The United Kingdom will become a third country from the withdrawal date.\"\n\nNow, for those of us who voted Leave but who are rather concerned about the way Brexit is going, this is all turning rather ugly. Far from having our cake and eating it, the EU27 seems determined to shove into our face like a custard pie, and then send us the bill for cleaning the mess up. What is becoming increasingly clear is this:\n\nThe impetus on both sides of the Channel is towards Hard Brexit; It will cause economic dislocation, and possibly a slump; The only way to make it work is via a \"Singapore of Europe\" model of a low-tax, low-wage, small state, free-trading enterprise economy; The British people are not up for that, being a mix of wet Tories and Corbynites these days; They also feel a bit misled about the \u00a3350m a week for the NHS and ending migration thing, which is all they thought that was at stake in the referendum; Therefore they have to be given a vote on what is about to befall them.\n\nLogistically and logically, the UK-EU talks will not be completed by this time next year; indeed we'll probably still be playing the three-dimensional chess game of how to keep the free travel and free trading zone with Ireland when the UK is out of the single market and the customs union in March 2019, if not the end of time.\n\nThat's because it doesn't matter how reasonable or \"tough\" both sides in the Brexit talks are - they won't be able to make two plus two equal five. I certainly think it will take more than \"goodwill on all sides\" and some automatic number plate recognition machines to solve that conundrum. One wonders if the right of the Tory party would be happy to let go of Northern Ireland completely for the sake of hard Brexit. Just a thought.\n\nTom Peck on Double Take: Parliamentary sketch writers are currently redundant in Brexit Britain\n\nThe truth is that there will be no agreement on the Irish border, not even by 2019, and none therefore on trade, none on the \"divorce bill\", none on transition arrangements and, thus, no way of answering the question \"Transition to what?\"\n\nIn such circumstances there is only one choice: hard Brexit and staying in (if Britain's lucky). And for that to be resolved we need another referendum, which would not actually be a \"second referendum\", but the first referendum on the actual terms of Brexit as they are agreed (or not agreed).\n\nThe people of Britain, as well as of Ireland and the rest of the European Union, deserve it. I wonder if Philip Hammond might extricate himself from the deadly embrace of the International Trade Secretary in time to advocate such a thing?\n\nMore about: Brexit Philip Hammond Liam Fox Theresa

The Brexit Secretary said it will only be a temporary trade arrangement that will enable business to continue as usual while a final trade deal between both sides has been finalised.\n\nHe said that a transitional deal is in the UK's and the trading bloc's best interests, but the maximum amount of time it would be allowed to endure would be until the 2022 General Election.\n\nMr. Davis said there was still a great deal of work to be done before Britain can finally leave the EU and that a transitional deal would provide more space to complete it all.\n\nThe Department for Exiting the EU produced a comprehensive plan for the UK's future relationship with Brussels. The paper will formally outline the transitional agreement and provides two options to withdraw Britain from the trading bloc's Customs Union completely.\n\nThe first choice would allow the Government to organise a new customs border with the EU to reduce trade barriers. The second would provide a new customs partnership which would remove a customs border.\n\nBut the paper has already been criticised by EU negotiators. A spokesman for the European Commission acknowledged the Government's request for an implementation period and said they will discuss this proposal when sufficient progress has been made on the terms of Britain's withdrawal from Brussels.\n\nThe EU's Chief Negotiator, Michel Barnier, said it is not possible for the UK to trade with Brussels if it cancels its membership of the Customs Union and the Single Market.\n\nThe European Parliament's lead coordinator on Brexit, Guy Verhofstadt, said the Government's proposals are pure fantasy. According to the lead negotiator, they must agree with them on citizens' rights, the divorce bill and Ireland first.\n\nMr. Davis said these plans are necessary to avoid a cliff-edge for businesses and individuals. He said companies require an interim period to adapt to new trading rules being implemented as Britain prepares to quit the trading bloc.\n\nNicola Sturgeon, Scotland's First Minister, wrote on Twitter that the Government returned to its \"have its cake and eat it\" approach to Brexit. She said the UK should remain a member of the Single Market and the Customs Union if it wants to avoid disruptions to trade.\n\nThe Confederation of Business Interests welcomed this measure as a progressive step forward in the face of difficulties Whitehall officials are finding themselves in, trying to balance the need for sensible customs arrangements and freedom to form new trade deals.\n\nThe Brexit Secretary defended the Government's lack of clarity over its negotiations with the EU. He said that he understands it is difficult to read what they intend to do, but discussions require constructive ambiguity. #Europe", "id": "9426096", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-16", "title":

Ireland is probably the biggest victim of this mess,\" Mr Hogan said.\n\nThe commissioner added that he had told Carolyn Fairbairn, director-general of the CBI, the employers' organisation, that big UK companies should press the British government to stay in the customs union in the interests of the British economy.\n\nBut in their joint article for the Sunday Telegraph, Mr Hammond, who backed Remain in last year's referendum, and Mr Fox, a leading Brexit supporter, argued that leaving the customs union would allow Britain to strike bilateral deals with other countries and ruled out any transition that served as \"a back door to staying in the EU\".\n\nThe UK is expected to set out its position on the Northern Irish border and future customs arrangements with the EU in two formal position papers to be published by Wednesday, ahead of the next round of negotiations with the EU which start on the week beginning August 28.\n\nDespite their backing for withdrawal from the customs union, Mr Fox and Mr Hammond said that during the transition period \"our borders must continue to operate smoothly\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009businesses must still be able to supply their customers across the EU\".\n\nIn June, Mr Hammond said that current customs arrangements needed to remain in place after the UK leaves the bloc \"until new long-term arrangements are up and running\".\n\nMr Hogan said the UK chancellor had been a \"lonely voice\" in his drive to prioritise the UK economy.\n\nHe added that British ministers \"still don't realise that the other 27 [member states] have to agree to this transition period of two or three years or whatever they're going to be seeking. We have to see will it be fruitful.\"\n\nHe dismissed Mr Fox's claims that there was \"no issue\" with importing chlorine-washed chicken as part of a UK-US trade deal -- one of the bilateral accords most eagerly anticipated by Brexiters -- and pointed out that Michael Gove, environment secretary, had ruled out such imports.\n\nChlorine-washed chicken is banned in the EU. The commissioner said any moves to open the UK market to genetically modified food or hormone beef, also banned in the EU but permitted in the US, would shut out UK food from the European market.\n\nThe benefit Britain drew from open trade with Europe was not recognised, Mr Hogan argued. \"Barrier-free trade in goods and services with the EU has worked more than any number of hypothetical trade agreements that Mr Fox talks about around the world.\n\nThe agricultural commissioner rejected the idea of a Brexit deal in which Northern Ireland remained in the customs union or internal market while the rest the UK left, saying that would not be acceptable to the Democratic Unionist party, the Northern Irish party now propping up Theresa May's government after the prime minister lost her parliamentary majority in the June election.\n\nAsked whether Mrs May's government was sufficiently seized of Ireland's concerns, he said it was not. \"Based on their pronouncements about leaving the single market and the customs union they are clearly setting their face against practical policy proposals that will help to achieve a soft Brexit,\" Mr Hogan said.\n\n\"They're talking about being a soft Brexit but they're acting in the negotiations [in a way that] can only lead to a hard Brexit.\"", "id": "9084236", "details": {"liCnt": 5}, "date": "2017-08-14", "title":

During this interim period, which will be negotiated with Brussels, Britain will look to negotiate bold new trade relationships around the world\", the British statement said.\n\nIt said this arrangement would be \"time-limited\", but without giving a deadline.\n\nIt also said it would \"allow for a smooth and orderly transfer\" to the final customs regime.\n\nThe final regime would either be a \"customs partnership\" or a \"highly streamlined customs arrangement\", it said.\n\nThe \"partnership\" would \"negate the need for a customs border\" between the UK and EU states.\n\nIt would mean the UK imposed the same tariffs and checks on international imports as the EU and collected customs duties on behalf of EU countries on items that entered the bloc via its ports.\n\nThe \"streamlined\" deal would mean a new customs border, including with Ireland.\n\nBut this would use high-tech solutions to create \"the freest and most frictionless possible trade\", such as CCTV that recognised the number plates of lorries carrying goods of \"trusted traders\" to avoid systematic vehicle checks.\n\nThe ideas were welcomed by British industry lobbyists, despite the fact they go against the EU's previous red lines.\n\nThe EU has said it would be illegal for the UK to negotiate new trade deals around the world so long as it is still inside its customs union.\n\nIt has also said it wants a deal on EU citizens' rights, on the Irish border, and on the UK's EU exit bill before negotiating future trade relations.\n\nPhil Hogan, the EU's agriculture commissioner, told the Financial Times, a British newspaper, that he welcomed the UK's \"appetite for a pragmatic and reasonable outcome to a free-trade agreement\".\n\nBut he said \"there's a high level of delusion in London\" on the amount of legal work to be done to implement its ideas in time and on the willingness of the other 27 EU states to agree to its proposals.\n\nKeir Starmer, the shadow Brexit minister from the opposition Labour party in the UK, was even more critical.\n\nHe said the proposals were \"fantastical and contradictory\" because they spoke of a new customs border that was not really a border.\n\n\"The cabinet remain split on key issues and cannot decide between two very different but equally unachievable options,\" he said.\n\nThe Irish government said in a statement on Monday the \"immediate focus\" of EU talks should be \"citizens' rights, the financial settlement and the Irish specific issues\".\n\nSinn Fein, the Irish nationalist party, called the idea of a \"streamlined\" border \"nonsense and impossible to deliver\".\n\n\"They [the British government] are prepared to impose an EU frontier across Ireland and are prepared to play fast and loose with our economy and peace agreements,\" David Cullinane, its Brexit spokesman said.", "id": "9233695", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-15", "title": "UK keen to keep old EU customs deal", "image":

Britain will be leaving the customs union of the European Union after the article 50 negotiating phase expires in March 2019. But this is because participation is only available to EU member states and Britain will not be a member after this point. It will however be seeking to negotiate new membership of a customs union with the EU's customs union, clinging to the side of the existing trade arrangements in an interim phase described as \"continued close association\". In most respects, it will look the same. The UK hopes to be a bit more explicit than now in its trade talks with other countries, but won't be able to implement new deals because it will be sharing the EU's existing common external tariffs.\n\nIs that it? How does that \"bring back control\"?\n\nNot so quick. This is only the \"interim\" stage, designed to give trade negotiators an unspecified period after March 2019 to negotiate a new and lasting deal on both customs arrangements and a wider free trade agreement. The government describes this as \"time limited\", but is reserving the right to determine what that means in future. In practice, it could prove a lot like the unspecified standstill period demanded by the CBI in July but without formally adopting the language of the existing customs union and single market - perhaps to give politicians something to cling on to at the Tory party conference.\n\nWhat happens after the can is kicked down the road?\n\nHere, even the government admits it does not know what will happen. Officials were keen to stress that Tuesday's new policy paper is not the same as the formal \"position papers\" they have been publishing before the Brexit negotiating rounds in Brussels. This is intended more as something for everyone to chew on as they ponder how the ambitions of the divorce stage - eg open borders with Northern Ireland - can be reconciled with still distant discussions about future post-Brexit arrangements. The new paper imagines these will fall into two broad camps: a \"highly streamlined customs arrangement\" that looks to soften the blow of border controls with technology, and a \"new customs partnership with the EU\" which seeks clever ways of avoiding a border entirely.\n\nAssociation, arrangement, partnership? What's the difference?\n\nThe \"new customs partnership\" is the more ambitious of the two, but comes with significant compromises. It envisages the UK copying, or \"mirroring\", EU tariffs for imported goods ultimately bound for other member states. A smart phone flown into Heathrow could be put on a truck and sent to Paris without passing through another physical customs barrier because any EU duty would be charged in the UK. Importers would either have to submit to electronic tracking to show that UK-only goods were not sneaking off to the continent, or else would just be charged the higher tariff rate upfront and then claim a rebate if it ends up in a British shop. The unspecified corollary of this is that UK-produced goods would also get to escape EU import tariffs because we would strike a far-reaching free trade deal at the same time. If everything heading for the continent or Ireland is therefore in effect duty free, then we don't need physical customs checks - or so the logic goes.\n\nThat sounds difficult. Is there an alternative?\n\nOfficials concede that their plan has never been tried before and is highly ambitious. It depends on substantial goodwill among the EU27, who will have to have the same faith in UK Customs & Excise and the honesty of British business as our own government seems to be ready to extend. If it cannot be agreed, then the UK proposes trying to mitigate existing customs controls with the \"highly streamlined arrangement\". This also relies on companies agreeing to report exports in advance, or perhaps once a month for big shippers, so that the border control can be reduced down to number plate recognition cameras and the like. Officials point out that much enforcement from non-EU countries already takes place far away from the borders, but this system could also require them to be checking on EU consumer standards as well. They may be able to persuade Dublin to accept such a scheme in the interests of Northern Irish peace, but it is hard to imagine the French, for example, taking everything on trust. The chief EU negotiator, Michel Barnier, is understood to have advised the French government to invest in new customs infrastructure at its Atlantic ports. How \"streamlined\" it proves is anybody's guess.\n\nWill Liam Fox have anything to do?\n\nIn the interim phase, Britain will face many of the same obstacles to striking new trade deals with non-EU countries as it struggles with now. Officials hope Fox might have some more leeway to negotiate, but are adamant that implementing new tariff arrangements is incompatible with abiding by the common EU tariff during the interim association. Once we move to arrangement or partnership things get a little easier, although maintaining key aspects of EU law could still prove a hindrance to new bilateral deals. The biggest worry, however, is time. Nigel Farage was quick to criticise the government on Tuesday for showing \"weakness\" and \"delay\". If an interim phase lasts three years, which many experts regard as a minimum, Fox might not be able to sign and implement any new deals until March 2022. This would be well into Donald Trump's second term (if he gets one) and approaching the point when any US president is seen as a lame duck by lawmakers in Congress who have to ratify trade deals. Britain might be front of the queue in Trump's eyes, but we won't be ready to do anything beyond talking about it until he is nearly gone.", "id": "9282205", "details": {"liCnt": 7}, "date":

It's going to be quite tough, but we'll sort it out.\"\n\nThe minister was speaking as the UK revealed its position on a continuing customs arrangement with Brussels ahead of the latest round of Brexit talks.\n\nThe plans would see a time-limited transition which would ensure businesses on both sides of the Channel only have to adapt once to the rule changes.\n\nAnd he told the BBC the UK was not ruling out making some payments to the EU after the end of the Article 50 timeline in 2019 as part of a transitional deal.\n\nBut pressed on whether the UK would have to pay, he told Radio 4's Today programme: \"I am not going to do the negotiation on air.\n\n\"What we are not going to do, let's be clear, we are not going to continue the \u00a310 billion a year net contributions we currently have.\"\n\nAsked if money could be a part of the negotiations, he said: \"I didn't say that. Wait and see.\"\n\nMr Davis also appeared on ITV's Good Morning Britain, and asked whether Britain would have to pay to stay in the customs union, he said: \"Well what happens in that sort of interim period you will have to leave me to negotiate, I'm afraid.\"\n\nHe added: \"We are still haggling with them over what we may owe them in the short term but we are going to bring the overall thing to an end.\n\n\"This is something that is in both sides' interest.\"\n\nThe proposals for new customs arrangements to allow trade with the EU are being outlined in the first of a series of \"future partnership papers\" being released by the Government.\n\nOne option being put forward by Mr Davis for new arrangements would see the UK manage a new customs border with administration streamlined to the \"fullest extent possible\".\n\nHe estimated the transition period would be roughly two years - with the deadline of the next General Election in 2022 as the \"absolute maximum\", adding: \"Unlike Big Ben it shouldn't take forever,\"\n\nBut critics have dubbed the proposals \"a fantasy\" and said they did little to provide the certainty businesses have called for.\n\nSir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, called the proposals \"incoherent and inadequate\" and said the Cabinet remains \"split on key issues\".\n\nHe added: \"These fantastical and contradictory proposals provide no guidance for negotiators or certainty for businesses.\n\n\"The proposals also make it less likely that necessary transitional arrangements will be in place by March 2019.\"\n\nAnd Tom Brake, the Liberal Democrats Brexit spokesman, said the Government's \"extreme Brexit will end up leaving Britain poorer\".\n\nMeanwhile the EU flatly rebuffed the proposal - saying the UK needed to focus on settling the divorce payment before any future trading issues could be thrashed out.\n\nA spokesman for Brussels said: \"An agreement on a future relationship between the EU and the UK can only be finalized once the UK has become a third country.\"\n\nAnd it rejected Mr Davis' claims future trade could be as easy as it is currently, adding; \"As Michel Barnier has said on several occasions, 'frictionless trade' is not possible outside the single market and customs union.\"\n\nBut they said the publication of a series of position papers as \"a positive step towards now really starting phase one of the negotiations\".\n\nMeanwhile Guy Verhofstadt, the European Parliament's Brexit negotiator, said: \"To be in and out of the Customs Union and 'invisible borders' is a fantasy.\"\n\nEchoing the EU statement he tweeted: \"First need to secure citizens' rights and a financial settlement.\"\n\nA further Government paper on the fraught issue of the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic will be published tomorrow.\n\nOthers are also expected with the next round of Brexit negotiations in Brussels at the end of the month, and a crucial European Council meeting of EU leaders coming in October", "id": "9270428", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-15", "title": "David Davis admits EU negotiator is losing patience with refusals to put figure on Brexit 'divorce bill'", "image": "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/nintchdbpict000340156406.jpg?strip=all&quality=100&w=1200&h=800&crop=1", "extractedDates": [{"textStart": 3216, "date": "2019-03-", "amb": false, "textEnd": 3226}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-15", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 5, "id": "76", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "Kingdom of Belgium"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Brussels"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 4, "id": "102303", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brussels", "label": {"eng": "Brussels"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "BBC"}, "id": "302926", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC"}, {"label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "id": "303064", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union"}, {"label": {"eng": "Fantasy"}, "id": "303768", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fantasy"}, {"label": {"eng": "European Parliament"}, "id": "303907", "score": 1, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Parliament"}, {"label": {"eng": "Customs"}, "id": "304875", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customs"}, {"label": {"eng": "ITV (TV network)"}, "id": "306548", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITV_(TV_network)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Today (BBC Radio 4)"}, "id": "312757", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Today_(BBC_Radio_4)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Michel Barnier"}, "id": "314716", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michel_Barnier"}, {"label": {"eng": "Next United Kingdom general election"}, "id": "318269", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Next_United_Kingdom_general_election"}, {"label": {"eng": "Liberal Democrats"}, "id": "318270", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_Democrats"}, {"label": {"eng": "Single market"}, "id": "326525", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_market"}, {"label": {"eng": "BBC Radio 4"}, "id": "329154", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_Radio_4"}, {"label": {"eng": "Bargaining"}, "id": "346428", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bargaining"}, {"label": {"eng": "Customs union"}, "id": "382637", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customs_union"}, {"label": {"eng": "Guy Verhofstadt"}, "id": "388307", "score": 1, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guy_Verhofstadt"}, {"label": {"eng": "Keir Starmer"}, "id": "419610", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keir_Starmer"}, {"label": {"eng": "Good Morning Britain (2014 TV programme)"}, "id": "427656", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Morning_Britain_(2014_TV_programme)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Tom Brake"}, "id": "606843", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Brake"}, {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom withdrawal from the European Union"}, "id": "1268836", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_withdrawal_from_the_European_Union"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 108, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 140, "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 268, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 550, "label": "dmoz/Society/Future", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Future"}], "time": "12:01:00"}

It is hoped the temporary measure will avert border chaos and calm businesses worried by the effects of leaving the bloc.\n\nThe customs union allows goods to travel across the EU free of tariffs and checks. Remaining part of the system would restrict Britain's ability to sign trade deals with non-EU countries.\n\nBrexit secretary David Davis has also insisted the government would \"negotiate and sign\" agreements with other countries once the EU withdrawal is complete, whatever the nature of any transitional period after 2019.\n\nHowever, former EU trade commissioner Karel De Gucht has warned that Brussels will find Britain's proposals \"very problematic.\"\n\nThe Belgian, who was European commissioner for trade between 2010 and 2014, suggested the EU would accept the status quo on customs for several years only on its terms. They would be Britain abiding by decisions of the European Court of Justice, paying contributions, and not seeking to sign trade deals with third countries.\n\nDe Gucht told the BBC the EU would not concede the benefits of a \"temporary benefits union\" if that meant \"keeping Britain warm\" for preferential agreements with non-EU countries in future years.\n\nDavis told the BBC Britain \"should be able to have an arrangement whereby we can do the negotiation, sign it off, but not enter it into effect.\" He insists the law is on Britain's side, because the \"duty of sincere cooperation\" - the bar on customs union members negotiating other deals - would lapse with EU withdrawal.\n\nThe stance is likely to guarantee confrontation with the EU's chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, once talks resume at the end of the month.\n\nIt is also possible that the EU will refuse to discuss the plan at all, having insisted the UK must first settle its priorities - citizens' rights, the so-called divorce bill and the Northern Ireland border.\n\nDavis has not ruled out Britain making some payments to the EU after 2019 as part of the transitional deal now being sought.\n\nHe insisted, however, that it would not be the \"current \u00a310 billion [US$12.9 billion] a year.\" That appears to rule out the \u00a336 billion, three-year financial settlement thought to be under discussion.", "id": "9257373", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-15", "title": "EU likely to deny Britain's hopes for free trade, former commissioner warns  --  RT UK", "image": "https://img.rt.com/files/2017.08/article/5992af7ddda4c894668b4567.jpg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-15", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "Kingdom of Belgium"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 3, "id": "19", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgium", "label": {"eng": "Kingdom of Belgium"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 5, "id": "76", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Northern Ireland"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 1, "id": "85555", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland", "label": {"eng": "Northern Ireland"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "Kingdom of Belgium"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Brussels"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 3, "id": "102303", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brussels", "label": {"eng": "Brussels"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Law"}, "id": "302557", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law"}, {"label": {"eng": "Human rights"}, "id": "302584", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights"}, {"label": {"eng": "BBC"}, "id": "302926", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC"}, {"label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "id": "303064", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union"}, {"label": {"eng": "Trade"}, "id": "303410", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade"}, {"label": {"eng": "Member state of the European Union"}, "id": "303880", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_state_of_the_European_Union"}, {"label": {"eng": "Customs"}, "id": "304875", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customs"}, {"label": {"eng": "Tariff"}, "id": "309353", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tariff"}, {"label": {"eng": "Michel Barnier"}, "id": "314716", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michel_Barnier"}, {"label": {"eng": "European Court of Justice"}, "id": "317113", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Court_of_Justice"}, {"label": {"eng": "Customs union"}, "id": "382637", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customs_union"}, {"label": {"eng": "European Commissioner"}, "id": "439077", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Commissioner"}, {"label": {"eng": "Karel De Gucht"}, "id": "761228", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karel_De_Gucht"}, {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom withdrawal from the European Union"}, "id": "1268836", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_withdrawal_from_the_European_Union"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 99, "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Signage", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Signage"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 108, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 139, "label": "dmoz/Society/Government", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Government"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 140, "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral"}], "time": "10:43:00"}

Today, the government sets out its plans for the temporary customs union it wants with the EU after Britain leaves in 2019. Brexit secretary David Davis says the aim for this new relationship is for it to be as 'close as we can to the current arrangement'. This will please the likes of Philip Hammond and the Times are painting this proposal as a victory for the Chancellor over Liam Fox in the ongoing Cabinet tussle. It will also placate businesses eager to avoid a cliff-edge.\n\nAs ever with Brexit negotiations, not everyone will be entirely happy. David Davis was keen to emphasis on the Today programme that the interim plans will be for two years or less. This is a nod to those who are worried that a transition period could be anything but - resulting in a limbo that drags on for longer than intended. This won't be the case, say ministers, who point out that while some things will stay the same after 2019, not everything will. One of the key proposals to emerge from the government's plan today is that switching to this new customs union won't stop Britain negotiating its own trade deals after 2019. Yet it will stop Britain putting pen to paper on these deals. It also seems likely that the EU will have something to say on this part of the plan. The Brexit secretary might have been adamant that there is nothing to stop the UK negotiating away come 2019; the EU might not agree.\n\nOf course, it's true that a smooth transition is in the EU's interests. The customs union largely affects the passage of goods rather than services. With the continent running a \u00a390bn goods trade surplus with the UK in 2015, Davis has a point when he says other European countries would be harmed by a lack of arrangement coming into place when the Article 50 clock stops ticking. Britain's negotiating tactic over the coming months will be to stick to this line.\n\nWhile Britain does have this card to play, Davis already hinted that the UK might be willing to go further and pay up to remain in the customs union for the transition period. When he was asked about forking out to gain access, he refused to rule anything out.

During this interim period, which will be negotiated with Brussels, Britain will look to negotiate bold new trade relationships around the world.\"\n\nBusinesses welcomed the proposals, but the Confederation of British Industry also warned the government that \"the clock is ticking and what matters now if giving companies the confidence to continue investing as quickly as possible\".\n\nPrime Minister Theresa May and her government are keen to move the talks with the EU forward to tackle the future relationship rather than focusing only on their divorce, and have promised to publish a series of policy documents this week.\n\nBut after being criticised by some EU officials for being ill-prepared for the first rounds of negotiations, the government's demand to secure trade deals while participating in a temporary customs union may cause further problems.\n\n\"It looks like the new unified position in the cabinet is to return the government to the territory of wanting to have their cake and eat it,\" said Chris Leslie, a pro-EU campaigner and member of Britain's opposition Labour Party.\n\nCountries that are part of the EU's customs union are not allowed to negotiate bilateral trade deals and May's government has said Brexit means Britain must leave the customs union.\n\nBut Turkey, while not an EU member, is part of a separate customs union for industrial goods and can still negotiate bilateral trade deals. It was not clear whether Britain was pursuing a similar arrangement to Turkey.\n\nThe government said that by sorting out the customs arrangements, Britain and the bloc could avoid a \"hard border\" with EU member state Ireland, something which officials fear could reignite tensions between Irish nationalists and unionists.\n\nIt proposed two different ways -- a highly streamlined customs arrangement managed by Britain, or a new customs partnership with the EU, which could \"negate the need for a customs border\".\n\nIts proposals on a future customs arrangement are set out in one of several position papers intended to flesh out the government's Brexit vision and show a united stance over the future relationship after rifts emerged among ministers.\n\nOn Wednesday, the government will set out its solutions for the border between Northern Ireland and Ireland.\n\n(This article has not been edited by DNA's editorial team and is auto-generated from an agency feed.)", "id":

negotiation with Brussels were going \"incredibly well\".\n\nThis morning the government published its plan to secure a deal that would reduce any problems of goods moving across the border when the UK leaves the EU in March 2019.\n\nAsked by BBC Radio 4's Today programme how long the termporary arrangement would last, Davis said: \"It's very hard to say exactly how long, the most likely is something like two years maybe a bit shorter.\"\n\nA customs union is an arrangement whereby once goods enter the zone, they can be moved around without further tariffs being imposed.\n\nThe Brexit secretary said the UK wanted to be able to strike new trade deals with non-EU countries during this period.\n\n\"We should be able to have an arrangement where we can do the negotiations, sign it off, but not enter into effect,\" he said.\n\nUntil the UK formally leaves the EU, it is not allowed to negotiate trade deals on its own.\n\nDavis said this legal barrier would be lifted even if a temporary customs arrangement was put in place.\n\nHowever Karel De Gucht, who was European Commissioner for Trade 2010-2014, told Today the EU was unlikely to let the UK start striking new trade deals while remaining in a customs union with the bloc.\n\n\"Technically you could do it,\" he said. \"But politically it is very difficult.\"\n\nDavis refused to rule out the UK paying money to Brussels after Brexit in exchange for securing a temporary customs arrangement. \"I am not going to do the negotiation on air,\" he said.\n\nAnd he rejected the suggestion the European Court of Justice would be the arbiter of any temporary customs union. \"No, we don't think so,\" he said.\n\nDavis also played down reports of cabinet splits over the Brexit strategy between Philip Hammond, Liam Fox, Boris Johnson and himself.\n\nHe said any confusion about the UK's position was deliberate \"constructive ambiguity\" designed to keep the EU on its toes. \"Sometimes you will find it difficult to read what we intend,\" he said.", "id": "9243098", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-15", "title": "David Davis Says Temporary Customs Union With EU Could Last For Two Years", "image":

Menon is currently a director at the research organisation UK In A Changing Europe.\n\nReacting to the Department for Exiting the EU (DExEU) paper published on Tuesday, Menon said \"hand on heart\" that he could not understand why the British side had decided to reveal its negotiating hand today.\n\n\"Hand on heart, I do not know why they have put this stuff out,\" Menon told Business Insider this afternoon.\n\n\"Their position up to now has been 'the British government doesn't discuss its negotiating position and doesn't publish its papers,' because why should they? You can agree with that or disagree with that -- but it was a position.\n\n\"By going back on that position, they have left themselves open to the allegation of being weak and reacting to criticism,\" he said.\n\n\"A lot of the criticism of the British government is just plain unfair. The stuff about the photo of David Davis with no papers in front of him was just ridiculous. But I don't know why they've done this. It seems like a sign of weakness.\"\n\nThe paper, which you can read in full here, confirmed the government's intention to leave the customs union and negotiate a transitional customs deal with the EU which will allow British businesses to carry on with little disruption after Brexit until a permanent customs arrangement is put into place.\n\nThe EU has made it clear on several occasions it will not discuss future trade relations with Britain until significant progress has been made on issues like the rights of citizens and the money the UK must pay in financial obligations, or the divorce bill as it has become known.\n\nHowever, the feeling within Westminster is British negotiators will struggle to make progress when talks resume this month unless the British side has a clear understanding of what it wants post-Brexit trade relations to look like.\n\nMenon says \"there is a lot in [the paper] that is ambiguous and vague\" but claims there is nothing in the government's proposals that EU negotiators are likely to sign up to. A spokesperson for the European Commission poured cold water over the UK's proposals on Tuesday, saying \"frictionless trade not possible outside the single market and customs union.\"\n\n\"Differences between 'a customs union,' 'the customs union' and 'customs union arrangement,' we don't know what any of that means. Whether 'a' customs union is materially different to 'the' customs union we don't know, and it strikes me that this is absolutely crucial,\" said Menon.\n\n\"But if a customs union is essentially the same as the customs union, why wouldn't the EU turn around and say 'well just take what you've already got?' We understand you've got political problems but for heaven's sake setting up a new system just because of Liam Fox is not in our interest.'\n\n\"Added to that, if there is any difference between the customs union and a customs union, it'll impose costs. It'll mean the French and the Dutch and the Irish have got to put in place new customs arrangements to deal with the new situation. Why they would accept increased costs just to ensure Liam Fox can negotiate trade deals I don't know.\n\n\"We need to stop and think what would make the EU want to stop and sign it. This is a negotiation. We can't just say 'this is what we want' and expect to get it because there are costs on the other side too. What they'll want is the transition either to be the same as what we have now or the same as where we end up.\"\n\nMenon said businesses will be encouraged by signs that May's government is taking their concerns seriously but stressed that, ultimately, Britain's \"fate\" will be settled by what follows the transitional period i.e a final Brexit deal or indeed no deal at all.\n\n\"The important thing about all this isn't transition but what happens after transition -- and that's even more ambiguous,\" he explained.\n\n\"Everyone is focused on transition because that's the next three years and everyone wants to know what happens tomorrow. But ultimately the fate of the country depends on what happens after that. I have a niggly sense that transition is being used a distraction to keep us all worried about that rather than the final Brexit deal.\"", "id": "9311436", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-15", "title": "Leading EU academic: The government's customs union position paper is a 'sign of a weakness'", "image": "http://static6.uk.businessinsider.com/image/5993024d361946140d8b47b5-1190-625/leading-eu-academic-the-governments-customs-union-position-paper-is-a-sign-of-a-weakness.jpg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-15", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "France"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 2, "id": "74", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "label": {"eng": "France"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 5, "id": "76", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 2, "id": "166", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 5, "id": "86522", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": null, "score": 3, "id": "303048", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "id": "303064", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union"}, {"label": {"eng": "European Commission"}, "id": "303458", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Commission"}, {"label": {"eng": "Government of the United Kingdom"}, "id": "304310", "score": 4, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_the_United_Kingdom"}, {"label": {"eng": "Customs"}, "id": "304875", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customs"}, {"label": {"eng": "King's College London"}, "id": "305285", "score": 4, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King's_College_London"}, {"label": {"eng": "Business Insider"}, "id": "314192", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Insider"}, {"label": {"eng": "Single market"}, "id": "326525", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_market"}, {"label": {"eng": "Liam Fox"}, "id": "330676", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liam_Fox"}, {"label": {"eng": "Eurasian Customs Union"}, "id": "340949", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurasian_Customs_Union"}, {"label": {"eng": "Customs union"}, "id": "382637", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customs_union"}, {"label": {"eng": "Anand Menon"}, "id": "394578", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anand_Menon"}, {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom withdrawal from the European Union"}, "id": "1268836", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_withdrawal_from_the_European_Union"}], "location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "type": "place"}, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 63, "label": "dmoz/Society/Work", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Work"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 99, "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Signage", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Signage"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 140, "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 143, "label": "dmoz/Reference/Education/Colleges and Universities", "uri": "dmoz/Reference/Education/Colleges_and_Universities"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 147, "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Customer Management", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Customer_Management"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 887, "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Labor Movement", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Labor_Movement"}], "time": "12:36:00"}

The mere opening of accession negotiations with Turkey would take another 18 years. Another 12 years after that, everyone in Brussels and Ankara knows full well that Turkish membership in the EU is an impossibility for the foreseeable future.\n\nNevertheless, the Turks think that 1) their country deserves full membership; and 2) the only reason the EU has not granted them membership is because they are Muslim. Few diagnoses could be as inaccurate as this.\n\nThree decades after Turkey formally applied for membership, it stands at position 146 on the Global Peace Index and position 155 on the World Press Freedom Index. Here are some snippets illustrating how candidate Turkey looks 30 years after it applied for EU membership:\n\nAgainst this unpleasant backdrop, the European Parliament has called for Turkey's accession talks to be suspended if Ankara fully implements plans to expand Erdo\u011fan's powers, which he narrowly won in a referendum on April 16. Although the parliament's vote is not binding, it illustrates the gulf that has grown between Ankara and Brussels.\n\nThe resolution passed by the parliament in Strasbourg \"calls on the Commission and the member states ... to formally suspend the accession negotiations with Turkey without delay if the constitutional reform package is implemented unchanged.\"\n\nIf the object of the resolution was to rein Erdo\u011fan in, it didn't work. He remains defiant. He said the majority of Turks did not \"want the EU anymore\", and the EU is not indispensable for Turkey.\n\nFor decades, Turkey and the EU have been the lead actors in a strange, not very amusing opera buffa. Turkey says it wants to join the club with no obligation to comply with membership rules. The club says it wants Turkey, although it knows full well that the applicant does not qualify. Turkey hopes the club rules will change; the club hopes the applicant will change. Neither will happen.\n\nBut both know that formally calling off the show will not benefit either party.

Brussels has brushed it off as wishful thinking, and \"leave\" voters have accused the majority Conservative government of selling out its base by seeking a softer Brexit.\n\nAccording to the plan, the U.K. would negotiate a \"temporary customs union\" where the current rules regulating the EU's tariff-free trading area would remain in place for up to two years. Brexit Minister David Davis admitted in the proposal that the U.K. may have to pay the EU for the privilege.\n\nThe plan promises to deliver an \"ambitious new customs arrangement\" and the \"freest and most frictionless possible trade\" with the rest of the EU. Yet the U.K. proposal has little audience in Brussels because it demands the right to negotiate its own international trade deals -- something it cannot do as an EU customs union member, and something the EU has been reluctant to move on.\n\nResponding to the proposals, Ireland's European commissioner, Phil Hogan, accused the U.K. of \"high-level delusion.\" Karel De Gucht, a former European commissioner for trade, called the plans \"very problematic.\" The European Commission also cast doubt on the proposals, claiming that a \"frictionless\" border was simply not possible if the U.K. leaves the customs union.\n\nThe latest policy document contradicts previous comments from U.K. Chancellor Philip Hammond and Trade Secretary Liam Fox, who days earlier had confirmed the U.K.'s departure from the EU's customs union.\n\nThe apparent flip-flop was the latest example of the overall confusion -- inside and outside the government -- that has surrounded Brexit talks from the start.\n\nOn Sunday, Fox/Hammond: no temporary membership of the Customs Union.\n\nOn Monday, Davis floats membership of a temporary Customs Union.\n\n-- Faisal Islam (@faisalislam) August 14, 2017", "id": "9343264", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-15", "title": "Everyone thinks Theresa May's new Brexit plan is a mess", "image": "https://news.vice.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/RTX3BRZ4-1024x720.jpg", "extractedDates": [{"textStart": 2322, "date": "2017-08-14", "amb": false, "textEnd": 2337}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-15", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 5, "id": "76", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "Kingdom of Belgium"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Brussels"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 4, "id": "102303", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brussels", "label": {"eng": "Brussels"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "id": "303064", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union"}, {"label": {"eng": "European Commission"}, "id": "303458", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Commission"}, {"label": {"eng": "Theresa May"}, "id": "304328", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theresa_May"}, {"label": {"eng": "Philip Hammond"}, "id": "304608", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Hammond"}, {"label": {"eng": "Customs"}, "id": "304875", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customs"}, {"label": {"eng": "Enlargement of the European Union"}, "id": "306543", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enlargement_of_the_European_Union"}, {"label": {"eng": "International trade"}, "id": "307061", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_trade"}, {"label": {"eng": "Tariff"}, "id": "309353", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tariff"}, {"label": {"eng": "Liam Fox"}, "id": "330676", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liam_Fox"}, {"label": {"eng": "Customs union"}, "id": "382637", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customs_union"}, {"label": {"eng": "European Commissioner"}, "id": "439077", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Commissioner"}, {"label": {"eng": "European Union Customs Union"}, "id": "470058", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union_Customs_Union"}, {"label": {"eng": "Karel De Gucht"}, "id": "761228", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karel_De_Gucht"}, {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom withdrawal from the European Union"}, "id": "1268836", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_withdrawal_from_the_European_Union"}, {"label": {"eng": "Second Cameron ministry"}, "id": "1383006", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Cameron_ministry"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 108, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 139, "label": "dmoz/Society/Government", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Government"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 140, "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 143, "label": "dmoz/Reference/Education/Colleges and Universities", "uri": "dmoz/Reference/Education/Colleges_and_Universities"}], "time": "13:45:00"}

There will be no endless transition period.\"\n\nOver the summer, Mr Hammond broke ranks to call for an \"off-the-shelf\" transitional deal for up to three years, keeping current trading arrangements and rules on movement of workers.\n\nBut Dr Fox made clear he would accept a transition only if he was able to seek and sign trade deals with non-EU countries from day one - and now appears to have won that battle.\n\nIn the article, the pair wrote: \"We will leave the customs union and be free to negotiate the best trade deals around the world as an independent, open, trading nation.\"\n\nThey added: \"When we've left the customs union, we will build on these relationships by negotiating as an independent nation with the freedom to sign bilateral free trade agreements.\"\n\nThe article stressed that any \"interim period\" would be time-limited and \"cannot be a back door to staying in the EU\" - while also allowing borders \"to operate smoothly\".\n\nHowever, the two ministers did not explain why they believed the EU would agree to such arrangements, in the exit talks due to resume at the end of the month.\n\nMore about: Brexit EU Customs Union Chancellor Philip Hammond Liam

They say they want a customs agreement with its 27 remaining members which allows for the \"freest and most frictionless possible trade in goods\".\n\nMinisters would also use the period to negotiate trade deals with major economies such as the United States, India and China.\n\nHow will Brussels react?\n\nThe key question.\n\nMichel Barnier, the EU's chief negotiator, has already warned that Britain will not be able to secure \"frictionless\" trade with the EU after Brexit.

Doing so is our shared duty,\" he said.\n\n\"The united desire to avoid unnecessary disruption or a disorderly exit for the United Kingdom from the European Union is a strong foundation for the negotiations.\"\n\nMinisters have been warned about the strain ports could be put under if they face a big increase in bureaucracy for dealing with goods entering and leaving the country.\n\nThe proposals for new customs arrangements to allow trade with the EU are being outlined in the first of a series of \"future partnership papers\" being released by the Government.\n\nAlthough negotiations on a new system are not scheduled to start for some time, the Government said setting out its aims showed the UK's \"desire to ensure our exit from the EU is smooth, orderly and successful\".\n\nOne option being put forward by Mr Davis for new arrangements would see the UK manage a new customs border with administration streamlined to the \"fullest extent possible\".\n\nThe Brexit Secretary will also float plans for a customs partnership with the EU that would negate the need for a customs border between the UK and the rest of the bloc.\n\nA position paper on the fraught issue of the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic will be published on Wednesday, ahead of the third round of Brexit negotiations in Brussels at the end of the month.\n\nSir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, called the proposals \"incoherent and inadequate\" in response to pleas for certainty from British businesses.\n\n\"Instead, the Cabinet remain split on key issues and cannot decide between two very different but equally unachievable options,\" he said.\n\n\"The first proposal suggests 'a new customs border with the EU' could be introduced without disrupting trade; the second suggests a new borderless customs partnership could somehow be agreed while Britain also signs external trade deals.\n\n\"These fantastical and contradictory proposals provide no guidance for negotiators or certainty for businesses.\n\n\"The proposals also make it less likely that necessary transitional arrangements will be in place by March 2019.\"\n\nIt comes after Chancellor Philip Hammond and International Trade Secretary Liam Fox said the UK would pull out of both the single market and the customs union in 2019.\n\nLabour former shadow chancellor Chris Leslie, a leading supporter of the Open Britain campaign group, said: \"It looks like the new unified position in the Cabinet is to return the Government to the territory of wanting to have their cake and eat it.\n\n\"Ministers claim we can leave the customs union and yet still achieve 'the most frictionless customs agreement anywhere in the world' but with absolutely no detail about how such a miraculous new system will be achieved.\n\n\"It is a fantasy to pretend we can have the freest and most frictionless trade possible with our largest partner when the Government remain intent on pulling Britain out of the customs union.\"\n\nTom Brake, the Liberal Democrats Brexit spokesman, said the Government's \"extreme Brexit will end up leaving Britain poorer\".\n\nHe added: \"Even if they were agreed to by the EU, these proposals will only delay the economic pain caused by leaving the customs union.\n\n\"We still face the prospect of more red tape for businesses, longer queues at our borders and higher prices for consumers once the transition comes to an end.\"\n\nCopyright (c) Press Association Ltd. 2017, All Rights Reserved.", "id": "9177553", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-14", "title":

Like the other papers on Brexit themes that are expected from Whitehall in the coming days, this one seems less concerned with its ostensible purpose, UK policy towards the EU after Brexit, than it is with the management of internal Conservative party divisions. The document is primarily an attempt to signal to MPs that Theresa May's government is back at its desks and back in business after its election debacle, and is now working together as one. It is not a serious attempt to set out a desirable relationship with the EU that stands up for Britain, its economy, its workforce and this country's values.\n\nThe document is being spun as a contribution towards the soon to be resumed Brexit negotiations between the UK and the EU. But that is largely pretence. Those discussions, which aim to reach some agreements in October, are not about future customs arrangements. They are strictly focused on the rights of EU and UK citizens in one another's jurisdictions after Brexit, on the Irish land border and on the financial settlement between the UK and the EU. Even if the new document were remarkably interesting and enlightened - and it is neither - the issues with which it deals are for later in the process, as critics were quick to point out.\n\nMost of what it contains, and most of what the Brexit secretary, David Davis, said about it on Tuesday, is little more than flannel. The paper speculates about ways in which future customs arrangements could be made simple and frictionless - as they are at the moment. But the words are aspirational not concrete. Alternative approaches are rehearsed, yet the government does not say which of them it prefers. Terms like \"innovative facilitations\" and \"technology-based solutions\" abound. Mr Davis boasts in an interview about its \"constructive ambiguity\". Yet the paper never escapes from magical thinking.\n\nAt no point does it say what it should say: \"This is what matters to us.\" The paper contains no flesh-and-blood recognition that more than half of the UK's trade in goods is with EU countries, or that Brexit will affect millions of transactions in goods, their certification of origin and the supply chains of which they are integral parts. The closest it comes to reality is to float the possibility of the UK shadowing the EU's external border customs policies in UK-EU traded goods.\n\nIt does not go further because the obvious policy for British business and British workers is not to shadow the customs union but to remain within it. That, though, is too hot for the Tory party. To open up that issue in that way, even though it is the way that would best defend the UK economy and would involve no change in our trade rules, would set off a Tory civil war that might topple Mrs May. As a result we are witnessing another episode in the lamentable story that has cursed this country's relations with the EU whenever there has been a Tory government. This latest iteration shows that, in the end, Mrs May is more concerned about getting through the Tory party conference than she is about the future of British trade. The country should be truly indignant about that.\n\nThere is, nevertheless, a substantive policy announcement in the customs paper. This is the confirmation of the government's commitment to what used to be called transitional arrangements, now rebranded as an \"interim model\" of close association with the EU. Precisely what this will mean in practice is unclear, But it represents a political victory for the chancellor, Philip Hammond, in his efforts to save the government from the prime minister's insane readiness to take the UK over a March 2019 cliff edge with the EU rather than confront the Daily Mail. It means Mrs May's earlier claim that no deal with the EU is better than a bad deal is now in the dustbin of history. This is something to welcome in an otherwise confused document.\n\nIt is not enough. Instead of taking the bold decisions to change course over Brexit policy, and putting the economy first, ministers have again feebly put their party first. It therefore falls to the opposition parties and sensible Conservatives to work together in every way to defend the public interests that this government seems incapable of defending.", "id": "9328989", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-15", "title": "The Guardian view on the EU customs union: stay, don't shadow | Editorial", "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d4df91599995f06213d30f9ec503712565f824f0/0_77_4228_2537/master/4228.jpg?w=1200&h=630&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=crop&crop=faces%2Centropy&bm=normal&ba=bottom%2Cleft&blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly91cGxvYWRzLmd1aW0uY28udWsvMjAxNi8wNi8wNy9vdmVybGF5LWxvZ28tMTIwMC05MF9vcHQucG5n&s=3ceb5549c72246e45438b7aa3d2fb814", "extractedDates": [{"textStart": 3939, "date": "2019-03-", "amb": false, "textEnd": 3949}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-15", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 5, "id": "76", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Member of Parliament"}, "id": "302970", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_Parliament"}, {"label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "id": "303064", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union"}, {"label": {"eng": "Member state of the European Union"}, "id": "303880", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_state_of_the_European_Union"}, {"label": {"eng": "Theresa May"}, "id": "304328", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theresa_May"}, {"label": {"eng": "Philip Hammond"}, "id": "304608", "score": 1, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Hammond"}, {"label": {"eng": "Customs"}, "id": "304875", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customs"}, {"label": {"eng": "Conservative Party (UK)"}, "id": "305609", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservative_Party_(UK)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Tory"}, "id": "305617", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tory"}, {"label": {"eng": "Daily Mail"}, "id": "307492", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Mail"}, {"label": {"eng": "Schengen Area"}, "id": "309629", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schengen_Area"}, {"label": {"eng": "Tories (British political party)"}, "id": "351820", "score": 4, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tories_(British_political_party)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Customs union"}, "id": "382637", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customs_union"}, {"label": {"eng": "Magical thinking"}, "id": "470268", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magical_thinking"}, {"label": {"eng": "Constructive ambiguity"}, "id": "1126495", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructive_ambiguity"}, {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom withdrawal from the European Union"}, "id": "1268836", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_withdrawal_from_the_European_Union"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 108, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 140, "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 276, "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics"}], "time": "17:34:00"}

Once this time expires, the government will hope to establish either a \"highly streamlined\" border with the EU or a new \"partnership\" with no customs border at all.\n\nThe FTA has hailed the report as a step in the right direction, but said it has compiled its own agenda that would help freight businesses and distributors continue trading during and after Brexit.\n\nThe body's Brexit recommendations include:\n\n- Customs systems and procedures capable of handling up to 300 million additional annual declarations\n\n- Learning curve - time to adapt to new systems and customs declarations for UK-EU trade\n\n- Equivalent procedures in all other European customs administrations to avoid intra-EU border delays\n\n- Avoid vehicle checks at ports and airports where there is no time and no room - advance declarations and clearance systems can eliminate the need for checks\n\n- No cliff-edge in trade procedures - businesses will require transitional arrangements to ensure international trade can continue, especially if negotiations break down at short notice and the UK exits the customs union without a deal\n\n\"The government has recognised that it cannot drive the British economy off the cliff edge of Brexit,\" said FTA deputy chief executive James Hookham. \"FTA is keen to play its part in helping to develop efficient customs procedures post-Brexit, which will keep trade flowing freely, and urges the government to include representatives of the sector, with specialist knowledge, at the negotiating table to help reach the best possible deal for Britain.\"\n\nThe logistics industry has \"clearly identified its needs\" if trade is to continue in a frictionless manner with the EU and the rest of the world, Hookham continued, adding that \"the government owes it to British trade and industry to work with us to ensure that these arrangements can be introduced as part of the final Brexit deal.\"\n\n\"No trade deal will succeed unless freight and logistics requirements have been factored into any discussions between the EU and the UK,\" he added.", "id": "9343418", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-15", "title": "Logistics industry outlines

The plan could run into resistance in Brussels where negotiators could question why Britain should enjoy the benefits of the customs union while standing outside it.\n\nJosh Hardie, the CBI's deputy director-general, said: \"It is encouraging to see these papers propose a time-limited interim period and a customs system that is as barrier-free as possible.\n\n\"We at the CBI have always been clear that new ideas on crucial issues like this should be brought to the table quickly.\"\n\nSir Vince Cable, the Liberal Democrat leader, said: \"The only way to guarantee 'free and frictionless' trade with the EU is to stay in the customs union and single market.\n\n\"Anything else risks creating more red tape for business, longer queues at our borders and higher prices for consumers.\"\n\nThe Labour MP Chris Leslie, of the Open Britain campaign group, accused ministers of \"wishful thinking\".\n\nHe said: \"It looks like the new unified position in the Cabinet is to return the Government to the territory of wanting to have their cake and eat it.\n\n\"Ministers claim we can leave the Customs Union and yet still achieve 'the most frictionless customs agreement anywhere in the world', but with absolutely no detail about how such a miraculous new system will be achieved.\"\n\nAdam Marshall, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce, said most businesses were more concerned about future customs arrangements with the EU than future trade deals.\n\nHe added: \"At this stage, it is critically important to keep a number of different options open in order to achieve this goal.\n\n\"While we await the detail of the government's customs position paper, and the reactions of EU negotiators, business is clear that a smooth transition to new arrangements is needed, and multiple adjustment costs must be avoided.\n\n\"In the long term, we should aim to avoid imports and exports being subjected to two sets of customs checks, and to ensuring the smoothest possible future trade relationship between the UK and EU.\"\n\nA position paper on the fraught issue of the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic will published tomorrow,

The EU has repeatedly warned the U.K. against cherry picking the advantages of membership and that it won't be able to enjoy frictionless trade outside its ranks.\n\nRead more about Britain's options for a trade deal with the EU\n\nWhile the bloc's 27 other governments have said they are open to a post-Brexit implementation phase, they first want to resolve matters such as citizens' rights and a financial settlement. Divorce talks are set to resume in Brussels on Aug. 28 and the EU's lead negotiator, Michel Barnier, has complained of a lack of progress in the first two rounds.\n\nThe U.K. is showing more of its hand after a summer in which members of Prime Minister Theresa May's cabinet forged a consensus around supporting a transitional period after Brexit, although there are differences over how long it should run. Tuesday's blueprint will be seen as a victory for Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond who has advocated as smooth a departure as possible from the EU.\n\nBritain's goal \"is to secure as frictionless trade as possible with the EU alongside the ability to forge trade deals around the world, and avoiding a hard border with Ireland,\" Brexit Secretary David Davis's department said in a statement. It also wants to \"negotiate bold new trade relationships around the world.\"\n\nThe Brexit department said the interim period it imagines would enable both sides of the English Channel to establish future customs arrangements to ease border crossings. The U.K.'s public-spending watchdog warned last month of a \"horror show\" if new systems were not in place by the time of Brexit.\n\nFailure to maintain something akin to the status quo could prove costly for the British. The current arrangement saves U.K. exporters from paying tariffs on goods sold to the EU. Countries outside the region and lacking a free-trade accord with it pay about 10 percent on shipments of cars alone.\n\nPotentially more expensive are non-tariff barriers. Customs checks at a U.K.-EU border such as proving the origin of goods could cost 1 billion pounds ($1.3 billion) a year and snarl traffic in both directions, according to a July report by Oxera, an economic consultancy.\n\nThe customs office calculates that in two years' time there will be 255 million declarations per year based on current levels of trade with the EU, up from 55 million now. Carmakers worry such bureaucracies would hurt their ability to ship vehicles and source inputs in a timely fashion, while retailers risk watching goods perish at borders.\n\n\"Business wants to see as frictionless a customs system as possible,\" Confederation of British Industry Deputy Director-General Josh Hardie said in a statement. \"All efforts should be made to deliver a single-step transition, so that businesses don't have to adapt twice.\"\n\nTheCityUK, which represents the finance sector, said the government must conduct \"urgent\" talks to support services, which make up a larger share of the U.K. economy.\n\nOpen Britain, a group that lobbies for close ties with the EU, accused May's government of \"having our cake and eating it.\"\n\n\"It is a fantasy to pretend we can have the freest and most frictionless trade possible with our largest partner when the government remain intent on pulling Britain out of the customs union,\" said Chris Leslie, a lawmaker in the opposition Labour Party.\n\nBarnier warned in July that it was \"not possible\" for Britain to enjoy as easy trade with the EU as it does now, pointing to the need to comply with tax returns and test animal products among other obstacles.\n\nA customs union-like relationship would help clear up the matter of how to police the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said earlier this month that a new customs union should be designed to avoid the need for controls on the 310-mile (500-kilometer) frontier which forms the EU's only land link with the U.K.\n\nThe Irish issue will be detailed more fully by the British on Wednesday when they publish another paper that will express a commitment to keeping a \"seamless and frictionless\" border on the island.\n\nThe U.K. said ultimately it would like to see as few hurdles to commerce as possible between it and the EU. That could mean designing \"highly streamlined customs arrangements\" or aligning approaches to \"negate the need for\" any border, it said.", "id": "9172158", "details": {"liCnt": 11}, "date":

The proposals today, however, have an air of unreality to them.\n\n\"The whole purpose of any interim agreement is to allow breathing space to work out a post-Brexit trade deal as it is simply not possible to so that before March 2019.\n\n\"Those constraints apply equally to the drafting of a bespoke customs deal as proposed by the British government today.\"\n\nThe UK's proposal to extend article 50 requires the agreement of all 27 states, including the Irish government.\n\nDeputy Cullinane said: \"The Irish government should stand up for the national interest and should only agree to an extension that is in our interests, that is, the economy, trade, the rights of citizens, and the protection of the Good Friday Agreement, in all of its aspects.\"\n\nRead More Today's top stories",

In the UK government's statement which outlines their intention, it lists two possible options: a \"highly streamlined customs arrangement\", or a \"new customs partnership\" with the EU.\n\nThe customs union allows EU countries to trade more freely with one another, as it imposes the same regulations and duties levied on imported goods.\n\nA change to this would impact greatly on businesses in the UK and the EU that do business with one another on a regular basis. In order to prepare businesses in Europe for the change, the UK is suggesting that an interim strategy be put in place.\n\nPrime Minister Theresa May could strengthen trade relations with the US if the UK were to leave the customs union.

However, whether the EU will agree to this until after Brexit is finalised is unknown as it could be seen as acting against the bloc's agreement.\n\nIt is a surprising turn for the Chancellor, as he argued that delaying the UK's departure from the customs union would lessen the economic shock. He and Fox have also been at loggerheads during many of the Brexit talks, with the Secretary of State for International Trade favouring a 'hard Brexit'.\n\nHowever, the pair has faced criticism over the article from both hardline Brexiteers and pro-Remainers who argue the decision is more about party unity than finding the best Brexit deal.\n\nThere is also still the matter of the 'divorce bill' to sort that has so far been a sticking point for the Conservative party.\n\nReports suggest that the Prime Minister Theresa May may be willing to pay the sum, which is estimated to be around \u20ac40 billion if it would allow the UK to negotiate a trade deal with the union.\n\nHowever, other leading Conservatives, such as Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, have spoken out against the 'fine', saying the UK owes nothing.\n\nThese reports come as the Prime Minister returns to Downing Street from her summer break. She is expected to restart negotiations with the EU soon, though it's unclear how much progress has been made up to now.\n\nThe change of heart from the Chancellor has also led to others in Parliament doubting whether Hammond can prioritise the UK's best financial interests.\n\nLeader of the Liberal Democrats Vince Cable said the u-turn from the Chancellor showed that he was not \"fighting off the more extreme Brexiteers\". He added that Hammond was supposed to be \"looking for a compromise to keep Britain within the customs union and single market as long as possible\".\n\nBrexit negotiations are likely to see the markets fluctuate until the matter of trade agreements is resolved.", "id": "9066584", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-14", "title": "Brexit Latest: UK will leave trade agreement during transitional period", "image": "https://betting.cdnbf.net/politics/london-2246461_640%20(1).336x224.jpg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-14", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 5, "id": "76", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Treaties of the European Union"}, "id": "303039", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaties_of_the_European_Union"}, {"label": {"eng": "Euroscepticism"}, "id": "303056", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euroscepticism"}, {"label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "id": "303064", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union"}, {"label": {"eng": "Trade"}, "id": "303410", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade"}, {"label": {"eng": "Trade union"}, "id": "303738", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_union"}, {"label": {"eng": "Theresa May"}, "id": "304328", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theresa_May"}, {"label": {"eng": "Philip Hammond"}, "id": "304608", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Hammond"}, {"label": {"eng": "Conservative Party (UK)"}, "id": "305609", "score": 4, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservative_Party_(UK)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Downing Street"}, "id": "305630", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downing_Street"}, {"label": {"eng": "International trade"}, "id": "307061", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_trade"}, {"label": {"eng": "Fox Broadcasting Company"}, "id": "308747", "score": 4, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Broadcasting_Company"}, {"label": {"eng": "Trade agreement"}, "id": "313703", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_agreement"}, {"label": {"eng": "Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs"}, "id": "324735", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary_of_State_for_Foreign_and_Commonwealth_Affairs"}, {"label": {"eng": "Single market"}, "id": "326525", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_market"}, {"label": {"eng": "Boris Johnson"}, "id": "326861", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boris_Johnson"}, {"label": {"eng": "Liam Fox"}, "id": "330676", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liam_Fox"}, {"label": {"eng": "Customs union"}, "id": "382637", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customs_union"}, {"label": {"eng": "Withdrawal from the European Union"}, "id": "410168", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Withdrawal_from_the_European_Union"}, {"label": {"eng": "The Sunday Telegraph"}, "id": "460086", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sunday_Telegraph"}, {"label": {"eng": "Vince Cable"}, "id": "508142", "score": 1, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vince_Cable"}, {"label": {"eng": "Leader of the Liberal Democrats"}, "id": "548018", "score": 1, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leader_of_the_Liberal_Democrats"}, {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom withdrawal from the European Union"}, "id": "1268836", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_withdrawal_from_the_European_Union"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 108, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 143, "label": "dmoz/Reference/Education/Colleges and Universities", "uri": "dmoz/Reference/Education/Colleges_and_Universities"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 269, "label": "dmoz/Business/International Business and Trade", "uri": "dmoz/Business/International_Business_and_Trade"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 479, "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day Trading", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day_Trading"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 722, "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Commodities and Futures", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Commodities_and_Futures"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 723, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Trading", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Trading"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 887, "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Labor Movement", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Labor_Movement"}], "time": "11:38:00"}

But he added that the negotiations were going \"incredibly well\" with the U.K.'s \"constructive ambiguity\" a deliberate negotiating tactic.\n\nChief negotiator Michel Barnier has said talks on future relations between the EU and the U.K., including a free-trade agreement, can't begin until EU leaders decide that \"sufficient progress\" has been made on separation issues such as the exit bill. EU leaders will make that assessment at a summit in October.\n\nDavis said Britain would meet any \"real international obligations.\"\n\n\"What we have been talking about is what they claim and what their legal basis is. They have had a difficult time in the negotiation on that, which is why they came back and said 'why don't you make your proposal.' We are going to go down that route and we are going to talk it through very very carefully. But at this stage we are not going to commit. There won't be a number by October or November, or whenever it is.\"\n\nHe would not be drawn on when a figure would be forthcoming.\n\nIn its proposals for a customs union transition period, published today, the government is putting forward a temporary customs union, distinct from but effectively identical to the current arrangements with the EU to give businesses certainty.\n\nDavis said that after Brexit in March 2019 the U.K. no longer had a legal duty -- as it currently does until EU membership -- not to negotiate and sign trade deals. So it would be free to pursue new trade deals during the transition. \"The reason we can't sign now is because of something called the duty of sincere cooperation,\" he said, \"That legal duty goes away [after Brexit].\"\n\nAnd he reiterated that the customs transition would be time limited. \"It's got to be done by the election [scheduled for 2022]. I would say the most likely is something like two years, maybe a bit shorter,\" Davis said.\n\nDavis also revealed that an \"international arbitration\" position paper, setting out Britain's alternative to oversight by the European Court of Justice, the EU's highest court, would be published next week.", "id": "9241261", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-15", "title": "Britain will not commit to Brexit bill figure by October, says David Davis", "image": "http://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/h_53595052.jpg?w=640", "extractedDates": [{"textStart": 1628, "date": "2019-03-", "amb": false, "textEnd": 1638}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-15", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 5, "id": "76", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 4, "id": "86522", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Law"}, "id": "302557", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law"}, {"label": {"eng": "BBC"}, "id": "302926", "score": 4, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC"}, {"label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "id": "303064", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union"}, {"label": {"eng": "Trade"}, "id": "303410", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade"}, {"label": {"eng": "Customs"}, "id": "304875", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customs"}, {"label": {"eng": "Free trade area"}, "id": "307356", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_trade_area"}, {"label": {"eng": "Michel Barnier"}, "id": "314716", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michel_Barnier"}, {"label": {"eng": "Eurasian Customs Union"}, "id": "340949", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurasian_Customs_Union"}, {"label": {"eng": "Customs union"}, "id": "382637", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customs_union"}, {"label": {"eng": "List of European Council meetings"}, "id": "444532", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_European_Council_meetings"}, {"label": {"eng": "Constructive ambiguity"}, "id": "1126495", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructive_ambiguity"}, {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom withdrawal from the European Union"}, "id": "1268836", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_withdrawal_from_the_European_Union"}], "location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "type": "place"}, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 108, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 127, "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Products", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Products"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 140, "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 319, "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Services", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Services"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 413, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Accounting", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Accounting"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1021, "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Medical Billing", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Medical_Billing"}], "time": "09:03:00"}

Its plan for a two-year transitional deal allowing existing customs arrangements to continue is sensible, and will hopefully provide some reassurance for an increasingly anxious business community. This follows a welcome intervention by the Chancellor Philip Hammond to head off the \"clean break\" favoured by hardline Brexiteers, which would have created a damaging \"cliff edge\" for business in 2019.\n\nHowever, the Government's document seems to be designed more for domestic political consumption - and the need to show a semblance of Cabinet unity after ministers promoted their conflicting ideas - than the reality of the difficult negotiations with the EU. There are two options for a UK-EU customs regime after the \"interim period\": a streamlined system using technology to limit bureaucracy, and a more ambitious partnership in which both parties would enforce each other's rules, which the Government admits is \"untested\" as it does not exist anywhere in the world.\n\nThese ideas are an opening bid, a wish list in tune with Boris Johnson's \"have our cake and eat it\" approach, under which the UK expects to walk out of the EU club and yet be allowed to continue to enjoy its benefits. When asked what the UK would give the EU in return, the Brexit Secretary David Davis reverted to the \"German cars\" argument, pointing out that the EU sells more to the UK than vice versa.\n\nHe will have to do better than that. It is obvious that the 27 EU countries will not allow the UK a pain-free exit; they will use Brexit to discourage other states from trying to cherry-pick their membership terms. Britain will have to pay a price for the close trading links it wants to keep, while naively expecting the EU to allow it to strike rival trade deals with non-EU nations.\n\nBrexit Secretary: UK wants temporary EU customs deal\n\nRather than gazing at the horizon, the Government should be prioritising the more pressing issues on which the EU is demanding progress before it will discuss a long-term deal: citizens' rights, the UK's divorce payment and the Irish border. Ministers will address the Irish question on Wednesday but, ominously, Mr Davis warned that the UK would not provide \"a number\" for the financial settlement by October or November. The Government should show more flexibility on this sensitive issue but is doing little to prepare the ground.\n\nWhile ministers believe \"the money\" is their trump card, the EU may have a bigger one - the clock. Time is running out for an agreement, which will need to be struck by the autumn of 2018 to allow it to be approved by EU institutions by March 2019.\n\nBuried in the Government's document is the announcement that its Customs Bill will give it powers to operate standalone customs, VAT and excise systems in case there is no deal with the EU. While this is not ministers' preferred outcome, the extra bureaucracy and costs it would involve should encourage the Government to strain every sinew to secure what Theresa May has called \"a deep and special partnership\" with the EU.\n\nAvoiding the worst outcome of all - no deal - will require much more clarity from the Government, and quickly. Ministers will have to accept some painful compromises; the sooner they admit that, and stop dreaming about a one-sided agreement in which the EU allows the UK \"frictionless trade\" at no cost, the better.\n\nMore about: Editorial Brexit Reuse content", "id": "9296599", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-15", "title": "The Government still isn't paying attention to what's most important - and immediate - about Brexit", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/08/15/10/davis-barnier.jpg", "extractedDates": [{"textStart": 2816, "date": "2019-03-", "amb": false, "textEnd": 2826}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-15", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 5, "id": "76", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Human rights"}, "id": "302584", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights"}, {"label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "id": "303064", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union"}, {"label": {"eng": "Member state of the European Union"}, "id": "303880", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_state_of_the_European_Union"}, {"label": {"eng": "Government of the United Kingdom"}, "id": "304310", "score": 4, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_the_United_Kingdom"}, {"label": {"eng": "Theresa May"}, "id": "304328", "score": 1, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theresa_May"}, {"label": {"eng": "Philip Hammond"}, "id": "304608", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Hammond"}, {"label": {"eng": "Institutions of the European Union"}, "id": "309183", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institutions_of_the_European_Union"}, {"label": {"eng": "Value added tax"}, "id": "312760", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_added_tax"}, {"label": {"eng": "Excise"}, "id": "315026", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excise"}, {"label": {"eng": "Boris Johnson"}, "id": "326861", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boris_Johnson"}, {"label": {"eng": "Republic of Ireland\u2013United Kingdom border"}, "id": "536741", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Ireland\u2013United_Kingdom_border"}, {"label": {"eng": "Irish question"}, "id": "586422", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_question"}, {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom withdrawal from the European Union"}, "id": "1268836", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_withdrawal_from_the_European_Union"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 108, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 139, "label": "dmoz/Society/Government", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Government"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 140, "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 268, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business"}], "time": "14:22:00"}

First need to secure citizens rights & a financial settlement -- Guy Verhofstadt (@GuyVerhofstadt)\n\nAugust 15, 2017\n\nThe customs partnership is one of two proposals put forward by Davis to help deliver the \"freest and most frictionless trade possible between the UK and the EU.\"\n\nThis arrangement, which would see the UK \"mirror\" EU tariffs on goods coming into Britain, involves an increase of red tape for businesses.\n\nCompanies selling goods into Britain would have to pay which ever tariff is higher out of the UK and EU rate, and then claim any money back they are owed at a later date.\n\nThe report says: \"Businesses in supply chains would need to be able to track goods or pass the ability to claim a repayment along their supply chain in order to benefit.\"\n\nThe other plan is for a \"highly streamlined\" arrangement, which would make use of new technologies to speed up the processing of goods arriving and leaving the UK.\n\nThe Government admits that this approach - which would see a customs border - would lead to \"an increase in administration compared to being in the customs union.\"\n\nThe Government also confirmed the UK would seek to stay in a customs union with the EU after March 2019, which would stop Britain from implementing free trade deals with other countries.\n\nSpeaking on BBC Radio 4 this morning, Davis said this interim arrangement could last two years.\n\nAnnouncing the 'Future Customs Arrangements' document, Davis said: \"The approaches we are setting out today will benefit both the EU and UK and avoid a cliff-edge for businesses and individuals on both sides.\n\n\"The way we approach the movement of goods across our border will be a critical building block for our independent trade policy.\n\n\"An interim period would mean businesses only need to adjust once to the new regime and would allow for a smooth and orderly transition.\n\n\"The UK is the EU's biggest trading partner so it is in the interest of both sides that we reach an agreement on our future relationship.\n\n\"The UK starts from a strong position and we are confident we can deliver a result that is good for business here in the UK and across the EU.\"",

Why did they go public with it?\n\nIt's been a grimly entertaining August, watching government ministers arguing about whether a transition is needed and, if so, what form they would prefer it to take. The international trade secretary, Liam Fox, appears to have bowed to the inevitable and realised that some kind of transition is the only way to make Brexit work. But the price of Fox's assent appears to be a type of deal that would in fact be impossible to agree with the EU. In the Sunday Telegraph, Fox and the chancellor, Philip Hammond, wrote: \"We are both clear that during this period the UK will be outside the single market and outside the customs union.\"\n\nBut it is the EU that will decide the nature of the transition Britain will get. The EU's Brexit strategy is underpinned by two principles: protect the EU's legal order from Britain's attempts to cherry-pick; and maximise the leverage that article 50's two-year deadline provides. If the Brexit talks collapse and no deal is struck, trade and investment in Britain would take a big hit - and while the EU would be hurt by this, it would incur much smaller losses than we would. And there is not much time to negotiate; the Brexit agreement must be struck by October 2018, because the European council, the British parliament and the European parliament will need six months to ratify it. These facts are the source of the EU's bargaining power. Since it holds the aces, the EU will insist that any transition deal is an off-the-shelf one.\n\nThere is simply not enough time to negotiate both a made-to-measure transition and the outline of the final deal in the period remaining. If Britain wanted a very simple agreement that kept trade tariff-free, but lacked any of the single market rules that tackle important non-tariff barriers to trade, then a transition wouldn't be needed: the whole thing could be wrapped up quickly. But any agreement comprehensive enough to be economically tolerable for Britain will take much longer to negotiate. And during the transition period itself, the 27 will insist that all EU rights and obligations continue. If it disagrees, Britain will need to go over the cliff-edge and try to negotiate a trade deal from outside the single market.\n\nThe decision to leave the customs union means that Ireland, France, Belgium and the Netherlands will have to make big investments in IT systems and lorry parks at their ports to cope with the post-Brexit surge of customs declarations and shipment checks. These are costs that the UK is imposing upon them. Why would those countries agree to an interim customs agreement that requires them to scramble to invest in their ports, simply to reduce costs at the EU border for Britain and to allow Liam Fox to negotiate trade deals with countries outside Europe?\n\nIt is also obvious that Britain will not be ready to leave the customs union or the single market in March 2019. The National Audit Office warned the government last month that its new customs IT system might not be ready. It was commissioned before the referendum, so was not designed with Brexit in mind, and any deal with the EU will probably require customs procedures that its designers did not anticipate. The government will have to build lorry parks in English ports and in Northern Ireland so customs checks can be made. These are not being built because it is not yet clear how big they will have to be; and that will not be clear until a customs agreement is struck with the EU.\n\nNeither are cabinet ministers any closer to agreeing the migration regime that will replace free movement. A new framework will require legislation to determine which EU citizens will be allowed to work. The UK does not have a register of EU citizens that are currently in the UK, and a registration scheme will require new IT systems and staff. Such new bureaucracies usually take longer to set up than ministers hope.\n\nGiven the political and practical obstacles to Fox and Hammond's transition plan, why did they publish it in the first place? There are three possibilities. First, the phrase \"during this period\" provides some wriggle room. The UK might seek a transition with a few years of full membership of the single market and customs union, and then a period when free movement of workers ends and the new customs arrangements kick in. (Given the EU's cherry-picking rule, this is unlikely to happen).\n\nSecond, the government might try to retain single market membership and just give it another name. Rather than the European court of justice, a new UK-EU court might adjudicate disputes during the transition. EU citizens might have to fill out more comprehensive registration forms, while still being allowed to work.\n\nThird, we know that ministers' words have become devalued - remember Boris Johnson saying that the EU can \"go whistle\" for the money the UK owes? Cabinet members are trying to rebuild party unity after a month of open disagreement, and are laying down fudge as the foundation for compromise.\n\nWhatever their motives, Fox and Hammond's words are demonstrably too detached from reality to be taken seriously.\n\n* John Springford is director of research at the Centre for European Reform in London", "id": "9099474", "details": {"liCnt": 10},

This is a special club for EU members that allows them to move goods in and out of each others' countries without having to show special ID or empty their pockets (or trucks) at the door.\n\nContainers roll on and roll off at both ends with zero hassle.\n\nMany businesses and port authorities are worried that leaving the club will mean people are stopped at the border and that these delays will cause long backlogs, interrupt supply chains, increase costs and deter trade.\n\nAs the head of the port of Dover has put it: \"If we don't get this right, we could face Operation Stack every day in perpetuity.\"\n\nThe answers to these customs questions are therefore important.\n\nYes and no.\n\nThe government document is very clear that the UK will leave the customs union at the end of March 2019. The UK will then seek to agree an \"interim period\".\n\nSo what will that look like? There is a big clue in today's paper.\n\nThe government is promising that businesses will only have to adjust once to our eventual customs relationship with the EU.\n\nThat must mean that the day after we leave the EU, and enter the interim period, there will be no change.\n\nSo we are out of the customs union, but everything will pretty much stay the same until the interim period is over.\n\nThe only difference is that because we are technically out of the customs union, we will be able to negotiate our own trade deals with non-EU countries, while enjoying the benefits of frictionless trade we have now.\n\nThis approach will look to many like the \"having our cake and eating it\" that Boris Johnson was so keen on - and EU officials weren't.\n\nThe cabinet now seems united that this interim period is finite.\n\nFirst answer: a brand new \"streamlined\" customs border with the EU.\n\nSome combination of technology, negotiation, unilateral rule changes would make for a whizzy low-friction border.\n\nMany will say that even if this new system works, it will find it hard to beat what we have now.\n\nOthers will say that a tiny bit of extra work at the border is a price worth paying for freedom to cut new trade deals.\n\nSecond answer: a new partnership based on a \"shared approach\" that would remove the need for a customs border altogether.\n\nThat option has most experts scratching their heads.\n\nWhatever it is, it does not exist between the EU and anyone else right now (with the possible exception in a limited way of Turkey), and so is hard to analyse.\n\nOverall, what we learn from this document is that the government wants to leave the customs union, while leaving border arrangements identical for up to five years from now.\n\nAfter March 2019, it hopes to negotiate new trade deals, and there is nothing in reality to stop Liam Fox warming relations with prospective partners right now.\n\nWhat is still hard to see is how substantive those negotiations with third parties can really be when we, and they, still have no idea what our future relationship will be with the EU.\n\nThe government is clearly trying to show the UK and the EU that it is getting its act together with these papers and I'm told this show of unity and effort will be welcomed by business.\n\nBut it's worth remembering Liam Fox has always been clear that, in his mind at least, an interim agreement means a period of time to adjust from A to B - where B is known and understood by both parties. It is NOT an extra three years to figure out where B might be.\n\nThe time available to define B - namely, the wider issues such as the financial settlement, trade, tariffs, immigration and rights of EU citizens in the UK and vice versa - continues to tick down.", "id": "9187109", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-14", "title": "Brexit: Back-to-school exam papers are marked - BBC News", "image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/560/cpsprodpb/1775C/production/_97329069_mediaitem97329067.jpg", "extractedDates": [{"textStart": 1351, "freq": 2, "date": "2019-03-", "amb": false, "textEnd": 1361}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-15", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 4, "id": "76", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "Turkey"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 2, "id": "225", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey", "label": {"eng": "Turkey"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "id": "303064", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union"}, {"label": {"eng": "Trade"}, "id": "303410", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade"}, {"label": {"eng": "Member state of the European Union"}, "id": "303880", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_state_of_the_European_Union"}, {"label": {"eng": "Theresa May"}, "id": "304328", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theresa_May"}, {"label": {"eng": "Philip Hammond"}, "id": "304608", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Hammond"}, {"label": {"eng": "Customs"}, "id": "304875", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customs"}, {"label": {"eng": "Border"}, "id": "308560", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Border"}, {"label": {"eng": "Port authority"}, "id": "323620", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_authority"}, {"label": {"eng": "Boris Johnson"}, "id": "326861", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boris_Johnson"}, {"label": {"eng": "Liam Fox"}, "id": "330676", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liam_Fox"}, {"label": {"eng": "Customs union"}, "id": "382637", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customs_union"}, {"label": {"eng": "Withdrawal from the European Union"}, "id": "410168", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Withdrawal_from_the_European_Union"}, {"label": {"eng": "Customs area"}, "id": "436702", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customs_area"}, {"label": {"eng": "Port of Dover"}, "id": "455321", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_of_Dover"}, {"label": {"eng": "Operation Stack"}, "id": "641157", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Stack"}, {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom withdrawal from the European Union"}, "id": "1268836", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_withdrawal_from_the_European_Union"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 63, "label": "dmoz/Society/Work", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Work"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 108, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 140, "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 147, "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Customer Management", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Customer_Management"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 269, "label": "dmoz/Business/International Business and Trade", "uri": "dmoz/Business/International_Business_and_Trade"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 270, "label": "dmoz/Business/International Business and Trade/Services", "uri": "dmoz/Business/International_Business_and_Trade/Services"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 479, "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day Trading", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day_Trading"}], "time": "19:16:00"}

Brussels has insisted sufficient progress must be made on Northern Ireland, citizens' rights and the so-called 'divorce bill' before negotiations can move forward.\n\nNevertheless, the formal position paper is not expected to give ground and will also play for time by arguing the border issue can only be resolved once the shape of a future trading deal is known.\n\nAt least three documents will be published this week, as ministers seek to rebut widespread criticism that Britain's aims for the negotiations are a muddle.\n\nAnother paper will set out how to ensure \"continuity in the availability of goods\", addressing the vexed issue of future customs arrangements.\n\nA third will explore 'confidentiality and access to official documents following the UK's withdrawal', the Department for Exiting the European Union (DExEU) said. The publications will show that \"intense work is underway to prepare for formal talks on the future, deep and special partnership the UK wants to strike with the EU\", a source at the department argued.\n\nBrexit Secretary David Davis, said: \"Over the last year, the Government has been working with British businesses and the British people to establish exactly how our new relationship with the EU should look and feel.\n\n\"And over the coming weeks we'll advance that thinking with a swathe of new future partnership papers.\n\n\"I've launched this process because with time of the essence, we need to get on with negotiating the bigger issues around our future partnership to ensure we get a deal that delivers a strong UK and a strong EU.\"\u200b\n\nThe government will hope the position papers will convince the EU Commission that it does have a coherent plan, when the exit talks resume at the end of this month.\n\nAfter the last round of negotiations, Michel Barnier, the

The proposed model, which would mean close association with the EU Customs union for a time-limited period, would ensure that UK businesses only have to adjust once to a new customs relationship. This would minimise disruption and offering business a smooth and orderly transition.\n\nThe approaches we are setting out today will benefit both the EU and UK and avoid a cliff-edge for businesses and individuals on both sides.\n\nThe way we approach the movement of goods across our border will be a critical building block for our independent trade policy. An interim period would mean businesses only need to adjust once to the new regime and would allow for a smooth and orderly transition.\n\nThe UK is the EU's biggest trading partner so it is in the interest of both sides that we reach an agreement on our future relationship.

Perhaps chastened by pre-holiday criticism from Brussels that its approach has been sluggish and opaque, May's government will on Tuesday publish the latest in a string of position papers aimed at fleshing at its ambitions for future relations with the European Union.\n\nToday's topic? Customs arrangements. The paper will state an intention to seek a \"close association\" with the EU's tariff-free, bureaucracy-light customs union for an \"interim\" period after the U.K. leaves the bloc in March 2019, with a view to striking a permanent deal that potentially preserves much of that relationship.\n\nThe proposal was cheered by lobbying groups for business, which is keen to avoid the duties, paperwork and regulatory uncertainty that life outside the customs union threatens, though those representing services want help in securing access for their industries. A continued customs arrangement would also help resolve the matter of how to police the Irish border, the subject of a position paper coming on Wednesday.\n\nYet the U.K. is also hoping to start sealing trade deals with other countries, something full membership of the customs union prevents. That will raise eyebrows in the EU, which has warned against cherry-picking and says that the U.K. won't be able to enjoy \"frictionless\" commerce outside its ranks.\n\nRead more: What are Britain's options for a post-Brexit trade deal?\n\nThe paper starts to flesh out what May wants from a transitional period. That now seems to be the government's approach to Brexit, although there is still debate over length and form. After a summer of cabinet rivalry over Brexit tactics, the embrace of transition can be read as a victory for Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond, who spent the summer advocating the case for a smooth Brexit.\n\nThe EU has been open to a stopgap arrangement, but will argue that other matters such as citizens' rights and the Brexit bill need to be resolved first. That will take until October at the earliest.\n\nThe publication of the position papers comes two weeks before divorce talks resume. To update your end-of-summer diary here's a reminder of key dates. May's office says she'll travel to Japan next week, just weeks after a trip by Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson.\n\nNo City break | Headhunter Morgan & McKinley reported a one percent increase in available financial services positions in July, a month that typically sees a decline in job traffic. This suggested a volatile market as Brexit looms.\n\nPound parity | HSBC and Morgan Stanley are predicting that the euro will attain and even go beyond parity with the pound for the first time in the next year. Meanwhile, ING warned the pound is set for a bout of volatility, having already slipped to its weakest level against the euro in 10 months.\n\nBank of England on hold | The case for the Bank of England to start raising interest rates soon is weakening. As Brexit nears, the U.K. economy will lose more momentum this year than previously forecast and inflation's peak may be shy of 3 percent, according to a Bloomberg survey of economists. The latest CPI figures are released this morning at 9.30 a.m. in London.\n\nHammond challenged | Pro-Brexit campaign group Vote.EU said it will write to voters in the Chancellor's constituency to urge them to deselect him because of his stance on Brexit. Home Secretary Amber Rudd will also be targeted.\n\nWhen May began the Brexit process in March an aide told reporters that Britain would be out of the EU when \"Big Ben bongs midnight\" on March 29, 2019. It turned out he was an hour wrong - it's midnight Brussels time that will actually count.\n\nBut it's a moot point anyway: Yesterday it was revealed that Big Ben, the 13.7-ton bell in Parliament's Elizabeth Tower, will fall silent this month for four years to protect workers carrying out restoration work. It will chime again next when the U.K. is no longer in the EU.", "id": "9229743", "details": {"liCnt": 3}, "date": "2017-08-15", "title": "Brexit Bulletin: We Know What EU Did This Summer", "image":

This is speedy and drives down costs.\n\n\"Our members would want to have as few physical checks on goods as possible, and if there is to be a customs border as little waiting time there as possible too.

They have their different fields; Liam (Fox) wants to do his trade deals, my job is to make sure that we do all of those in a practical way that works and also in a way that is negotiable and we can get that outcome that we want so we are not pitching for the moon.\n\n\"Of course there are discussions, of course there are interests, but we all want the best outcome for Britain.\"\n\nMr Davis claimed his changeover period would last \"most likely something like two years - probably a bit shorter\".\n\nHe said he expected to be able to negotiate for trade deals during the transition period - but admitted he wouldn't be able to implement them until Brexit is fully complete.\n\nBut he insisted the EU is now less hostile to Britain than it was last year.\n\n\"There was a terror early on that we would be the first of many countries breaking off,\" he said. \"After the victory of Macron in France that terror has reduced. They're no longer quite so afraid. So the punishment battalion side is now reducing.\"\n\nMr Davis also revealed a clearer statement on the key issue of the European Court of Justice will be published by the government next week.\n\nHe refused to rule out the ECJ overseeing the transition period - something Britain opposes. He said \"I don't think so\" and \"let's see how that plays out.\"\n\nJosh Hardie, CBI deputy director-general, said: \"Business wants to see as frictionless a customs system as possible, with a strong emphasis on digital systems that make it easier to trade.\n\n\"But to secure frictionless trade, negotiations on regulation, tariff and non-tariff barriers will have to take place. All efforts should be made to deliver a single-step transition, so that businesses don't have to adapt twice.\"\n\nAdam Marshall, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce, said: \"Business is clear that a smooth transition to new arrangements is needed, and multiple adjustment costs must be avoided.\n\n\"In the long term, we should aim to avoid imports and exports being subjected to two sets of customs checks, and to ensuring the smoothest possible future trade relationship between the UK and EU.\"\n\nLabour former shadow chancellor Chris Leslie, a leading supporter of the Open Britain campaign group, said: \"It looks like the new unified position in the Cabinet is to return the Government to the territory of wanting to have their cake and eat it.\"\n\nTom Brake, the Liberal Democrats Brexit spokesman, said the Government's \"extreme Brexit will end up leaving Britain poorer\".", "id": "9232614", "details": {"liCnt": 11}, "date": "2017-08-15", "title": "It looks like our

movement for Irish nationals and calls for a custom border between the two countries.\n\nBritish Prime Minister Theresa May is expected to travel back to Downing Street this week as ministers prepare to flesh out their negotiating position on Brexit.\n\nThe return of the British Prime Minister coincides with the publication this week of a series of new position papers on Brexit - including one on the fraught issue of the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic.\n\nThe Irish Times are reporting this morning that that position paper will include proposals for a customs Border between the North and the South.\n\nCiting London and DUP sources the Irish Times have suggested the paper will call for the creation of a \"light touch\" border between the Republic and Northern Ireland.\n\nThey go on to suggest that Britsh authorities will seek to lessen the impact of the Border by making the Border as \"seamless and frictionless as possible\".\n\nThis, they suggest, is expected to include proposals to have an \"electronic border\" where possible, to have spot checks of vehicles, to avail of number plate recognition technology and to also use CCTV cameras to try to monitor the movement of goods across the Border.\n\nMeanwhile, there will then be a further series of papers in the run up to the European Council in Brussels in October, setting out the Government's vision of Britain's future relations with the EU, including the crucial issue of the post-Brexit customs arrangements.\n\nThe move comes amid complaints from Brussels about a lack of clarity about the British negotiating position.\n\nEU chief negotiator Michel Barnier is reported to have warned his first two rounds of talks with Brexit Secretary David Davis, covering the opening issues of the Irish border, the rights of EU citizens in the UK, and Britain's \"divorce bill\", had made limited progress.\n\nBritish Ministers hope the release of the position papers will convince the EU side that they will be ready to move on to the next phase of the negotiations, including a new free trade deal with the bloc, in the autumn.\n\nMr Davis said: \"I've launched this process because with time of the essence, we need to get on with negotiating the bigger issues around our future partnership to ensure we get a deal that delivers a strong UK and a strong EU.\n\n\"It's what businesses across Europe have called on both sides to do and will demonstrate that the UK is ready for the job.\"", "id": "9059288", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-14", "title": "British expected to offer free movement for

a \"temporary customs union\" with the EU, remaining free to \"negotiate\" new trade deals at the same time.\n\nThe paper was widely welcomed by business groups. \"The commitment from government to explore a customs union for the interim period is a critical first step forward,\" said Josh Hardie, CBI deputy director general. \"This clarity is vital for businesses making long-term investment decisions today.\"\n\nAllie Renison, head of EU and trade policy at the Institute of Directors, said it was a \"hugely positive step\" for the government to lay out its customs objectives.\n\nHowever, other figures were concerned that the government has so far remained silent on financial services.\n\nMiles Celic, chief executive of TheCityUK, said: \"Alongside a transitional customs arrangement, we also want to see urgent agreement by the UK and the EU27 on a broader transitional arrangement which includes services.\"\n\nAnthony Belchambers of the Legatum Financial Services Forum told City A.M.: \"I would hope that [the City] would be treated in a similar way, subject to the same degree of extension.\"\n\nAndrew Hood, a former legal adviser to David Cameron who now works for law firm Dechert, said: \"[The paper] focuses only on trade in goods and the government needs to set out how it aims to provide reassurance on the continued trade in services and how businesses will be able to access the right skills in the years ahead.\"\n\nDexEU has not confirmed precisely when an expected paper on financial services will be published.\n\nMeanwhile, the European Commission yesterday pushed back against parts of the UK's customs proposals, saying that future agreements will be addressed only when \"sufficient progress\" has been made on exit terms.\n\nThe commission also played down the chances of a \"frictionless\" trade agreement, as suggested by Davis, after the UK leaves the customs union.\n\nRead more: There's still all to play for in the Brexit debate", "id":

Britain will have access to the Customs Union, but also the unique privilege of making its own trade deals, which it would not sign and would not be enforced.\n\nFor a \"time-limited period\" the EU and the UK would have a shared external tariff and internal processes mirroring the status quo. In effect, the UK would \"take back control of its borders\" but there would be no borders. \"We acknowledge this is an innovative and untested approach that would take time to develop and implement,\" the white paper reads.\n\nThe opposition's shadow Brexit Secretary, Keir Starmer, said the proposals were \"incoherent and inadequate.\" Other local analysts are less kind.\n\nIdeas and their execution\n\nThe process envisioned will allow the tracking of all goods and components, complete with a repayment mechanism, allowing importers to pay EU or UK tariffs (whichever is higher) and claim a refund when they reach their destination.\n\nTo make this process easier, the UK proposes a mechanism of Authorised Economic Operators (AEOs). That is an accreditation process for import-export businesses that are solvent and have a track record of paying customs fees. That accreditation will allow their cargoes \"fast track\" processing at the border, while most of these traders would do a \"self-assessment\" of how much they owe in customs duties.\n\nAlso, the UK wants to install place recognition technology at ports, which would be linked to customs declarations, allowing cars to move without being manually stopped and checked. Of course, the white paper specifies that the UK is \"willing\" to make the investment required to make border controls seamless only if the EU matches that investment in its own ports.\n\nAssuming good faith\n\nAll that assumes a lot of good faith that may not be there.\n\nThe European Parliament's Brexit negotiator, Guy Verhofstadt, called the idea of \"invisible borders\" outside the customs union a \"fantasy.\"\n\nTo be in & out of the Customs Union & \"invisible borders\" is a fantasy. First need to secure citizens rights & a financial settlement\n\n-- Guy Verhofstadt (@GuyVerhofstadt) August 15, 2017\n\nThe European Commission also recalled on Tuesday that the chief EU negotiator, Michel Barnier, has made clear that frictionless trade is not possible outside the single market and customs union.\"\n\nThe UK does not have a good track record on border controls. This March, OLAF proposed a \u20ac2bn fine as the UK has in recent years emerged as a backdoor for Chinese contraband to the Single Market. At the same time, it is true that the UK is the sixth biggest economy in the world and a major market for many EU products.\n\nNo deal scenario\n\nThe white paper also makes clear that the UK government is also preparing for the \"no deal\" scenario, which means \"standalone customs and excise systems.\" That is meant to be a warning to Brussels that the UK is ready to handle customs and is putting the infrastructure in place.\n\nThat is a political bluff the logistics industry in the UK has already called. Moreover, \"no deal\" assumes that the market can quickly move to fill gaps in the supply chain from Europe.\n\nIn Brussels, this is not going a discussion to be had. The European Commission insists that the two sides must first make progress on EU and UK immigrants rights and the financial settlement before discussing future trade relations.\n\nIrish Border\n\nThe British Irish Chamber of Commerce said it was \"cautious\" about the feasibility of some proposals, the Belfast Telegraph reports. Chambers Ireland chief executive Ian Talbot called the expectation of implementing new customs rules within two years \"wildly optimistic.\"\n\nIt is clear that this trade deal will largely shape how the island's economy operates. But, a hard border now seems inevitable, which is already raising concerns in Ireland.\n\nShare on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Google+ Share on LinkedIn+", "id": "9431973", "details": {},

The new British paper on Brexit and Northern Ireland throws out some ideas for discussion on how the reintroduction of a Border for goods on the island of Ireland could be avoided, or made as \"frictionless\" as possible.\n\nBut there is still no magic solution to the problem that if Britain leaves the EU customs union, some controls become inevitable both at the Border and between Ireland and the UK. London is saying that these could be well nigh invisible, but the European Commission warned in reply that if Britain leaves the customs union and the single market, as it has said it will, then the concept of a frictionless Border \"is not possible.\"\n\nFor Irish businesses this is big deal, but they still have no firm information on which to set their plans and are unlikely to have any for some time to come. One positive is indications that Britain is conscious of Irish companies using the \"landbridge\" via sea and road to get goods to the Continent and is looking at ways to reduce bureaucracy and delays.\n\nBorders control the movement of two things - people and goods. There is reason for optimism that people will still be able to move freely between Ireland and the UK, both to go about their daily business and also, if they choose, to work. The latest British paper proposes the continuation of the Common Travel Area and other associated rights which allow this to happen.\n\nAs much of this predates the EU, there seems no reason why agreement cannot be reached in this area. As well as the social and political links, this is also important economically for Ireland, as the UK has typically been a destination for people who can't find work here.\n\nOne issue which will have to be sorted is how freedom of movement between Ireland and the UK can be squared with new controls. Britain wants to put in place on immigrants coming from other EU countries. Britain will not want to see Ireland used as a \" back door\" for people from other countries to avoid quotas restricting the number of immigrants. This may be achievable via the need for people to register when taking up employment or benefits in the UK, rather than via any Border checks.\n\nThe movement of goods post-Brexit will be a thornier subject. Britain has said it will leave the customs union when it leaves the EU. This would mean controls on goods trade would be needed between Britain and the EU, including on the island of Ireland, the one land border between the UK and the EU.\n\nThe UK paper proposes two possible ways forward. One is for a new customs union agreement between Britain and the EU which could, depending on its terms, reduce or eliminate the need for Border controls. By warning that once Britain leaves the customs union, frictionless trade will be impossible, the EU is setting down a marker that Britain's plan to be both within and outside a customs union at the same time won't fly.\n\nTime will tell on this one. But one really big problem is that Britain wants to strike new trade deals with countries like the US. When this happens, how do you control the flow of these goods between Britain and the EU - including the Irish Border? The paper proposes some ways to do this, but acknowledges it would be complicated. And politically the rest of the EU would feel that signing up to this was, to use the phrase de jour, letting Britain have its cake and eat it too.\n\nIf this is not possible, then Britain proposes a range of measures which could make the Border as \" frictionless\" as possible. This would involve effectively allowing small businesses to operate without many controls, given that most are trading just on the island, with pre-clearance for many bigger treaders reducing bureaucracy and technology used to help track some goods.\n\nOne problem is that this could be a charter for smugglers and illegal trade, back to the days when the Border was in place of moving goods by night on unapproved roads. The European Commission will be conscious to maintain the integrity of its single market and customs union and is unlikely to sign up, unless it is happy that the Border is reasonably sound.\n\nAn option would be to have customs borders in the Irish Sea, rather than on the island, but the paper rules this out. It points out that the North's business sold \u00a310.7 billion of goods to the British market last year and \u00a32.7 billion to the Republic.

During this interim period, which will be negotiated with Brussels, Britain will look to negotiate bold new trade relationships around the world.\"\n\nBusinesses welcomed the proposals, but the Confederation of British Industry also warned the government that \"the clock is ticking and what matters now if giving companies the confidence to continue investing as quickly as possible\".\n\nPrime Minister Theresa May and her government are keen to move the talks with the EU forward to tackle the future relationship rather than focusing only on their divorce, and have promised to publish a series of policy documents this week.\n\nBut after being criticised by some EU officials for being ill-prepared for the first rounds of negotiations, the government's demand to secure trade deals while participating in a temporary customs union may cause further problems.\n\n\"It looks like the new unified position in the cabinet is to return the government to the territory of wanting to have their cake and eat it,\" said Chris Leslie, a pro-EU campaigner and member of Britain's opposition Labour Party.\n\nCountries that are part of the EU's customs union are not allowed to negotiate bilateral trade deals and May's government has said Brexit means Britain must leave the customs union.\n\nBut Turkey, while not an EU member, is part of a separate customs union for industrial goods and can still negotiate bilateral trade deals. It was not clear whether Britain was pursuing a similar arrangement to Turkey.\n\nThe government said that by sorting out the customs arrangements, Britain and the bloc could avoid a \"hard border\" with EU member state Ireland, something which officials fear could reignite tensions between Irish nationalists and unionists.\n\nIt proposed two different ways -- a highly streamlined customs arrangement managed by Britain, or a new customs partnership with the EU, which could \"negate the need for a customs border\".\n\nIts proposals on a future customs arrangement are set out in one of several position papers intended to flesh out the government's Brexit vision and show a united stance over the future relationship after rifts emerged among ministers.\n\nOn Wednesday, the government will set out its solutions for the border between Northern Ireland and Ireland.

The new British paper on Brexit and Northern Ireland throws out some ideas for discussion on how the reintroduction of a Border for goods on the island of Ireland could be avoided, or made as \"frictionless\" as possible.\n\nBut there is still no magic solution to the problem that if Britain leaves the EU customs union, some controls become inevitable both at the Border and between Ireland and the UK. London is saying that these could be well nigh invisible, but the European Commission warned in reply that if Britain leaves the customs union and the single market, as it has said it will, then the concept of a frictionless Border \"is not possible.\"\n\nFor Irish businesses this is big deal, but they still have no firm information on which to set their plans and are unlikely to have any for some time to come. One positive is indications that Britain is conscious of Irish companies using the \"landbridge\" via sea and road to get goods to the Continent and is looking at ways to reduce bureaucracy and delays.\n\nBorders control the movement of two things - people and goods. There is reason for optimism that people will still be able to move freely between Ireland and the UK, both to go about their daily business and also, if they choose, to work. The latest British paper proposes the continuation of the Common Travel Area and other associated rights which allow this to happen.\n\nAs much of this predates the EU, there seems no reason why agreement cannot be reached in this area. As well as the social and political links, this is also important economically for Ireland, as the UK has typically been a destination for people who can't find work here.\n\nOne issue which will have to be sorted is how freedom of movement between Ireland and the UK can be squared with new controls. Britain wants to put in place on immigrants coming from other EU countries. Britain will not want to see Ireland used as a \" back door\" for people from other countries to avoid quotas restricting the number of immigrants. This may be achievable via the need for people to register when taking up employment or benefits in the UK, rather than via any Border checks.\n\nThe movement of goods post-Brexit will be a thornier subject. Britain has said it will leave the customs union when it leaves the EU. This would mean controls on goods trade would be needed between Britain and the EU, including on the island of Ireland, the one land border between the UK and the EU.\n\nThe UK paper proposes two possible ways forward. One is for a new customs union agreement between Britain and the EU which could, depending on its terms, reduce or eliminate the need for Border controls. By warning that once Britain leaves the customs union, frictionless trade will be impossible, the EU is setting down a marker that Britain's plan to be both within and outside a customs union at the same time won't fly.\n\nTime will tell on this one. But one really big problem is that Britain wants to strike new trade deals with countries like the US. When this happens, how do you control the flow of these goods between Britain and the EU - including the Irish Border? The paper proposes some ways to do this, but acknowledges it would be complicated. And politically the rest of the EU would feel that signing up to this was, to use the phrase de jour, letting Britain have its cake and eat it too.\n\nIf this is not possible, then Britain proposes a range of measures which could make the Border as \" frictionless\" as possible. This would involve effectively allowing small businesses to operate without many controls, given that most are trading just on the island, with pre-clearance for many bigger treaders reducing bureaucracy and technology used to help track some goods.\n\nOne problem is that this could be a charter for smugglers and illegal trade, back to the days when the Border was in place of moving goods by night on unapproved roads. The European Commission will be conscious to maintain the integrity of its single market and customs union and is unlikely to sign up, unless it is happy that the Border is reasonably sound.\n\nAn option would be to have customs borders in the Irish Sea, rather than on the island, but the paper rules this out. It points out that the North's business sold \u00a310.7 billion of goods to the British market last year and \u00a32.7 billion to the Republic. Politically and economically a border in the Irish Sea is this a no go for the North's unionists and businesses .\n\nThe real issue here is that there may simply be no way of squaring the circle of Britain leaving the customs union and avoiding some kind of hardish Border on the island. Some 14 months after Brexit, we are still not much the wiser. Dublin will welcome London's objection to a hard Border.

for the post-Brexit border between Ireland and Northern Ireland, which is on the agenda for Mr Davis's next talks in Brussels at the end of this month.\n\nIreland's EU Commissioner Phil Hogan was yesterday quoted criticising the UK for \"conflicting messages\" about Brexit and for having \"a high level of delusion about what is required to be done\" as he claimed British ministers \"still don't realise that the other 27 (member states) have to agree to this transition period of two or three years, or whatever they're going to be seeking\".\n\nMr Hogan, who oversees EU agriculture policy, urged Mrs May to consider staying in the EU customs union to reduce risks both to trade and the Northern Ireland peace deal.\n\nBritain insists it does not want a return to the old \"hard border\" between Ireland and the north.\n\nLabour former shadow chancellor Chris Leslie, a leading supporter of the Open Britain campaign group, said: \"It looks like the new unified position in the Cabinet is to return the Government to the territory of wanting to have their cake and eat it.\n\n\"Ministers claim we can leave the customs union and yet still achieve 'the most frictionless customs agreement anywhere in the world' but with absolutely no detail about how such a miraculous new system will be achieved.\n\n\"It is a fantasy to pretend we can have the freest and most frictionless trade possible with our largest partner when the Government remain intent on pulling Britain out of the customs union.\"\n\nTom Brake, the Liberal Democrats Brexit spokesman, said the Government's \"extreme Brexit will end up leaving Britain poorer\".\n\nHe added: \"Even if they were agreed to by the EU, these proposals will only delay the economic pain caused by leaving the customs union.\n\n\"We still face the prospect of more red tape for businesses, longer queues at our borders and higher prices for consumers once the transition comes to an end.\"", "id": "9176339",

They sell us 290 billion euro. So there are a lot of things there.\"\n\nAsked whether Britain would have to pay to stay in the customs union, he said: \"Well, I don't think ... well, what happens in that sort of interim period you will have to leave me to negotiate, I'm afraid, how we do it, but the aim is to bring to an end these huge \u00a310 billion-a-year payments, bring that to an end now.\n\n\"We are still haggling with them over what we may owe them in the short term but we are going to bring the overall thing to an end.\n\n\"This is something that is in both sides' interest. Now you are right, there will be political pushback and that's what the negotiations will be about.\"\n\nMr Davis said the negotiations were going \"fine\" and he \"wouldn't have taken the job\" if he was not confident of achieving a good deal for Britain.\n\nHe said: \"The simple truth is we want to come out of this better but they (the Europeans) want to come out of it better too.\n\n\"There was a terror early on that we would be the first of many countries breaking off.\n\n\"After the victory of (President) Macron in France, that terror is reduced.\n\n\"They are no longer quite so afraid so the punishment battalion side is now reducing.\"\n\nThe proposals for new customs arrangements to allow trade with the EU are being outlined in the first of a series of \"future partnership papers\" being released by the Government.\n\nOne option being put forward by Mr Davis for new arrangements would see the UK manage a new customs border with administration streamlined to the \"fullest extent possible\".\n\nThe Brexit Secretary will also float plans for a customs partnership with the EU which would negate the need for a customs border between the UK and the rest of the bloc.", "id": "9225315", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-15", "title": "Temporary customs arrangements with EU in both sides' interest - Davis", "image": "http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/business/uk-world/article36033331.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/PANews%20BT_P-d1e0d6f9-3358-43e7-b4ca-0ac5fe4cb6eb_I1.jpg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-15", "concepts": [], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 108, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 140, "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 147, "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Customer Management", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Customer_Management"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 269, "label": "dmoz/Business/International Business and Trade", "uri": "dmoz/Business/International_Business_and_Trade"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 270, "label": "dmoz/Business/International Business and Trade/Services", "uri": "dmoz/Business/International_Business_and_Trade/Services"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 682, "label": "dmoz/Business/Customer Service", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Customer_Service"}], "time": "07:16:00"}

Today, those ministers charged with the delivery of Brexit lurk in a similar limbo, insisting their urgency is undimmed while demanding patience of those who, not unreasonably, would like to know what, precisely, the UK's departure from the EU will mean.\n\nThe Government's new position papers are the latest reports on Britain's negotiating strategy, intended both to manage such expectations of clarity and (less explicitly) to sedate the fractious Conservative Party.\n\nIn their defence, ministers argue that their objectives have become more detailed in the past six months. Theresa May's Lancaster House speech and its accompanying white paper in January have been followed by the parliamentary debate over Article 50, the Repeal Bill, and now a series of documents on specific aspects of the process.\n\nYet the first two such papers -- on customs arrangements after Britain leaves the EU and the Irish border -- do not inspire confidence. They amount to little more than different and more elaborate ways of posing the same old question: how the hell do we do this?\n\nMuch has been made of the fact that the Cabinet is now broadly united behind the proposition that the UK will leave the institutions of the EU at the end of March 2019, that there will be a transitional period thereafter, but that this \"implementation phase\" will be limited to the current Parliament (on the dubious assumption that it lasts until 2022). The joint article in this weekend's Sunday Telegraph by Philip Hammond and Liam Fox was intended to seal this Cabinet ceasefire in advance of the Prime Minister's return to work.\n\nYet this pact reflects a recognition of reality. Painful as it was to those who backed Remain, the referendum result was a vote against freedom of movement and the sovereignty of the European Court of Justice.\n\nWhatever constitutionally nuanced arrangements are theoretically available, there has never been the slightest political chance that Britain would stay in the single market, customs union or other subsidiary parts of the EU. It is no accident that Jeremy Corbyn and John McDonnell have been so clear on this. No modern populist, of the Left or Right, can afford to say otherwise.\n\nThis has two important consequences. First, Britain must be seen to leave the EU, clearly and unambiguously, on March 31, 2019. Second, we must then re-invent the wheel: to enable British business to trade as openly as possible with our former European partners, to facilitate the migration of labour to the UK and to retain the many benefits of pan-European co-operation (notably in law and order, counter-terrorism measures and intelligence sharing).\n\nHence the core contradiction in the first two transition papers. Carbonated by the fizz of radical change ahead, they still seek as much continuity as possible. The proposals for post-Brexit customs, for instance, combine an insistence that present arrangements must end with a tortuous plan to reproduce them.\n\nThe first option proposed is essentially an exercise in damage limitation, euphemistically described as \"highly streamlined... streamlining and simplifying requirements, leaving as few additional requirements on EU trade as possible\". Quite how this would be achieved is opaque, beyond the promise of \"technology-based solutions\" and \"innovative facilitations\". At times, the jargon veers close to the sales patter of a marketing presentation.\n\nThe second proposal is even more baffling, proposing \"innovative approaches that could support UK-EU trade outside of a customs union arrangement, while still removing the need for customs processes at the border\". This would apparently involve \"mirroring the EU's customs approach at its external border\" so as to \"ensure that all goods entering the EU via the UK have paid the correct EU duties\".\n\nConfused? You should be. When the paper acknowledges that \"this is an innovative and untested approach\", one can sense the justified panic of Whitehall officials beneath the surface. The sub-heading \"Providing certainty\" has a desperate quality to it.\n\nNo less enigmatic are today's plans for a new border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland that would involve no physical infrastructure. Welcome as such an arrangement would be, it is hard to imagine how it would be compatible with the UK's new status outside the EU. At the very least it would depend upon a level of technological sophistication that has defeated successive governments.\n\nSome of the objections already raised by our 27 soon-to-be-former partners are part of the great poker game that lies ahead. But not all. It is quite true that the new border between the UK and the EU cannot be both exclusionary and \"frictionless\", any more than we can both fulfil our international financial obligations and tell Europe to \"go whistle\" over the divorce bill.\n\nSuch reservations infuriate Brexiteers, who dismiss them as the cavilling of \"Remoaners\". But the time for such fury is long past. The referendum was won and lost last year, and the Government has now, quite properly, embarked upon the process of departure. But questioning the practicality of its proposals is scarcely treasonable, or even an insult to those who voted Leave. Indeed, it is in the interests of those who believed in Brexit last year to scrutinise its implementation with care.\n\nThe curse of contemporary politics is the urge to insist that complex problems have simple solutions. The Leave campaign presented Britain's departure from the EU as a light-switch moment that would transform its prospects.\n\nYet the reality is not a sudden catharsis but a forest of technicalities from which, at times, it seems we may not emerge. The more ministers say, the clearer it becomes that this is a desperately weak Government, unsure of its own, and the nation's, trajectory.", "id": "9474583", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-16",

But the publication this week of Brexit position papers by the UK government indicate that London is not deviating from its position of a so-called \"hard\" exit, but is maintaining its stance that it would like to cherrypick aspects of its current EU arrangements it likes.\n\nIn recent weeks Varadkar has made his feelings known on a number of Brexit fronts, primarily that the Government does not want an economic border on the island of Ireland. But when he toned the rhetoric down in a speech at Queen's University in Belfast, the Taoiseach anticipated some of the issues that have been confirmed this week.\n\nIf the UK wanted to leave the Customs Union, he argued for a separate \"EU-UK customs union\".\n\nThe Taoiseach also said the UK could rejoin the European Free Trade Association, which gives access to the Single Market, but would most likely mean Britain accepting free movement of people. That is likely to be a non-runner given the emphasis in the Brexit referendum on immigration.\n\nThe customs position paper published Tuesday outlined that the UK wants a customs arrangement of sorts with the EU, the most benign of which for Ireland would not require any customs checks on the Border.\n\nBut it again showed the UK government trying to have it all its own way: maintain the benefits of the Customs Union while also using any transitional period to negotiate, but not finalise, its own free trade deals.\n\nAn arrangement such as the customs union the EU has with Turkey - previously cited by Varadkar - allows for bilateral trade deals to be struck by \"third countries\". But the Turkish experience suggests the UK would face some restrictions if it is to go down that path, which are unlikely to sit well with the buccaneering free-trade vision favoured by many Brexiteers.\n\nThe UK is seemingly clear in what it wants, or else knows that what it is outlining this week is an opening offer that will shift in time. Perhaps Theresa May is attempting to manage the right wing of her party towards a pre-determined destination.\n\nBut, in proposing \"practical solutions\" in his Queen's University speech, Varadkar also acknowledged there is a \"space in which agreements are made\".\n\nThe Irish Government clearly wants the UK to remain in the Customs Union or a similar arrangement at the very least.\n\nThe UK wants the benefits of it too but, as of now, is demanding far too much.\n\nIn October, Varadkar will probably have no choice but to side with the EU27 if it decides insufficient progress has been made for the talks to move on to trade.\n\nBut he could soon find himself in that space he described - the one where deals are made - if Ireland is to prevent a nightmare scenario of a \"no-deal\" Brexit.", "id": "9378992", "details": {"liCnt": 5}, "date": "2017-08-16", "title": "London does not seem to be deviating from position of 'hard' Brexit", "image": "https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3187918.1502827980!/image/image.jpg", "extractedDates": [{"textStart": 313, "date": "2019-03-", "amb": false, "textEnd": 323}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-16", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 5, "id": "76", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "Turkey"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 2, "id": "225", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey", "label": {"eng": "Turkey"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 3, "id": "86522", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": null, "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 4, "id": "112932", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Referendum"}, "id": "303036", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referendum"}, {"label": {"eng": "Immigration"}, "id": "303047", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration"}, {"label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "id": "303064", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union"}, {"label": {"eng": "Trade"}, "id": "303410", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade"}, {"label": {"eng": "European Council"}, "id": "303919", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Council"}, {"label": {"eng": "Government of the United Kingdom"}, "id": "304310", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_the_United_Kingdom"}, {"label": {"eng": "Theresa May"}, "id": "304328", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theresa_May"}, {"label": {"eng": "Head of state"}, "id": "305553", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_of_state"}, {"label": {"eng": "Internal market"}, "id": "305938", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_market"}, {"label": {"eng": "Free trade"}, "id": "307357", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_trade"}, {"label": {"eng": "Michel Barnier"}, "id": "314716", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michel_Barnier"}, {"label": {"eng": "Single market"}, "id": "326525", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_market"}, {"label": {"eng": "Queen's University Belfast"}, "id": "348579", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen's_University_Belfast"}, {"label": {"eng": "Government of Ireland"}, "id": "349185", "score": 1, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Ireland"}, {"label": {"eng": "Taoiseach"}, "id": "361307", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taoiseach"}, {"label": {"eng": "Queen's University"}, "id": "373323", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen's_University"}, {"label": {"eng": "European Free Trade Association"}, "id": "381588", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Free_Trade_Association"}, {"label": {"eng": "Customs union"}, "id": "382637", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customs_union"}, {"label": {"eng": "Leo Varadkar"}, "id": "518475", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo_Varadkar"}, {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom withdrawal from the European Union"}, "id": "1268836", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_withdrawal_from_the_European_Union"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 108, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 140, "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 143, "label": "dmoz/Reference/Education/Colleges and Universities", "uri": "dmoz/Reference/Education/Colleges_and_Universities"}], "time": "00:10:00"}

But it cannot be indefinite - it cannot be a back door to staying in the EU.\"\n\nLabour's Ben Bradshaw MP said: \"Pulling Britain out of the single market and the customs union in 2019 will drive our economy over a cliff edge, putting jobs and family finances at risk.\"\n\nMay is reported to be ready to make a grovelling apology to the Tory faithful at the party's annual conference in October in

The British position paper on future customs arrangements, published yesterday, and today's paper on the Border and the North, cover issues vital to Ireland. The Government in Dublin will welcome the fact that London is finally starting to put some suggestions and options on the table, even if they are still lacking in detail and a way forward is far from clear.\n\nIssues relating to Ireland are one of three topics on which progress is meant to be made before the talks move on to future trade arrangements between the UK and the EU. As such, the weeks ahead will be important for Ireland and the Government will, before an EU summit in October, have to decide whether it feels sufficient progress has been made on the Irish issues.\n\nToday's paper is expected to propose that the ability to move and work freely between Ireland and the UK broadly continues after Brexit. This is important, particularly recognising the deep social and economic links that have built up over many years. It also means free movement of people can continue across the Border.\n\nThere are also other Irish-specific issues to be negotiated, some springing from the Belfast Agreement, which was negotiated in the context of both countries being part of the EU. Nothing is more sensitive, politically, than the future of the Border itself.\n\nThe British paper on new customs arrangements recognises that the reimposition of a Border on the island would be a key consequence if it leaves the EU customs union, the arrangement which allows goods to flow freely. It does suggest that this might be avoided, or at least mitigated, if the UK and the EU agreed a new customs union deal to apply after Brexit, though there are clear difficulties to negotiating such an agreement on the terms suggested by London. In particular, the EU will be highly sceptical of London's attempts to negotiate a customs union while still trying to retain the flexibility of negotiating new deals with third countries.\n\nIf a new customs deal is not possible, Britain says, arrangements can be put in place to make the Border as \" seamless and frictionless\" as possible. It also suggests that other, unspecified steps \"may be necessary.\" However, checks, controls and documentation would still be needed and what the Taoiseach called an \" economic border\" would be in place. The Government has decided not to engage in technical discussions on how this might operate, fearing that doing so would concede that the Border is coming back. With so much still in play, this seems a sensible approach.With huge questions remaining about how Brexit might happen, there is still a lot of talking ahead, and a clear need for the Government to keep the Border question central to this.", "id": "9374718", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-15", "title": "Brexit: Border dilemma must focus minds", "image": "https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3187627.1502814674!/image/image.jpg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-15", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 4, "id": "76", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 4, "id": "86522", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": null, "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 5, "id": "112932", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "Republic of Ireland"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Dublin"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 3, "id": "113087", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dublin", "label": {"eng": "Dublin"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "id": "303064", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union"}, {"label": {"eng": "Trade"}, "id": "303410", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade"}, {"label": {"eng": "Customs"}, "id": "304875", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customs"}, {"label": {"eng": "Internal market"}, "id": "305938", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_market"}, {"label": {"eng": "Eurasian Customs Union"}, "id": "340949", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurasian_Customs_Union"}, {"label": {"eng": "Taoiseach"}, "id": "361307", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taoiseach"}, {"label": {"eng": "Customs union"}, "id": "382637", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customs_union"}, {"label": {"eng": "Good Friday Agreement"}, "id": "389754", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Friday_Agreement"}, {"label": {"eng": "List of European Council meetings"}, "id": "444532", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_European_Council_meetings"}, {"label": {"eng": "European Union Customs Union"}, "id": "470058", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union_Customs_Union"}, {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom withdrawal from the European Union"}, "id": "1268836", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_withdrawal_from_the_European_Union"}, {"label": {"eng": "Freedom of movement for workers in the European Union"}, "id": "1271375", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_movement_for_workers_in_the_European_Union"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 108, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 140, "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 542, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Dogs", "uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Dogs"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 550, "label": "dmoz/Society/Future", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Future"}], "time": "23:26:00"}

idea of a temporary customs union with Europe after Brexit.\n\nThe UK government has put forward the idea to avoid the damage of a \"cliff-edge\" departure before a final deal.\n\nSpeaking at the Pembrokeshire Show, NFU President Meurig Raymond said sheep farmers could suffer most from any return of tariffs.\n\nThe Welsh Government said it was \"disappointed\" a permanent post-Brexit customs union was not explored.\n\nThe UK government's position paper, published on Tuesday, said the UK would want to negotiate its own trade deals during the transition period, something it cannot currently do as a member of the EU customs union.\n\nMr Raymond, who farms in Pembrokeshire, told BBC Wales: \"We're delighted to hear the government will be arguing for a transition period post-March 2019.\n\n\"We cannot afford that cliff-edge departure - it would have a devastating effect on certain sectors, particularly sheep, if we ended up with tariffs on our exports to Europe.\n\n\"Obviously we need to be within the customs union through that transition period as I believe it would take at least two to three years to negotiate a bilateral trade deal with the European Union.\n\n\"We need to have a frictionless trade position where business can carry on as normal, at least in the short term.\"\n\nMr Raymond stressed the need for an agreement across the nations on how the financial aid to farmers promised by the UK government following Brexit would be spent.\n\n\"No farmer must be disadvantaged - whether you're in Wales, England, Scotland or Northern Ireland - because we're going to have to be competing against the rest of the world,\" he said.\n\n\"That money needs to be directed to farming so that it can become more efficient, more competitive, and invest for the future.\"\n\nStephen James, president of NFU Cymru, agreed with the idea of a temporary customs union, for the sake of the whole rural economy.\n\n\"We've got all these businesses that are dependent on farming and agriculture - for every pound of support we have, it delivers \u00a37.40 in the wider economy.\n\n\"That's a good message for all governments, because that keeps an economy going.\"\n\nThe Farmers' Union of Wales (FUW), also represented at the Pembrokeshire Show, renewed its call for an agricultural summit of the various UK governments to agree the rules on how the sector should be run when EU policies no longer apply.\n\nThe UK government proposes an \"innovative and untested approach\" to customs checks once any transition period is over, using measures such as number plate recognition technology for lorries.\n\nHowever, Guy Verhofstadt, the European Parliament's negotiator, dismissed the idea of \"invisible borders\" as a \"fantasy\".\n\nThe Welsh Government said it welcomed \"the recognition that there will need to be an interim or transitional period with as little change as possible in terms of practical customs arrangements\".\n\nBut a spokeswoman added that there had been \"no attempt to seek input\" from devolved administrations.\n\nShe said the Welsh Government was \"disappointed\" that the costs and benefits of establishing an independent trade policy had not been analysed, and that the idea of a new customs union with the EU post-Brexit had not been considered.\n\nPlaid Cymru MP Hywel Williams said the idea of the UK keeping \"the perks of remaining in the EU Customs Union whilst negotiating alternative deals with third countries is at best naive and at worst deluded\".\n\n\"What was meant to be a reassuring step ahead continues to cause more uncertainty for businesses all over the country,\" he added.", "id": "9343334", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-15", "title": "Brexit: Farming union leader backs

He argued that the consequences of a hard Brexit would \"make Black Wednesday look like a picnic\" and is championing the creation of a new centrist party called the Democrats.\n\nHe said it was time for MPs in \"all parties to admit Brexit is a catastrophe, come together in new party if need be, and reverse it\".\n\nThis comes as the anti-EU group Leave.EU is leading calls to deselect two Conservative cabinet ministers, Chancellor Philip Hammond and Home Secretary Amber Rudd, because they sought to \"meddle\" in the Brexit process.\n\nAccording to political historian Anthony Seldon: \"We have to go back 100 years to see a time when the Conservative Party was in such disarray.\"\n\nRemaining hopes that the UK could stay in the single market and the customs union appeared killed off this week when Chancellor Mr Hammond and International Trade Secretary Liam Fox stated the UK would leave both in March 2019.\n\nHowever, Welsh Tories who were on opposite sides of the referendum debate in 2016 denied the party was on the verge of fracturing.\n\nCraig Williams, who as Cardiff North MP was a leading Conservative supporter of continued EU membership, lost his seat in the June election but was adamant he was \"not going anywhere\".\n\nHe predicted the Tories would unify in shared opposition to \"the idea of Jeremy Corbyn as Prime Minister\".\n\nMr Williams said: \"I think even the most hardened of Remainers now realise the biggest danger is not Brexit but the deep, deep left-wing alternatives being presented [in] the form of Jeremy Corbyn's Labour's party.\"\n\nHe expected any new grouping would \"die out swiftly\".\n\nFormer Brexit Minister and Clwyd West Conservative MP David Jones - who was at the forefront of the campaign to quit the EU - played down the chances of people joining the new party envisaged by James Chapman.\n\nHe said: \"I don't honestly think that there's any appetite at all... I worked quite closely with James, very closely indeed, and I really had no inkling that he was as unhappy as he appears to be.\"\n\nMr Jones added: \"What you have to remember is there was a party that actually made remaining in the EU a general election issue, and that was the Lib Dems and the Lib Dems suffered a drubbing at the general election, not least in Wales where of course they were left with no seats at all... I think James may be overlooking the fact that the Lib Dems don't appear to be getting any traction for that policy - 85% of the voters at the last general election voted for parties who were committed to taking Britain out of the EU.\n\n\"I really don't know why he's ploughing this particular furrow but if he wants to do so that's up to him and it's a matter for individual conscience really.\"\n\nAngela Burns, Conservative AM for Carmarthen West and South Pembrokeshire, wanted the UK to stay in the EU in 2016 but said politicians should now \"focus on delivering what the voters have asked for\".\n\nShe said: \"My only comment would be we must be sure that the interests of the nation come before the self-interests of individual politicians with ambition.\"\n\nDescribing the concerns of local voters, she said: \"Truly and honestly, when I go about my business in Carmarthen West and South Pembrokeshire, this doesn't reach voters' lips. They voted for Brexit or they didn't.\n\n\"Those who did want it to be delivered, delivered properly, delivered fairly and delivered to the benefit of Britain. Those who voted against Brexit expect to be delivered fairly for Britain but also for the EU and for the rest of the world...\n\n\"Apart from that, they are concentrating on school standards, the local hospital, jobs for their kids, what's going to happen to their pensions, the price of food in the shops... They've made a decision and they expect people to be sensible and grown up and mature and get on and sort it out on their behalf.\"\n\nMontgomeryshire Conservative MP Glyn Davies, who supports leaving the single market and the customs union, did not expect a new party to win support.\n\nHe said: \"There's clearly a division of opinion in all political parties at the moment and you always get this sort of talk... Any politician is foolish to discount any possible occurrence but I can say honestly I just cannot see any such occurrence happening.\"\n\nArguing that the UK must leave the single market and customs union to achieve true Brexit, he said: \"I know that those who don't want Britain to leave the European Union are still hoping that we might stay within the single market and the customs union but [that] means you have effectively not left the European Union and I just don't think that's going to happen.\"\n\nMr Davies was unimpressed by the argument that some Conservatives will feel they have more in common on this issue with moderate Labour politicians.\n\nHe said: \"If you go back through history you'll always find people in one political party have got very close colleagues in another political party. I'e seen it myself... I don't think that's anything new or anything unusual.\"\n\nSetting out his own approach, he said: \"You can try to make a headline or you can try to make a difference in politics and I always preferred the latter course.\"", "id": "9162855", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-14", "title": "Welsh Conservatives refuse to accept the Tories will split", "image":

On Aug. 15, the British government published a strategy paper on Brexit in preparation for a new round of negotiations with the European Union scheduled to begin Aug. 28. It proposes establishing a temporary customs union between the United Kingdom and the European Union during the Brexit transition period beginning in March 2019, confirming London's desire to buy more time to negotiate a permanent settlement.\n\nThe document is the first in a new series of position papers to be published in the run-up to October, when the British Parliament and the European Council will publish two separate assessments on how much progress has been made toward resolving three major Brexit issues: the Brexit bill, citizens' rights, and the Irish border. According to the proposal, the United Kingdom would be able to negotiate new trade deals while remaining in a temporary customs union with the European Union. The new deals, however, would only be implemented after the United Kingdom has left the interim stage and Brexit has been fully enacted.\n\nAccording to the British paper, the United Kingdom and European Union would then establish a customs partnership with no internal customs border. The United Kingdom would also be required to mirror EU tariffs on imported goods whose final destination is in the European Union. The alternative option would be a highly streamlined arrangement, under which the United Kingdom would impose the same conditions as the European Union on international customs and collect customs duties on its behalf. This second option would require a customs border -- including one between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland -- which would utilize technology to minimize the need for physical checks.\n\nThe European Union replied to the paper on the same day of its release, saying the issue concerns bilateral relations and cannot be addressed before sufficient progress has been made in negotiating the details of Brexit. The United Kingdom, for its part, insists that its withdrawal from the European Union and its future relationship to it are inextricably linked. British Brexit Secretary David Davis said on Aug. 15 that the United Kingdom will not commit to a number for the Brexit bill before the European Council meets in October. However, chief Brexit negotiator for the European Union Michel Barnier responded to the British paper by saying that the sooner withdrawal negotiations are successful, the sooner discussion of a future relationship -- including a customs arrangement -- can begin.\n\nThe plan outlined by the British paper is expected to be met with resistance within the European Union. Europeans have already made it clear that the United Kingdom will not be able to negotiate trade deals while it's in a customs union. On Aug. 15, a spokesman from the European Commission reiterated Barnier's statement, saying that frictionless trade is not possible outside the single market and customs union.

Ministers said the plans would mean the \"freest and most frictionless possible trade\" with the rest of Europe. This could include a \"temporary customs union\" after Brexit to prevent border problems as the UK leaves the EU. Businesses have called for clarity since the UK said it was leaving the customs union - the EU's tariff-free trading area - as part of Brexit. The customs union document is the first of a series of papers to be published by the UK government on key negotiation issues. On Wednesday it is expected to set out proposals for the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.\n\nSource: BBC News\n\nBeaufort Securities Share Facebook Twitter Google+ LinkedIn Email Print Download PDF version", "id": "9231483", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-15", "title": "Beaufort Securities Breakfast Alert", "image": "http://www.proactiveinvestors.co.uk/thumbs/upload/ColumnSource/Logo/2015_05/757x468_Beaufort-130.jpg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-15", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 4, "id": "76", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Northern Ireland"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 1, "id": "85555", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland", "label": {"eng": "Northern Ireland"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "New York"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 3, "id": "218051", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York", "label": {"eng": "New York"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "NASDAQ"}, "id": "303007", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASDAQ"}, {"location": null, "score": 5, "id": "303048", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "id": "303064", "score": 4, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union"}, {"label": {"eng": "Standard & Poor's"}, "id": "303348", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_&_Poor's"}, {"label": {"eng": "Trade"}, "id": "303410", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade"}, {"location": null, "score": 3, "id": "303540", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia", "label": {"eng": "Asia"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Government of the United Kingdom"}, "id": "304310", "score": 1, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_the_United_Kingdom"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nikkei 225"}, "id": "304663", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikkei_225"}, {"label": {"eng": "Brent Crude"}, "id": "304665", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brent_Crude"}, {"label": {"eng": "DAX"}, "id": "304666", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DAX"}, {"label": {"eng": "Customs"}, "id": "304875", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customs"}, {"label": {"eng": "Border"}, "id": "308560", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Border"}, {"label": {"eng": "Telerate"}, "id": "309266", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dow_Jones_&_Company"}, {"label": {"eng": "Tariff"}, "id": "309353", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tariff"}, {"label": {"eng": "West Texas Intermediate"}, "id": "310654", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Texas_Intermediate"}, {"location": null, "score": 3, "id": "315104", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continental_Europe", "label": {"eng": "Continental Europe"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Customs union"}, "id": "382637", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customs_union"}, {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom withdrawal from the European Union"}, "id": "1268836", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_withdrawal_from_the_European_Union"}, {"label": {"eng": "Session Manager Subsystem"}, "id": "1276340", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Session_Manager_Subsystem"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 108, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 140, "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 143, "label": "dmoz/Reference/Education/Colleges and Universities", "uri": "dmoz/Reference/Education/Colleges_and_Universities"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 887, "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Labor Movement", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Labor_Movement"}], "time": "07:59:00"}

Goods - from wood chips to cars - come in to the country, while items made in the UK go out.\n\nAs long as the transfer of these goods is between the UK and another EU country, no one really blinks an eye.\n\nAnd that's all because Britain is a member of the customs union - a set of bloc agreements which removes tariffs (i.e. a financial charge) between the 28 EU countries and lifts the need for import and export checks, making business cheaper and faster.\n\nBut, in just over 18 months' time, the country will no longer be part of the EU or its customs union and businesses could face more paperwork and costly delays to sell to, or buy from, Europe.\n\nThe Government yesterday published a paper looking at how a future customs arrangement with the EU could work after March 2019.\n\nIn it, it conceded that the UK would have to prepare for a cliff-edge whereby, overnight, British firms would have to start declaring everything they export to the likes of France and even, in some cases, apply for export licences.\n\nThe same would go for countries looking to sell to the UK, making imports more cumbersome.\n\nThat could create huge issues in North East Lincolnshire, home to the Port of Immingham - the busiest port in the UK by tonnage - and Grimsby Docks, a major port for the car industry.\n\nTraders using the ports are not going to be happy if they face new import tariffs or lengthy waiting times for checks to be carried out.\n\nOfficials and ministers were clear yesterday that they are trying to avoid such a situation, and have proposed two options it would ideally like to see in place after Brexit.\n\nThe first - dubbed the \"highly streamlined customs arrangement\" - would look to \"waiver\" entry and exit declarations, see Britain sign-up to the Commons Transit Convention so goods travelling through Europe don't have to stop for checks at every border, while also allowing for companies to self-declare their goods before entering the country, meaning less need for physical checks.\n\nThe second is a new customs partnership with the EU, which is more complicated as it would require new technology and would be dealing with different pricing structures for import and export tariffs.\n\nIt is also an \"untested approach\", with the Government saying it would require further discussion with those in the industry.\n\nIn the meantime, the Government has officially proposed an \"interim\" period after Brexit, a period of perhaps two years according to Brexit Secretary David Davis, whereby the current EU customs rules will still apply to Britain while both UK and EU-based companies adjust.\n\nThe caveat is that Britain wants to be able to negotiate new trade deals with countries outside the EU - something the customs union forbids - during that interim period.\n\nThe CBI called the proposal of an interim period a \"critical first step forward\" in the EU trade negotiations.\n\nAssociated British Ports, which runs the ports at Grimsby and Immingham, and the Hull and Humber Chamber of Commerce said they would be keeping a \"watching brief\" on how talks progressed over a future customs arrangement.\n\nA spokeswoman for ABP said the company \"welcomed\" the Government's paper and said it would be working to ensure businesses had \"efficient and reliable access\" to the Continent.\n\n\"We are committed to working with our customers and the Government to make sure trade can flow as smoothly as possible following the UK's exit from the Single Market and Customs Union,\" said the spokeswoman.\n\n\"Underpinned by our ongoing commitment to invest in new infrastructure and facilities, ABP's Humber ports will continue to provide British businesses with efficient and reliable access to European markets.\"\n\nDavid Hooper, external affairs manager at the chamber of commerce, said the paper would be discussed by its members and boards in the coming weeks.\n\n\"We are keeping a watching brief on developments and things will be discussed at length at our shipping and transport committee and by our five area councils,\" said Mr Hooper.\n\n\"The chamber will take its lead from our member businesses, so it is probably too early to take a view on which option is best.\n\n\"David Davis has unveiled the Government's preferred option but obviously that has to be agreed by the remaining EU members, so we will watch developments accordingly.\n\n\"We import a lot from Europe as well as export, so it is in nobody's interest to make things more difficult than they need to be.\"\n\nThe reason the Government has decided to publish details on the kind of future customs arrangement it would like to see is because it freely admits that the negotiations are not going as well as they would like.\n\nOne well-connected Whitehall official, speaking on an anonymous basis, told the Telegraph that the \"early experience of negotiations hasn't been as effective as it might otherwise have been\" had they a vision of the future UK-EU relationship to share.\n\nThese proposals, the Department for Exiting the European Union (Dexu) hopes, will help move things forward at a sharper pace.\n\nThat has not stopped EU officials from criticising the ministerial suggestions.\n\nGuy Verhofstadt, the European Parliament's chief Brexit negotiator, tweeted: \"To be in and out of the Customs Union and invisible borders is a fantasy\".\n\nThere have been critics closer to home as well. Grimsby MP Melanie Onn said she found Mr Davis' suggestions \"far from ideal\" and feared it could put the region's seafood industry, which employs 5,500 people, \"needlessly at risk\".\n\nAny import delays could harm the quality of the seafood, while new security measures - such as new number-plate recognition software being mooted by HMRC - at Humber ports could prove costly.\n\nMs Onn said: \"Grimsby, Immingham, and Hull ports are major employers here, and I'm worried that [what] the Government admit is their ideal outcome, before they've even started negotiating, would result in increased administration.\n\n\"This could cause delays and ultimately trade moving away from our shores, unless it was accompanied by major investment in our ports.\n\n\"It may not make a huge difference to the motor industry if it takes a couple of days extra to make it through border checks - no one checks the expiry date on a Nissan before they buy one.\n\n\"But senior voices in the seafood industry have been clear that border checks on their imports and exports must remain as simple, quick, and cheap as they are currently if these jobs are to be maintained.\n\n\"The Government shouldn't put our biggest local industry needlessly at risk.\"\n\nCleethorpes MP Martin Vickers, whose constituency is home to Immingham port, said any changes to security operations at Immingham could see \"support from the Government\" being called for locally.\n\nThe Conservative backbencher said a recent meeting with DExU minister Steve Baker and his officials demonstrated they were aware of the \"importance of assuring that documentation is kept to a minimum\" under any new regulations.\n\nAddressing the critics, Mr Vickers said there was bound to be some tit-for-tat between UK and EU figures while negotiations were on-going.\n\n\"On all the issues, whatever the UK says, the European Commission will say, 'That's not quite what we were looking for'.\n\n\"This is a negotiation. They are going to be cautious and push things off as not being up to standard,\" said Mr Vickers.\n\n\"What emerges from the negotiations will be what is in the best interests of all sides.\"", "id":

"eng-3358827", "body": "The Government will propose a new UK-EU customs union as an interim measure to avoid a \"cliff-edge\" for manufacturers after Britain leaves the bloc.\n\nThe proposal is contained in the Government's first \"future partnership paper\", published on Tuesday by the Department for Exiting the European Union (DExEU).\n\nThe outline of post-Brexit customs arrangements is designed to keep all members of the Cabinet onside.\n\nWhile confirming the UK's exit from the EU's customs union after Brexit, the paper proposes a \"temporary customs union between the UK and the EU\" as a \"possible approach\" to getting a \"smooth and orderly\" transfer to a post-Brexit customs regime.\n\nAt the moment, all goods and parts travel across the EU free of both tariffs and checks as part of the bloc's customs union.\n\nAfter the Brexit vote there has been an ongoing debate within Cabinet about whether to stay in the system.\n\nRemaining in the EU's customs union would restrict Britain's ability to sign independent trade deals with non-EU countries, with a common external tariff applied outside the zone.\n\nTurkey already has its own customs union with the EU for industrialised goods, which enables participation in complex manufacturing supply chains.\n\nSpeaking to Sky News last month, International Trade Secretary Liam Fox said there was a difference between \"the\" customs union and \"a\" customs union, but cautioned against using Turkey as a model.\n\nDExEU says the interim customs arrangements will be \"time-limited\" to allow for businesses to adapt to a post-Brexit system.\n\nNo actual timeframe has been mentioned, although some Cabinet ministers have suggested it will have to expire before the next scheduled general election in 2022.\n\nThere has been much criticism of the Government's own preparedness to introduce the sorts of customs systems and checks required by its policy to leave the EU's customs union by 2019.\n\nThe National Audit Office was hugely critical of HMRC in a recent report.\n\nThe EU will have to agree to any interim arrangement and especially to the establishment of a temporary customs union.\n\nCritics of the Government's Brexit strategy accused ministers of chasing a \"fantasy\" following the release of the paper.\n\nLabour MP Chris Leslie, a leading supporter of the Open Britain group, said: \"It looks like the new unified position in the Cabinet is to return the Government to the territory of wanting to have their cake and eat it.\n\n\"Ministers claim we can leave the customs union and yet still achieve 'the most frictionless customs agreement anywhere in the world' but with absolutely no detail about how such a miraculous new system will be achieved.\n\n\"It is a fantasy to pretend we can have the freest and most frictionless trade possible with our largest partner when the Government remains intent on pulling Britain out of the customs union.\n\n\"This is wishful thinking of the highest order.\n\n\"The only way to retain genuinely free trade with Europe, and protect the millions of jobs created by it, is to remain a member of the customs union.\"\n\nIt is not clear whether the EU will respond to the paper, having agreed with the UK to first deal with issues of the so-called Brexit bill, Ireland and citizens' rights during negotiations before moving on to the future EU-UK relationship.\n\nOutlining a position on customs arrangements does, however, help bring some clarity to the position of the border with Ireland.\n\nA further Government paper on the issue of Ireland's border will be published on Wednesday.", "id": "9162318", "details": {"liCnt": 22, "gpCnt": 4}, "date": "2017-08-14", "title": "Brexit: Govt chases interim EU-UK customs union", "image":

"body": "It's understood the Prime Minister is expected back in 10 Downing Street on Thursday\n\nGet politics updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email\n\nTheresa May is still enjoying her summer break despite widespread reports she was getting back to work today.\n\nIt's understood the Prime Minister is expected back in 10 Downing Street this Thursday.\n\nBy the time she returns it'll be three weeks and three days in total since she set off for her first of two summer holidays.\n\nShe returned from a five-day break in northern Italy for an official event marking the centenary of the outbreak of the Battle of Passchendaele on July 31.\n\nShe then set off again for a two-week holiday walking with her husband Philip in the Swiss Alps.\n\nMultiple previous reports had said Mrs May would be back to work on Monday 14 August.\n\nBut it appears August 14 was confused with the \"week of\" August 14 in a to-and-fro between reporters and Downing Street last month.\n\nThe Tory leader will be plunged into the deep end when she does return as the government attempts to show its hand on Brexit .\n\nAt least two 'position papers' spelling out the government's view on thorny issues of customs and the Northern Ireland border will be published this week.\n\nOnly one - the Northern Ireland paper - will actually be used in the next round of negotiations with the EU at the end of this month.\n\nThe other, on the customs union, is expected to be a \"future position\" paper - meaning it won't be discussed straight away.\n\nEU chiefs have warned the \"clock is ticking\" but have been unwilling to discuss Britain's future trade with the EU until key parts of Brexit itself are settled, including a multi-billion pound 'divorce bill'.\n\nAsked why future position papers are being published now, a Downing Street spokesman said: \"The talks which have taken place so far have shown that many of the withdrawal questions can only be settled with the future relationship in mind.\"\n\nMrs May will fly home to face Tory chaos after a senior MP threatened to quit the party over Brexit.\n\nFormer Business Minister Anna Soubry said she would put \"country before party\" and quit the Tories for a new pro-EU group if Mrs May does not soften her stance on Brexit.\n\nIn an attempt to show Cabinet unity, Remain-backing Chancellor Philip Hammond and Brexiteer Liam Fox published a joint article agreeing key red lines.\n\nThey said Britain will need a \"time-limited interim period\" to implement Brexit \"but it cannot be indefinite, it cannot be a back door to staying in the EU.\"\n\nBut behind the public calm anonymous MPs claimed the PM should sack pro-Remain ministers in a mini Cabinet reshuffle.\n\nIt also emerged arch-Brexiteer toff Jacob Rees-Mogg is mulling a possible run for the party leadership if Mrs May is forced out or quits.\n\nMeanwhile Jeremy Corbyn has kicked off a three-week tour of the country after returning from his summer break in Croatia.\n\nThe Labour leader is due to address a rally in Milton Keynes this afternoon after drawing a crowd of more than 1,000 last week in Cornwall.", "id": "9069535", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-14", "title": "Everyone thought Theresa May was back to work but she's still on holiday", "image":

There is a world out there waiting for us, and we need to get on with embracing it.\"\n\nThe fresh row shatters a delicate truce brokered by No10 between Mr Hammond and Mr Fox last weekend.\n\nThe formal customs plans paper published today gave no mention of any transition time frame.\n\nOther hardline Brexit campaigners also attacked the transition plan today.\n\nFormer UKIP boss Nigel Farage accused the government of surrender, saying: \"Today is a big victory for the European Commission. The government has shown great weakness.\n\n\"On the current timetabling, President Trump will be near end of his second term before we could enact a US trade deal.\n\nThe government also proposed two options for a longterm customs deal with the EU after the transition, a major streamlining of new border processes and a new customs-free arrangement to keep trade as free as possible.\n\nChancellor Philip Hammond today dubbed the two longterm proposals as \"ambitious, and rightly so\".\n\nBut pro-EU critics of the plan attacked it for ladelling red tape on businesses after the Brexit ministry admitted they would see \"an increase in administration\".\n\nConsultants Ernst and Young also warned a new customs arrangement would be a major tech challenge for the civil service to deliver, saying that \"anything shorter than a four year delivery window could pose major risks\".\n\nEurope's politicians also criticised the government's plans for being unrealistic.\n\nIreland's foreign minister Simon Coveney said more detailed thinking from the government was \"welcome\", but branded Britain's bid for a temporary customs deal while negotiating new trade deals at the same time as \"difficult\".\n\nThe European Parliament's chief negotiator, arch federalist Guy Verhofstadt, dubbed the proposals for invisible borders as \"fantasy\".\n\nBut in the proposals, ministers also warned Europe's leaders that failing to give Britain a good customs deal would mean a mountain of new red tape and tax for their own businesses.\n\nIt also confirmed that the government has begun preparations for a worst case 'no deal' scenario on trade borders which would see thousands of companies across Europe forced to join a new registration system before they are allowed to import goods into the UK, submitting a mountain of declarations about them, and paying VAT on them as well.", "id": "9362822", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-15", "title": "Cabinet row erupts as Liam Fox and

welcomed the idea of a temporary customs union with Europe after Brexit.\n\nThe UK government has put forward the idea to avoid the damage of a \"cliff-edge\" departure before a final deal.\n\nSpeaking at the Pembrokeshire Show, NFU President Meurig Raymond said sheep farmers could suffer most from any return of tariffs.\n\nThe Welsh Government said it was \"disappointed\" a permanent post-Brexit customs union was not explored.\n\nThe UK government's position paper, published on Tuesday, said the UK would want to negotiate its own trade deals during the transition period, something it cannot currently do as a member of the EU customs union.\n\nMr Raymond, who farms in Pembrokeshire, told BBC Wales: \"We're delighted to hear the government will be arguing for a transition period post-March 2019.\n\n\"We cannot afford that cliff-edge departure - it would have a devastating effect on certain sectors, particularly sheep, if we ended up with tariffs on our exports to Europe.\n\n\"Obviously we need to be within the customs union through that transition period as I believe it would take at least two to three years to negotiate a bilateral trade deal with the European Union.\n\n\"We need to have a frictionless trade position where business can carry on as normal, at least in the short term.\"\n\nMr Raymond stressed the need for an agreement across the nations on how the financial aid to farmers promised by the UK government following Brexit would be spent.\n\n\"No farmer must be disadvantaged - whether you're in Wales, England, Scotland or Northern Ireland - because we're going to have to be competing against the rest of the world,\" he said.\n\n\"That money needs to be directed to farming so that it can become more efficient, more competitive, and invest for the future.\"\n\nStephen James, president of NFU Cymru, agreed with the idea of a temporary customs union, for the sake of the whole rural economy.\n\n\"We've got all these businesses that are dependent on farming and agriculture - for every pound of support we have, it delivers \u00a37.40 in the wider economy.\n\n\"That's a good message for all governments, because that keeps an economy going.\"\n\nThe UK government proposes an \"innovative and untested approach\" to customs checks once any transition period is over, using measures such as number plate recognition technology for lorries.\n\nHowever, Guy Verhofstadt, the European Parliament's negotiator, dismissed the idea of \"invisible borders\" as a \"fantasy\".\n\nThe Welsh Government said it welcomed \"the recognition that there will need to be an interim or transitional period with as little change as possible in terms of practical customs arrangements\".\n\nBut a spokeswoman added that there had been \"no attempt to seek input\" from devolved administrations.\n\nShe said the Welsh Government was \"disappointed\" that the costs and benefits of establishing an independent trade policy had not been analysed, and that the idea of a new customs union with the EU post-Brexit had not been considered.\n\nThe Farmers' Union of Wales (FUW), also represented at the Pembrokeshire Show, renewed its call for an agricultural summit of the various UK governments to agree the rules on how the sector should be run when EU policies no longer apply.", "id": "9301287", "details": {"liCnt": 16}, "date":

But with many firms requiring several months or a year's lead time to make recruitment, investment and operational decisions for the financial year 2019-2020, the high-ranking business leader said the situation is \"genuinely urgent.\"\n\n\"It's not time to panic, but it is time for everyone to realize that the effects of Brexit are starting to show and it's reasonable to assume those effects will get greater,\" the senior business figure said.\n\n\"Phasing [of the Brexit talks] makes the timing difficult. Some in Brussels feel a transition deal is not possible until the future relationship element of the talks. We are going to be having conversations in Brussels encouraging a sensible approach to phasing.\"\n\nThere are particular concerns for small- and medium-sized businesses that may not have the capacity to conduct detailed contingency planning for a cliff-edge Brexit.\n\nThe plan for a lobbying push in Brussels by British businesses will be music to the ears of the U.K.'s Brexit negotiating team, which this week is publishing position papers laying out the government's stance on future customs arrangements with the EU and the Northern Irish border. They have been forced to accept the EU's phased approach to the talks but maintain that future relationship issues such as the nature of transitional arrangements with the bloc are inextricably linked to the exit terms and should be discussed in parallel.\n\n\"We have been clear that we believe an implementation period is in the interests of both the U.K. and the EU, providing certainty to businesses and citizens, and ensuring we avoid any cliff-edge as we move to our future partnership,\" a U.K. government spokesperson said. \"It would be mutually beneficial for both parties if we agree this principle early in the process.\"\n\nBut time is running out.\n\nContingency planning for a cliff-edge Brexit, in which the U.K. crashes out of the EU without a transitional deal, is already taking place at many U.K. firms, particularly in the financial services sector. Regulatory experts in banks say that those plans would be hard to reverse.\n\nBank of England Governor Mark Carney said earlier this month that banks and insurance companies under his supervision required about 18 months to prepare for any transition period -- more than the time left available for the Brexit talks once ratification of the deal is factored in. And Financial Conduct Authority Chief Executive Andrew Bailey said a transition deal would need to be decided by the end of this year.\n\nA survey of 357 firms in July conducted by the Confederation of British Industry (CBI), a lobby group for 190,000 British businesses, found that 40 percent said Brexit already is affecting investment decisions, with 98 percent of this group saying the effect was negative.\n\nMiles Celic, chief executive officer of TheCityUK lobbying group, said many companies already were making spending decisions and activating contingency plans. Early clarity on the shape of a transitional deal would \"decelerate\" those plans and help keep business in the U.K \"and, indeed, within Europe,\" he said.\n\n\"Different companies have different requirements, but our industry wants confirmation that there will be a time-bound and legally-binding transitional period by the end of this year at the very latest,\" Celic added.\n\nAllie Renison, head of EU and trade policy at the Institute of Directors, an organization representing senior business leaders, said she hoped government would prioritize reaching a deal on transition \"by the end of the first quarter [January to March]\" of 2018 to provide businesses with clarity to plan ahead.\n\nAt the very latest, \"many businesses will need to know by summer 2018 ... whether it is necessary to put in place big changes to operations, should trade arrangements change significantly when we leave the EU in 2019,\" Renison said.\n\nThe CBI is calling for a post-Brexit transition period in which the U.K. remains in the single market and a customs union until a final deal on future trade comes into force. It wants a deal to be agreed, \"as soon as possible, that gives firms today the confidence to continue investing and creates time to get the final deal details right. This period should be as short as practically possible and could be in the realm of two to three years,\" said Josh Hardie, the organization's deputy director general.\n\nThere are particular concerns for small- and medium-sized businesses that may not have the capacity to conduct detailed contingency planning for a cliff-edge Brexit, the senior business figure said. Even businesses that do not export to the EU or employ EU citizens risk being hit as a result of spending decisions made by larger U.K. clients or changes in supply chains.\n\nMike Cherry, chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses, said his group's research showed small business confidence is now falling.\n\n\"There is now real concern about decisions on investment shifting from 'pause' to 'stop' as larger companies look to enact their contingency plans for Brexit,\" he said. \"This would have huge implications for smaller businesses in their supply chains.\"\n\nAttention is now fixed on October's European Council summit, where EU27 leaders will rule on whether \"sufficient progress\" has been made in the Brexit talks to allow them to move on to the next phase.\n\nWhile many businesses would prefer talks on transitional arrangements to begin immediately, a failure to reach the next phase in October would prompt serious anxiety, particularly among trading businesses, said Adam Marshall, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce. \"Many would be concerned,\" he said, if talks between the U.K. and the EU on the post-Brexit transition period were postponed beyond the fall.", "id": "9193786", "details": {"liCnt": 49}, "date": "2017-08-15", "title": "British business to lobby Brussels on Brexit transition deal", "image":

such as soap or slate - have no tariffs.\n\nThe UK's departure from the EU's customs union was confirmed at the weekend in a joint article by Chancellor Philip Hammond and Trade Secretary Liam Fox.\n\nAccording to the newly-published government paper, the UK could ask Brussels to establish a \"temporary customs union\" after it leaves the EU in March 2019.\n\nBut during this period, it would also expect to be able to negotiate its own international trade deals - something it cannot do as an EU customs union member.\n\nOnce this period expires, the UK will look to agree either a \"highly streamlined\" border with the EU, or a new \"partnership\" with no customs border at all.\n\nThe government said the interim arrangements would mean businesses would only have to adjust once to the new arrangements.\n\nAll of this will have to be negotiated with the EU -

While both sides want to avoid obstacles to trade, Britain's desire to leave the EU's customs union makes that tough.\n\nIrish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar has warned that he won't help the U.K. set up border checks and ordered officials to scale back examining technological solutions to minimize disruption along the frontier. The U.K. will propose remaining a member of the Common Transit Convention to facilitate the movement of goods and new \"trusted trader\" arrangements that would ease commerce for larger companies. Smaller firms, accounting for more than 80 percent of cross-border trade, would be exempt from customs processes.\n\nMeanwhile, Germany's election campaign is touching on Brexit.

Guy Verhofstadt, the European Parliament's point person on Brexit, was less diplomatic. \"To be in & out of the Customs Union & 'invisible borders' is a fantasy,\" he tweeted.\n\nRed Tape Warning | In making two suggestions for how post-Brexit customs will work, the U.K acknowledged both would likely inflict red tape on businesses. That will come as a surprise to many who backed Brexit hopeful that leaving the EU would rid them of paperwork.\n\nPolitical Angst | \"Anglo-Saxon political angst\" is spurring a shift in investment from U.S. and British equities to Europe, according to a survey of fund managers by Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Money managers of $587 billion polled from Aug. 4 to 10 cut allocations to the two nations to a post-financial crisis low, while boosting positions in European shares.\n\nNew Party? | James Chapman, a former chief of staff to Brexit Secretary David Davis, plans to launch a new political party to reverse Brexit. His critiques of May's team -- including his former boss -- have raised plenty of eyebrows in Westminster. This morning's was against Trade Secretary Liam Fox. Separately, former Deputy PM Nick Clegg is to publish a book on how to avoid Brexit.\n\nOn the Markets | A divergence in political outlooks between Britain and France is evident in the stock prices of the largest construction companies, according to Bloomberg Gadfly's Lionel Laurent. Shares of Eiffage and Vinci are outperforming Balfour Beatty and Kier Group.\n\nBritish commuters may soon start paying a price for Brexit. Those who travel by rail to work have their fares reset each January depending on how far the retail prices index rose in July.

the plan, International Trade Secretary Liam Fox will be free to start drawing up deals with countries, such as the US, immediately after Brexit on March 30, 2019.\n\nBut to keep EU trade free of barriers during the transition period, a key demand from Chancellor Philip Hammond, they will not be able to come into force while the temporary union lasts.\n\nWhile the plan pleased business leaders

Our plan is to stand up for businesses and jobs and for the economy.\"\n\nHe said \"nobody could give a definitive answer\" on whether the UK will leave the customs union after March 2019 \"as it's subject to negotiation\".\n\nThe government has proposed a \"customs partnership\", which would see the UK \"mirror\" EU tariffs on goods coming into Britain, involves an increase of red tape for businesses.\n\nCompanies selling goods into Britain would have to pay which ever tariff is higher out of the UK and EU rate, and then claim any money back they are owed at a later date.\n\nBut the plans, set out by Brexit secretary David Davis, were rubbished by Labour MP and former shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna, who is now co-chair of a cross-party Parliamentary group on EU Relations.\n\nHe said: \"As the Brexit negotiations go forward, it is crucial that Ministers take positions based on realism rather than wishful thinking.\n\n\"Unfortunately, such realism is thin on the ground in this position paper.\n\n\"They might promise frictionless trade, but they are offering a red tape bombshell for British business.\"", "id": "9322395", "details": {}, "date":

The answer to the second is, 'No'. But I would be betraying my principles if I did not make it clear that country must always come before party.\"\n\nScottish Tory leader Ruth Davidson was also reported to be backing the move to replace May with Rudd.\n\nBut a spokesman for Davidson said the claims were \"rubbish\", adding: \"Ruth backs the PM.\"\n\nHammond joined forces with Brexiteer Liam Fox to declare that a transition deal to leave the EU would not become a \"back door\" to remaining in Europe.\n\nAfter a summer of cabinet feuding, Hammond, who favours a \"softer\" pro-business Brexit, and Fox, a hardline Brexiteer, said they agreed there should not be a \"cliff-edge\" break when Britain leaves the EU in March 2019.\n\nIn a joint article for a Sunday newspaper, they said Brexit would mean pulling out of the EU single market and the customs union.\n\nThey wrote: \"Businesses need to have confidence that there will not be a cliff-edge when we leave the EU.\n\n\"That is why we believe a time-limited interim period will be important to further our national interest and give business greater certainty. But it cannot be indefinite - it cannot be a back door to staying in the EU.\"\n\nMay is reported to be ready to make a grovelling apology to the Tory faithful at the party's annual conference in October in an attempt to stave off any coup attempt against her.\n\nMeanwhile Tory backbencher and Old Etonian Jacob Rees-Mogg was unveiled as the latest hard-line Brexiteer to be willing to throw his hat in the ring for the party leadership.\n\nLabour's Ben Bradshaw MP said: \"Pulling Britain out of the single market and the customs union in 2019 will drive our economy over a cliff edge, putting jobs and family finances at risk.\"\n\nRees-Mogg is canvassing support among Tory MPs while denying he has leadership ambitions.\n\nRead More Top stories", "id": "9044588", "details": {}, "date":

Perhaps chastened by pre-holiday criticism from Brussels that its approach has been sluggish and opaque, May's government will on Tuesday publish the latest in a string of position papers aimed at fleshing at its ambitions for future relations with the European Union.\n\nToday's topic? Customs arrangements. The paper will state an intention to seek a \"close association\" with the EU's tariff-free, bureaucracy-light customs union for an \"interim\" period after the U.K. leaves the bloc in March 2019, with a view to striking a permanent deal that potentially preserves much of that relationship.\n\nThe proposal was cheered by lobbying groups for business, which is keen to avoid the duties, paperwork and regulatory uncertainty that life outside the customs union threatens, though those representing services want help in securing access for their industries. A continued customs arrangement would also help resolve the matter of how to police the Irish border, the subject of a position paper coming on Wednesday.\n\nYet the U.K. is also hoping to start sealing trade deals with other countries, something full membership of the customs union prevents. That will raise eyebrows in the EU, which has warned against cherry-picking and says that the U.K. won't be able to enjoy \"frictionless\" commerce outside its ranks.\n\nThe paper starts to flesh out what May wants from a transitional period. That now seems to be the government's approach to Brexit, although there is still debate over length and form. After a summer of cabinet rivalry over Brexit tactics, the embrace of transition can be read as a victory for Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond, who spent the summer advocating the case for a smooth Brexit.\n\nThe EU has been open to a stopgap arrangement, but will argue that other matters such as citizens' rights and the Brexit bill need to be resolved first. That will take until October at the earliest.\n\nThe publication of the position papers comes two weeks before divorce talks resume. To update your end-of-summer diary here's a reminder of key dates. May's office says she'll travel to Japan next week, just weeks after a trip by Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson.\n\nBrexit Latest\n\nWhere is Boris, anyway? | Johnson has been oddly quiet on Brexit lately. Bloomberg's Svenja O'Donnell explores the possible reasons for his silence.\n\nWhile you were away | Broadcasters are concerned about their post-Brexit businesses and demand for HSBC's foreign currency accounts has spiked. Deutsche Bank insiders said they envisioned shifting almost half its U.K. positions to the continent, while Amsterdam is already luring talent from London.\n\nNo City break | Headhunter Morgan & McKinley reported a one percent increase in available financial services positions in July, a month that typically sees a decline in job traffic. This suggested a volatile market as Brexit looms.\n\nPound parity | HSBC and Morgan Stanley are predicting that the euro will attain and even go beyond parity with the pound for the first time in the next year. Meanwhile, ING warned the pound is set for a bout of volatility, having already slipped to its weakest level against the euro in 10 months.\n\nBank of England on hold | The case for the Bank of England to start raising interest rates soon is weakening. As Brexit nears, the U.K. economy will lose more momentum this year than previously forecast and inflation's peak may be shy of 3 percent, according to a Bloomberg survey of economists. The latest CPI figures are released this morning at 9.30 a.m. in London.\n\nHammond challenged | Pro-Brexit campaign group Vote.EU said it will write to voters in the Chancellor's constituency to urge them to deselect him because of his stance on Brexit. Home Secretary Amber Rudd will also be targeted.\n\nAnd Finally...\n\nWhen May began the Brexit process in March an aide told reporters that Britain would be out of the EU when \"Big Ben bongs midnight\" on March 29, 2019. It turned out he was an hour wrong - it's midnight Brussels time that will actually count.\n\nBut it's a moot point anyway: Yesterday it was revealed that Big Ben, the 13.7-ton bell in Parliament's Elizabeth Tower, will fall silent this month for four years to protect workers carrying out restoration work. It will chime again next when the U.K. is no longer in the EU.\n\nSource: Bloomberg", "id": "9401713", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-15", "title": "Brexit Bulletin: We Know What EU Did This Summer",

Business would have to declare goods for import and export to the EU. But Britain would do its best to make trade as \"streamlined\" as possible, by staying within something called the Common Transit Convention, which currently covers the EU, Switzerland, Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Turkey, Macedonia and Serbia.\n\nThe U.K. would also agree with the EU which firms are considered trusted traders - known as Authorised Economic Operators -- who have to meet certain standards in return for reduced bureaucracy. Technical solutions such as pre-arrival notification of goods crossing borders, and number plate recognition cameras, would be deployed to avoid long queues at Dover and other ports.\n\nThe government's position paper admits this option would entail \"an increase in administration.\" It may also require firms to do self-assessments of their own customs duties. A lot of paperwork, in other words.\n\nThen we have the partnership option (bear with me).\n\nThis would involve the U.K. imposing EU rules and tariffs on all third-country goods entering the country. Essentially the U.K. border would remain the EU border.\n\nExcept, that is, for goods that are going to end up being consumed in the U.K. Those goods would incur a tariff set by the U.K. - thus enabling the U.K. to have its coveted independent trade policy. The position paper acknowledges this is \"an innovative and untested approach.\"\n\nIt does have a significant upside. According to the position paper, it would avoid any customs border whatsoever between the U.K. and the EU -- including between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.\n\nThe downside is, it would require all goods to be tracked from import to end user, or alternatively, for all goods coming into the U.K. from third countries to incur whichever tariff is higher, the U.K. or the EU one. Then traders, through a labyrinthine process, could claim back the difference if their imported goods ended up in the market that incurred the cheaper tariff.\n\nUnderstood? Good.\n\nThat's position paper No. 1.

The Prime Minister of the Republic of Ireland has clearly stated he does not intend to work for a hard Brexit border.\n\nThe UK has previously promised detailed proposals for a new customs arrangement with the Republic. However, the paper falls short of that promise, arguing that the nature of the border between the North of Ireland and the Republic cannot be addressed before the future trade relations between the EU and the UK has been determined. Therefore, the paper offers vague references to the use of technology to make the trade in goods appear seamless or \"frictionless.\"\n\nWhat is certain is that the North of Ireland and the Republic will not have a common market and/or customs' regime. In a joint letter to the Sunday Telegraph, Chancellor Philip Hammond and international trade secretary Liam Fox confirmed that the UK will leave both the customs union and the single market in March 2019, confirming the hard Brexit scenario.\n\nThat means that Dublin and London could be soon colliding on the future of Northern Ireland, a clash underscored by the far-right Democratic Unionist Party lending their support to Theresa May's government.\n\nThe other two papers to be published this week will address concerns about the trade in goods and freedom of information after Brexit. These papers are meant to convey something that resembles a Brexit plan, ahead of the resumption of negotiations in Septembers and October's European Council.\n\nShare on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Google+ Share on LinkedIn+", "id": "9070953", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-14", "title": "The British government plans for hard border with the Republic of Ireland", "image": "https://www.neweurope.eu/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/04_Borders-UK.jpg", "extractedDates": [{"textStart": 1416, "date": "2019-03-", "amb": false, "textEnd": 1426}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-14", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 5, "id": "76", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "Republic of Ireland"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 4, "id": "101", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Ireland", "label": {"eng": "Republic of Ireland"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Northern Ireland"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 3, "id": "85555", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland", "label": {"eng": "Northern Ireland"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 2, "id": "86522", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "Republic of Ireland"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Dublin"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 2, "id": "113087", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dublin", "label": {"eng": "Dublin"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Transport"}, "id": "303009", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport"}, {"label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "id": "303064", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union"}, {"label": {"eng": "Trade"}, "id": "303410", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade"}, {"label": {"eng": "Minister (government)"}, "id": "303435", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minister_(government)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Passport"}, "id": "303926", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passport"}, {"label": {"eng": "Government of the United Kingdom"}, "id": "304310", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_the_United_Kingdom"}, {"label": {"eng": "Theresa May"}, "id": "304328", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theresa_May"}, {"label": {"eng": "Philip Hammond"}, "id": "304608", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Hammond"}, {"label": {"eng": "Customs"}, "id": "304875", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customs"}, {"label": {"eng": "International trade"}, "id": "307061", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_trade"}, {"label": {"eng": "Democratic Unionist Party"}, "id": "322426", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Unionist_Party"}, {"label": {"eng": "Single market"}, "id": "326525", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_market"}, {"label": {"eng": "Liam Fox"}, "id": "330676", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liam_Fox"}, {"label": {"eng": "Freedom of information"}, "id": "340693", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_information"}, {"label": {"eng": "Taoiseach"}, "id": "361307", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taoiseach"}, {"label": {"eng": "David Miliband"}, "id": "375823", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Miliband"}, {"label": {"eng": "Customs union"}, "id": "382637", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customs_union"}, {"label": {"eng": "The Sunday Telegraph"}, "id": "460086", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sunday_Telegraph"}, {"label": {"eng": "Leo Varadkar"}, "id": "518475", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo_Varadkar"}, {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom withdrawal from the European Union"}, "id": "1268836", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_withdrawal_from_the_European_Union"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 315, "label": "dmoz/Business/Materials/Pulp and Paper", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Materials/Pulp_and_Paper"}], "time": "12:02:00"}

This paper details the Government's aspirations for the UK's future customs arrangements.\"\n\nThe word that troubles most is \"aspiration\". And, indeed the proposal has been met with a fairly incredulous response from EU figures and some national governments. The idea is that post the Brexit deadline in March of 2019 that the UK can continue to enjoy free movement of goods for a subsequent two years, whilst also getting the right to pursue trade deals with other countries too (which is not currently permitted to EU nations). It's a bit of a have cake and eat it suggestion but it does make sense from a business and ecommerce perspective.\n\nA hard Brexit where free movement of goods has to stop post March 2019 would be obviously negative to any UK business trading within the EU bloc. And with the UK being a key consumer market, it's not attractive to EU merchants either selling to the UK. The free movement of goods from an ecommerce perspective has to be a good thing, even if Brexit means Brexit. Two more years of certainty, part of this proposal, is a good thing.\n\nAnother aspect of the proposal which is of particular value and importance to merchants in the UK and Ireland is complete clarity that the UK wants a tariff free and fluid movement of people and goods across the only UK land border. That's an idea to be welcomed too. The UK and Ireland are key trading partners and a closed border for goods and people would have a very real negative business impact.", "id": "9415830", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-16", "title": "UK offer for temporary customs union Brexit deal is good for ecommerce - Tamebay", "image": "https://tamebay.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/UK-EU-Brexit.jpg", "extractedDates": [{"textStart": 1412, "date": "2019-03-", "amb": false, "textEnd": 1422}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-16", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 5, "id": "76", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": null, "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 1, "id": "112932", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Business"}, "id": "302720", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business"}, {"label": {"eng": "Referendum"}, "id": "303036", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referendum"}, {"location": null, "score": 3, "id": "303048", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Trade"}, "id": "303410", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade"}, {"label": {"eng": "Member state of the European Union"}, "id": "303880", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_state_of_the_European_Union"}, {"label": {"eng": "Customs"}, "id": "304875", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customs"}, {"label": {"eng": "Internal market"}, "id": "305938", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_market"}, {"label": {"eng": "Tariff"}, "id": "309353", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tariff"}, {"label": {"eng": "Consumer"}, "id": "310387", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer"}, {"label": {"eng": "E-commerce"}, "id": "317432", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-commerce"}, {"label": {"eng": "Withdrawal from the European Union"}, "id": "410168", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Withdrawal_from_the_European_Union"}, {"label": {"eng": "European Union Customs Union"}, "id": "470058", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union_Customs_Union"}, {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom withdrawal from the European Union"}, "id": "1268836", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_withdrawal_from_the_European_Union"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 108, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 140, "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 269, "label": "dmoz/Business/International Business and Trade", "uri": "dmoz/Business/International_Business_and_Trade"}], "time": "06:32:00"}

It came days before the first of Brexit secretary David Davis's offical position papers.\n\nFox and Hammond represent opposite sides of the Tory infighting.\n\n\"Hard Brexiteer\" Fox speaks to the nationalist right wing of the Tory grassroots, Hammond to the interests of big businesses. Hammond has fought a rearguard action to preserve the most neoliberal aspects of European Union (EU) membership.\n\nThere's also a grubby Whitehall turf war.\n\nFox's international trade department was meant to bring him the influence and glory of negotiating post-Brexit trade deals. It won't do much if Britain stays in the EU's customs union. It's effectively a binding, Europe-wide trade deal whose members are banned from making other deals on the side.\n\nBoth sides deserve to lose and their truce may not last.\n\nThe big concessions in the article were by Hammond. He promised that any transitional period would end by 2022 and that Britain would leave the customs union. This invited ridicule from both the Tory right and pro-EU liberals.\n\nBut Davis rapidly poured cold water on Fox's gloating. His paper took a different emphasis. Britain will pay to stay in the customs union for now, then replace it with a \"customs partnership\" -- and commit to not making other deals until then.\n\nThe government has little room to manoeuvre. It cannot afford to alienate business too much. But to stay in office it needs to avoid picking fights with its base, scapegoate migrants and reassure Leave voters.\n\nSeperate\n\nIn a seperate paper this week Davis was expected to offer continued free movement for Irish nationals after Brexit. This keeps up an arrangement -- a hangover from Britain's empire -- that long predates the EU and that couldn't be ended without provoking bigger rows.\n\nBut keeping it will satisfy neither side. The anti-migrant racists will say it isn't enough, while other EU nationals and their supporters will ask why the government can't make the same offer to them.\n\nTory former business minister Anna Soubry and the Labour right's favourite leader in exile David Miliband both hinted on Sunday about the possibility of a cross-party anti-Brexit alliance.\n\nOther Labour right MPs have daydreamed out loud about a new anti-Brexit centre party to escape Labour's left wing leadership. So has Tory adviser James Chapman.\n\nBut the idea has failed to catch on.

But, crucially, the report added that the North Korean leader would watch the US before making any decision, signalling an apparent deceleration in the provocative rhetoric.\n\nThe family of Bernard Kenny, who tried to stop the murder of MP Jo Cox in West Yorkshire last year, says he has died aged 79. The former miner was stabbed as he intervened when Thomas Mair attacked Mrs Cox in Birstall in 2016, and was later awarded the George Medal. Tracey Brabin MP, who was elected in Jo Cox's constituency after her death, said: \"Bernard will forever be remembered as a true hero.\"\n\nMore than 300 people have been killed in mudslides and flooding near Sierra Leone's capital, Freetown. A hillside in the Regent area collapsed early on Monday following heavy rains, leaving many houses covered in mud. The number of casualties is expected to rise, with local residents reportedly trying to recover bodies from the rubble with their bare hands.\n\nThe Daily Telegraph and the Daily Mail report on a \"backlash\" against the announcement that Big Ben will fall silent for four years - with the Telegraph quoting senior MPs as calling the move \"entirely bonkers\". The Times interprets today's customs union proposal as evidence that Chancellor Philip Hammond has won the upper hand over International Trade Secretary Liam Fox as reported divisions continue in the cabinet over how to proceed with Brexit.\n\nSwift justice Pop star Taylor Swift wins an assault case against DJ David Mueller\n\nRailroaded Train passengers are braced for news of an increase in regulated rail fares from January 2018\n\nFat not fit People who are overweight face increased health risks even if they appear medically healthy, experts warn\n\nSnap judgement Social media giant Snap's shares plunge following disappointing results\n\n09:30 The ONS publishes the inflation figures for July which will be used as the benchmark for rail fare rises to be introduced in January 2018\n\nToday Tory MP Craig MacKinlay appears in court for the first time after being charged with falsely recording election expenses in 2015\n\n1947 India officially became an independent country outside British rule\n\n1992 The first Premier League matches were played, with the first goal by Brian Deane of Sheffield United as they beat Manchester United 2-1\n\nLearndirect faces collapse after failing to suppress Ofsted report (FT)\n\nHow the Garden Bridge came to be so hated (CityMetric)\n\nIs America heading for a new kind of civil war?

Ireland's agri-food sector has a high dependence on the UK market, with 40 per cent of exports destined for the UK market annually.\n\n\"The UK Government has proposed two options - either the reinstatement of a 'highly streamlined customs arrangement', or a 'customs partnership' which they suggest would not require a customs border between the EU and UK.\n\n\"The first option would see the reinstatement of a customs border between the EU and UK. This is a very retrograde development for trade on the island of Ireland and between Ireland and Britain, after forty-five years of EEC/EU integration.\"\n\nMr Healy continued, \"The second option, of a 'customs partnership' between the EU and UK is simply not an acceptable outcome for the agriculture and food sector, as even under this arrangement, the UK would still be committed to pursuing their own trade policy for imports into the UK.\n\n\"Any increase in low-cost food imports into the UK that would undermine the value of the UK market would have a devastating effect on the Irish agri-food sector. The potential displacement of Irish food exports from the UK market will in turn destabilise the EU market balance.\"\n\nThe IFA President concluded by saying that in order to safeguard the future value of the Irish and EU farming and food sector, the EU must negotiate a balanced Free Trade Agreement with the UK, which would include the following specific conditions for agriculture and food:", "id": "9472243", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-16", "title": "UK Customs Proposals Very Negative for Irish Agriculture, Says IFA", "image": "http://www.thepigsite.com/images/pigsiteFacebook.jpg", "extractedDates": [{"imp": true, "textStart": 388, "date": "2017-08-15", "amb": false, "textEnd": 397}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-16", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 4, "id": "76", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": null, "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 5, "id": "112932", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Agriculture"}, "id": "302524", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agriculture"}, {"label": {"eng": "Economy"}, "id": "303018", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy"}, {"label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "id": "303064", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union"}, {"label": {"eng": "Export"}, "id": "303403", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Export"}, {"label": {"eng": "Trade"}, "id": "303410", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade"}, {"label": {"eng": "Government of the United Kingdom"}, "id": "304310", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_the_United_Kingdom"}, {"label": {"eng": "Customs"}, "id": "304875", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customs"}, {"label": {"eng": "Internal market"}, "id": "305938", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_market"}, {"label": {"eng": "Import"}, "id": "307363", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Import"}, {"label": {"eng": "Border"}, "id": "308560", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Border"}, {"label": {"eng": "Irish people"}, "id": "309111", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_people"}, {"location": null, "score": 2, "id": "355707", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Economic_Community", "label": {"eng": "European Economic Community"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "European integration"}, "id": "369060", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_integration"}, {"label": {"eng": "Customs union"}, "id": "382637", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customs_union"}, {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom withdrawal from the European Union"}, "id": "1268836", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_withdrawal_from_the_European_Union"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 213, "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Food Science", "uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Food_Science"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 214, "label": "dmoz/Business/Food and Related Products/Consulting", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Food_and_Related_Products/Consulting"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 217, "label": "dmoz/Business/Food and Related Products/Import and Export", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Food_and_Related_Products/Import_and_Export"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 827, "label": "dmoz/Society/Ethnicity/Celtic", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Ethnicity/Celtic"}], "time": "12:01:00"}

However, there are concerns among senior Whitehall officials that some documents are being rushed through without proper analysis.\n\nAt the weekend, Chancellor Philip Hammond, who favours a \"soft\" pro-business Brexit, and the International Development Secretary Liam Fox, a leading Brexiteer, issued a joint statement that there would have to be a transition period after Britain leaves the EU.

It is about the succession to Theresa May.\n\nIn the Observer David Miliband writes: \"Delegating to May and Davis, never mind Johnson and Fox, the settlement of a workable alternative to EU membership is a delusion, not just an abdication.\"\n\nBut he then heaps praise on Philip Hammond :\"I never thought I would say this, but Philip Hammond is also playing an important, even valiant, role. A transition of the kind he has advocated is vital.\"\n\nMiliband is one of the most brilliant men on policy to surface in recent years but the crude workings of personal raw ambition and hunger for power are not part of his CV.\n\nHammond is utterly cynical and in 2015 said Brexit \"would light a fire under Europe.\" He is part and parcel of the 21st Century anti-EU fronde in the Tory Party.\n\nSince July 2016 he has to represent the Treasury which is in despair over Brexit and he has to reassure business. As long as economic actors, i.e. the business community in the broadest sense, refuse to come out clearly and cleanly against Brexit there is no real pressure on the Tories.\n\nUnfortunately Corbyn as leader of the revived Labour Party is a huge help to the Brexit camp. No economic actor is going to say or do anything that appears to be preferring Corbyn to a Tory government. If Corbyn can find words that imply accepting the Single Market/Customs Union then that changes the dynamic. We shall see what happens in the party conference season of September/early October.\n\nSo Hammond has room for manoeuvre. He knows how fragile May is and how much Tory MPs want a new leader not the woman who lost so many of their colleagues their seats on 8th June and made Labour the Lazarus party - back from the dead.\n\nFox was the kingmaker in the 2005 Tory leadership campaign. He gave 40 votes to David Cameron in exchange for Cameron agreeing to pull out of the European Peoples Party, the federation of centre-right parties in Europe. This was the first political exit from Europe paving the way for the much bigger Brexit amputation with economic, trade and political Europe enshrined in EU Treaties.\n\nNow Fox has told Hammond that he can have 10 Downing Street in exchange for a guarantee of hard Brexit and a big promotion for Fox in a Hammond government.\n\nIf Paris was worth a mass for Henry IV of France, then Downing Street is worth a hard Brexit for an ambitious Philip Hammond.\n\nAnne McElvoy, a liberal rightist Economist senior editor (Eurosceptic but never a Ukip-Gove Brexit fanatic) also writes in the Observer in praise of those \"determined to limit the worst damage from a hard Brexit in the wider interest. Those slogging away at that aim, notably Philip Hammond as chancellor, are doing the more responsible thing.\"\n\nSo Hammond is seen as both responsible and talking \"transition\" language and, simultaneously, thanks to his new alliance with Fox is also seen as the man ready to take the UK out of the Single Market and Customs Union.\n\nIf May goes in the next period Hammond is likely to succeed her with both Tory Remainers and Leavers able to read into him what they want.\n\nThe mood is uneasy, unsettled. The UK has no previous example of getting out of a disastrous policy blunder based for the first time in British history on a plebiscite decision, especially one which has yet to take place in the sense of leaving the EU.\n\nPast blunders like Suez, the Poll Tax, or Iraq were solved by cutting losses and in the first two examples swiftly removing a Prime Minister as a sacrifice. But the Brexit decision was taken by a plebiscite, and has yet to be given effect.\n\nDavid Cameron has gone and Theresa May will probably go but that does not provide a solution to working out what is an appropriate political solution. There is no previous precedent. The text-books of political history provide no answers. Perhaps our constitutionalists can come up with some ideas?\n\nBookstores are snowed under with Brexit books.

Launching the plan, David Davis, Britain's main Brexit negotiator, noted that other European Union nations, which export more goods to Britain than it sends back, have an interest in making it work.\n\nUnder the proposal, Britain would quit the customs union, but seek to join something almost identical for a period. During that time, it would want to be allowed to sign -- but not put into effect -- trade deals with other partners.\n\nThat stipulation -- like everything else -- has to be agreed upon with the other 27 European governments, which may oppose such a move. And experts say that countries like the United States or India would not be in a position to strike trade deals with Britain until they know more about its future economic relationship with the European Union.\n\nIn any event, the British plan was given a cool reception by European Union officials, who said there would be no negotiations on that point until \"divorce\" issues have been settled, like the exit bill London would have to pay and the rights European Union citizens in Britain would have. Hence, the talk about \"fantasy\" from Mr. Verhofstadt.\n\nMore important, the lack of any convincing scheme for the longer term underscores the unresolved divisions in the government over whether Britain should gamble with its ties to the giant European economic free trade area on its doorstep in the hope of negotiating separate agreements that would limit the damage from leaving the customs union, in part or even entirely.\n\nThe infighting has been heightened by the economic uncertainty caused by Brexit, with reduced investment in key British industrial sectors, subdued economic growth and a decline in living standards as business frets about a \"cliff edge\" change in trading rules ahead of Britain's planned departure in 2019.\n\nThe tensions burst into public view last week when James Chapman, a former senior aide to Mr. Davis, described Brexit as a catastrophe, called for the creation of a new political party called the Democrats to oppose it, and suggested that the foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, and other Brexit campaigners should be jailed for false claims made ahead of last year's referendum (in which Britons voted 52 percent to 48 percent to leave).\n\n\"Let's be honest, if we had an effective electoral law leading Brexiteers would now be in jail #wheresmy350maweekboris,\" Mr. Chapman tweeted, a reference to Mr. Johnson's claims that an additional 350 million pounds a week -- $525 million at the currency rates then prevailing -- would be available for health care after Britain's withdrawal.\n\nSupporters of Brexit fought back, including Jacob Rees-Mogg, a Conservative lawmaker, who argued that Mr. Chapman wanted to overturn the will of the people, and said that rather than the Democrats, his party should more accurately be called the Oligarchs.\n\nMeanwhile, what Britain wants from long-term Brexit trade negotiations -- let alone what it can get -- seems almost as opaque as ever, with Tuesday's document suggesting two strikingly different options.\n\nOne would allow for very different British and European Union customs systems, but rely on technology to prevent trucks backing up at ports -- a challenge for which Britain and its neighbors would certainly need to prepare.\n\nThe second, \"partnership\" approach would align some British and European Union rules, doing away with any customs border between Britain and the European Union at all, as at present. The British government acknowledged that it would be \"challenging\" to do this in a way that was compatible with Britain's desire to strike broader global trade deals.\n\nKeir Starmer, who speaks for the opposition Labour Party on Brexit, argued that the cabinet remains \"split on key issues and cannot decide between two very different but equally unachievable options.\"\n\n\"These fantastical and contradictory proposals provide no guidance for negotiators or certainty for businesses,\" Mr. Starmer said in a statement.\n\nThough Mr. Davis insisted that discussions in Brussels were going well, even he made little attempt to conceal the scale of the task ahead when asked about the pace of talks.\n\n\"This is probably the most complex negotiation in history,\" he told the BBC.", "id":

It's not perfect from either side, and we are going through the negotiation.\"\n\nThe UK chief Brexit negotiator also tried to make a virtue of the government's lack of clarity on what it wants from the negotiations.\n\n\"You will find it difficult sometimes to read what we intend,\" he told Today. \"That's deliberate. I'm afraid in negotiations you do have constructive ambiguity from time to time.\"\n\nHe also claimed the EU's desire to punish the UK for voting for Brexit had waned since the election in May of the new pro-European president of France, Emmanuel Macron.\n\n\"There was a terror early on that we would be the first of many countries breaking off. After the victory of Macron in France, that terror has reduced. They are no longer quite so afraid, so the punishment battalion side is now reducing,\" Davis told ITV.\n\nOn BBC Breakfast he conceded there were differences in cabinet over what ministers want from the talks with the EU. He said: \"Of course there are different views on elements of the deal, because departments have their own specific interests.\n\n\"Treasury is obviously concerned about the City; Business, Energy and Industry are concerned about things like research and manufacturing. [The international trade secretary] Liam [Fox] of course wants to do his trade deals. My job is to make sure we do all of those things in a practical way that works, but also in a way which is negotiable ... that we are not pitching for the moon.\n\n\"Of course there are discussions, and of course there are interests, but we all want the best outcome for Britain.\"\n\nOn ITV Davis dismissed James Chapman as a \"maniac\" after his former aide called for a new centrist party claiming Brexit signalled the end of the Conservatives.\n\n\"Dear old James. James did a great job for me as my chief of staff but even the day he arrived he was a maniac,\" Davis said.\n\nChapman, who had previously been special adviser to the chancellor George Osborne and the Daily Mail's political editor responded with a series of tweets criticising Davis.\n\nHe accused the Brexit secretary of working part-time, and said he had behaved in a \"drunk, bullying and inappropriate\" way towards the shadow home secretary, Diane Abbott. He also said Davis once accidentally called the EU Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, while trying to get through to a \"far-right friend\", and had the former Ukip leader Nigel Farage on his speed dial.", "id": "9236500", "details": {"liCnt": 23}, "date": "2017-08-15", "title": "UK may have to pay EU in temporary customs union, Davis suggests", "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2a23c4caeb35b016761cfa59f9a86f6c5445aea4/0_68_2200_1320/master/2200.jpg?w=1200&h=630&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=crop&crop=faces%2Centropy&bm=normal&ba=bottom%2Cleft&blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly91cGxvYWRzLmd1aW0uY28udWsvMjAxNi8wNi8wNy9vdmVybGF5LWxvZ28tMTIwMC05MF9vcHQucG5n&s=44f073baaf2021112666c78590d7a616", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-15", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "France"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 3, "id": "74", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "label": {"eng": "France"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 5, "id": "76", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Human rights"}, "id": "302584", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights"}, {"location": null, "score": 3, "id": "303048", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "id": "303064", "score": 4, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union"}, {"label": {"eng": "Trade"}, "id": "303410", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade"}, {"label": {"eng": "George Osborne"}, "id": "305289", "score": 1, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Osborne"}, {"label": {"eng": "Conservative Party (UK)"}, "id": "305609", "score": 1, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservative_Party_(UK)"}, {"label": {"eng": "ITV (TV network)"}, "id": "306548", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITV_(TV_network)"}, {"label": {"eng": "International trade"}, "id": "307061", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_trade"}, {"label": {"eng": "Daily Mail"}, "id": "307492", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Mail"}, {"label": {"eng": "President of France"}, "id": "308754", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_France"}, {"label": {"eng": "Today (BBC Radio 4)"}, "id": "312757", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Today_(BBC_Radio_4)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Centrism"}, "id": "313115", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centrism"}, {"label": {"eng": "Emmanuel Macron"}, "id": "316181", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmanuel_Macron"}, {"label": {"eng": "BBC Radio 4"}, "id": "329154", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_Radio_4"}, {"label": {"eng": "Special advisers (UK government)"}, "id": "355042", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_advisers_(UK_government)"}, {"label": {"eng": "BBC Breakfast"}, "id": "358027", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_Breakfast"}, {"label": {"eng": "Customs union"}, "id": "382637", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customs_union"}, {"label": {"eng": "Good Morning Britain (2014 TV programme)"}, "id": "427656", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Morning_Britain_(2014_TV_programme)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Pro-Europeanism"}, "id": "450631", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro-Europeanism"}, {"label": {"eng": "Constructive ambiguity"}, "id": "1126495", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructive_ambiguity"}, {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom withdrawal from the European Union"}, "id": "1268836", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_withdrawal_from_the_European_Union"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 41, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 63, "label": "dmoz/Society/Work", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Work"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 108, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 140, "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 268, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business"}], "time": "08:32:00"}

Five weeks of a steady thaw in government thinking over how to ease Britain's departure from the EU appears to have come to a shuddering halt. A joint article by the chancellor, Philip Hammond, and his cabinet rival Liam Fox instead signals that the position paper on customs policy published on Tuesday could once again favour a more bracing leap into the unknown.\n\nThat, at least, is the fear of business groups who are interpreting the weekend peace accord between Hammond and Fox as a sign that the cabinet Brexit wars have been won by Tory hardliners. By conceding that any transition phase cannot involve membership of the single market or the EU customs union, the once troublesome chancellor seems to be raising the white flag ahead of the prime minister's return from holiday this week.\n\nThe post-election thaw in government thinking began at a summit of business leaders at the Chevening country house on 7 July at which the CBI called for full continued membership of both the single market and customs union. But the political consequences of this are threatening in many ways, none more so than for Fox, whose international trade department would be barred from striking any new deals abroad for the entire length of the transition.\n\nWithout doubt, there has been a climbdown in the chancellor's language while his boss has been away. Out is Hammond's summertime dream of an indefinite \"transition\" phase, in which life largely continues as normal while trade negotiators finish the lengthy process of thrashing out Britain's future relationship with the EU. Instead, Downing Street is once more buzzing with talk of an interim or \"implementation\" period: a phrase preferred by the prime minister because she believes it suggests a more finite, controlled process of departure.\n\nBut the EU has always insisted that enjoying the full benefits of market membership can only come with an agreement to play by existing rules. If cabinet unity is to be maintained, then promises of \"frictonless trade\" throughout may still end up looking a lot like temporary membership of the customs union.\n\nEither the government is now prepared to tolerate a sharp, painful departure, or it still believes in the cake-and-eat-it dream of changing EU minds. Many Brexit-watchers fear a combination of both.

covering the opening issues of the Irish border, the rights of EU citizens in the UK, and Britain's 'divorce bill' - had made limited progress.\n\nSince the June election, the Government has been on the back foot, disunited, allowing Brussels to present a gloomy picture of progress.\n\nSo if Theresa May has to achieve anything before Parliament reconvenes in September it is to regain control of the narrative.\n\nI'm sure after a three-week break and the political disaster that preceded it, Theresa May thinks things can only get better, and they can -

Before leaving the European Union altogether, the British government now wants an \"interim period,\" in which the United Kingdom would retain the commercial rights of EU membership, while still contributing to the EU budget, observing EU regulations and legal judgements, and allowing the free movement of people. This period would last for at least two years after March 2019 - the official deadline for the Brexit process - meaning that until 2021, Britain would essentially be an EU member state without any voting rights.\n\nIn the meantime, British Prime Minister Theresa May's government, having promised to maintain a \"deep and special\" relationship with Europe, would try to negotiate a new \"treaty-based arrangement\" with the EU. But Britain will have a vanishingly small chance of concluding a new treaty in so short a time.\n\nIndeed, come 2021, the UK will still be hurtling toward a \"cliff edge\": a full break from Europe, with no alternative arrangement in place to cushion the blow. Politically, that timing would pose even greater risks for May's government than it faces today, since the next general election must be held by June 2022. So the UK may try to extend the transition period beyond 2022. And as past experience tells us, once an extension is granted, it may never end.\n\nThe UK seems to be approaching the scenario I outlined three months ago. May's fateful decision to hold an early election in June has allowed her opponents to demand that the UK negotiate a transitional arrangement similar to what Norway has as a member of the European Economic Area. The EEA was originally created in 1994 as a temporary framework for various countries preparing to join the EU. But because Norwegian voters rejected a referendum on EU membership 11 months later, the EEA has now lasted for 24 years.\n\nNobody can predict what will happen in 24 years. But the good news for Britain is that the EU may already be moving slowly toward a two-track structure. To prosper, the eurozone will need to establish a political union. This will leave non-euro countries such as Denmark, Poland, and Sweden forming an outer ring of economic co-operation outside the eurozone. These countries would have membership in the single market, but not in the monetary or political union.\n\nA two-track Europe would be very different from the \"two-speed\" model that applies to Europe today. In the latter, every country is theoretically heading toward \"ever-closer union,\" just at different rates. In a two-track scenario, by contrast, Britain could comfortably re-join the outer track along with Norway and, perhaps, Switzerland.\n\nNow for the bad news. A transition arrangement for the UK may be unacceptable to both EU governments and British voters. Committed federalists in the EU want Britain out as quickly as possible, because Britain has long given cover for others - such as Denmark, Poland, and Sweden - to resist deeper integration.\n\nFederalist zealots hate the idea of a two-track Europe. They want to force all EU member states to adopt the euro within the next decade, and to embed themselves permanently into a full-scale political and fiscal union. And they rightly believe that achieving this goal will be easier with Britain out of the picture.\n\nBut a transition period is no panacea for the UK either. Britons have already started to get a glimpse of the economic costs of Brexit, as international businesses that once used Britain as a hub for their European operations have started to relocate some of their activities. As the UK government tries to maintain the fiction of a strictly time-limited transition, this process will accelerate further. Moreover, the EU will use the transition period to change its own regulations, so that businesses generating employment and large tax revenues will have to move onto EU territory.\n\nFor example, the European Banking Authority and the European Medicines Agency are already relocating from London, meaning the many legal, managerial, and lobbying jobs connected to highly regulated activities such as finance and pharmaceutical research will have to relocate, too. A transition period would thus hit international businesses based in Britain with a regulatory double-whammy: they would be subject to the whims of UK and EU bureaucracies at the same time.\n\nMaking matters worse, the promise of a long transition could delay the shift in public opinion needed to reverse Brexit before it is too late. After March 28, 2019, the UK will be officially out of the EU, where economic growth has already started to overtake that of Britain. If it ever wants to be readmitted, it will have to settle for far less attractive terms than what it enjoys today. Not only would it no longer receive budget rebates or special treatment on social regulations; it might even be forced to join the euro.\n\nEven the 48% of British voters who voted \"Remain\" might reject such humiliating terms. Britain would thus be stuck in limbo - like Norway, but without the oil wealth or social cohesion. As the Labour Party's trade spokesman has aptly put it, a semi-permanent transition period based on the \"Norway model\" would turn Britain into a \"vassal state.\" It would still pay large sums into the EU budget and adhere to EU laws, but it would have no say over how that money is spent or how those laws are made.\n\nIn the months ahead, the British public may start to foresee this humiliating endgame. The Norway model will satisfy neither Britain's elderly, provincial Europhobes, nor the young, urban voters who want to preserve the rights of EU citizenship that they have taken for granted all their lives.\n\nWith this depressing prospect setting in, British voters could change their minds about Brexit before their leaders go through with it. But for such a Damascene conversion to happen, the country would have to experience a political or economic crisis large enough to shake public opinion out of its fatalistic complacency. As things stand, Britons have been emulating that beloved national slogan, \"Keep calm and carry on.\" Before things can get better for Britain, they will probably have to get much worse. - Project

Ireland's agri-food sector has a high dependence on the UK market, with 40% of exports destined for the UK market annually.\"\n\nHe continued, \"The UK Government has proposed two options - either the reinstatement of a 'highly streamlined customs arrangement', or a 'customs partnership' which they suggest would not require a customs border between the EU and UK.\n\n\"The first option would see the reinstatement of a customs border between the EU and UK. This is a very retrograde development for trade on the island of Ireland and between Ireland and Britain, after forty-five years of EEC/EU integration.\"\n\nJoe Healy said, \"The second option, of a 'customs partnership' between the EU and UK is simply not an acceptable outcome for the agriculture and food sector, as even under this arrangement, the UK would still be committed to pursuing their own trade policy for imports into the UK.\"\n\nHe said, \"Any increase in low-cost food imports into the UK that would undermine the value of the UK market would have a devastating effect on the Irish agri-food sector. The potential displacement of Irish food exports from the UK market will in turn destabilise the EU market balance.\"\n\nThe IFA President concluded, \"In order to safeguard the future value of the Irish and EU farming and food sector, the EU must negotiate a balanced Free Trade Agreement with the UK, which would include the following specific conditions for agriculture and food:\n\n* Tariff - free trade for agricultural products and food;\n\n* Maintenance of equivalent standards on food safety, animal health, welfare and the environment;

Until yesterday, the anti-Brexiteers known as Remoaners had high hopes of Philip Hammond, the Chancellor.\n\nHis statement on The Andrew Marr Show last month that failure to reach an amicable deal with the EU 'would be a very, very bad outcome for Britain' was seen as an attack on his Brexiteer colleagues in the Cabinet (and, indeed, on the Prime Minister).\n\nBut yesterday he appeared as joint author of a newspaper article with the most adamantine Brexiteer in the Cabinet, the International Trade Secretary Dr Liam Fox. The two supposed foes declared that in March 2019, Britain would not just be leaving the EU but also 'we will leave the Customs Union and be free to negotiate the best trade deals around the world as an independent, open, trading nation'.\n\nAlthough the Cabinet Brexiteers were content with Hammond's proposal that there should be a transition period after March 2019, pending a final settlement of the country's arrangements with the EU, the Chancellor had given the impression he was bending to the demands of the CBI that Britain remain within the Customs Union during that unspecified period.\n\nBlunder\n\nThis they regarded as a fatal blunder -- and not just because they suspected the CBI (which had campaigned for Britain to give up sterling for the euro) of seeking to keep the UK in the EU 'by the back door'.\n\nAs Shanker Singham, chairman of the special trade commission of the Legatum Institute (a group consulted regularly by the Government), warned last week: 'The UK must be able to provide the clarity of being outside the Customs Union on Day 1 of Brexit. If such clarity does not exist, then other countries will not think the UK is serious about executing an independent trade policy and they will quickly lose patience and move on.'\n\nThe point is that while remaining a member of the EU Customs Union, you can't unilaterally negotiate trade deals with other countries -- which would wreck one of the fundamental purposes of Brexit.\n\nLast week, the man appointed by Theresa May and Dr Fox to be our chief trade advisor, Crawford Falconer, arrived from New Zealand to take up his post. If the Government had given way to the demands of the CBI, Professor Falconer -- renowned for his expertise in trade negotiations across the world -- might as well have returned immediately to the Antipodes. That will now not happen, thank goodness (I speak as someone who has met the redoubtable New Zealander).\n\nIn the circumstances, it is almost comical that David Miliband appeared yesterday as the author of a column in The Observer demanding a second referendum on Brexit, and declaring 'Philip Hammond is playing an important, even valiant role' in defying what the former Labour Foreign Secretary termed the 'delusion' of Dr Fox (and other 'hard Brexiteers' in the Government).\n\nComic timing: David Miliband demanded a second referendum in a newspaper column but he had the rug pulled from under him following Mr Hammond's comments\n\nNot only has Hammond pulled the rug from under Miliband's feet: his argument for a second referendum -- the eternal demand of the Remoaners -- is also dead and buried. We are going to leave in March 2019: full stop.\n\nAny referendum thereafter about EU membership would not be on the basis of our previous terms. We would be applying as a new member, obliged to agree a timetable for joining the euro, and without the mega-billions rebate negotiated by Margaret Thatcher. Good luck selling that to the British people, Mr Miliband.\n\nIn any case, the nation has not changed its collective mind since the referendum in June 2016. If anything, views have hardened in the direction set by the result. A survey of 3,293 people published on Friday by the London School of Economics showed that even those who had voted 'Remain' would prefer the sort of Brexit deal the LSE's team described as 'hard'.\n\nA total of 51.3 per cent of Remain voters backed a Brexit deal which delivered 'full control' over immigration and led to lower numbers of migrants from the EU. No fewer than 54.7 per cent of Remainers said that the UK should 'pay nothing' to the EU by means of a 'divorce bill'.\n\nAnd 52.2 per cent of Remainers told the LSE researchers that we should entirely free British law from the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice. Unsurprisingly, a still higher proportion of self-identifying 'Leave' voters supported what the LSE termed 'hard Brexit'.\n\nMonstrous\n\nThis clearly disappointed the most voluble critic of the Brexiteers on the Tory parliamentary benches, Anna Soubry. In her own newspaper article yesterday, she lamented 'a sense of resignation among most people who voted Remain that we have to \"man up\" and make the most of what we know will be a rotten Brexit'.\n\nCritic: Anna Soubry described Liam Fox as a 'Brexit ideologue' who had 'brought down' previous Tory PMs - including Mrs Thatcher\n\nThis former business minister under David Cameron described the likes of Dr Fox as the sort of 'Brexit ideologue' who had 'brought down' previous Tory PMs, among whom she listed John Major, her old boss Cameron -- and Mrs Thatcher!\n\nIt is a monstrous misrepresentation to say that Thatcher was brought down by 'Brexit ideologues'.\n\nIt was two days after Mrs T declared 'No! No! No!' to Brussels' plans for a federal European state that her deputy, Geoffrey Howe, resigned in protest, precipitating the leadership challenge by his fellow supporter of British membership of the euro, Michael Heseltine.\n\nIn other words, it was Soubry's fellow pro-EU 'ideologues' who brought down Thatcher. By intimating yesterday that she would vote in Parliament against the Government over a 'hard Brexit', Soubry signalled her readiness to bring down Theresa May over the same issue.\n\nBut the waters are closing rapidly over Soubry's head: the Cabinet is now united over its approach to Brexit. About time, too.\n\nA spooky political diagnosis of dementia\n\nDominic Lawson received a puzzling email last week suggesting that his father Nigel had dementia because of comments he had given during a BBC interview\n\nI received a puzzling email from a doctor last week. It was headed 'Climate Change' and warned: 'Your paps needs a dementia screening soon.' Because of climate change?\n\nNot exactly. Juergen Messner -- that was the sender's name -- was referring to an interview my father Nigel Lawson had just given to the BBC, in which he said there had been no increase in 'extreme weather events' and that we should stop panicking about climate change.\n\nDr Messner, a registrar in trauma and orthopaedic surgery at an NHS teaching facility in Yorkshire, seemed to think my 85-year-old father's opinions indicated that he was losing his mind to dementia.\n\nHe isn't, as it happens -- but I emailed Dr Messner to ask if, as a bone rather than a brain specialist, he was qualified to diagnose dementia. He replied with the garbled: 'Assessing mental capacity is part of most clinical doctors.'\n\nI emailed back that surely any doctor with respect for the proprieties of his profession does not give anyone a diagnosis of a potentially terminal condition in one of their relatives without personally having responsibility for the patient -- Dr Messner has never met my father. I added that I would consult the General Medical Council to check if I was right.\n\nDr Messner responded by asserting his rights to freedom of speech under Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights, followed by what some would term 'a religious profanity'.\n\nActually, he has a good point about freedom of speech -- and it covers abuse (which basically is what Dr Messner's original email was). But it is a little spooky when a doctor in this country regards dissent from establishment views on the effects of climate change as evidence of mental incapacity.\n\nTotalitarian regimes in the past -- notably the Soviet Union -- often treated dissent as a form of mental illness. Such dissidents would be consigned to psychiatric units, where they were drugged by doctors compliant with the prevailing political orthodoxy.\n\nI would advise elderly patients at Dr Messner's orthopaedic clinic not to engage him in discussions about climate change. They may get a diagnosis they hadn't bargained for.", "id": "8987851", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-14", "title": "Hammond's on board with Brexit - and  Remoaners are dead and buried", "image":

27 EU leaders will assess how much progress has been made on the first phase of talks, which have focused on EU citizens' rights, the Brexit 'divorce' bill and Northern Ireland's status.\n\nIf they agree that things are going well, they will move on to issues such as the future trading relationship between the UK and the bloc.\n\nBritain is desperate for the talks to be widened, while the EU is

At midnight on March 29, 2019, Britain will leave the European Union.\n\nYou might not think it from some of the commentary, but the sun will still rise the next day, there'll still be a clean water supply, and the trains and buses will still run. Life will go on.\n\nYet while the apocalyptic stuff about life after Europe may be dismissed, we ought to face up to the reality that the most likely possible outcome is a Hard Brexit, whether we like it or not.\n\nIndeed even a so-called \"transition deal\" after March 2019 amounts to Hard Brexit.\n\nThe latest government thinking on that came in that joint article from International Trade Secretary Liam Fox and Chancellor Philip Hammond, with Hard Brexit plainly looming: \"We are both clear that during this period the UK will be outside the single market and outside the customs union and will be a 'third-country' not party to EU treaties,\" they said.\n\nNo matter that this is inconsistent with them also wanting to see that the UK's borders \"must continue to operate smoothly\", that goods bought on the internet \"must still cross borders\", and \"businesses must still be able to supply their customers across the EU\" after Brexit. Cake and eat it, in short. Much the same goes for the Government's \"position papers\" on membership.\n\nThere's been much more sense from Mervyn, now Lord, King. As he said the other day, it is time we made a plan.\n\nI never thought I'd miss the former Governor of the Bank of England so much, his owlish presence in our national life so swiftly eclipsed by his \"rock star\" successor Mark Carney. Yet I can only echo Mervyn's warnings.\n\nFor it does looks increasingly obvious that Britain will not enjoy, if that's the right word, a so-called Soft Brexit, either for the short term -- the \"transition\" or \"implementation\" phase as it's being called -- or in the long run.\n\nFirst, there's no such thing as Soft Brexit anyway. I give Theresa May credit for recognising this in her Lancaster House speech, and the Fox-Hammond article echoes that. Being in the single market means accepting free movement of labour; unacceptable to the British, though the Europeans insist on it. Only Liechtenstein enjoys the perk of membership without free movement, as a micro-state tax haven.\n\nStaying in the EU customs union means we can't sign any trade deals with other countries, so that too is out. In either case we'll have no say in the European Council or the European Parliament. We can try for a bespoke deal, but we'll not get that either, because the EU has no incentive to make Brexit beneficial.\n\nTime has probably already run out to get any \"soft\" deal anyway. A resolution of the Irish border issue is essential before the EU talks move on to broader trade in October. The British have had 600 years to sort out the Irish Question, and this modern iteration of it will not be sorted by David Davis over the summer hols.\n\nTherefore the trade talks may not even start in October and all that is before a fractious and chaotic Parliament gets its hands on things. The talks will get bogged down and fail and we may as well admit it now. Soft Brexit, then, is a false hope. We need a plan. Here are some radical ideas:\n\n*We operate a unilateral free trade policy. So: no tedious trade talks required, and at least our borders are frictionless in one direction, inwards.\n\nWe let into the UK whatever we want, and stop the other stuff, by exception. We take advantage of world prices and bargains, like a giant version of Lidl. If we don't fancy chlorinated chicken from America, we just say no. If we like the idea of tariff-free Ford Mustangs, then in they come. Simple.\n\n*We scrap many restrictions on immigration. It makes the best economic sense.\n\nNot what many voted for last year, but still, needs must and the economy comes first. We offer companies, farms and agencies the right to bring in key workers. That way Goldman Sachs or the LSE would be free to recruit as many Indian, American, South African or Dutch economists as they need; and bulb growers in Lincolnshire too would still be able to employ seasonal labour from Bulgaria, or Bangladesh for that matter.\n\n*We let the pound go. Hard Brexit means sterling will \"overshoot on the downside\" as the euphemism goes. Fine; it will help the adjustment.\n\n*The UK needs to let rip as the Singapore of Europe, a free-trading, flexible, productive powerhouse. A highly competitive economy is the only chance we have in world markets.\n\nThat means relaxing labour laws, a radical shrinking of the state, and an ultra-low corporate and personal taxation regime. It's been called \"Margaret Thatcher's Fourth Term\" and it is no coincidence that so many hard Brexiteers are also hard Thatcherites.\n\nThe UK economic model has to be \"reset\", as Philip Hammond once put it (though he has since retreated from that, a little messily).\n\n*There has to be a shift from consumption to investment, so lower living standards but better infrastructure and capital for future productivity growth -- sacrifices again.\n\nSo what might this brave new world feel like? A harsher, more bracing, more unequal country, for sure.\n\nWe could, in fact, wake up to a Tudor-style kingdom. Scotland and Northern Ireland would go their separate ways, leaving just England and Wales, as Henry VIII might have recognised things: A post-EU \"Littler Britain\" endowed with the same spirit of adventure and commerce as drove the First Elizabeth, Drake, Raleigh and Frobisher.\n\nLondon, then as now, would be at the centre of this great buccaneering maritime power in a Second Elizabethan Age with David Davis, Boris Johnson and Liam Fox in doublet and hose.\n\nWell, there's a plan.

The communications strategy, which hitherto saw the government keep many aspects of its Brexit plan a closely-guarded secret, has allowed the EU side to fill the void and frame the debate, senior officials now believe.\n\nThe change in approach is also symptomatic of an opening up of communications under the new team in No. 10 Downing Street following the June 8 election. Prior to the election, in which Prime Minister Theresa May lost her majority, the prime minster's two co-chiefs of staff ran a very tight operation which controlled communication across all government departments. Both were forced to resign in the wake of the election campaign and May's new team has made deliberate efforts to make government more open.\n\n\"This is about making the most effective use of specialist knowledge across both departments\" -- DExEU spokesperson\n\nThe strategy will particularly focus on EU capitals, ahead of a crucial European Council summit in October that will decide whether negotiations can progress to the next stage and discussions of the future relationship between the U.K. and the EU.\n\n\"As we approach the next stage of negotiations -- discussing our future relationship with the EU once we've left -- we want to ramp up the communications work, campaigns and stakeholder engagement that will enable the government to communicate its messages effectively in EU member states as well as at home,\" a spokesperson from the Department for Exiting the European Union (DExEU) said.\n\n\"Staff from DExEU and FCO are working together to deliver this. This is about making the most effective use of specialist knowledge across both departments.\"\n\nBritain's network of ambassadors in the EU27 capitals, who are coordinated from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) led by Johnson, had been underused in the Brexit process so far, the first official said.\n\n\"Ambassadors know who to talk to and how to talk to them, but they have been a relatively untapped resource ... They can have more influence than an opinion piece by a minister in a newspaper,\" the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.\n\nWith the role of the EU member countries in the Brexit negotiations about to become critical when leaders of the EU27 and Theresa May meet for the October European summit, British officials are conscious of the need to reassure May's counterparts that the U.K. wants a good economic outcome for both sides and a close relationship with the EU after Brexit.\n\nMay's Article 50 letter from March called for a \"deep and special partnership\" with the EU and \"a fair settlement of the U.K.'s rights and obligations as a departing member state.\"\n\nThe new Whitehall unit will ensure ambassadors and their teams are fully briefed on Brexit plans and empowered to reach out to their opposite numbers and other key influencers.\n\nTheir task will be made easier after the U.K. publishes up to 12 position papers, expected in the coming weeks, on crucial aspects of its EU strategy -- part of what officials are calling a \"big push\" to firm up and publicize the Brexit plan.\n\nRobin Niblett, director of the London-based foreign policy think tank Chatham House, said that the U.K. had neglected diplomacy in European capitals in recent years, and welcomed the move toward deeper engagement ahead of Brexit.\n\n\"During the last big push for 'Global Britain,' prior to Brexit, the government raised the number of British diplomats in India, China, the Gulf, while cutting back some of the human capacity in European capitals. Now the government is having to do some re-engineering to bring back that capability to prepare for the pointy end of the Brexit negotiation,\" he said.\n\n\"But the government has to be clear that we are negotiating with Brussels and that we do have clear ideas on everything from fisheries to farming to air traffic control, and on the whole negotiating position with the EU, right down to granular details.\"\n\nThe formation of the new unit is in part a victory for senior DExEU official Alex Ellis, a former ambassador to Brazil and European Commission staffer, who has long argued for greater openness and engagement over Brexit, according to the first official.\n\nEllis, who previously worked in the office of former European Commission President Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso, became a director general at DExEU in January. His push, supported by others within the Brexit department, for officials to have more contact with external parties such as foreign governments, businesses, and the media fell foul of No. 10's tight communications management prior to the June general election, the official said.\n\nA third former Whitehall official also said that the ambassador network had been under-used, and unable to feed into

For the long term, the UK wants either a customs border with checks reduced to the minimum, or a \"customs partnership\" without a formal border.\n\nHowever, under any of these three arrangements, London wants \"the ability to forge trade deals around the world\".\n\nHealy said that the UK's insistence on pursuing an independent trade policy \"amounts to a hard Brexit and is potentially very negative for Irish agriculture and the value of our agri-food exports\".\n\nThe customs border option, even with lighter checks, would be \"a very retrograde development for trade on the island of Ireland and between Ireland and Britain, after 45 years of EEC/EU integration,\" he commented.\n\nAny increase in low-cost food imports into the UK that would undermine the value of the UK market would have a devastating effect on the Irish agri-food sector\n\nThe \"customs partnership\" arrangement would not suit Ireland's agri-food industry either, Healy argued, because the UK wants to sign its own trade agreements allowing potentially cheaper food imports at the same time.\n\n\"Any increase in low-cost food imports into the UK that would undermine the value of the UK market would have a devastating effect on the Irish agri-food sector. The potential displacement of Irish food exports from the UK market will in turn destabilise the EU market balance,\" he said.\n\nInstead, the IFA wants the UK and the EU to conclude a free-trade agreement whereby no tariffs or additional checks would apply and the two markets would continue to negotiate trade deals with other partners as a bloc.\n\nForeign Affairs Minister Simon Coveney is expected to respond to the UK position on Wednesday.\n\nLooking forward to responding to UK BREXIT paper on Ireland tomorrow -

Over the past year, businesses have been providing policymakers with the evidence, ideas and solutions to make a success of Brexit.\n\n\"So it's encouraging to see that these papers propose a time-limited interim period and a customs system that is as barrier-free as possible.\n\n\"We at the CBI have always been clear that new ideas on crucial issues like this should be brought to the table quickly. But the clock is ticking and what matters now is giving companies the confidence to continue investing as quickly as possible.\"\n\nAnd focusing on the customs issues, Hardie said: \"Business wants to see as frictionless a customs system as possible, with a strong emphasis on digital systems that make it easier to trade.\n\n\"But to secure frictionless trade, negotiations on regulation, tariff and non-tariff barriers will have to take place. All efforts should be made to deliver a single-step transition, so that businesses don't have to adapt twice.\"", "id": "9238376", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-15", "title": "UK suggesting \"temporary customs union\" with EU", "image": null, "extractedDates": [{"imp": true, "textStart": 946, "date": "2017-08-15", "amb": false, "textEnd": 955}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-15", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 5, "id": "76", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Business"}, "id": "302720", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business"}, {"label": {"eng": "Politician"}, "id": "302954", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politician"}, {"label": {"eng": "Government"}, "id": "303023", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government"}, {"label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "id": "303064", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union"}, {"label": {"eng": "Trade"}, "id": "303410", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade"}, {"label": {"eng": "Government of the United Kingdom"}, "id": "304310", "score": 4, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_the_United_Kingdom"}, {"label": {"eng": "Customs"}, "id": "304875", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customs"}, {"label": {"eng": "Confederation of British Industry"}, "id": "315832", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confederation_of_British_Industry"}, {"label": {"eng": "Central Bureau of Investigation"}, "id": "327616", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Bureau_of_Investigation"}, {"label": {"eng": "Customs union"}, "id": "382637", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customs_union"}, {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom withdrawal from the European Union"}, "id": "1268836", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_withdrawal_from_the_European_Union"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 108, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 140, "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 147, "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Customer Management", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Customer_Management"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 269, "label": "dmoz/Business/International Business and Trade", "uri": "dmoz/Business/International_Business_and_Trade"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 270, "label": "dmoz/Business/International Business and Trade/Services", "uri": "dmoz/Business/International_Business_and_Trade/Services"}], "time": "08:45:00"}

It shows a lack of decisive leadership and it lowers our standing in the world.\n\n\"The big opportunity of Brexit, and sure there are technical things that need to be sorted out and that's where the detail comes in, is for us to be able to open ourselves up to do trade deals with the rest of the world.\"\n\nThe leading Brexiteer added: \"We have an American president in Donald Trump who is really keen as mustard to do a deal with us.\n\n\"Under the plan revealed by David Davis today, we would not be able to sign that trade deal until President Trump was nearing the end of his second term.\n\n\"This is not what we voted for - we voted to leave, not for transitional arrangements.\"\n\nAnd he added that he fears big business will seek to extend the initial transition period beyond the two years Mr Davis said it will last for.\n\nThe position paper released by the Brexit department was also criticised by the Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon - who called the position \"daft\".\n\nShe wrote on Twitter: \"Seems UK Government is back to its daft 'have cake and eat it' approach to Brexit. They should commit to staying in single market and CU, period.\"\n\nMeanwhile the Brexit Select Committee chairman said the Government's \"have their trade cake and eat it\" stance does not provide the certainty business needs.\n\nBut disagreeing with Mr Farage, Hilary Benn said ministers should consider staying in the European customs union for the long term.\n\nThe Labour MP said: \"Six months

He had previously appeared to suggest that we might remain in one of the two arrangements, as part of a softer Brexit.\n\nThe article is welcome for two reasons: it seems to be a deliberate attempt to demonstrate unity, after what at times has seemed like an alarming free-for-all in the Cabinet.\n\nIt ought to hardly need be said that ministers should speak publicly with a single voice, and air their disagreements privately. That this has not been happening is an illustration of the fact that Theresa May's ministers have no fear of her.

He may still be able to negotiate trade agreements to come into force at the end of the transition period, but the timescale puts key deals in serious jeopardy.\n\nFor example, whilst U.S. President Donald Trump has been an enthusiastic supporter of Brexit and pledged a \"very big, very powerful\" Anglo-American trade pact, the bulk of the U.S. political establishment -- as exemplified by Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton -- was hostile to Brexit, pledging to put Britain to \"the back of the queue\" for a trade deal in a show of solidarity with fellow globalists in Brussels.\n\nThe proposed transition agreement pushes such a deal well beyond the end of President Trump's current term of office, moving it down the list of the administration's priorities and leaving open the possibility that a new, globalist-minded administration could undo any provisional agreement.\n\nI warned of the great Brexit betrayal two weeks ago.

He's also been unafraid to team up with Labour MPs, despite his Conservative background, to fight on issues of civil liberty.\n\nIn fact, once he felt so strongly that he resigned from being an MP in order to raise awareness of civil liberty issues and the UK government's involvement in torture.\n\nConsidered a passionate eurosceptic, Davis has nonetheless been on both sides of the Brexit debate at one time or another.\n\nAt the divisive signing of the Maastricht treaty (the precursor to the EU as we know it) he acted as pro-EU prime minister John Major's chief whip.\n\nHowever, on the other hand, Davis has expressed anti-EU sentiment time and again. Essentially, Davis' opposition to the EU centres around his belief that Europe stagnates growth and trade for Britain. Writing for ConservativeHome, Davis outlines his opposition to the EU:\n\nEconomic growth on the continent has ground to a halt. Since the turn of the century, the EU has grown at a third of the rate of the global average, and the Eurozone has grown even more slowly than that. Europe's share of global GDP is falling, as is its share of global trade. This trend is expected to continue. When we last voted on our membership in 1975, trade with Europe was the vast majority of our total trade. This has fallen since then, and in 2008 the UK started to trade more with the rest of the world than with Europe. The fact is that Europe is becoming less and less important. The Euro has become a destroyer of jobs. Unemployment across the continent is running at almost 10 per cent, with youth unemployment double that at 20 per cent. For individual countries, these figures are even worse... Then there is the Schengen Zone. The passport-less travel area once held up as the pinnacle of European integration is crumbling before our very eyes. The migration crisis that has brought more than a million refugees to Europe's shores, with many more expected to come, is a stake in the heart of a borderless Europe... From the faulty European Arrest Warrant, that has led to innocent Brits being detained for months overseas in terrible conditions without trial, to the slow steady creep of the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice, we are increasingly finding that our justice system is incompatible with the one on the continent. So the problems facing the EU are mounting up. Economic stagnation, high debt, high unemployment, high regulation, ineffective foreign policy and failing internal policies.\n\nEssentially, there are few areas of the EU that Davis doesn't hold in contempt.\n\nHowever, despite numerous oppositions to the European Court of Human Rights, he has also suggested he wishes the UK to remain within its jurisdiction.\n\nHe suggests that to leave the ECHR would encourage other countries with worse human rights records to do so too.\n\nWhile Theresa May and the rest of her cabinet (led by Davis) have been involved in working out general negotiating positions for Brexit, it is Davis who'll do the bulk of the actual negotiating.\n\nIt is him who'll be sitting down with EU leaders to hammer out the specifics of any deals between Britain and the EU.\n\nIn an article on ConservativeHome, Davis laid out some general policy positions:\n\nOf course, as it stands, much of the negotiating is going on behind closed doors but we know that the general plan is to pull the UK out of the single market and the EU custom's union, even during a transitional phase between Brexit and fully leaving the EU.", "id": "9187151", "details": {}, "date":

The ISU objected to the race on the grounds it would attract gamblers. The skaters complained the ISU was abusing its dominant position over skating, restricting their professional opportunities and limiting the sport's reach. Nicholas Hirst reports European Commissioner for Competition Margrethe Vestager has taken a personal interest in the case, telling one of the skaters on Twitter: \"I will look into the matter.\"\n\nCOUNCIL -- EU AGREES ON COMMON LINE OVER NORTH KOREA: Jacopo Barigazzi has this analysis for Playbook of Monday's meeting of diplomats in the Political and Security Committee: EU security officials on Monday approved a common EU line on North Korea's nuclear arsenal escalation, as part of the bloc's efforts to play a diplomatic role in the crisis. \"There's a urgent need for de-escalation,\" said EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini in a statement released after the meeting. Mogherini added the EU is ready to \"consider further appropriate measures\" in line with the U.N. Security Council.\n\nThe EU will convey its message on the crisis \"by reaching out to the Republic of Korea, the United States, China, Russia and Japan, as well as the DPRK,\" the statement continued, a nod to the long-stalled \"six-party talks\" -- the regional format favored by Beijing. But the EU won't seek a bigger role in the crisis as, for example, a mediator, officials told Jacopo -- that wasn't even on the meeting's agenda.\n\nMIGRATION -- LIBYA CROSSINGS DOWN IN JULY: Frontex, the EU's border agency, confirmed the number of migrants arriving in Italy across the central Mediterranean route fell by 57 percent in July compared to the previous month, the lowest level since 2014.\n\nMerkel says no to linking EU funds to receiving refugees: Rejecting the proposal made by SPD leader Martin Schulz to only disburse EU funds to countries that accept migrants, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said: \"This is not the European solidarity that I am imagining.\"\n\nItaly feels abandoned by Europe: \"Italy is contributing, but we cannot cope with this burden alone,\" said Angelino Alfano, Italy's foreign minister, before acknowledging \"the only solution\" to ensuring fewer migrants reach Italy \"is in Libya.\"\n\nBREXIT CORNER ...\n\nUK sets out Brexit customs plan: In the first of up to 12 position papers to be published before the October Council summit, the U.K. government laid out two options for a \"close association\" with the EU in customs matters during a transition period, confirming the country will leave the customs union.\n\nThe first option would see it manage a new customs border with the EU, unilaterally simplifying requirements on EU goods entering the country as much as possible and providing border \"facilitations\" to reduce and remove trade barriers. Under the second option, the U.K. and EU would negotiate a \"new customs partnership,\" aligning their approaches to customs -- an option which, the DExEU briefing said, would negate the need for a customs border.\n\nBritish business to lobby Brussels over need for transition: A senior U.K. business leader told POLITICO industry will start pushing EU Brexit negotiators to accelerate talks over a transitional period in a bid to stop companies from going over a cliff-edge.\n\nNorwegian PM cautious about UK membership of EFTA: Norway's Prime Minister Erna Solberg, who is facing a tough election battle, told Reuters the U.K. may find membership of the European Free Trade Area challenging, even during a transition period. \"There would be a cost they would have to share, and an authority outside their border that could impose binding decisions on them, which is not entirely in line with what they've said they want,\" said Solberg.\n\nCorbyn bets on Brexit fatigue: Britain's Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has made a success of mostly ignoring Brexit and choosing instead to focus his energy (and campaigning) on public services. But with the party readying for its annual September conference and Brexit negotiations heating up, Labour MPs told Annabelle Dickson and Charlie Cooper that internal disputes over membership of the single market and whether or not to promise a second referendum on the terms of the Brexit deal will reach boiling point.\n\nBrexiteers take on Hammond: Pro-Brexit campaign group Leave.EU called on supporters to pressure the local Conservative Party to ditch Chancellor Philip Hammond as its candidate at the next election, saying he is plotting to stop Brexit, Reuters reports. \"He is part of a cabal of Westminster MPs who believe that if they can delay exit, they can overturn the wishes of the 52 percent who despite threats from the political classes drew upon the courage of their conviction at the ballot box,\" said Leave.EU Chairman Arron Banks in a letter sent to voters in Hammond's constituency.\n\nUK -- THERESA MAY TO VISIT JAPAN AUGUST 30: The British PM will discuss defense and security cooperation as well as trade and investment opportunities with her counterpart Shinz\u014d Abe on her three-day visit.\n\nGERMAN ELECTION PRIORITIES ...\n\nThings that won't be raised and won't happen during the German election campaign ...\n\nEnergy prices: German household power prices, some of the highest in Europe (after Denmark), reached a record high in early 2017, despite the fact wholesale prices are sinking. For the average four-person household, annual prices vary by as much as almost \u20ac470. Meanwhile, Merkel's Energiewende (a shift to complete reliance on renewable energy by 2050), which the chancellor unilaterally announced in 2011, still needs infrastructure that saves wind energy, links the northern (windy) parts of Germany to the (non-windy) southern regions, and makes the renewables sector competitive.\n\nNord Stream 2: Merkel's conservative bloc and her Social Democrat one-time allies, now opponents, want to steer clear of discussions of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which would deliver Russian gas to Germany. Ever since Merkel became chancellor in November 2005, she has supported what she has dubbed a purely \"commercial project.\" Forget the fact former SPD Chancellor Gerhard Schr\u00f6der took a job with Gazprom weeks after he lost the election to Merkel in 2005, is now a big-shot in Nord Stream 2 and has just joined the board of Rosneft, Russia's state-owned oil giant.\n\nDieselgate: The Dieselgate scandal won't get a look-in in any serious way either -- all the established parties are too connected to the car industry. Americans who bought German diesel cars will be compensated, Europeans won't, at least not for now. In the meantime, forget about trying to resell your diesel auto in Germany.\n\nDigitization: Merkel likes to talk about the issue but only at industry fora. Everyone know what it means for jobs, education and migration policy. Take a look at this report by McKinsey: \"Germany ... lacks large-scale consumer tech companies and online business-transaction platforms to rival global giants such as Apple, Alphabet and Alibaba. As a result, Germany runs a digital services trade deficit with the United States of over 4 percent of total services trade.\"\n\nCampaigning: Forget about leaflets and door-to-door canvasing. In my dozen or so years here, not one candidate knocked on the door, and the only party to drop a leaflet in my letterbox was the far-right NPD.\n\nMerkel rules out coalition: \"Since there are no natural coalitions, everyone is now fighting for themselves,\" German Chancellor Angela Merkel told Deutschlandfunk.\n\nSPD say Merkel wants to join Trump's weapons madness: The September federal election will be \"a vote on whether Germany remains a peaceful power or joins Trump's weapons madness,\" said Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel. Like Trump, Merkel's Christian Democrats \"want to put all their money into weapons and cut social spending,\" he said. The chancellor's position to \"practically voluntarily bend over and promise to double the German military budget after the Bundestag election is nothing less than a sign to Trump that they will give in to his pressure.\"\n\nPOLAND -- PiS WANTS WAR REPARATIONS: Poland's Law and Justice (PiS) party sure knows how to needle Germany. PiS leader Jaros\u0142aw Kaczy\u0144ski said at a convention in July that Poland never received compensation for the massive war damages it suffered in World War II, losses which \"we have really still not made up for.\" PiS deputy Arkadiusz Mularczyk said a report from parliamentary experts on whether Poland can claim reparations from Germany should be ready by the middle of August and would then be handed to the government. He added that seeking war reparations from Germany was a \"moral duty.\" Polish Foreign Minister Witold Waszczykowski said in a weekend interview: \"Today we have powerful ... opposition against raising this issue at all in talks with Germany.\" Germany's next foreign minister, you've been warned.\n\nFRANCE -- MACRON CHOOSES MARSEILLE FOR HIS SUMMER HOLIDAY: Emmanuel Macron will spend his time off in August in Marseille. Politically, the choice makes sense -- the president is following his own order to his ministers to remain within a few hours of Paris through the summer break. But more than that, it represents a major vote of confidence in a city with a growing reputation as an ideal weekend getaway, and a sunny foil to Paris' seriousness, writes Nicholas Vinocur.\n\nAUSTRIA -- SP\u00d6 CAMPAIGN ADVISER ARRESTED IN ISRAEL: Austria's governing Social Democrats (SP\u00d6) terminated their relationship with Tal Silberstein, a key election adviser, on Monday after reports emerged he was allegedly the subject of a money-laundering investigation in Israel.\n\nSLOVAKIA -- FICO TO MEET COALITION PARTNERS: Attempts to reach a new agreement between the three parties making up Slovakia's Smer-led government are set to continue today when Prime Minister Robert Fico meets leaders of the Slovak National Party and Most-H\u00edd, the country's ethnic Hungarian party.\n\nSERBIA -- KOSOVO DIVISION? Ivica Da\u010di\u0107, Serbia's foreign minister, in an article in state-owned newspaper Vecernje Novosti Sunday suggested that in order to avoid future conflict, what belongs to Serbs and Albanians in Kosovo should be divided up, although he did not explain what this might mean in practice. He said an Association of Serbian Municipalities should be established in the south of Kosovo, similar to the one already due to be set up in the mainly Serb north under the EU-mediated agreement between Belgrade and Pristina. To ensure the security of Serbian Orthodox churches in Kosovo, Da\u010di\u0107 proposed the creation of \"independent monastic communities,\" which would have a certain degree of territorial autonomy.\n\nWestern powers put pressure on Kosovo MPs: Attempts to elect a new speaker in Pristina have failed four times due to many MPs not showing up to vote.

This would free the UK from the bloc's rules and restrictions, like the one that requires trade deals to be negotiated by Brussels on behalf of member states. Considering Britain's desire to sign its own trade deals to bolster its economy post-Brexit, it could emphasize its differences to the EU as part of the negotiations.\n\nBrussels is expected to push back on Chinese takeovers of European companies in key areas such as infrastructure and manufacturing by pushing for more \"rigorous screening,\" according to the Financial Times (paywall). This is after months of reports that the EU and US have been fretting about China gaining a technological edge by taking over key companies abroad.\n\nWith Britain heading towards a \"hard Brexit,\" it will be pretty desperate for new trade deals to replace the ones it benefited from as a member of the EU. Prime Minister Theresa May has dispatched key members of her cabinet around the world for talks, pledging to seal its trade deals (pay wall) as soon as possible with major economies.\n\nEven if the EU makes it harder for China to seal deals, there are obstacles for Britain to overcome when it comes to convincing China to give it more attention. The uncertainty about the effects of Brexit has dampened GDP growth, and the potential destabilizing impact of a \"hard Brexit\" (paywall) may put off investors from sinking money into the economy in the future.\n\nBut China appears to have a strong appetite for investing in Britain. Even when its ambassador to UK government grumbled about its $20 billion-plus nuclear power deal being put on hold (it is partly financed by a Chinese consortium), he also noted that \"I hope the UK will keep its door open to China\" (paywall).\n\nChina is the sixth-largest investor in Britain, according to Grant Thornton. London, in particular, has been the destination for large-scale investments, including China's CC Land buying the iconic \"Cheesegrater\" skyscraper for \u00a31 billion ($1.29 billion) earlier this year.\n\nThere are some suggestions that Chinese investors are taking a breather while they see how Brexit talks shape up.

As part of the Board's Brussels visit, INTA is organizing a \"Government Relations Program\" dedicated to IP in Europe on September 11. This program will feature speakers from various EU institutions, officials from third countries, and brand owners. The objective is for government officials to brief and exchange views with the Board on the current hot topics and future policy and regulatory trends of relevance to brand owners.\n\nThe program will be followed by an \"INTA Partners in Europe\" cocktail reception, aimed at providing Board members with an opportunity to network with EU and third-country officials, Brussels-based associations and stakeholders, brand owners' representatives in Brussels, and of course local INTA members.\n\n41.3 Million Fake Goods Seized by EU Customs in 2016\n\nAs reported in a recent INTA blog post, on July 20, the European Commission - Directorate-General for Taxation and Customs (DG TAXUD) published its annual report on customs enforcement of intellectual property rights (IPRs) at EU borders.\n\nThere were 63,000 detentions in 2016 (81,000 in 2015), for a total of 41.3 million articles (43.7 million in 2015) seized, representing a value of more than EUR 672 million (EUR 640 million in 2015). IPR infringements in general, and counterfeiting in particular, remains a wide and important phenomenon even though customs' performance at tackling it seemed to have improved (the number of intercepted articles rose by 2 percent compared to 2015).\n\nThis report is a statistics-based document covering the year 2016 and does not entail any policy or political recommendation. It is mainly aimed at feeding information to customs authorities to ultimately help them better understand their shortcomings and areas of improvements with regards to customs enforcement of IP rights.\n\nFor more information on INTA's anticounterfeiting activities in Europe and how you can be involved, please contact Maysa Razavi, INTA's Advisor on Anticounterfeiting, at mrazavi@inta.org.\n\nAlthough every effort has been made to verify the accuracy of items in the INTA Bulletin, readers are urged to check independently on matters of specific concern or interest.\n\n\u00a9 2017 International Trademark Association", "id": "9315224", "details": {"liCnt": 7}, "date": "2017-08-15", "title": "Europe Office Keeps Busy with Brexit, Board Meetings, and Counterfeits", "image": null, "extractedDates": [{"imp": true, "textStart": 82, "amb": false, "textEnd": 91, "freq": 2, "date": "2017-08-28"}, {"imp": true, "textStart": 306, "date": "2017-07-17", "amb": false, "textEnd": 313}, {"imp": true, "textStart": 1186, "date": "2017-07-27", "amb": false, "textEnd": 1193}, {"imp": true, "textStart": 1675, "date": "2017-09-11", "amb": false, "textEnd": 1687}, {"imp": true, "textStart": 2389, "date": "2017-07-20", "amb": false, "textEnd": 2396}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-15", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 5, "id": "76", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 3, "id": "86522", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "Kingdom of Belgium"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Brussels"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 5, "id": "102303", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brussels", "label": {"eng": "Brussels"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": null, "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 3, "id": "112932", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Euro"}, "id": "302536", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro"}, {"label": {"eng": "Brand"}, "id": "302722", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brand"}, {"location": null, "score": 3, "id": "303048", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "id": "303064", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union"}, {"label": {"eng": "European Commission"}, "id": "303458", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Commission"}, {"label": {"eng": "European Parliament"}, "id": "303907", "score": 4, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Parliament"}, {"label": {"eng": "Counterfeit"}, "id": "304784", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counterfeit"}, {"label": {"eng": "Lobbying"}, "id": "304969", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lobbying"}, {"label": {"eng": "Internal market"}, "id": "305938", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_market"}, {"label": {"eng": "Institutions of the European Union"}, "id": "309183", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institutions_of_the_European_Union"}, {"label": {"eng": "Trademark"}, "id": "310149", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trademark"}, {"label": {"eng": "Citizenship of the European Union"}, "id": "311961", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizenship_of_the_European_Union"}, {"label": {"eng": "Intellectual property"}, "id": "313700", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellectual_property"}, {"label": {"eng": "Intellectual Property Office (United Kingdom)"}, "id": "563737", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellectual_Property_Office_(United_Kingdom)"}, {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom withdrawal from the European Union"}, "id": "1268836", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_withdrawal_from_the_European_Union"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 41, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 123, "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 139, "label": "dmoz/Society/Government", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Government"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 140, "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 319, "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Services", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Services"}], "time": "16:15:00"}

has never been this explicit about how she could quit the party over Brexit.\n\nIt comes as a joint statement from Chancellor Philip Hammond and International Trade Secretary Liam Fox ruled out Britain staying in the EU customs union, even as part of a transitional deal.\n\nSoubry has previously said that a good Brexit deal would have to involve the UK staying in the customs union.\n\nPerseid meteors bring stunning shower of shooting stars across the UK\n\nAnd James Chapman, who was a special adviser to George Osborne and then later to David Davis, claimed last week that

The Government wants to leave the EU customs union but then replicate it. Ministers insist that free movement will end in 2019, but say that EU nationals will still be able to come to the UK.\n\nIrish citizens will continue to enjoy free movement as the Government seeks to recreate the existing soft border on the island after Brexit. Despite Theresa May's notoriously tough stance on immigration, the Government said there was \"no question of new immigration checks operating between Northern Ireland and Ireland\". Its position paper published on Wednesday raised lots of questions about how to stop migrants getting into Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK via Ireland but provided few answers.\n\nThe proposed two-year transitional phase after the UK leaves the EU in 2019 gives the Government a breathing space to bring some sense to its wider immigration policy. Officially, May remains wedded to the discredited target to reduce net migration below 100,000 a year. But I have never known a government policy supported by so few members of the Government. It is May's target; her ministers barely pay lip service to it.\n\nBrexit Secretary: UK wants temporary EU customs deal\n\nAmber Rudd, the Home Secretary, did not even mention the target when she belatedly asked the independent Migration Advisory Committee to review EU migration last month. It might have been better if Rudd had asked these experts to look at the target, since they might well have buried it for good.\n\nAnother nail was hammered in its coffin by Ruth Davidson, the impressive leader of the Scottish Conservatives. \"The time for easy slogans is over,\" she wrote in The Daily Telegraph last week. \"We have to ask whether the target is the right one.\" She joined calls for overseas students to be taken out of the migration figures. Again, it is only May's obstinacy which prevents her ministers doing so.\n\nI have been writing about the \"tens of thousands\" goal as part of the Drop the Target campaign by The Independent and the Open Britain group, which urges a soft Brexit. It is nice to see we are not alone. The Sun, not always a bastion of liberal values, welcomed Davidson's important intervention, saying in an editorial that the target \"is a random, nonsense figure, probably impossible to achieve without damaging the economy.\"\n\nIt was going to be hard for whoever followed May at the Home Office but Rudd is now making her own mark. She struck a conciliatory tone when launching the review, hinting that free movement would continue at least for the transitional period. Rudd seems to have formed a highly significant alliance with Davidson, whom she met privately in Glasgow recently. The Scottish Tory leader would probably back Rudd to also succeed May in Downing Street. (My sources tell me Davidson will not be running Jacob Rees-Mogg's leadership campaign).\n\nMay clings to the migration target as an insurance policy against claims that she is not delivering on the demand for more control over immigration in last year's EU referendum. But there is new evidence that she might not be as in tune with the mood of the country as she thinks.\n\nIn pictures: European Parliament Brexit discussions 12 show all In pictures: European Parliament Brexit discussions 1/12\n\nEuropean commission member in charge of Brexit negotiations with Britain, French Michel Barnier listens at the President of the European Commission Jean-Claude Juncker speaking at the European Parliament in Strasbourg\n\nGetty Images\n\n2/12\n\nFrank-Walter Steinmeier, President of the Federal Republic of Germany, delivers his speech at the European Parliament in Strasbourg\n\nEPA\n\n3/12\n\nEuropean Union's chief Brexit negotiator Guy Verhofstadt, President of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe (ALDE), addresses the European Parliament during a debate on Brexit priorities and the upcomming talks on the UK's withdrawal from the EU\n\nReuters\n\n4/12\n\nMichel Barnier, European Chief Negotiator for Brexit reacts during a meeting at the European Parliament in Strasbourg\n\nEPA\n\n5/12\n\nMember of the European Parliament and former leader of the anti-EU UK Independence Party (UKIP) Nigel Farage wears socks with Union Jack flag at the European Parliament in Strasbourg\n\nGetty Images\n\n6/12\n\nNigel Farage, United Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP) member and MEP, addresses the European Parliament during a debate on Brexit priorities and the upcoming talks on the UK's withdrawal from the EU\n\nReuters\n\n7/12\n\nEuropean commission member in charge of Brexit negotiations with Britain, French Michel Barnier gestures during speeches at the European Parliament in Strasbourg\n\nGetty\n\n8/12\n\nThe President of the European Commission Jean-Claude Juncker (L) speaks with European commission member in charge of Brexit negotiations with Britain, French Michel Barnier at the European Parliament in Strasbourg\n\nGetty\n\n9/12\n\nEuropean Union's chief Brexit negotiator Guy Verhofstadt, President of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe (ALDE), addresses the European Parliament during a debate on Brexit priorities and the upcomming talks on the UK's withdrawal from the EU\n\nReuters\n\n10/12\n\nGetty\n\n11/12\n\nGerman president Frank-Walter Steinmeier delivers a speech during a plenary session at the European Parliament in Strasbourg\n\nGetty Images\n\n12/12\n\nThe European Parliament in Strasbourg, eastern France\n\nGetty Images\n\nThe British Future think tank and HOPE Not Hate campaign have visited the first 24 towns and cities of 60 where their \"National Conversation\" is holding citizens' panels. Anyone can contribute via an online survey (www.nationalconversation.org.uk). It is part of a wide-ranging inquiry into immigration by the Commons Home Affairs Select Committee, which is aiming to find common ground in an often polarised debate.\n\nThe group discussions so far show that most people have a balanced view of immigration: there are concerns about pressures on schools, the NHS and housing, neighbourhood decline and the enforcement of immigration rules but also recognition of the benefits. Even people worried about the impact of low-skilled EU migration in their area accept the economy needs immigration. Many acknowledge that migrants keep the NHS going. While some people worry about numbers, there is support for the level of migration to remain about the same.\n\nThe findings suggest that politicians would do well to follow Davidson's lead by spelling out the national economic benefits of migration in order to put the local pressures in context. But after feelings were whipped up by the Leave campaign last year, few Conservatives are willing to make the case.\n\nBrexit is the right time to press the re-set button on immigration. There should indeed be a national conversation about both the pressures caused by immigration and its benefits. In place of an arbitrary target that ministers admit privately will not be hit, a forward-looking new policy should be driven by the needs of the economy rather than by the politicians' need for a headline.\n\nMore about: Brexit Customs Union transitional deal EU immigration Reuse content", "id": "9496229", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-16", "title": "Theresa May's immigration target is

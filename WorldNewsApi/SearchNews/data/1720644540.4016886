{"id": 231220002, "title": "Mahan: The answer to solving San Jose&#8217;s homeless problem? All of the above", "text": "Despite billions and billions in spending, no city in California has yet to adequately address the homelessness crisis. We can \u2014 and must \u2014 make San Jose the first. We can, because we know what\u2019s working. For years, we failed to prioritize immediate, safe alternatives to life on our streets and in our creeks. Recently we\u2019ve decided not to let the perfect be the enemy of the good. And it\u2019s paying off. Since implementing our all-of-the-above approach, we\u2019re seeing rates of unsheltered homelessness go down. San Jose has shown that there isn\u2019t just one solution to homelessness, because there are many causes of homelessness. Some people struggling with an addiction or mental illness aren\u2019t ready to live in a permanent affordable housing unit on their own. Many survivors of domestic violence won\u2019t ever feel safe in a congregate shelter. Most of our chronically homeless neighbors need time to reacclimate to living indoors before they\u2019re ready for a place of their own. A few of our most vulnerable residents simply need help getting a plane ride home to family. But no one can turn their lives around while living in a tent along the creek. It\u2019s profoundly difficult to apply for a job without regular access to showers and laundry. And to try to address mental illness alone without counseling, access to medication or regular support is close to impossible. The point is that we can embrace the entire spectrum of solutions that work \u2014 from safe sleeping sites and treatment centers to tiny homes and affordable housing. It isn\u2019t one or the other, it\u2019s all the above, monitored with clear metrics and a relentless focus on results. And this year, we don\u2019t have a choice in the matter. We must invest in faster approaches, because recent regulatory mandates mean monumental penalties if we don\u2019t eliminate pollution entering our waterways \u2014 88% of which comes from people living in unmanaged, unsheltered conditions along our waterways. We must invest in public dashboards and reporting as advised by the state auditor so that our community knows exactly where their tax dollars are going and how their investments are leading to better outcomes on homelessness. Gov. Gavin Newsom said he\u2019s no longer going to fund failure \u2014 it\u2019s time we showed him what success looks like. Our back-to-basics budget this year will construct over 600 tiny homes, create safe-sleeping sites with capacity for 500 homeless neighbors, open a new safe-parking site to move 100 lived-in vehicles off our streets, help more homeless residents return home to their families, and keep investing in programs that pay our homeless neighbors to clean up our streets and invest in their job skills as they work toward a better life. It also continues the homelessness prevention program that has kept 3,900 households from falling into homelessness. We have no other choice than to make the right choice to clear encampments along our waterways and get people into dignified shelter. If we don\u2019t, our city attorney warns, we could face penalties of up to $66,000 per day per pollutant. We don\u2019t have enough money in our city budget to do everything. And we won\u2019t have money to do anything if we spend all our dollars settling litigation for a crisis we should have taken more seriously decades ago. But we do have enough to quickly transition homeless residents into safe and decent shelter. And that\u2019s why we\u2019re proposing to make the most strategic investment in ending unsheltered homelessness in the history of our city.

It effectively undermines the negotiations and indicates a serious moral failure.\"\n\nTheir allegation came while Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu - whose critics have accused him of prolonging the war - is in Washington for talks Thursday with US President Joe Biden.\n\nA senior US administration official said on Wednesday that negotiations on a Gaza deal were in the last stretch and that Biden would try to close some \"final gaps\" with Netanyahu.\n\nThursday's military announcement came after two Israeli communities, Nir Oz and Nir Yitzhak, said in separate statements late on Wednesday that the army had recovered the bodies of Goren and Goldin.\n\n\"Last night, we were informed that in a military rescue operation, the body of the late Maya Goren was recovered,\" the Nir Oz kibbutz community said, adding that her family had been informed.\n\nKibbutz Nir Yitzhak said the army had returned Goldin's body.\n\n\"This evening, we were informed about the rescue operation for the late Oren Goldin, a member of the kibbutz emergency team, who fell on October 7\" during the attack by Hamas militants, Nir Yitzhak said.", "source": {"uri": "newarab.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New Arab"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hostage", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hostage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_fedayeen", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Palestinian fedayeen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Israel Defense Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khan_Yunis", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Khan Yunis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Khan Yunis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_of_Israel", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cabinet of Israel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceasefire", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ceasefire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nir_Yitzhak", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nir Yitzhak"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kibbutz", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kibbutz"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Izz_ad-Din_al-Qassam_Brigades", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Netanyahu", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Benjamin Netanyahu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Israel", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of Israel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabotage", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sabotage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agence_France-Presse", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Agence France-Presse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nir_Oz", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nir Oz"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nir Oz"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://www.newarab.com/sites/default/files/styles/600x338/public/2162683603.jpeg?h=199d8c1f&itok=CoJ-oz7k", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9760941", "eventUri": "eng-9760941", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-10-07", "textStart": 188, "textEnd": 197, "freq": 3}], "sentiment": -0.4196078431372549, "wgt": 205, "relevance": 1}

Aid groups have lamented that Israel has occasionally struck the area, despite telling Gaza residents they would be safer there. There was no immediate response from Hamas.\n\nIsrael has been carrying out a new operation in Khan Younis this week, using tanks and fighter jets to strike what it has described as Hamas infrastructure in the southern Gaza city. Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari, the Israeli military spokesperson, told reporters the renewed offensive aimed in part to \"enable the operation\" to retrieve the bodies.\n\nDozens of people have been killed during the Israeli assault on Khan Younis, the Gaza Health Ministry has reported. Many also fled their homes as the Israeli bombardment intensified, while others elected to stay, hoping they would be safer in their houses than in tents. Hagari said Israeli forces had killed \"many terrorists.\"\n\nThe five people whose bodies were recovered -- Maya Goren, 56; Tomer Ahimas, 20; Kiril Brodski, 19; Oren Goldin, 33; and Ravid Katz, 51 -- were killed during the Hamas-led attacks on Oct. 7 and were taken back to Gaza to be held as bargaining chips, Israeli officials said. They are considered hostages by the Israeli government.\n\nBrodski and Ahimas were soldiers who fell during the attacks, while the other three were civilians.\n\nGoren was a teacher from Nir Oz, one of the hardest-hit communities near the Gaza border; her husband was also killed on Oct. 7. Katz, also from Nir Oz, was a father of three children. The body of Goldin, a member of a nearby village's civil response squad, was taken, along with that of his brother-in-law Tal Haimi, whose body is still in Gaza.\n\nThe Israeli military said that intelligence -- including information from detained Palestinian militants -- had guided forces to the tunnel.\n\nMore than 250 people were abducted during the Hamas-led attack on Oct. 7, according to Israel, and 105 were released during a brief cease-fire in November. Israeli officials say 115 hostages remain in Gaza, including about 40 who are presumed dead.\n\nThe return home of the hostages' remains in body bags added to the domestic political pressure on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to end the war, even as he was visiting Washington and in a speech to Congress gave a full-throated defense of Israel's military operations in Gaza.\n\n\"The war in Gaza could end tomorrow if Hamas surrenders, disarms, and returns all the hostages,\" Netanyahu said during his address to Congress on Wednesday. \"But if they don't, Israel will fight until we destroy Hamas's military capabilities and its rule in Gaza and bring all our hostages home.\"\n\nNetanyahu did not refer to the current proposal backed by the Biden administration and the UN Security Council. Under that deal, Israel would ultimately agree to a permanent cease-fire with Hamas and withdraw its forces from Gaza in exchange for the release of all hostages.\n\nNissim Kalderon, whose brother Ofer was abducted on Oct. 7, accused Netanyahu of hesitating to reach a deal for political reasons. Netanyahu's coalition government depends on hard-line parties who support permanent Israeli control of Gaza, effectively ruling out a cease-fire with Hamas.\n\n\"I expected, hoped, wished that you would open your speech with 'We have a signed deal.' But again and again, you're not doing what you should have done 292 days ago,\" Kalderon said at a rally in Tel Aviv on Wednesday night. \"Bring your citizens home.\"\n\nAt least six Israeli relatives of hostages were arrested in the House gallery by Capitol Police during Netanyahu's speech as they wore bright yellow T-shirts calling on him to reach an agreement to free their loved ones.", "source": {"uri": "bostonglobe.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Boston Globe"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_City", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gaza City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel Defense Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hostage", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hostage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khan_Yunis", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Khan Yunis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Khan Yunis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Admiral", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Admiral"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarian_aid", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Humanitarian aid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rocket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tank", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nir_Oz", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nir Oz"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nir Oz"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_fedayeen", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Palestinian fedayeen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceasefire", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ceasefire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Netanyahu", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Benjamin Netanyahu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Gaza_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2014 Gaza War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalition_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coalition government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Capitol", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Capitol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Nations Security Council"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tel_Aviv", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tel Aviv"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tel Aviv"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://bostonglobe-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/dDZpPFdtzR2-xn6TNS2pC84bWJI=/506x0/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/bostonglobe/USYOILCSQNI377QAHHYZKPCKEU.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9760941", "eventUri": "eng-9760941", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-10-07", "textStart": 1170, "textEnd": 1176, "freq": 4}], "sentiment": -0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 181, "relevance": 1}

We will not stop fighting for the return of everyone.\"\n\nThe development came days after the IDF confirmed the deaths of two Hamas hostages in Gaza.\n\nAlex Dancyg and Yagev Buchshtab were abducted into Gaza on Oct. 7 and the IDF said Monday that the terrorist organization was in possession of their bodies.", "source": {"uri": "thenewstribune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The News Tribune"}, "authors": [{"uri": "darryl_coote@thenewstribune.com", "name": "Darryl Coote", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shin_Bet", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Shin Bet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_enclaves", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Palestinian enclaves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kibbutz", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kibbutz"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_operation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Military operation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Israel Defense Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Press_International", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Press International"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khan_Yunis", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Khan Yunis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Khan Yunis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Gaza_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2014 Gaza War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IDF_Spokesperson's_Unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "IDF Spokesperson's Unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hostage", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hostage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Subcultures/Urban_Primitive", "label": "dmoz/Society/Subcultures/Urban Primitive", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Bodyart/Image_Galleries", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Bodyart/Image Galleries", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 48}], "image": "https://www.mcclatchy-wires.com/incoming/v9ksw6/picture290407664/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/00ef65a1-e56f-45e9-a629-ec845f968c59", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9760941", "eventUri": "eng-9760941", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-24", "textStart": 0, "textEnd": 7}, {"amb": false, "date": "-10-07", "textStart": 439, "textEnd": 445, "freq": 4}], "sentiment": -0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 179, "relevance": 1}

Kiril Brodski, 19, and Staff Sgt. Tomer Yaakov Ahimas, 20, were all previously declared dead in absentia.\n\nIsraeli forces located their remains during an operation in Khan Younis. The IDF began a major operation on Monday to root out a Hamas resurgence in the southern Gaza city.\n\nAccording to a joint IDF and Israel Security Agency statement, troops obtained intelligence on the whereabouts of the bodies through interrogation of Palestinian terrorists.\n\nThe ISA on Thursday afternoon released images from the operation to recover the bodies.\n\n\"It's hard to describe in words how an operation of this kind feels. The sense of responsibility, the magnitude of the moment, the understanding of the importance of the task, everything boils down to one moment when you realize you've arrived at the right place,\" an ISA agent who participated in the operation said.\n\nIsraeli President Isaac Herzog on Thursday expressed gratitude to the security forces for their \"determination and courage.\"\n\n\"It is our duty to bring them all home -- those who are alive, and those who we must return for burial in Israel,\" Herzog said, adding: \"May the memories of Ravid, Oren, Maya, Tomer and Kiril be blessed.\"\n\nGoren, a kindergarten teacher, was taken from her home as thousands of terrorists infiltrated the border on Oct. 7 and slaughtered 1,200 people, including her husband, Avner Goren. His body is still being held by Hamas.\n\nThe Israeli military confirmed on Dec. 1 that Maya Goren was killed in Hamas captivity, without providing details on the circumstances of her death.\n\nThe couple is survived by their four children -- Assif, 25, Bar, 23, Gal, 21, and Dekel, 18. Bar and Dekel were in Kibbutz Nir Oz when Hamas attacked but survived, while Asif and Gal were staying elsewhere.\n\nMaya Goren was also the teacher of 1-year-old Kfir Bibas, the youngest Israeli hostage, who has been in Hamas captivity for almost 300 days.\n\nOren Goldin, a mechanic and member of Kibbutz Nir Yitzhak's civilian defense team, was killed on Oct. 7.\n\nIn a statement released on Wednesday night, the kibbutz said: \"Oren was the first to leave that damn morning, even before we knew how serious the danger lurking outside. In November, about a month and a half in which we were hoping for a sign of life, we were informed that Oren was killed on 7/10, and his body was being held captive.\n\n\"For almost 10 months, we read and wished for the day when his body would be brought to Israel and we would be able to bury him in the home he loved so much, Kibbutz Nir Yitzhak.\"\n\nGoldin is survived by his wife, Oshrit Masala, and their 2-year-old twins, Aviv and Ilay; his parents, Adi and Yair; and his siblings, Rani and Shai.\n\nRavid Katz was a member of the Kibbutz Nir Oz security team who fell fighting Palestinian terrorists on Oct. 7.\n\nHis wife and baby survived the assault, after hiding in their home for hours.\n\nKatz's death was confirmed on Nov. 28.\n\nKiril Brodski and Tomer Ahimas were killed in Kibbutz Nirim on Oct. 7 while battling terrorists alongside IDF Col. Asaf Hamami, the commander of the Gaza Division's Southern Brigade. The bodies of all three were taken to the Palestinian enclave.\n\nBrodski and Ahimas were both declared dead in November.\n\nThe IDF's decision to re-enter Khan Younis this week was driven by new intelligence on the existence of undiscovered Hamas tunnels in the area, as well as an uptick in rocket attacks.\n\nThe IDF informed Gaza residents on Monday that it was about to enter the city, and called on the remaining population of eastern Khan Younis to move to the newly adjusted humanitarian zone, using text messages, phone calls and Arabic-language media broadcasts.\n\nSince the IDF's withdrawal from the area in April, Hamas has been working to reconstruct munitions production centers and reestablish its operational capabilities.\n\nIsraeli authorities estimate that 111 of the 251 hostages taken by Hamas on Oct. 7 remain in Gaza, including the bodies of 39 who have been confirmed dead by the IDF.\n\nHamas is also holding Israeli citizens Avera Mengistu and Hisham al-Sayed, who crossed into Gaza separately and on their own accord a decade ago; as well as the bodies of two IDF soldiers, Oron Shaul and Hadar Goldin, who were killed in action during \"Operation Protective Edge\" in 2014.\n\nThe Tikva Forum for Families of Hostages told JNS on Thursday, \"We would like to express our gratitude, together with that of the entire nation, to the IDF soldiers for their courage, bravery and dedication to the recovery of our precious hostages.\"\n\nThe forum expressed its condolences to the families of those whose bodies were recovered.\n\n\"We all hope for a continuation of the rescue and return of all the hostages, and for a complete victory over our enemies who threaten to destroy the State of Israel,\" the statement concluded.\n\nHowever, Lee Siegel, whose brother Keith Siegel is still being held in Gaza, told JNS on Thursday that there is no victory in Gaza with out the return of all the hostages.\n\n\"Those alive to begin the long process of rebuilding and those deceased a proper burial,\" he said.\n\nKeith's wife, Aviva, who was released as part of a ceasefire agreement in November after 51 days in Hamas captivity, addressed a rally in Washington on Wednesday in support of the abductees.\n\n\"I want Keith to come back alive. Not in a box. Not dead. I want him to come back like I know Keith,\" she said.\n\n\"But I know what Keith is going through and the [other] hostages are going through. They are going through hell. I'm just screaming out loud. They need to come home,\" she added.\n\nIlay David, whose brother Evyatar was abducted on Oct. 7, told JNS on Thursday that he felt \"great relief\" at the news of the recovered remains.\n\n\"For the families it is something big to have the right to bury their loved ones,\" he said.\n\nAt the same time, he added, \"There are so many hostages alive that we are trying to save and their time is running out. It's crazy that we feel sort of privileged that he is being held and not dead.\"\n\nHe said he could not reveal when the last proof of life was received from his brother, but noted that video of Evyatar's capture on Oct. 7 proved that he was taken alive.\n\nThe return of the hostages was important not just to them and their families, but for the security of the country and the world, he said.\n\n\"If we fail in this war to bring back the hostages it will happen everywhere where there is a radical Islamist presence. We have to show the world we can bring them back and defeat evil,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "washingtontimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

The shaft was nearly 220 yards long and more than 20 yards underground, with several rooms, the military said.\n\nIsrael has said that Hamas has exploited the \"humanitarian zone\" to launch rockets at Israel, as well as use it for other military purposes. Aid groups have lamented that Israel has occasionally struck the area, despite telling Gazans they would be safer there. There was no immediate response from Hamas.\n\nIsrael has been carrying out a new operation in Khan Younis this week, using tanks and fighter jets to strike what it has described as Hamas infrastructure in the southern Gaza city. Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, the Israeli military spokesman, told reporters the renewed offensive aimed in part to \"enable the operation\" to retrieve the hostages' bodies.\n\nDozens of people have been killed during the Israeli assault on Khan Younis, the Gazan Health Ministry has reported. Many also fled their homes as the Israeli bombardment intensified, while others elected to stay, hoping they would be safer in their houses than in tents. Admiral Hagari said that Israeli forces had killed \"many terrorists.\"\n\nThe five people whose bodies were recovered -- Maya Goren, 56; Tomer Ahimas, 20; Kiril Brodski, 19; Oren Goldin, 33; and Ravid Katz, 51 -- were killed during the Hamas-led attacks on Oct. 7 and were taken back to Gaza to be held as bargaining chips, Israeli officials said. They are considered hostages by the Israeli government.\n\nMr. Brodski and Mr. Ahimas were soldiers who fell during the attacks, while the other three were civilians.\n\nMs. Goren was a teacher from Nir Oz, one of the hardest-hit communities near the Gaza border; her husband was also killed on Oct. 7. Mr. Katz, also from Nir Oz, was a father of three children. The body of Mr. Goldin, a member of a nearby village's civil response squad, was taken, along with that of his brother-in-law Tal Haimi, whose body is still in Gaza.\n\nThe Israeli military said that intelligence -- including information from detained Palestinian militants -- had guided forces to the tunnel.\n\nMore than 250 people were abducted during the Hamas-led attack on Oct. 7, according to Israel, and 105 were released during a brief cease-fire in November. Israeli officials say 115 hostages remain in Gaza, including roughly 40 who are presumed dead.\n\nThe return home of the hostages' remains in body bags created a contrast with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's visit to Washington, where he has sought to project optimism despite the growing rift over the war in Gaza.\n\n\"The war in Gaza could end tomorrow if Hamas surrenders, disarms and returns all the hostages,\" Mr. Netanyahu said during his address to Congress on Wednesday. \"But if they don't, Israel will fight until we destroy Hamas's military capabilities and its rule in Gaza and bring all our hostages home.\"\n\nMr. Netanyahu did not refer to the current proposal backed by the Biden administration and the United Nations Security Council. Under that deal, Israel would ultimately agree to a permanent cease-fire with Hamas and withdraw its forces from Gaza in exchange for the release of all hostages.\n\nNissim Kalderon, whose brother Ofer was abducted on Oct. 7, accused Mr. Netanyahu of hesitating to reach a deal for political reasons. Mr. Netanyahu's coalition government depends on hard-line parties who support permanent Israeli control of Gaza, effectively ruling out a cease-fire with Hamas.\n\n\"I expected, hoped, wished that you would open your speech with 'We have a signed deal.' But again and again, you're not doing what you should have done 292 days ago,\" Mr. Kalderon said at a rally in Tel Aviv on Wednesday night. \"Bring your citizens home.\"\n\nAt least six Israeli relatives of hostages were arrested in the House gallery by Capitol Police during Mr. Netanyahu's speech as they wore bright yellow T-shirts calling on him to reach an agreement to free their loved ones.\n\n\"Benjamin Netanyahu spoke for 54 minutes and he did not mention once the need to seal the deal,\" said Gil Dickmann, whose cousin Carmel Gat was abducted from the Israeli border community of Be'eri. \"That's what he needs to do, sign the deal and release all the hostages now.\"", "source": {"uri": "dnyuz.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "DNyuz"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The immediate return of the remaining 115 hostages can only be achieved through a deal!\" it said, including among their number another four Israelis who were abducted before 7 October.\n\nThe forum called on Mr Netanyahu to send Israel's negotiating team to Qatar \"without delay\".\n\nThe Israeli prime minister's office had said the negotiators would depart on Thursday, following what it called an in-depth discussion with Mr Netanyahu over the weekend. But on Wednesday, Israeli officials said the team would head to Doha only after Mr Netanyahu had met US President Joe Biden at the White House.\n\nThe IDF also said on Thursday that its troops were continuing operations against \"terrorist infrastructure and operatives\" in Khan Younis and claimed that they had killed dozens of Palestinian fighters over the past few days.\n\nOn Wednesday, Palestinian news agency Wafa reported that four people had been killed in an Israeli air strike on a car in Jourat al-Loot, south of Khan Younis. Medics told Reuters news agency that another two people had been killed in a strike in Bani Suhaila, a town to the east where Hamas said it had targeted Israeli forces.\n\nThe UN estimates that more than 150,000 people have been displaced from Khan Younis since Monday, when Israel ordered the evacuation of eastern neighbourhoods that were part of its designated \"humanitarian area\".\n\nIsrael launched a military campaign in Gaza to destroy Hamas in response to an unprecedented attack on southern Israel on 7 October, during which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 were taken

The shaft was nearly 220 yards long and more than 20 yards below ground, with several rooms, the statement said.\n\nIsrael has accused Hamas of launching rockets from the humanitarian zone and using it for other military purposes. There was no immediate response from Hamas.\n\nIsrael has been carrying out a new operation in Khan Younis this week, using tanks and fighter jets to strike what it has described as Hamas infrastructure in the southern Gaza city. The Gaza Health ministry has reported that dozens of people have been killed during the offensive.\n\nThe five hostages -- Maya Goren, 56; Tomer Ahimas, 20; Kiril Brodski, 19; Oren Goldin, 33; and Ravid Katz, 51 -- were already presumed dead by Israeli officials. Mr. Brodski and Mr. Ahimas were soldiers who fell during the Hamas-led attack on Oct. 7, while the other three were civilians whose bodies were brought back to Gaza as bargaining chips.\n\nThe Israeli military said that intelligence -- including information from detained Palestinian militants -- had guided forces to the tunnel.\n\nMore than 250 people were abducted during the Hamas-led attack on Oct. 7, according to Israel, and 105 were released during a brief cease-fire in November. Israeli officials say 115 hostages remain in Gaza, including 40 who are presumed dead.\n\nMs. Goren was a kindergarten teacher from Nir Oz, one of the hardest-hit communities near the Gaza border; her husband was also killed on Oct. 7. Mr. Katz, also from Nir Oz, was a father of three children. The body of Mr. Goldin, a member of a nearby village's civil response squad, was taken along with that of his brother-in-law Tal Haimi, whose body is still in Gaza.\n\nTheir return home in body bags created a contrast with Mr. Netanyahu's visit to Washington, where he has sought to project optimism despite the growing rift over the war in Gaza.\n\n\"The war in Gaza could end tomorrow if Hamas surrenders, disarms and returns all the hostages,\" Mr. Netanyahu said during his address to Congress on Wednesday. \"But if they don't, Israel will fight until we destroy Hamas's military capabilities and its rule in Gaza and bring all our hostages home.\"\n\nMr. Netanyahu did not refer to the current proposal backed by the Biden administration and the United Nations Security Council. Under that deal, Israel would ultimately agree to a permanent cease-fire with Hamas and withdraw its forces from Gaza in exchange for the release of all hostages.\n\nNissim Kalderon, whose brother Ofer was abducted on Oct. 7, accused Mr. Netanyahu of hesitating to reach a deal for political reasons. Mr. Netanyahu's coalition government depends on hard-line parties who support permanent Israeli control of Gaza, effectively ruling out a cease-fire with Hamas.\n\n\"I expected, hoped, wished that you would open your speech with 'We have a signed deal.' But again and again, you're not doing what you should have done 292 days ago,\" Mr. Kalderon said at a rally in Tel Aviv on Wednesday night. \"Bring your citizens home.\"\n\nAt least six Israeli relatives of hostages were arrested in the House gallery by Capitol Police during Mr. Netanyahu's speech as they wore bright yellow T-shirts calling on him to reach an agreement to free their loved ones.\n\n\"Benjamin Netanyahu spoke for 54 minutes and he did not mention once the need to seal the deal,\" said Gil Dickmann, whose cousin Carmel Gat was abducted from the Israeli border community of Be'eri. \"That's what he needs to do, sign the deal and release all the hostages now.\"", "source": {"uri": "dnyuz.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "DNyuz"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Mr. Brodski and Mr. Ahimas were soldiers who fell during the Hamas-led attack on Oct. 7, while the other three were civilians whose bodies were brought back to Gaza as bargaining chips.\n\nThe Israeli military said that the bodies were found in the Khan Younis area on Wednesday and that intelligence -- including information from detained Palestinian militants -- had guided forces to their location. Israel has been carrying out a new operation in Khan Younis this week, using tanks and fighter jets to strike what it has described as Hamas infrastructure in the southern Gaza city.\n\nMore than 250 people were abducted during the Hamas-led attack on Oct. 7, according to Israel, and 105 were released during a brief cease-fire in November. Israeli officials say 115 hostages remain in Gaza, including 40 who are presumed dead.\n\nMs. Goren was a kindergarten teacher from Nir Oz, one of the hardest-hit communities near the Gaza border; her husband was also killed on Oct. 7. Mr. Katz, also from Nir Oz, was a father of three children. The body of Mr. Goldin, a member of a nearby village's civil response squad, was taken along with that of his brother-in-law Tal Haimi, whose body is still in Gaza.\n\nTheir return home in body bags created a contrast with Mr. Netanyahu's visit to Washington, where he has sought to project optimism despite the growing rift over the war in Gaza.\n\n\"The war in Gaza could end tomorrow if Hamas surrenders, disarms and returns all the hostages,\" Mr. Netanyahu said during his address to Congress on Wednesday. \"But if they don't, Israel will fight until we destroy Hamas's military capabilities and its rule in Gaza and bring all our hostages home.\"\n\nMr. Netanyahu did not refer to the current proposal backed by the Biden administration and the United Nations Security Council. Under that deal, Israel would ultimately agree to a permanent cease-fire with Hamas and withdraw its forces from Gaza in exchange for the release of all hostages.\n\nNissim Kalderon, whose brother Ofer was abducted on Oct. 7, accused Mr. Netanyahu of hesitating to reach a deal for political reasons. Mr. Netanyahu's coalition government depends on hard-line parties who support permanent Israeli control of Gaza, effectively ruling out a cease-fire with Hamas.\n\n\"I expected, hoped, wished that you would open your speech with 'We have a signed deal.' But again and again, you're not doing what you should have done 292 days ago,\" Mr. Kalderon said at a rally in Tel Aviv on Wednesday night. \"Bring your citizens home.\"\n\nAt least six Israeli relatives of hostages were arrested in the House gallery by Capitol Police during Mr. Netanyahu's speech as they wore bright yellow T-shirts calling on him to reach an agreement to free their loved ones.\n\n\"Benjamin Netanyahu spoke for 54 minutes and he did not mention once the need to seal the deal,\" said Gil Dickmann, whose cousin Carmel Gat was abducted from the Israeli border community of Be'eri. \"That's what he needs to do, sign the deal and release all the hostages now.\"\n\nRawan Sheikh Ahmad contributed reporting.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

The Israeli leader has been facing increasing anger from Israelis over the fate of the hostages in Gaza.\n\nThe five hostages -- Maya Goren, 56; Tomer Ahimas, 20; Kiril Brodski, 19; Oren Goldin, 33; and Ravid Katz, 51 -- were already presumed dead by Israeli officials. Mr. Brodski and Mr. Ahimas were soldiers who fell during the Hamas-led attack on Oct. 7, while the other three were civilians whose bodies were brought back to Gaza as bargaining chips.\n\nThe Israeli military said that the bodies were found in the Khan Younis area on Wednesday and that intelligence -- including information from detained Palestinian militants -- had guided forces to their location. Israel has been carrying out a new operation in Khan Younis this week, using tanks and fighter jets to strike what it has described as Hamas infrastructure in the southern Gaza city.\n\nMore than 250 people were abducted during the Hamas-led attack on Oct. 7, according to Israel, and 105 were released during a brief cease-fire in November. Israeli officials say 115 hostages remain in Gaza, including 40 who are presumed dead.\n\nMs. Goren was a kindergarten teacher from Nir Oz, one of the hardest-hit communities near the Gaza border; her husband was also killed on Oct. 7. Mr. Katz, also from Nir Oz, was a father of three children. The body of Mr. Goldin, a member of a nearby village's civil response squad, was taken along with that of his brother-in-law Tal Haimi, whose body is still in Gaza.\n\nTheir return home in body bags created a contrast with Mr. Netanyahu's visit to Washington, where he has sought to project optimism despite the growing rift over the war in Gaza.\n\n\"The war in Gaza could end tomorrow if Hamas surrenders, disarms and returns all the hostages,\" Mr. Netanyahu said during his address to Congress on Wednesday. \"But if they don't, Israel will fight until we destroy Hamas's military capabilities and its rule in Gaza and bring all our hostages home.\"\n\nMr. Netanyahu did not refer to the current proposal backed by the Biden administration and the United Nations Security Council. Under that deal, Israel would ultimately agree to a permanent cease-fire with Hamas and withdraw its forces from Gaza in exchange for the release of all hostages.\n\nNissim Kalderon, whose brother Ofer was abducted on Oct. 7, accused Mr. Netanyahu of hesitating to reach a deal for political reasons. Mr. Netanyahu's coalition government depends on hard-line parties who support permanent Israeli control of Gaza, effectively ruling out a cease-fire with Hamas.\n\n\"I expected, hoped, wished that you would open your speech with 'We have a signed deal.' But again and again, you're not doing what you should have done 292 days ago,\" Mr. Kalderon said at a rally in Tel Aviv on Wednesday night. \"Bring your citizens home.\"\n\nAt least six Israeli relatives of hostages were arrested in the House gallery by Capitol Police during Mr. Netanyahu's speech as they wore bright yellow T-shirts calling on him to reach an agreement to free their loved ones.\n\n\"Benjamin Netanyahu spoke for 54 minutes and he did not mention once the need to seal the deal,\" said Gil Dickmann, whose cousin Carmel Gat was abducted from the Israeli border community of Be'eri. \"That's what he needs to do, sign the deal and release all the hostages now.\"\n\nRawan Sheikh Ahmad contributed reporting.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

The immediate return of the remaining 115 hostages can only be achieved through a deal!\" it said, including among their number another four Israelis who were abducted before 7 October.\n\nThe forum called on Mr Netanyahu to send Israel's negotiating team to Qatar \"without delay\".\n\nThe Israeli prime minister's office had said the negotiators would depart on Thursday, following what it called an in-depth discussion with Mr Netanyahu over the weekend. But on Wednesday, Israeli officials said the team would head to Doha only after Mr Netanyahu had met US President Joe Biden at the White House.\n\nThe IDF also said on Thursday that its troops were continuing operations against \"terrorist infrastructure and operatives\" in Khan Younis and claimed that they had killed dozens of Palestinian fighters over the past few days.\n\nOn Wednesday, Palestinian news agency Wafa reported that four people had been killed in an Israeli air strike on a car in Jourat al-Loot, south of Khan Younis. Medics told Reuters news agency that another two people had been killed in a strike in Bani Suhaila, a town to the east where Hamas said it had targeted Israeli forces.\n\nThe UN estimates that more than 150,000 people have been displaced from Khan Younis since Monday, when Israel ordered the evacuation of eastern neighbourhoods that were part of its designated \"humanitarian area\".", "source":

Kiril Brodski, Staff-Sergeant Tomer Achimas, Oren Goldin, and Warrant Officer (res.) Ravid Aryeh Katz.\n\nThe joint operation in Khan Yunis was conducted based on Shin Bet interrogations of terrorists and other precise intelligence information, the military said.\n\nRecovering the dead hostages' bodies was a pre-planned secret goal of the recent reinvasion of Khan Yunis, which started on Monday, after having first invaded Khan Yunis back on December 1 and then withdrawn on April 7.\n\nThe IDF said that its intelligence units were working with the Shin Bet for weeks on the exact location and planning for an operation to recover the bodies.\n\nIDF locate an underground shaft with a tunnel that held the bodies of the five hostages on July 25, 2024.\n\nEventually, late Tuesday night, the IDF discovered a tunnel in a humanitarian zone within Khan Yunis (in a general area that Hamas was using to hide behind human shields).\n\nThe Yahalom tunnel unit spent 12 hours digging and then exploring the tunnel and found that it extended for 200 meters and ran 20 meters deep with a number of rooms, with the bodies of the dead hostages located in one of those rooms.\n\nDespite the finding of the tunnel occurring as part of the reinvasion, Hamas forces had already fled the area by the time IDF forces arrived, such that there was no gunfight to take control of the tunnel area.\n\nIn a related development, an IDF reservist soldier filmed himself with the bodies of hostages found near Khan Yunis and posted the video on the social media platform TikTok on Wednesday.\n\nOn Thursday, the IDF announced that he had been court-martialled and sentenced to 10 days low-grade IDF detention following which he would be permanently expelled from reservist duty.\n\nThe bodies of rescued in the operation\n\nMaya Goren, 56, from Kibbutz Nir Oz, was kidnapped to the Gaza Strip on October 7.

In his speech Wednesday, he promised their families that he \"will not rest until all their loved ones are home,\" as protests against him continued outside the U.S. Capitol.\n\nIn Israel, families of hostages reacted negatively to the news about the latest setbacks in the hostage talks, particularly the delay of the negotiating team's trip to Qatar, and blamed Netanyahu.\n\n\"For two weeks, the Prime Minister has refrained from responding to the mediators' inquiries regarding the implementation of the deal,\" the Hostages Families Forum Headquarters said in a statement. \"It has now become apparent that the information provided to the hostages' families did not accurately reflect the situation's reality.\"\n\nThe group accused Netanyahu and the negotiating team of \"a deliberate sabotage of the chance to bring our loved ones back,\" and it demanded to know who was obstructing the hostage deal and why.\n\nTalks around the hostage negotiations hit a new snag last week in Doha, according to a diplomat briefed on the talks who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive diplomatic effort.\n\nAfter the meeting, Israeli negotiators submitted new demands, including the refusal to withdraw from Gaza's border with Egypt and restrictions on the ability for civilians to return to Gaza's north, according to the diplomat.\n\nGranting civilians permission to return to northern Gaza has been a key Hamas demand in the talks for months, and previous reports from the negotiations suggested the issue had largely been agreed to. Israeli forces took over Gaza's border with Egypt in May and say the area was used by Hamas to smuggle weapons and supplies into Gaza.\n\nWhile Netanyahu's speech received numerous standing ovations from lawmakers who attended, much of the reaction in the Israeli press was critical and contrasted the address with the discovery of the hostages' corpses.\n\n\"While Netanyahu was speaking in Congress, the IDF was working to identify the bodies of dead hostages,\" columnist Nahum Barnea wrote in the Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper. \"One world in Washington, another world in Israel.\"\n\nThe daily Maariv quoted Einav Zangauker, whose son Matan is being held hostage, as saying that Netanyahu was delaying the deal \"for personal reasons.\"\n\n\"Even if we receive news of more hostages dying in tunnels, he will continue with his public relations campaign in the United States and will continue to drag his feet,\" she said.\n\nA Netanyahu ally, Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, hit back at the media for what he called its overly negative portrayal of the prime minister's \"impressive\" speech and accused commentators of trying to weaken the country.\n\n\"The bitter band of sourpusses in (the media) has illustrated once again the enormity of its disconnect from Israeli experience and is doing everything to ruin the celebration,\" he wrote on Facebook.\n\nFamily and friends of Goren, the kindergarten teacher whose body was taken from Kibbutz Nir Oz, expressed relief that her body had been recovered. She had already been declared dead in December.\n\n\"Mom was finally laid to rest - after more than nine months, her journey has ended,\" her family said in a statement shared on a WhatsApp forum that also thanked the security forces that brought her body back. \"Your abandonment has at last ended.\" Around a quarter of residents of the kibbutz were reported killed or missing after the attack, and about half of the houses were destroyed.\n\nMore than 250 hostages were taken by Hamas and its allies on Oct. 7. Israelis said at least 111 remain in Gaza and of those at least 72 are believed to still be alive.\n\nTalks to release hostages and end the war in Gaza have been stalled for months, with each side blaming the other for the lack of progress. At the core of the deadlock is the issue of how the war in Gaza will end. Hamas has demanded that the release of hostages be followed by the withdrawal of Israeli forces and a permanent cease-fire. Netanyahu has vowed to completely destroy Hamas.\n\nFor its part, Hamas also accused Netanyahu of obstructing negotiations.\n\n\"He is the one who thwarted all efforts,\" the group said, blasting Netanyahu's claim that efforts to reach an agreement have intensified and calling it \"a complete lie.\"\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin met Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in the Kremlin on Thursday. \"Considering all the events that are taking place in the world as a whole and in the Eurasian region today, our meeting today seems very important to discuss all the details of the development of these events,\" Assad told Putin through a Russian interpreter.\n\nMany Palestinian families are continually forced to seek new places of refuge inside the Gaza Strip, where there is no safe place, the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees said Thursday morning. \"Children are crying and screaming. Everybody is in this horrible position once again. It keeps happening over and over and over,\" said Louise Wateridge, a spokeswoman for the U.N. Relief and Works Agency in Gaza. \"They are forced from place to place, promised safety where there is none.\"\n\nAt least 39,175 people have been killed and 90,403 injured in Gaza since the war started, the Gaza Health Ministry said Wednesday. It does not distinguish between civilians and combatants but says the majority of the dead are women and children. Israel estimates that about 1,200 people were killed in Hamas's Oct. 7 attack, including more than 300 soldiers, and it says 326 soldiers have been killed since the start of its military operations in Gaza.", "source": {"uri": "adn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Anchorage Daily News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label":

The Israel leader has been facing increasing anger from Israelis over the fate of the hostages in Gaza.\n\nThe five hostages -- Maya Goren, 56; Tomer Ahimas, 20; Kiril Brodski, 19; Oren Goldin, 33; and Ravid Katz, 51 -- were already presumed dead by Israeli officials. Mr. Brodski and Mr. Ahimas were soldiers who fell during the Hamas-led attack on Oct. 7, while the other three were civilians whose bodies were brought back to Gaza as bargaining chips.\n\nThe Israeli military said that the bodies were found in the Khan Younis area on Wednesday and that intelligence -- including information from detained Palestinian militants -- had guided forces to their location. Israel has been carrying out a new operation in Khan Younis this week, using tanks and fighter jets to strike what it has described as Hamas infrastructure in the southern Gaza city.\n\nMore than 250 people were abducted during the Hamas-led attack on Oct. 7, according to Israel, and 105 were released during a brief cease-fire in November. Israeli officials say 115 hostages remain in Gaza, including 40 who are presumed dead.\n\nMs. Goren was a kindergarten teacher from Nir Oz, one of the hardest-hit communities near the Gaza border; her husband was also killed on Oct. 7. Mr. Katz, also from Nir Oz, was a father of three children. The body of Mr. Goldin, a member of a nearby village's civil response squad, was taken along with that of his brother-in-law Tal Haimi, whose body is still in Gaza.\n\nTheir return home in body bags created a contrast with Mr. Netanyahu's visit to Washington, where he has sought to project optimism despite the growing rift over the war in Gaza.\n\n\"The war in Gaza could end tomorrow if Hamas surrenders, disarms and returns all the hostages,\" Mr. Netanyahu said during his address to Congress on Wednesday. \"But if they don't, Israel will fight until we destroy Hamas's military capabilities and its rule in Gaza and bring all our hostages home.\"\n\nMr. Netanyahu did not reference the current proposal backed by the Biden administration and the United Nations Security Council. Under that deal, Israel would ultimately agree to a permanent cease-fire with Hamas and withdraw its forces from Gaza in exchange for the release of all hostages.\n\nNissim Kalderon, whose brother Ofer was abducted on Oct. 7, accused Mr. Netanyahu of hesitating to reach a deal for political reasons. Mr. Netanyahu's coalition government depends on hard-line parties who support permanent Israeli control of Gaza, effectively ruling out a cease-fire with Hamas.\n\n\"I expected, hoped, wished that you would open your speech with 'We have a signed deal.' But again and again, you're not doing what you should have done 292 days ago,\" Mr. Kalderon said at a rally in Tel Aviv on Wednesday night. \"Bring your citizens home.\"\n\nAt least six Israeli relatives of hostages were arrested in the House gallery by Capitol Police during Mr. Netanyahu's speech as they wore bright yellow T-shirts calling on him to reach an agreement to free their loved ones.\n\n\"Benjamin Netanyahu spoke for 54 minutes and he did not mention once the need to seal the deal,\" said Gil Dickmann, whose cousin Carmel Gat was abducted from the Israeli border community of Be'eri. \"That's what he needs to do, sign the deal and release all the hostages now.\"", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Israel's military earlier this week began a new offensive in the city to root out Hamas fighters who had reentered it.\n\n\"Alongside the operational effort, the IDF's directorate for the missing and captives worked with the Institute for Forensic Science and the Israel Police to identify the bodies and inform the families,\" Shin Bet said in a statement.\n\nA video clip of the bodies - which were tightly wrapped in what looked like plastic garbage sacks - and which were neatly arrayed in an APC, appeared online. The reserve soldier who filmed it was handed a 10-day prison sentence by the commander of the 98th Division, and was permanently dismissed from duty for actions \"completely against\" military protocol.\n\n\"The IDF views such incidents with severity, and condemns behavior that endangers the security of our forces, and harms the families of the hostages,\" the military said, according to the Times of Israel.\n\nIsrael's President Isaac Herzog delivered an emotional message on X:\n\n\"Our hearts are with the Katz, Goldin, Goren, Ahimas and Brodski families - as soon as it became known about the recovery of their loved ones' bodies - soldiers and civilians from the Gaza Strip. I thank the IDF soldiers, Shin Bet and Security Services personnel who act with determination and bravery to return the male and female hostages.\"\n\n\"We must return them all, the living and those for whom it is our responsibility to bring them home to Israel for burial.\"\n\n\"May the memories of Ravid, Oren, Maya, Tomer, and Kiril, be blessed.\"\n\nThe retrieval of these five bodies means there are still some 111 captives remaining in Gaza, including the 39 the IDF has already declared dead, out of the 251 who were taken to the coastal enclave on Oct. 7 more than 290 days ago.\n\nMaya Goren was a beloved kindergarten teacher from Kibbutz Nir Oz, one of the worst-hit locations on that \"Black Sabbath.\" There is a very affecting image of her tending to baby Kfir Bibas, the then-nine-month-old baby taken into Hamas captivity, along with his four-year-old brother and his distraught parents.\n\nMaya, who was in the kindergarten looking after children when the barbarous hordes descended on her home, was critically wounded although apparently still alive, and whisked across the border to Gaza. She is known to have been murdered some time after that.\n\nMaya's husband, Avner, was also killed inside the couple's home. Although her family already sat shiva - the traditional seven days of mourning following - in December, she will now be laid to rest next to her husband, in a dignified burial.\n\nSgt. Kiril Brodski, was from Ramat Gan, and served in the brigade commander's command post, and was killed on Oct. 7. In November, it was announced he had been murdered on the day of the attacks and his body was taken to Gaza.\n\nStaff Sgt. Tomer Yaakov Ahimas, fell during fierce battles in Nirim. He along with Sgt. Brodski was part of the command post team of Col. Assaf Hamami, commander of the Southern Brigade in the Gaza Division - who was also killed - as they fought valiantly to contain the waves of terrorists.\n\nOren Goldin, was born in Kibbutz Nir Yitzhak. He was married to Oshrit and together they raised two-year-old twins - Aviv and Ilay. He was kidnapped along with three other members of the kibbutz's emergency squad, including his brother-in-law - Tal Haimi, another Oct. 7 victim.\n\nRavid Katz lived in Kibbutz Nir Oz. He leaves behind three children - Shahar, Shira, and little Alma, only six months old - and his partner, Revital.\n\nContent created by the WND News Center is available for re-publication without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Oren Goldin, Staff Sergeant Tomer Ahimas, and Sergeant Kiril Brodski were rescued from the Khan Yunis area.\n\nAccording to reliable intelligence obtained, it was determined that Maya Goren was murdered, and Master Sergeant (Res.) Oren Goldin, Staff Sergeant Tomer Ahimas, and Sergeant Kiril Brodski fell in combat during the brutal October 7th attack, and their bodies were abducted to the Gaza Strip.\n\nThe rescue was conducted yesterday by ISA and IDF soldiers from the Commando Brigade, 'Yahalom' Unit, and Egoz Unit with the direction of the 98th Division.\n\nThe intelligence effort prior to the operation was directed by the ISA and consisted of a combination of intelligence from ISA terrorist interrogations, the IDF Intelligence Directorate Hostages Headquarters and additional sources that contributed to the operation.\n\nAlongside the operational effort, the IDF Hostage and Missing Persons Unit and the Manpower Directorate's Hostage and Missing Persons Center, which is responsible for accompanying the families of the hostages, operated with The National Center of Forensic Medicine and the Israel Police to identify and inform the families of the hostages.\n\nThe IDF and ISA will continue to operate, using all intelligence and operational means to fulfill the supreme mission of rescuing all of the hostages.\n\nThe IDF and ISA later updated their statement to note that the body of Sergeant Major (Res.) Ravid Aryeh Katz was also recovered.\n\nKibbutz Nir Oz issued a statement on Goren:\n\nAfter more than nine excruciating months, Maya Goren was brought back home to Nir Oz. Maya will return to the soil of the kibbutz she loved, and will be buried next to her husband Avner Goren, who was also murdered on October 7th.\n\nMaya was 56 years old, a member of Kibbutz Nir Oz. Mother to Assif, Bar, Gal, and Dekel. She was a hardworking, dedicated kindergarten teacher, who gave loving care to the kibbutz's children for many years. Maya was murdered and abducted from the baby daycare at the kibbutz on October 7th.\n\nThe return of her body by the IDF brings an important closure for the Goren family and the community of Kibbutz Nir Oz.\n\nBringing Maya to eternal rest is an important step on the way to recovery of Kibbutz Nir Oz and the State of Israel, a recovery that will not be complete without the return of all hostages - the living ones to their families, and the dead to eternal rest. We must bring them all home, NOW.\n\nThere are still over 100 hostages remaining in Gaza, roughly half of whom, it is hoped, are still alive.\n\nJoel B.

But the barnstorming address left the father of 19-year-old soldier and Hamas hostage Liri Albag feeling heartsick.\n\n\"When he talked for 55 minutes and didn't talk about the deal for one second, I was very upset, embarrassed and angry,\" Eli Albag told NBC News in a phone interview Thursday about what he viewed as Netanyahu's unwillingness to strike a deal with Hamas for the release of relatives being held in the Gaza Strip.\n\nHe added that he wanted to believe that the return of Israeli hostages like Liri was a priority for the Israeli leader, but he said he hasn't seen \"the results.\"\n\nAlbag, 55, is one of several family members of hostages held by Hamas in Gaza who demanded to meet with cease-fire negotiators after Israeli media and Reuters reported that an Israeli delegation had not set off for talks in Qatar on Thursday as planned. Instead it was reported that they were held back until next week.\n\nNetanyahu railed against Hamas and Iran in his Wednesday address, and he said Israel would not settle for anything less than \"total victory\" in its offensive in Gaza, which he said \"could end tomorrow if Hamas surrenders, disarms and returns all the hostages.\" If they didn't, he said, \"Israel will fight until we destroy Hamas' military capabilities and its rule in Gaza and bring all our hostages home.\"\n\nLarge protests greeted the speech, which came three months after Congress passed a military aid package that included $14 billion for Israel, with many demonstrators decrying the nearly 40,000 Palestinians killed in Gaza since the start of the war, according to health authorities in the enclave.\n\nWhile some lawmakers, mostly Democrats, refused to attend the address amid mounting global outrage over the tens of thousands of Palestinian civilians killed and wounded, Noa Argamani, who traveled with Netanyahu to Washington, watched the address in the chamber.\n\nArgamani became a symbol of Hamas' Oct. 7 terror attack, which killed 1,200 and saw around 250 taken hostage, after her kidnapping was captured in a viral video. She has faced criticism from some Israeli commentators and hostage families for joining Netanyahu, some of whom have accused her of being a pawn in a political game.\n\nNetanyahu has also been criticized for allegedly using hostages as \"props\" during public appearances but not advocating hard enough for their release.\n\n\"While (Netanyahu) boasts about caring about the hostages, he's not sending the negotiation team to Qatar to seal the deal,\" Udi Goren, whose cousin Tal Haimi's body remains in Hamas' captivity, said in a statement.\n\n\"Why doesn't he want more Argamanis to be back home?\" he added.\n\nNetanyahu's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the hostage families' criticism of the prime minister's address and the government policy toward negotiations with Hamas.\n\nThe Hostages and Missing Families Forum, which represents the relatives of those held captive in Gaza, said the delay in sending negotiators to Qatar unfolded after hostage families had received repeated assurances from them that the delegation would be sent this week.\n\n\"This foot-dragging is a deliberate sabotage of the chance to bring our loved ones back. It effectively undermines the negotiations and indicates a serious moral failure,\" the group said in a statement Thursday morning.\n\nThere are now 115 hostages who remain held in Gaza, including at least 41 who are believed to be dead, according to Israeli officials. Those numbers include four hostages who have been held in Gaza since 2014, with two of them among those believed to be dead.\n\nAccording to several of the American hostage families in Washington for the Netanyahu speech and meetings, they are upset that he is in the United States instead of in Israel trying to get their loved ones home. They also told NBC News on Wednesday that they are looking toward Thursday's joint meeting at the White House with President Joe Biden and Netanyahu as a chance for Biden to pressure the Israeli leader to agree to a cease-fire deal as soon as next week with no new obstacles.\n\nCalling Netanyahu's speech a \"disgrace,\" Israeli opposition leader Yair Lapid also wrote on X that there had been \"an hour of talking without saying a single sentence: 'There will be a hostage deal.'\"\n\nThe families spoke out after the Israeli military said Thursday that troops had retrieved the bodies of five hostages in Gaza's southern city of Khan Younis.\n\nAmong them was kindergarten teacher Maya Goren, who died in Hamas' captivity at age 56, according to Israeli officials.

But the barnstorming address left the father of 19-year-old soldier and Hamas hostage Liri Albag feeling heartsick.\n\n\"When he talked for 55 minutes and didn't talk about the deal for one second, I was very upset, embarrassed and angry,\" Eli Albag told NBC News in a phone interview Thursday about what he viewed as Netanyahu's unwillingness to strike a deal with Hamas for the release of relatives being held in the Gaza Strip.\n\nHe added that he wanted to believe that the return of Israeli hostages like Liri was a priority for the Israeli leader, but he said he hasn't seen \"the results.\"\n\nAlbag, 55, is one of several family members of hostages held by Hamas in Gaza who demanded to meet with cease-fire negotiators after Israeli media and Reuters reported that an Israeli delegation had not set off for talks in Qatar on Thursday as planned. Instead it was reported that they were held back until next week.\n\nNetanyahu railed against Hamas and Iran in his Wednesday address, and he said Israel would not settle for anything less than \"total victory\" in its offensive in Gaza, which he said \"could end tomorrow if Hamas surrenders, disarms and returns all the hostages.\" If they didn't, he said, \"Israel will fight until we destroy Hamas' military capabilities and its rule in Gaza and bring all our hostages home.\"\n\nLarge protests greeted the speech, which came three months after Congress passed a military aid package that included $14 billion for Israel, with many demonstrators decrying the nearly 40,000 Palestinians killed in Gaza since the start of the war, according to health authorities in the enclave.\n\nWhile some lawmakers, mostly Democrats, refused to attend the address amid mounting global outrage over the tens of thousands of Palestinian civilians killed and wounded, Noa Argamani, who traveled with Netanyahu to Washington, watched the address in the chamber.\n\nArgamani became a symbol of Hamas' Oct. 7 terror attack, which killed 1,200 and saw around 250 taken hostage, after her kidnapping was captured in a viral video. She has faced criticism from some Israeli commentators and hostage families for joining Netanyahu, some of whom have accused her of being a pawn in a political game.\n\nNetanyahu has also been criticized for allegedly using hostages as \"props\" during public appearances but not advocating hard enough for their release.\n\n\"While (Netanyahu) boasts about caring about the hostages, he's not sending the negotiation team to Qatar to seal the deal,\" Udi Goren, whose cousin Tal Haimi's body remains in Hamas' captivity, said in a statement.\n\n\"Why doesn't he want more Argamanis to be back home?\" he added.\n\nNetanyahu's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the hostage families' criticism of the prime minister's address and the government policy toward negotiations with Hamas.\n\nThe Hostages and Missing Families Forum, which represents the relatives of those held captive in Gaza, said the delay in sending negotiators to Qatar unfolded after hostage families had received repeated assurances from them that the delegation would be sent this week.\n\n\"This foot-dragging is a deliberate sabotage of the chance to bring our loved ones back. It effectively undermines the negotiations and indicates a serious moral failure,\" the group said in a statement Thursday morning.\n\nThere are now 115 hostages who remain held in Gaza, including at least 41 who are believed to be dead, according to Israeli officials. Those numbers include four hostages who have been held in Gaza since 2014, with two of them among those believed to be dead.\n\nAccording to several of the American hostage families in Washington for the Netanyahu speech and meetings, they are upset that he is in the United States instead of in Israel trying to get their loved ones home. They also told NBC News on Wednesday that they are looking toward Thursday's joint meeting at the White House with President Joe Biden and Netanyahu as a chance for Biden to pressure the Israeli leader to agree to a cease-fire deal as soon as next week with no new obstacles.\n\nCalling Netanyahu's speech a \"disgrace,\" Israeli opposition leader Yair Lapid also wrote on X that there had been \"an hour of talking without saying a single sentence: 'There will be a hostage deal.'\"\n\nThe families spoke out after the Israeli military said Thursday that troops had retrieved the bodies of five hostages in Gaza's southern city of Khan Younis.\n\nAmong them was kindergarten teacher Maya Goren, who died in Hamas' captivity at age 56, according to Israeli officials. The bodies of four soldiers -- Sgt. Maj. Ravid Aryeh Katz, Master Sgt. Oren Goldin, Staff Sgt. Tomer Ahimas and Sgt. Kiril Brodski -- were also retrieved, the officials said.\n\nThe rescue operation took place as Israeli forces carried out an offensive in Khan Younis that saw tens of thousands of Palestinians forced

(Julia Nikhinson/AP)\n\nThe bodies of five Israelis killed in Hamas's Oct. 7 attack and then taken to Gaza have been recovered, the Israel Defense Forces said Thursday, as families of hostages reacted angrily to news that an Israeli negotiating team has delayed its latest trip to the talks to free those remaining.\n\nThe delay comes as those involved in the cease-fire talks revealed that the negotiations hit a snag after Israel made new demands, including keeping its troops along the Gaza border with Egypt.\n\nThe hostages' bodies were retrieved from an unguarded tunnel in Khan Younis in southern Gaza, according to Israeli radio. The bodies recovered were those of Maya Goren, 56, a kindergarten teacher, and four soldiers: Oren Goldin, Tomer Ahimas, Kiril Brodski and Ravid Aryeh Katz, according to the IDF statement.\n\nNews about the recovery of the bodies emerged around the time Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was addressing Congress and promoting his efforts to free the hostages. In his speech Wednesday, he promised their families that he \"will not rest until all their loved ones are home,\" as protests against him continued outside the U.S. Capitol.\n\nIn Israel, families of hostages reacted negatively to the news about the latest setbacks in the hostage talks, particularly the delay of the negotiating team's trip to Qatar, and blamed Netanyahu.\n\n\"For two weeks, the Prime Minister has refrained from responding to the mediators' inquiries regarding the implementation of the deal,\" the Hostages Families Forum Headquarters said in a statement. \"It has now become apparent that the information provided to the hostages' families did not accurately reflect the situation's reality.\"\n\nThe group accused Netanyahu and the negotiating team of \"a deliberate sabotage of the chance to bring our loved ones back,\" and it demanded to know who was obstructing the hostage deal and why.\n\nTalks around the hostage negotiations hit a new snag last week in Doha, according to a diplomat briefed on the talks who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive diplomatic effort.\n\nAfter the meeting, Israeli negotiators submitted new demands, including the refusal to withdraw from Gaza's border with Egypt and restrictions on the ability for civilians to return to Gaza's north, according to the diplomat.\n\nGranting civilians permission to return to northern Gaza has been a key Hamas demand in the talks for months, and previous reports from the negotiations suggested the issue had largely been agreed to. Israeli forces took over Gaza's border with Egypt in May and say the area was used by Hamas to smuggle weapons and supplies into Gaza.\n\nWhile Netanyahu's speech received numerous standing ovations from lawmakers who attended, much of the reaction in the Israeli press was critical and contrasted the address with the discovery of the hostages' corpses.\n\n\"While Netanyahu was speaking in Congress, the IDF was working to identify the bodies of dead hostages,\" columnist Nahum Barnea wrote in the Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper. \"One world in Washington, another world in Israel.\"\n\nThe daily Maariv quoted Einav Zangauker, whose son Matan is being held hostage, as saying that Netanyahu was delaying the deal \"for personal reasons.\"\n\n\"Even if we receive news of more hostages dying in tunnels, he will continue with his public relations campaign in the United States and will continue to drag his feet,\" she said.\n\nA Netanyahu ally, Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, hit back at the media for what he called its overly negative portrayal of the prime minister's \"impressive\" speech and accused commentators of trying to weaken the country.\n\n\"The bitter band of sourpusses in [the media] has illustrated once again the enormity of its disconnect from Israeli experience and is doing everything to ruin the celebration,\" he wrote on Facebook.\n\nFamily and friends of Goren, the kindergarten teacher whose body was taken from Kibbutz Nir Oz, expressed relief that her body had been recovered. She had already been declared dead in December.\n\n\"Mom was finally laid to rest - after more than nine months, her journey has ended,\" her family said in a statement shared on a WhatsApp forum that also thanked the security forces that brought her body back. \"Your abandonment has at last ended.\" Around a quarter of residents of the kibbutz were reported killed or missing after the attack, and about half of the houses were destroyed.\n\nMore than 250 hostages were taken by Hamas and its allies on Oct. 7. Israelis said at least 111 remain in Gaza and of those at least 72 are believed to still be alive.\n\nTalks to release hostages and end the war in Gaza have been stalled for months, with each side blaming the other for the lack of progress. At the core of the deadlock is the issue of how the war in Gaza will end. Hamas has demanded that the release of hostages be followed by the withdrawal of Israeli forces and a permanent cease-fire. Netanyahu has vowed to completely destroy Hamas.\n\nFor its part, Hamas also accused Netanyahu of obstructing negotiations.\n\n\"He is the one who thwarted all efforts,\" the group said, blasting Netanyahu's claim that efforts to reach an agreement have intensified and calling it \"a complete lie.\" Here's what else to know\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin met Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in the Kremlin on Thursday. \"Considering all the events that are taking place in the world as a whole and in the Eurasian region today, our meeting today seems very important to discuss all the details of the development of these events,\" Assad told Putin through a Russian interpreter.\n\nMany Palestinian families are continually forced to seek new places of refuge inside the Gaza Strip, where there is no safe place, the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees said Thursday morning. \"Children are crying and screaming. Everybody is in this horrible position once again. It keeps happening over and over and over,\" said Louise Wateridge, a spokeswoman for the U.N. Relief and Works Agency in Gaza. \"They are forced from place to place, promised safety where there is none.\"\n\nAt least 39,175 people have been killed and 90,403 injured in Gaza since the war started, the Gaza Health Ministry said Wednesday. It does not distinguish between civilians and combatants but says the majority of the dead are women and children. Israel estimates that about 1,200 people were killed in Hamas's Oct. 7 attack, including more than 300 soldiers, and it says 326 soldiers have been killed since the start of its military operations in Gaza.", "source": {"uri": "stripes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Stars and Stripes"}, "authors": [{"uri": "susannah_george@stripes.com", "name": "Susannah George", "type": "author", "isAgency":

Palestinians have been sheltering there since the army re-entered the southern Gaza city to counter Hamas efforts to re-establish itself.\n\nNone of the projectiles fired reached Israeli territory.

These individuals were previously taken hostage during the surprise assault by Hamas on October 7.\n\nThe identities of the recovered individuals include Maya Goren, a kindergarten teacher, as well as soldiers Major Ravid Aryeh Katz, Master Sergeant Oren Goldin, Staff Sergeant Tomer Ahimas, and Sergeant Kiril Brodski. Their bodies were discovered during a military operation in the Khan Younis region.\n\nReports indicate that Ms. Goren was murdered while in captivity, whereas the soldiers were allegedly killed in combat on the day of the initial assault, with their bodies taken thereafter.\n\nThis revelation leaves 111 of the 251 individuals initially taken hostage still believed to be in Gaza. Among these, 39 are feared to have died while in captivity.\n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu addressed concerns regarding the hostages during his speech to the U.S. Congress. He remarked, \"As we speak, we're actively engaged in intensive efforts to secure their release.\" However, critics noted that he did not provide any definitive assurance regarding a potential agreement for their release combined with a ceasefire and prisoner exchange.\n\nFamilies of the missing expressed deep disappointment during Netanyahu's speech. Talya Dancyg, granddaughter of Alex Dancyg, who was recently confirmed dead, expressed her sorrow, stating: \"My grandfather could still be alive with us, he was waiting for someone to come and save him.\"\n\nAnother family member, Nissan Kalderon, questioned the government's actions, saying, \"You are killing our families, give up your political ambitions.\"\n\nOn Thursday, both the IDF and the Israel Security Agency released a statement confirming that commandos had successfully retrieved the bodies of the five hostages. They emphasized their commitment to utilizing all available intelligence and operational resources to achieve the objective of rescuing all hostages.\n\nThe Hostages and Missing Families Forum applauded the military's efforts, describing it as a decisive action that brings closure to the affected families. They urged the government to expedite negotiations with Hamas to facilitate the return of the remaining hostages.\n\nAs military operations persist in Khan Younis, reports indicate that the Israeli forces have engaged with Palestinian fighters, leading to numerous casualties over recent days.

In Khan Younis, 50 terrorist sites were struck. The Israeli Air Force also carried out airstrikes to support ground operations in Rafah and the Netzarim corridor. In addition, the IDF said that its 401st Armored Brigade \"has been conducting precise, intelligence-based operations against terrorist infrastructure and operatives in Tel al-Sultan and Shabura in the Rafah area. During scans in the area, the troops located a tunnel shaft, a large number of weapons, and night vision equipment inside a children's bedroom in a civilian building.\" The Khan Younis operation is aimed at removing terrorist infrastructure in areas that were previously declared a humanitarian zone.

Medics told Reuters news agency that another two people had been killed in a strike in Bani Suhaila, a town to the east where Hamas said it had targeted Israeli forces.\n\nThe UN estimates that more than 150,000 people have been displaced from Khan Younis since Monday, when Israel ordered the evacuation of eastern neighbourhoods that were part of its designated \"humanitarian area\".", "source": {"uri": "bbc.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "BBC"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hostage", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hostage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shin_Bet", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Shin Bet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Israel Defense Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nir_Yitzhak", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nir Yitzhak"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kibbutz", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kibbutz"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commando", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Commando"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Netanyahu", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Benjamin Netanyahu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nir_Oz", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nir Oz"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nir Oz"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khan_Yunis", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Khan Yunis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Khan Yunis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Israel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of Israel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qatar", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Qatar"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Qatar"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internally_displaced_person", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Internally displaced person"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarian_aid", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Humanitarian aid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airstrike", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Airstrike"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doha", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Doha"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Doha"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Qatar"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/de6e/live/edfc5a40-4a67-11ef-aebc-6de4d31bf5cd.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9760941", "eventUri": "eng-9760941", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-10-07", "textStart": 1200, "textEnd": 1209}], "sentiment": 0.03529411764705892, "wgt": 128, "relevance": 1}

Ravid Aryeh Katz, Master Sergeant (Res.) Oren Goldin, Staff Sergeant Tomer Ahimas and Sergeant Kiril Brodski, were rescued in a joint operation of the Commando Brigade Combat Team, the Egoz Unit and the Yahalom Unit with Israel Security Agency (ISA) field analysts and coordinators.\n\nIn recent weeks, an IDF Intelligence Directorate Hostage Headquarters and Shin Bet (ISA) intelligence team carried out intensive intelligence research and interrogations of apprehended suspects to identify the location of the hostages in Khan Younis.\n\nRecently the IDF adjusted the borders of the designated humanitarian zone, encouraging Gaza civilians to move away from the adjusted boundaries so as to escape impending combat.\n\nFollowing precise intelligence information, the forces located an underground tunnel shaft, leading to a tunnel approximately 200 meters in length and 20 meters deep with several rooms where the hostages were located.\n\n\"The Hamas terror organization abducted our hostages and took them into their tunnels, which are 20 meters below the city of Khan Younis,\" Hagari emphasized.\n\n\"This location was previously designated by the IDF as a Humanitarian Area, intended for Gazan civilians to move away from the battlefield and receive humanitarian aid and shelter.\n\n\"Hamas exploited this Humanitarian Area to hold our hostages captive,\" he added.\n\nThe terror organization also launched rocket attacks against Israel from the same humanitarian zone; in fact, Hamas terrorists murdered their own people the same day, when they launched rockets aimed at Israel but instead hit a United Nations (UNRWA) school on Wednesday in Khan Younis. At least two civilians were killed and numerous others were wounded.\n\nHamas Terrorists Kill Gazans at UNRWA School with Failed Rocket Attack Aimed at Israel\n\nPerhaps Hamas believes that hiding the hostages in a tunnel beneath a humanitarian zone would prevent Israeli forces from being able to search for them and rescue them.\n\nIn general, it is a given that Hamas exploits any and all civilian areas as a place from which to launch attacks against Israel. The terrorist organization believes -- or at least, used to believe -- that such a strategy would deter the Israeli military from eliminating its attackers and from rescuing its people still being held captive in the Hamas terror dungeons.\n\nIt's also a strategy that Hamas continues to employ in hopes that Israeli forces will indeed kill Gaza civilians -- a very effective way through media photos to raise outrage and sympathy around the world while bringing down upon the Israeli government the wrath of global leaders, who could then be depended upon to pressure Israel into ending its war for survival.\n\nIn the past, that strategy has worked very well, but not this time around. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is 74 years old. He is in his sixth term as Israel's head of state, serving a total of more than 16 years in the post.\n\nWhether he is reelected again or not, Netanyahu has already secured his place in the history of the state, and has said on multiple occasions that he is personally committed to ending the threat to Israel from Gaza, permanently.", "source": {"uri": "jewishpress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Jewish Press - JewishPress.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "hana_levi_julian@jewishpress.com", "name": "Hana Levi Julian", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shin_Bet", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Shin Bet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel Defense Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarian_aid", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Humanitarian aid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hostage", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hostage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergeant", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sergeant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khan_Yunis", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Khan Yunis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Khan Yunis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_Intelligence_Directorate_(Israel)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Military Intelligence Directorate (Israel)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergeant_major", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sergeant major"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IDF_Spokesperson's_Unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "IDF Spokesperson's Unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commando", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Commando"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Admiral", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Admiral"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNRWA", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "UNRWA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rocket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_of_Israel", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cabinet of Israel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Netanyahu", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Benjamin Netanyahu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_of_state", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Head of state"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Nations"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 86}], "image": "https://www.jewishpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/tunnel-where-hostage-bodies-were-found.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9760941", "eventUri": "eng-9760941", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1607843137254903, "wgt": 125, "relevance": 1}

Miller knows it, and he offered a hilarious warning for Knicks fans when he was on \"The Dan Patrick Show\" on Monday.\n\n\"Just know, the Boogeyman is coming back to town to call the game,\" Miller said. \"I am coming.\"\n\nReggie Miller history with Knicks\n\nIn Miller's 18-seasons with Indiana, he faced the Knicks in the playoffs six times. While both teams split the series 3-3 during that time, Miller was the villain to Knicks fans, and the Basketball Hall of Famer embraced it.\n\nThe most memorable moments in the feud came in 1994 and 1995 NBA playoffs. In Game 5 of the 1994 Eastern Conference Finals, Miller put on a dazzling display with 39 points, 25 of which were scored in the fourth quarter. But during that performance, Miller traded words with director and Knicks superfan Spike Lee. Miller did his infamous \"choke\" gesture at Lee during the win in what is one of the most iconic photos in NBA history. The Knicks would win the series in seven games.\n\nIn Game 1 of the 1995 Eastern Conference Semifinals in New York on May 7, 1995, the Knicks were up 105-99 with 18 seconds left, but Miller pulled off an incredible feat of scoring eight points over the final nine seconds to win the game.\n\nWhat does Reggie Miller expect back in Madison Square Garden?\n\nMiller said on Monday it's never been a big deal whenever he calls games in New York during the regular season, but he expects it to be somewhat hostile this time around.\n\n\"I'm sure I'll hear the chants, I'm sure I'll hear all those naughty words,\" he said. \"I'm good with that, but I'm there to do a job, to call a game.\n\n\"I will be surprised during the game if I don't hear, 'Reggie sucks,'\" Miller added. \"Actually, I'll be a little hurt if I don't hear, 'Reggie sucks.' I kind of want that.\"\n\nMiller also acknowledged the feud he had with Lee during his playing days. He said the two have put their rivalry behind them, but they'll \"forever be linked\" because of their memorable jabs.\n\nThe Knicks are up 1-0 in the series after they won Game 1 on Monday.\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Reggie Miller warns Knicks fans at MSG: 'The Boogeyman is coming'", "source": {"uri": "aol.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Aol"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jordan_mendoza@aol.com", "name": "Jordan Mendoza", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reggie_Miller", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Reggie Miller"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madison_Square_Garden", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Madison Square Garden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Boogeyman_(wrestler)", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "The Boogeyman (wrestler)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Bros._Discovery_Sports", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Warner Bros.

It's all love. Peace and love. Two grown Black men who respect each other,\" he said.\n\nMiller seemed to echo that during the interview on \"The Dan Patrick Show,\" though it didn't seem as emphatic about it as Lee did.\n\n\"We will forever be linked. Now, we have put a lot of our baggage under the bridge,\" Miller said. \"We have been friendly at All-Star Games and he was at when we did the All-Star luncheon for the legends, he was there. He presented an award for me, so we've been kind of cool.\n\n\"But we haven't faced...our Pacers and Knicks have not faced each other.

Indeed, that's precisely why Indiana's famous sharpshooter will likely ruffle some feathers with his presence on Wednesday night\n\nReggie Miller is coming back to MSG\n\nWhen we consider the way in which Monday night's contest ended, Game 2 between the Indiana Pacers and Indiana Pacers was always going to be a heated affair. If you missed Game 1 of the second-round series, you can read more about the outright robbery that occurred here, but alas, I digress. On Wednesday night, the Pacers will look to get back on track against a Knicks team that despite help from the officials, did in fact play some sensational basketball - we're looking at you Jalen Brunson.\n\nYet, it may just be that the Pacers will do so with a secret weapon, albeit one that's off the court. If you haven't heard, Pacers legend Reggie Miller will be at Madison Square Garden on Wednesday night for Game 2 with reports indicating that TNT is bringing him in specifically for this game. As part of the broadcast team, you can expect to hear Millers take on will undoubtedly be a contentious game. Speaking during an interview with Dan Patrick on Monday, Miller couldn't hide his excitement, while taking a cheeky shot at the Knicks and their fans. \"Just know, the Boogeyman is coming back to town to call the game,\" Miller said. \"I am coming.\"\n\nThe Knicks and Reggie Miller go way back.\n\nYou may remember that it was Miller who was at the center of several legendary clashes between the Knicks and Pacers during the 1990s. The most famous of those of course is undoubtedly his \"8 points, 9 seconds\" game, however, nobody will have forgotten the infamous \"choking\" taunt that he made toward diehard Knicks fan and film director, Spike Lee. Consider for a moment that Miller was eventually referred to as the \"Knicks Killer\" due to his performances during that decade.\n\nSurprisingly, Miller was quite matter-of-fact about the harsh reception that he expects from the crowd at MSG, one that is known for being hostile. To that end, the 5-time All-Star admitted that he would be disappointed if he isn't targeted on Wednesday night. \"I'm sure I'll hear the chants, I'm sure I'll hear all those naughty words,\" Miller said. \"I'm good with that, but I'm there to do a job, to call a game. I'm sure this will be a great series. I will be surprised during the game if I don't hear, 'Reggie sucks.' Actually, I'll be a little hurt if I don't hear, 'Reggie sucks.' I kind of want that.\"\n\nInterestingly, Miller also took a moment to touch on the notorious taunt of Lee, something he explained resulted in them being \"forever linked,\" however, he disclosed that both have \"put a lot of our baggage under the bridge.\" Regardless, we should mention once again the circumstances in which Game 1 ended. To be clear, there were a multitude of calls that went against the Pacers as they fell to a 121-117 loss. Most notable among them were a kicked ball that wasn't and a moving screen that never happened. That said, Miller did give a curious take when discussing the possibility of favoring his former team when he takes to the microphone on Wednesday night. \"There won't be any favoritism,\" Miller said. \"For 18 years, was I an Indiana Pacer? Absolutely. But, I'm sure I'll hear the chants, I'm sure I'll hear all those naughty words, I'm good with that. But I'm there to do a job, to call a game.

In fact, Miller did so much damage to the Knicks during that era that he earned the nickname \"Knicks Killer.\"\n\nThe MSG crowd is known for being unfriendly, and Miller is expecting a reaction. In fact, he told Patrick that he'll be somewhat upset if the Knicks fans don't come after him during the game.\n\n\"I'm sure I'll hear the chants, I'm sure I'll hear all those naughty words,\" Miller said. \"I'm good with that, but I'm there to do a job, to call a game.

There were a number of calls that went against the Pacers down the stretch, including a phantom kicked ball violation and a moving screen foul on Myles Turner.\n\nHowever, if Pacers fans were hoping they would at least receive some favoritism on the broadcast, they can think again.\n\n\"There won't be any favoritism,\" Miller said. \"For 18 years, was I an Indiana Pacer?

While the rosters have changed dozens of times since the 1990s, this year's series between the Knicks and Pacers brings Miller and Lee back into the same building.\n\nHere's a look back at the beef between Lee and Miller and how it started.\n\nMORE: Revisiting Knicks-Pacers 1990s rivalry\n\nLee, a fixture at Knicks' games for three decades, regularly trash-talked opposing players during the franchise's run of success in the 1990s. Miller was no exception, and the friction between the two grew because Miller was actually willing to give it right back to Lee.\n\nMiller was a member of the Pacers for all six of Indiana's playoff meetings with the Knicks from 1993-2000, so Lee became a recurring character in his career. Miller said in 2015 that Lee's taunts were \"a little personal,\" even referencing his sister, basketball star Cheryl Miller.\n\n\"I made [Lee] part of the game,\" Miller told the Dan Patrick Show.\n\nLee particularly made a point of taunting Miller when the Knicks and Pacers faced off in the 1994 Eastern Conference Finals. He also unintentionally sparked something in Miller, who notoriously scored 25 fourth-quarter points in Game 5 of the series while going back and forth with Lee. The Pacers won the game, prompting Miller to do his now-iconic choking gesture, though the Knicks would win the final two games of the series and advance to the NBA Finals.\n\nLee believes the tension is behind him and Miller.\n\n\"That stuff is two-plus decades old,\" Lee told the New York Post. \"There's no rivalry between Reggie and I. It's all love.\"\n\nWhile the beef might be a thing of the past, Miller isn't exactly backing down from his role as a Madison Square Garden villain ahead of Game 2, when he will be on the broadcast alongside Brian Anderson and Stan Van Gundy.\n\n\"Actually, I'll be a little hurt if I don't hear, 'Reggie sucks.' I kind of want that,\" Miller said in an appearance on the Dan Patrick Show.\n\nMiller added that while he will call the game fairly as always, Knicks fans should know, \"the boogeyman is coming back to town.\"\n\nMORE: Inside 'Nova Knicks' connection between Knicks stars\n\nMiller made his iconic choking gesture toward the end of Game 5 of the 1994 Eastern Conference Finals after the Knicks blew a 12-point lead in the fourth quarter. Miller scored 25 points in the fourth quarter alone, and the choking gesture was a taunt toward both Lee and Knicks fans as a whole.\n\nThe Knicks not only blew Game 5, but they lost three straight after jumping out to a 2-0 series lead. New York finished the regular season 10 games better than Indiana, so Miller wasn't necessarily wrong to characterize the Knicks as chokers. He just needed the Pacers to win one more game, and that win never came.\n\nMiller had another signature playoff moment against the Knicks a year later when he scored eight points in 8.9 seconds to knock off the Knicks in Game 1 of the East Semifinals, also at Madison Square Garden. This time, the Pacers would win the series in seven games.\n\nWhen he's not cheering on the Knicks at Madison Square Garden, Lee is a film director and producer. He owns 40 Acres and a Mule Filmworks, a production company he founded in 1979 along with Monty Ross.\n\nLee won his first Academy Award in 2019 when his film \"BlacKkKlansman\" won Best Adapted Screenplay.\n\nLee's sports fandom goes beyond the Knicks, though he's most recognizable when clad in Knicks gear while sitting courtside in Manhattan. Lee is a fan of the Yankees and Rangers as well and has made regular appearances at Yankees postseason games.\n\nThe beef between Lee and Miller was featured in ESPN's 30 for 30 documentary, \"Winning Time: Reggie Miller vs. The New York Knicks.\"", "source": {"uri": "sportingnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sporting News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

That would be Reggie Miller, longtime Indiana sharpshooter/Knicks antagonist and current TNT broadcaster.\n\nMiller has primarily worked the Western Conference series between the Denver Nuggets and Minnesota Timberwolves thus far in the second round, but with those two teams off on Wednesday, Miller made the trip to New York to watch his former team face its nemesis.\n\nOn the broadcast, Miller was largely complimentary of the Knicks and their fans. Those same fans were having none of it. As the game drew to a close with a Knicks victory -- their second of the series as they now hold a 2-0 lead -- those New York fans serenaded Miller with chants of \"f--- you Reggie!\"\n\nIn case you can't tell what they're saying, Knicks wing Josh Hart came over to Miller and was caught giving him a playful jab by the TNT cameras. \"I don't know if you heard but I think they're saying, 'f--- you,\" Hart joked. After the game, Hart added that he \"just wanted to make sure he heard what the fans were saying.\"\n\nMiller is responsible for quite a bit of Knicks heartbreak over the years. The Pacers met the Knicks in the playoffs six times during Miller's career, and the two sides split those series three apiece. Most famously, Miller scored eight points in nine seconds to lead the Pacers to a stunning 107-105 victory in Game 1 of their 1995 series. That legendary performance was the difference in the series, as the Pacers won Game 7 and the series to give Miller his first series win over New York.\n\nSimilar chants can be heard during any Knicks playoff series at Madison Square Garden, with the target changing depending on the opponent. Trae Young and Joel Embiid are recent recipients, but there has never been a Knicks villain quite as loathed in New York as Miller.

He embraced the opportunity to return the Madison Square Garden floor where he had so many memorable games and iconic moments.\n\nThe last time Miller played at MSG in the playoffs, he dropped 34 points to eliminate the Knicks in Game 6 of the Eastern Conference Finals. Indiana eventually lost to the Shaq and Kobe Lakers for the 2000 championship. With Miller's return hyped up by the NBA and TNT, the Hall of Famer couldn't resist playing the villain again.\n\nBefore the game, Reggie Miller did what he was known for when in New York:\n\n\"People are like, 'Aren't you worried about going back to NYC & calling a game?' No. I've owned this city. I've owned this building! So why would I be worried about walking on out there, right? I'm looking forward to it.\"\n\nWhile \"Uncle Reg\" was talking trash on national TV, a diehard New York Knicks fan had to respond in the background:\n\nBen Stiller did not say anything but his look and the gesture likely represented everything Knicks fans wanted to do to Reggie Miller. As great as Miller was in Game 6 to send the Knicks on vacation in 2000, he had more iconic moments for the Indiana Pacers. Stiller and some older fans who were at MSG during those times will not have forgotten.\n\nSpike Lee was blasted by the New York media following Miller's 25-point fourth-quarter explosion in Game 5 of the 1994 East Finals. The Academy Award-winning director taunted and talked trash against the legendary shooting guard for most of the game. The Knicks eventually won the series but Miller's lore and reputation only grew following that game.\n\nNearly three decades after that famous back-and-forth between the two, Lee brought framed newspaper clippings of that incredible night. Reggie Miller gladly signed them to commemorate the event. Unlike Lee, Ben Stiller refused to do the \"water under the bridge\" theme.\n\nReggie Miller's presence couldn't help the Pacers from wilting in Game 2 against the Knicks\n\nReggie Miller built a reputation in New York as one of the most dependable players when the stakes are highest. On Wednesday, Miller and Madison Square Garden fans watched as the Pacers wilted under the pressure and intensity of the Knicks. New York bucked the injuries to Jalen Brunson and OG Anunoby to carve a 130-121 win to lead the series 2-0.\n\nMiller was jeered and whistled at by fans multiple times, particularly when the Knicks stormed back to the game starting the third quarter. The Hall of Famer would have relished that back in his heyday as it only spurred him to be at his best. Tyrese Haliburton and Co. didn't have that in them as they limped to a disappointing loss.\n\nLeading into Game 2, Reggie Miller appeared on the Dan Patrick Show and told the host that he expected nothing less than usual from Knicks fans. Miller even said that he'd be hurt if he doesn't hear \"Reggie sucks\" chants. Well, the fans obliged him and then some. Ben Stiller didn't have to say it but words were not needed.\n\nThe Knicks were lucky Miller was on the sidelines calling the game. In the '90s, he would have made them pay. Unfortunately, this version of the Pacers didn't rise to the occasion even with the \"Knicks Killer\" in the house.", "source": {"uri": "sportskeeda.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportskeeda"}, "authors": [{"uri": "michael_macasero@sportskeeda.com", "name": "Michael Macasero", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reggie_Miller", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Reggie Miller"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Stiller", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ben Stiller"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madison_Square_Garden", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Madison Square Garden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TNT_(American_TV_network)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "TNT (American TV network)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naismith_Memorial_Basketball_Hall_of_Fame", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaquille_O'Neal", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shaquille O'Neal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spike_Lee", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spike Lee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Academy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shooting_guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shooting guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Patrick_(sportscaster)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dan Patrick (sportscaster)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrese_Haliburton", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tyrese Haliburton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalen_Brunson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jalen Brunson"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 61}], "image": "https://staticg.sportskeeda.com/editor/2024/05/5c890-17152254182821-1920.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546901", "eventUri": "eng-9546901", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 211, "relevance": 1}

Josh Hart shared a funny moment with former Indiana Pacers legend and current commentator Reggie Miller about a NSFW message from the Knicks fans. \"Nova Knicks\" trio played key roles in the win, with Josh Hart's off-court banter with Reggie Miller stealing the show.\n\nThe New York Knicks took down the Indiana Pacers in Game 2 of the Eastern Conference semifinals on Wednesday night, 130-121. With the win, the Knicks took a commanding 2-0 lead in the series, and look to be in strong position to reach the conference finals.\n\nIt was a team effort from New York to secure the win, with all three of the \"Nova Knicks\" contributing in a massive way to the victory. Jalen Brunson finished with 29 points, despite missing the entirety of the second quarter while dealing with an injury. Donte DiVincenzo added 28 points of his own along with six rebounds and four assists, all while shooting 6-of-12 from beyond the arc. And Josh Hart finished with an impressive 19 points, 15 rebounds, and seven assists on the night.\n\nBut Hart's most impressive play might have come not on the court, but rather from a bit of banter he shared with NBA legend Reggie Miller, who was serving as color commentator on the game for TNT's broadcast team.\n\nThroughout the game, the crowd had jeered Miller, an historic enemy at Madison Square Garden, with chants of \"F--- you Reggie!\"\n\nWith just 22 seconds left on the clock on Wednesday night, Hart made his way over to the commentary table to echo the chants of the home crowd directly into Miller's ear.\n\n\"I don't know if you heard, but I think they're saying, 'F--- you,'\" Hart told Miller.\n\nIt's No Surprise That Reggie Miller Is Still Public Enemy No. 1 at Madison Square Garden Miller orchestrated some of the most iconic moments of his career at the expense of the Knicks\n\nDuring his playing career with the Pacers, Miller was an absolute menace, and often left the Knicks on the losing end of heartbreakers. In Game 5 of the 1994 Eastern Conference finals, Miller dropped 39 points on the Knicks, including 25 in the fourth quarter, to take a 3-2 lead in the series.\n\nWhile the Knicks would go on to win that series, the very next season, Miller would once again bring nightmares to the Garden once again. With the Pacers trailing 105-99 with just 18 seconds to play in Game 1 of the Eastern Conference semifinals, Miller scored eight points in nine seconds to steal a win.\n\nDespite these memories now being 30 years in the past, Madison Square Garden did not forget. Miller certainly heard the chants as he worked to do his job for TNT, but Hart just wanted to make sure the message came through loud and clear. He confirmed as much in the Knicks' locker room after the game.\n\nAs things stand, it looks as though the Knicks will get the last laugh in this round of the ongoing rivalry between MSG and Miller. With their win on Wednesday night, New York jumped out to a 2-0 series lead over Indiana, with Game 3 set to tip off on Friday.\n\nRelated Tom Thibodeau Had a Perfect One-Liner on Jalen Brunson Battling Through Game 2 Injury Brunson played strong in the second half after missing the entire second quarter.", "source": {"uri": "givemesport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GiveMeSport"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Hart", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Josh Hart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reggie_Miller", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Reggie Miller"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madison_Square_Garden", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Madison Square Garden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eastern Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalen_Brunson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jalen Brunson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_commentator", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Color commentator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_on_TNT", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA on TNT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Thibodeau", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tom Thibodeau"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Appraisal_and_Valuation", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Appraisal and Valuation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://static0.givemesportimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/mixcollage-03-may-2024-12-34-pm-3695.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546901", "eventUri": "eng-9546901", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3490196078431373, "wgt": 211, "relevance": 1}

The sharp-shooting, trash-talking Miller repeatedly delivered memorable moments during those epic clashes, especially with Lee sitting courtside.\n\nThe spirited spats included Miller giving the \"choke\" gesture to Lee during a Pacers come-from-behind victory in Game 5 of the 1994 Eastern Conference finals, and Miller scoring eight points in 8.9 seconds late in Game 1 of the 1995 Eastern Conference semifinals.\n\n\"We're two grown men,\" Lee said. \"That's dead and buried. We're good.\"\n\nMiller averaged 23.1 points per game over 35 postseason meetings with the Knicks, during which established himself as the ultimate New York sports villain.\n\nThis year's second-round matchup between the Knicks and Pacers marks the eighth postseason meeting between the teams.\n\nMiller, who spent his entire Hall of Fame career with the Pacers, called the first two games of the Nuggets-Timberwolves series in Denver, then pivoted to Game 2 at the Garden on Wednesday.\n\nFeatured Local Savings\n\nHis pregame stroll onto the Garden court received a subdued reaction from Knicks fans, contrary to his expectations.\n\n\"I'm sure I'll hear the chants,\" Miller said Monday on \"The Dan Patrick Show\" of his Garden return. \"I'm sure I'll hear all those naughty words. I'm good with that, but I'm there to do a job, to call a game. ... I will be surprised during the game if I don't hear 'Reggie sucks.' Actually, I'll be a little hurt.\"\n\nMiller arrived with fighting words.\n\n\"People are like, 'Aren't you worried about going back to New York City and calling a game?' No,\" Miller said Wednesday during on a pregame hit on TNT. \"I've owned this city. I've owned this building, so why would I be worried?\"\n\nMiller joined Brian Anderson, Stan Van Gundy and Chris Haynes -- the trio who called Game 1 -- for Wednesday's broadcast.\n\n\"It's great for the league to have all the former players around,\" said Knicks head coach Tom Thibodeau, who was an assistant during three of those series against Millers' Pacers. \"I think that the tradition of that is important.

When that moment happened, memories may have been evoked from the last time the Knicks felt like they were this good. Of course, no story from that era of Knicks basketball is complete without Reggie Miller.\n\nMiller famously grappled with the Knicks on numerous occasions in the mid-to-late 90s. The most famous encounter between Miller's Pacers and the Knicks occurred 30 years ago in the 1994 Eastern Conference Semifinals. Miller scored eight points in just nine seconds to help lift the Pacers over New York in a crucial Game 5. While New York went on to win the series, it's one of the most infamous moments in NBA Playoffs history, especially when you add Miller's famed choke taunt towards filmmaker and revered Knicks fan, Spike Lee.\n\nSo now that the two teams are colliding again, Miller is following right behind. This week, Miller will be in attendance for Game 2 between the Knicks and the Pacers. The Hall of Famer will call the action from Madison Square Garden as part of TNT's NBA Playoffs coverage.\n\nHe'd have to be crazy not to think about or discuss it.

Miller has told everyone who's worried about him being in MSG to rest easy given the history of success he has in the arena and in New York.\n\n\"I'm looking forward to the atmosphere. People are like, 'Aren't you worried about going back to NYC and calling a game?' No. I've owned this city. I've owned this building, so why would I be worried to walk out there?\"\n\nMiller is referencing his NBA Playoffs battles against the Knicks from the 1990s. Miller gave birth to the '90s rivalry between the franchises that many have been reminiscing on as the Knicks and Pacers meet in Round 2 of the 2024 NBA Playoffs.\n\nMiller averaged 23.1 points, 2.9 rebounds and 2.3 assists in 35 playoff games against the Knicks. He has a 3-3 record in playoff series against the Knicks, losing in 1993, 1994, and 1999 but winning in 1995, 1998, and 2000. It's one of the most enduring rivalries of the '90s and the new generation is just as feisty.\n\nThe Knicks won Game 2 against the Pacers 130-121. The Knicks had 124 points from the starting lineup alone, with Jalen Brunson putting up 29 points while OG Anunoby and Donte DiVincenzo contributed 28 points. Josh Hart put up 19 points, 15 rebounds, and seven assists.\n\nReggie Miller's Iconic New York Beef With Superfan Spike Lee\n\nDuring the Pacers vs. Knicks rivalry in the 1990s, Knicks superfan Spike Lee found himself sitting courtside to watch Miller's heroics in those matchups. As a result, the pair had an acrimonious relationship in the '90s. The 1994 Playoffs served as the genesis of their feud, as Miller scored 25 points in the fourth quarter of Game 5 while trash-talking Spike, who was courtside at MSG.\n\nThis matchup is also infamous for the infamous Reggie Miller choke gesture, as he ended the night with 39 points and a Pacers win, but ended up losing the series.\n\nThis incident was covered massively, with New York newspapers making it front-page news. Before the 2024 series between the franchises, Spike and Miller embraced and shared framed copies of the front pages from their 1994 interaction.\n\nMiller added to his list of iconic moments against the Knicks in 1995 as the Pacers won their first series against New York. In Game 5 of this series, Miller would go off for eight points in 8.9 seconds, a scoring outburst we've only seen bettered by Tracy McGrady years later.\n\nThe current matchup between the Knicks and Pacers doesn't carry the same animosity Miller's era brought about, but the series is fascinating nonetheless.", "source": {"uri": "fadeawayworld.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fadeaway World"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ishaan_bhattacharya@fadeawayworld.net", "name": "Ishaan Bhattacharya", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reggie_Miller", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Reggie Miller"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madison_Square_Garden", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Madison Square Garden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball_positions", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Basketball positions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_commentator", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sports commentator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O.G._Anunoby", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "O.G.

In the Hoosier State, and across the entire NBA, '8 points in 9 seconds' is all you need to say to evoke images of Greg Anthony on the floor, Reggie Miller in hysterics, and Spike Lee in disbelief.\n\nA few notes from Game 1 of that 1995 Eastern Conference Semifinals series:\n\n-Indiana Pacers center Rik Smits (34 points, 7 rebounds) absolutely took it to Patrick Ewing (11 points, 10 rebounds). The Dunking Dutchman's 34 points were a postseason career high.\n\n-Smits and Pacers forward Derrick McKey had both fouled out of the game, and Antonio Davis and Knicks guard Derek Harper were both ejected during the 3rd quarter. Sounds just like 90's hoops to me.\n\n-Reggie Miller's famous Choke Sign, which he directed at Spike Lee, did NOT take place in this game, but it might as well have. It actually happened one year earlier in Game 5 of the 1994 Eastern Conference Finals, when the Pacers outscored the Knicks by 19 in the 4th quarter to take a 3-2 series lead. The only problem was, Indiana lost the next two games and the Knicks advanced to the NBA Finals. The much bigger choke job happened in '95.\n\n-The Knicks had no timeouts left when they were forced to inbound the ball under their own basket after Miller's first triple in the iconic sequence, resulting in a frantic Anthony Mason making a costly error as he tried to inbound to Greg Anthony, who was on the floor.\n\n-The Pacers themselves nearly choked away the game after Miller's back-to-back three's tied the game. Pacers reserve guard Sam Mitchell intentionally fouled John Starks believing that Indiana was still trailing. Starks had a chance to give the Knicks the lead back with seconds remaining... but that didn't happen. 25 years later, Mitchell would recall Reggie Miller telling him that Starks was going to miss both of the free throws.\n\n\"Reggie Miller said basically, 'Mitch, don't worry about it. That you-know-what is gonna choke,'\" Mitchell recounted for NBA.com back in 2020. \"He said that loud so that John Starks could hear it. And as soon as he said it, John Starks turned around and started yelling at Reggie.\"\n\n-Out of frustration, Starks fouled Miller in the aftermath of his own missed free throws, giving Reggie Miller the chance to ice the game at the free throw line.\n\n-Two weeks later, the Pacers would win Game 7 at Madison Square Garden to clinch the series and advance to the Eastern Conference Finals for the second year in a row.\n\nReggie Miller is coming back to MSG\n\nMiller was 18-17 in his postseason career against the Knicks, with Indiana and New York splitting the six series they played against each other in that eight year span. In each of those six series, the team that won Game 1 would go on to win the series. This potentially spells bad news for Indiana this year.\n\nNow a broadcaster for TNT, Reggie Miller will have a front row seat for Game 2, much like his Knicks superfan nemesis Spike Lee did all those years ago.\n\n\"Just know, the Boogeyman is coming back to town to call the game,\" Reggie Miller joked with Dan Patrick on Monday, per ESPN.com. Even though he's there on official business for Turner, the greatest player in Pacers history isn't expecting a warm welcome when he steps inside of Madison Square Garden for another Knicks vs. Pacers postseason matchup.\n\n\"I'm sure I'll hear the chants, I'm sure I'll hear all those naughty words. I'm good with that, but I'm there to do a job, to call a game.\"", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sonny_giuliano@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Sonny Giuliano", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reggie_Miller", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Reggie Miller"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greg_Anthony", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Greg Anthony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rik_Smits", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rik Smits"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spike_Lee", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Spike Lee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jabo_Starks", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jabo Starks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1995_NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "1995 NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derrick_McKey", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Derrick McKey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Mitchell_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sam Mitchell (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonio_Davis", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Antonio Davis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwin_Chapin_Starks", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Edwin Chapin Starks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_foul_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Personal foul (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1994_NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "1994 NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derek_Harper", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Derek Harper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Mason_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Mason (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Ewing", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Patrick Ewing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_throw", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Free throw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TNT_(American_TV_network)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "TNT (American TV network)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN.com", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ESPN.com"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madison_Square_Garden", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Madison Square Garden"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Game_Studies/Education", "label": "dmoz/Games/Game Studies/Education", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Pacers-news-Reggie-Millers-iconic-8-points-in-9-seconds-anniversary-will-ease-sting-of-Game-1-loss-to-Knicks.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546901", "eventUri": "eng-9546901", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 200, "relevance": 1}

The sharp-shooting, trash-talking Miller repeatedly delivered memorable moments during those epic clashes, especially with Lee sitting courtside.\n\nThe spirited spats included Miller giving the \"choke\" gesture to Lee during a Pacers come-from-behind victory in Game 5 of the 1994 Eastern Conference Finals, and Miller scoring eight points in 8.9 seconds late in Game 1 of the 1995 Eastern Conference Semifinals.\n\n\"We're two grown men,\" Lee said. \"That's dead and buried. We're good.\"\n\nMiller averaged 23.1 points per game over 35 postseason meetings with the Knicks, during which established himself as the ultimate New York sports villain.\n\nThis year's second-round matchup between the Knicks and Pacers marks the eighth postseason meeting between the teams.\n\nMiller, who spent his entire Hall of Fame career with the Pacers, called the first two games of the Nuggets-Timberwolves series in Denver, then pivoted to Game 2 at the Garden on Wednesday.\n\n\"I'm sure I'll hear the chants,\" Miller said Monday on \"The Dan Patrick Show\" of his Garden return. \"I'm sure I'll hear all those naughty words. I'm good with that, but I'm there to do a job, to call a game. ... I will be surprised during the game if I don't hear 'Reggie sucks.' Actually, I'll be a little hurt.\"\n\nMiller joined Brian Anderson, Stan Van Gundy and Chris Haynes - the trio who called Game 1 - for Wednesday's broadcast.\n\n\"It's great for the league to have all the former players around,\" said Knicks head coach Tom Thibodeau, who was an assistant during three of those series against Millers' Pacers. \"I think that the tradition of that is important. We're excited we have a number of our guys here as well.\"\n\nLee, too, is enjoying the latest chapter of Knicks-Pacers.", "source": {"uri": "nydailynews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "peter_sblendorio@nydailynews.com", "name": "Peter Sblendorio", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reggie_Miller", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Reggie Miller"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spike_Lee", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Spike Lee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Daily_News", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New York Daily News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TNT_(American_TV_network)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TNT (American TV network)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/She's_Gotta_Have_It_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "She's Gotta Have It (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Academy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madison_Square_Garden", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Madison Square Garden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1995_NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "1995 NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1994_NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "1994 NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Points_per_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Points per game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Anderson_(sportscaster)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brian Anderson (sportscaster)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stan_Van_Gundy", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stan Van Gundy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Thibodeau", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tom Thibodeau"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dan_Patrick_Show", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Dan Patrick Show"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naismith_Memorial_Basketball_Hall_of_Fame", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Online/Play-By-E-Mail", "label": "dmoz/Games/Online/Play-By-E-Mail", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Tile_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Tile Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://www.nydailynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-2149917845.jpg?w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546901", "eventUri": "eng-9546901", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 199, "relevance": 1}

TNT commentator Reggie Miller was a fixture of their six playoff battles in the '90s and was getting serenaded with f**k you chants by Knicks fans, something Josh Hart went over and told him to make sure he knew.\n\n\"I think they're saying f**k you!\"\n\nThe Knicks had secured an 11-point advantage with 22 seconds on the clock, so it makes sense that Hart took that moment to let Miller know how Knicks fans feel about him to this date.\n\nHart had a sensational outing in this game, putting up 19 points, 15 rebounds, and seven assists as the Knicks won the contest 130-121. They now have a 2-0 lead in the series, successfully defending homecourt and heading to Indiana for Games 3 and 4.\n\nIf there had to be a Most Improved Player to be awarded in the NBA Playoffs, Josh Hart would likely be the top candidate. He's averaging 18.0 points, 12.8 rebounds, and 5.3 assists in the playoffs after putting up 9.4 points, 8.3 rebounds, and 4.1 assists in the regular season. He's become one of the league's highest-volume rebounders at 6'5\", stepping in and playing power forward in Julius Randle's absence.\n\nIf the Knicks close the series out, it will be their first Conference Finals appearance in 25 years while the highest-paid player on the team sits out with injury.\n\nReggie Miller Didn't Care About How Knicks Fans Will Treat Him\n\nReggie Miller knew he had to walk into MSG and sit in the commentary booth, visible to the tens of thousands of fans in the arena. Miller gave the Knicks a hard time in their classic rivalry from 1993 to 2000, as the teams met in six playoff matchups over those eight years. Their overall series record is tied at 3-3, with this being one of the best rivalries of the '90s.\n\nAhead of his return to MSG, Miller made it clear he wasn't scared of Knicks fans.\n\n\"I'm looking forward to the atmosphere. People are like, 'Aren't you worried about going back to NYC and calling a game?' No. I've owned this city. I've owned this building, so why would I be worried to walk out there?\"\n\nMiller was the protagonist in most of the Pacers' wins in this rivalry, with two iconic moments against the Knicks in the 1994 and 1995 Playoffs. In 1994, Miller scored 25 points in the fourth quarter to erase a 12-point Knick lead and win Game 5 of the series. This performance is remembered as Miller trash-talked Spike Lee and ended the game with a choking gesture at Knicks fans.\n\nThe Knicks had won the 1994 series and went on to the NBA Finals, but the Pacers bounced back in 1995. Miller scored eight points in 8.6 seconds to seal another clutch Game 5 win in a series that Indiana would actually end up winning. He averaged 23.1 points, 2.9 rebounds and 2.3 assists in 35 playoff games. He is still loathed in New York for those excellent performances.", "source": {"uri": "fadeawayworld.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fadeaway World"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ishaan_bhattacharya@fadeawayworld.net", "name": "Ishaan Bhattacharya", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Hart", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Josh Hart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reggie_Miller", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Reggie Miller"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TNT_(American_TV_network)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TNT (American TV network)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MSG_Network", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "MSG Network"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Most_Improved_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA Most Improved Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clutch_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Clutch (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spike_Lee", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spike Lee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Action", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Action", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Tile_Games/Spectrangle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Tile Games/Spectrangle", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://fadeawayworld.net/.image/ar_1.91%2Cc_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_faces:center%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MjA2MzAzOTUwNjc5MzIwMzM5/usatsi_23224396.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546901", "eventUri": "eng-9546901", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 199, "relevance": 1}

Miller, doing his part, told the Knicks fans that he \"owns this city, owns this building [the Garden.]\" At one point he even called himself the Knicks' \"boogeyman.\"\n\nWell, the boogeyman got his. As time was winding down in the fourth quarter and with the Knicks pulling away, New York forward Josh Hart made sure Miller understood what the Garden faithful were chanting. He ran over to the annoucer's table, up to Miller and told him, \"I don't know if you heard, but I think they said, F**k you.\" Miller and everyone watching the broadcast got to hear it.\n\nThere's no doubt that the Knicks have electrified New York City. The two teams will now head to Indiana to face the Pacers Friday night in the best-of-seven Eastern Conference Semifinals.\n\nSpike Lee's expected to be there. So is Reggie Miller.", "source": {"uri": "outkick.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "OutKick"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mike_gunzelman@outkick.com", "name": "Mike Gunzelman", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reggie_Miller", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Reggie Miller"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TNT_(American_TV_network)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TNT (American TV network)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naismith_Memorial_Basketball_Hall_of_Fame", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madison_Square_Garden", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Madison Square Garden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Ewing", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Patrick Ewing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spike_Lee", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spike Lee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Yankees", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York Yankees"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Red_Sox", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boston Red Sox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Sinatra", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Frank Sinatra"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2022 NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Hart", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Josh Hart"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Appraisal_and_Valuation", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Appraisal and Valuation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 66}], "image": "https://static.outkick.com/www.outkick.com/content/uploads/2024/05/JOSH-HART-KNICKS-REGGIE-MILLER-PACERS.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546901", "eventUri": "eng-9546901", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1607843137254903, "wgt": 198, "relevance": 1}

The all-time NBA great was on the announcing team for this game taking place at Madison Square Garden. Having the pleasure of witnessing his team go down 0-2 in the series, he was then reminded of just how every New Yorker felt about him, courtesy of Knick, Josh Hart.\n\nThe New York Knicks had Game 2 effectively sealed with 22 seconds still left in the contest. It is at this point in the game that Hart decided to make his move to the broadcaster's table.\n\nAt the time, fans could be heard screaming \"F**k you, Reggie!,\" at the top of their lungs. And if there was any chance that Miller may not have picked up on that, the NY guard made sure to reiterate the message right to his face, saying, \"I'm not sure but I think they're saying 'F**k you.'\"\n\nReggie Miller could have avoided this. Before this game tipped off, he was asked if he was worried about going back to New York to announce this game. The legend simply said, \"I've owned this city. I've owned this building.\".\n\nWhere did this energy come from? Well, the Knicks and the Pacers were two powerhouses that locked horns on numerous occasions during the 90s. These two teams featured an action-packed roster, with Miller spearheading the Pacers against the Knicks.\n\nDuring this era, Miller had several massive performances against New York, including when he scored 39 points in Game 5 of the 1994 Eastern Conference Finals. And given how much he loved to talk smack, the icon was never going to be endearing himself to Knicks fans.\n\nSo, suffice it to say, Miller may well have rightfully 'owned' New York back then. However, if you can dish it out, you must also be strong enough to take it. And sure enough, after their team's victory, the Knicks fandom was never going to let him walk Scott free.\n\nThe New York Knicks' may be one of the most brutal fanbases in the entire NBA. Shouting obscenities and going the extra mile to express sheer hatred toward opposing players and teams, this group will do whatever it can to get into the opposition's head.\n\nOf course, when things go wrong for New York, it should only be fair game for an opposing star to shout a few taunts back at them. However, this fandom does not adhere to logic whatsoever. Unfortunately for him, Reggie Miller had to find that out the hard way.\n\nThe legend had one of the most jaw-dropping performances in NBA history. Miller scored 8 points in 9 seconds against the New York Knicks back in Game 1 of the 1995 Eastern Conference Semifinals that changed the course of the game and eventually, the series.\n\nOf course, this also came the year after Reggie Miller almost knocked the Knicks out of the playoffs, before executing his famous 'Choke' gesture during Game 5 of the 1994 Eastern Conference Semifinals.\n\nNeedless to say, Reggie Miller and the fans of New York do not get along. While there is likely a level of respect in every fan's mind for the all-time great, it will likely be a millennium (maybe longer) before the former Indiana Pacers man gets any kind of ovation at Madison Square Garden.", "source": {"uri": "thesportsrush.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The SportsRush"}, "authors": [{"uri": "abhishek_dhariwal@thesportsrush.com", "name": "Abhishek Dhariwal", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reggie_Miller", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Reggie Miller"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1994_NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "1994 NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madison_Square_Garden", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Madison Square Garden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1995_NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "1995 NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Adventure", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Adventure", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Online/Play-By-E-Mail", "label": "dmoz/Games/Online/Play-By-E-Mail", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 52}], "image": "https://cdn-wp.thesportsrush.com/2024/05/f0c526c0-untitled-design-2024-05-09t100332.138.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546901", "eventUri": "eng-9546901", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 197, "relevance": 1}

Like always, the Knicks crowd provided a great atmosphere and were extremely active during the game. The Knicks and Pacers have a storied rivalry, and the series feels like it means something to both team's fans beyond the playoffs. Pacers legend and Hall of Famer Reggie Miller was back at Madison Square Garden to call the game, and it was a big deal for Knicks fans. Reggie was a thorn in the side of the Knicks in the 90s, and the crowd made sure to give him a warm welcome. Knicks guard Josh Hart had to let Reggie know.\n\nAs the Knicks began to assert their dominance in the game's final minutes, the New York fans decided to add their unique touch to the proceedings. They chose to shower Reggie Miller once again, a gesture that was both humorous and a testament to their passion for the game. Miller, who had been flown in by TNT for Game 2, was calling the Nuggets and Timberwolves series, which had an extended break until Friday's Game 3. The crowd chanted in unison, \"F*** you Reggie!\" Reggie and the broadcast crew were oblivious to the chants because of their headsets, so Josh Hart went over to Reggie during a dead ball and hilariously let the Pacers legend know what was up.\n\nRead More: Tracy Morgan Gives Tyrese Maxey The Middle Finger As He Torches Knicks\n\nYou can hear Josh Hart drop the f-bomb while letting Reggie know. The moment was just another highlight in what has been an entertaining playoff from the New York Knicks. The games at MSG have been a show. The atmosphere and passion of the fans make the games feel special. Reggie Miller being back at MSG was just another fun wrinkle in the proceedings. He et up with his old frenemy Spike Lee, and even Ben Stiller jokingly gave him the middle finger while passing him by.\n\nIt's good times in New York, but there are some major worries for the Knicks. Jalen Brunson left the game in the first quarter with a foot injury but was able to return in the second half. Knicks defensive stopper OG Anunoby left the game in the fourth quarter with what appeared to be a hamstring injury. That will be a major blow for the Knicks if he has to miss time. The Knicks' big man Mitchell Robinson is currently out, and he has the same injury he received from Joel Embiid's dirty play. Overall, whoever is playing for the Knicks will leave everything on the floor, and the fans will be 100% behind them, chanting, \"F*** you Reggie.\"", "source": {"uri": "hotnewhiphop.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "HotNewHipHop"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jamil_david@hotnewhiphop.com", "name": "Jamil David", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reggie_Miller", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Reggie Miller"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madison_Square_Garden", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Madison Square Garden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Hart", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Josh Hart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naismith_Memorial_Basketball_Hall_of_Fame", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrese_Maxey", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tyrese Maxey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TNT_(American_TV_network)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "TNT (American TV network)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tracy_Morgan", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tracy Morgan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Timberwolves", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Timberwolves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Nuggets", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Denver Nuggets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O.G._Anunoby", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "O.G.

And of course, there was Spike Lee, who brought Miller a present: Copies of the New York papers from when the two had their infamous run-in back in the 1990s, which Miller went on to sign.\n\nEverything about Reggie being back at the Garden is really cool, and kudos to two of the biggest Knicks fans out there for leaning into it.", "source": {"uri": "uproxx.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "UPROXX"}, "authors": [{"uri": "derrick_rossignol@uproxx.com", "name": "Derrick Rossignol", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "steven_hyden@uproxx.com", "name": "Steven Hyden", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "aaron_williams@uproxx.com", "name": "Aaron Williams", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "wongo_okon@uproxx.com", "name": "Wongo Okon", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "megan_armstrong@uproxx.com", "name": "Megan Armstrong", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reggie_Miller", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Reggie Miller"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eastern Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madison_Square_Garden", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Madison Square Garden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Stiller", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ben Stiller"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inside_the_NBA", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Inside the NBA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spike_Lee", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spike Lee"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Education_and_Training", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Education and Training", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Appraisal_and_Valuation", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Appraisal and Valuation", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/rm.jpg?w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546901", "eventUri": "eng-9546901", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 194, "relevance": 1}

No! I've owned this city and I've owned this building, so why would I be worried about walking on out there.\"\n\nTowards the end of the Knicks 130-121 Game 2 win, the crowd was heard chanting \"F you\" to the former Pacers player, who is certainly used to it, as he had been booed for six playoff series throughout the 1990's in that same arena.\n\nJosh Hart, 19 points and 15 rebounds, walked over to the announcer table with 22.5 seconds left in the game, to tell Miller what the crowd was chanting, \"I'm not sure if you heard, but I think they saying F*** you.\" And this was heard on the TV broadcast.\n\nNot only that, Miller's old rival Spike Lee, Oscar-winning film director, had him sign framed pictures before the game.\n\nOne of the most iconic moments in NBA history is when Miller took over in Game 5 of the 1994 Eastern Conference Finals in MSG, scoring 25 fourth-quarter points. This was the game that the Pacers' sharpshooter famously gave Spike the \"choke signal\" before hitting a long three-pointer, and then afterwards telling the famous courtside Knicks' fan to shut up, as he helped lead Indiana to win 93-86.\n\nThis moment in history has not been forgotten, especially by New Yorkers, as the 18-year NBA vet, Miller stated on a social media live video while strolling the streets of NYC before the game, \"I live rent free in a lot of New Yorkers' heads, and as you can see they are still mad.\"\n\nIn the six playoff matchups between Miller and the Knicks, the Pacers split the series, 3-3, as Miller averaged 23.1 points, 2.9 rebounds and 2.3 assists against his rival in 35 playoff games.\n\nFast forward to current day, the second-seeded Knicks and sixth-seeded Pacers have proven to carry the nostalgia of one of the best rivalries in NBA history. To point out, both franchises are longing for a championship, as the Knicks haven't won one since 1973, while the Pacers are still looking for their first.\n\nDuring the first quarter, Jalen Brunson left the game with a sore right foot, but pulled a Willis Reed, returning after halftime to score 24 of his 29 points in the second half, which helped contribute to the Knicks outsourcing the Pacers 36-18 in the third quarter.\n\nNot to mention, Brunson passed Carmelo Anthony in playoff points (591) in Game 2, after scoring 43 in Game 1, leading the Knicks to two straight victories at home to go up 2-0 in the series; Game 3 will be played in Indiana on Friday, May 10 at 7pm ET (ESPN).", "source": {"uri": "fanbuzz.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "FanBuzz - Sports News - NFL | NCAA | NBA |  WWE"}, "authors": [{"uri": "brandon_santomauro@fanbuzz.com", "name": "Brandon Santomauro", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reggie_Miller", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Reggie Miller"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madison_Square_Garden", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Madison Square Garden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TNT_(American_TV_network)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TNT (American TV network)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Hart", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Josh Hart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spike_Lee", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spike Lee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1994_NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "1994 NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-point_field_goal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Three-point field goal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willis_Reed", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Willis Reed"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalen_Brunson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jalen Brunson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carmelo_Anthony", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Carmelo Anthony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Tile_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Tile Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://fanbuzz.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2022/05/Reggie-Miller-choke-sign.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546901", "eventUri": "eng-9546901", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-10", "textStart": 2774, "textEnd": 2780}], "sentiment": 0.2156862745098038, "wgt": 194, "relevance": 1}

Knicks superfan Spike Lee and former Pacers guard Reggie Miller were on hand for Game 2 of their series in the Eastern Conference semifinals.\n\nBefore tip-off, Lee was captured sitting in his usual courtside seat at Madison Square Garden. This time, he was accompanied with two framed front pages from the the day after the Knicks' infamous loss to the Pacers in Game 5 of the 1994 conference finals.\n\nThe headlines criticized Lee for arguing with Miller during the game. Many felt it motivated Miller to score 25 second-half points in the victory. He broke out the iconic choking gesture late in the game after the Knicks blew a 12-point, fourth-quarter lead. After the loss, the Knicks went on to capture the series before falling to the Houston Rockets in the Finals.\n\nMiller and Lee also had another moment the following season in the conference semifinals. Miller scored eight points in 8.9 seconds to lead the Pacers to another comeback in the series opener. This time, the Pacers won the series before losing to Shaquille O'Neal and the Orlando Magic in the conference finals.\n\nBoth Miller and Lee have said they are far past their days as rivals. Still, it's nice to see them find another opportunity to take center stage during one of the NBA's most heated matchups. The Knicks are having their best season since those days of competing for supremacy with the Pacers and Michael Jordan-led Chicago Bulls in the 1990s.

Don't know if you heard, though,\" Hart told Miller.\n\nThe entire incident, including the expletives directed at Miller, was audible on the broadcast.\n\nBefore the game, Knicks superfan Spike Lee shared a moment with Miller, who played for the Pacers during all six of Indiana's playoff matchups against the Knicks from 1993 to 2000.\n\nOne of the most memorable moments from those years occurred during Game 5 of the 1994 Eastern Conference finals, when Miller and Lee engaged in a heated exchange throughout the game.\n\nThe game became a part of NBA history as Miller scored 25 points in the fourth quarter, during which he pulled off his now-iconic choking taunt.\n\nFollowing the game, New York newspapers pointed fingers at Lee for his taunting of Miller during the game, although the Knicks ultimately won the final two games of the series and advanced to the NBA Finals.\n\nLee had copies of those newspapers framed and had them signed by Miller.\n\nJosh Hart tallies huge double-double in Knicks' Game 2 win\n\nJosh Hart continued to be a key piece for the New York Knicks in Game 2, playing all 48 minutes and recording a monster stat line.\n\nJosh Hart had 19 points, 15 rebounds and seven assists for the Knicks, who outhustled the Pacers to eke out a 130-121 victory and take a 2-0 lead in the Eastern Conference semifinals.\n\nThe two other members of the Knicks' \"Villanova Trio\" also had stellar outings.

It all happened during a Mitchell Robinson injury scare that limited the Knicks' frontcourt plan going forward.

Miller accused the home team of playing with an unfair advantage and said, \"You're playing 5 vs 8...you're playing the officials as well.\"\n\nHe did not stop there though, he continued to call out the Knicks and said, \"People are like 'aren't you worried about going back to NYC & calling a game?' No. I've owned this city. I've owned this building.\" While the NBA legend was saying this, Knicks superfan Ben Stiller was caught in the frame pointing fingers towards Miller.\n\nThe hate stems from his series heroics against the Knicks, which reached its peak in game 7 of the 1995 playoff series. Miller dropped 29 points in that game to send the NY franchise packing before falling to Shaquille O'Neal and his Orlando Magic side.\n\nThe Knicks fans retaliated at the dying embers of the game, and they made sure their opinion of Reggie was heard loud and clear.\n\nWith around 30 seconds remaining on the clock before the final buzzer, Madison Square Garden suddenly came alive. Chants of \"F**k you Reggie\" broke out in the arena, which kept going even after the end of the game.\n\nThe Knicks' Josh Hart also went up to the 5-time NBA All-Star to let him know what was being chanted.

Though the six get-togethers were evenly split, the series' defining moment has been Miller's eight-point output in just under nine seconds during Game 1 of the 1995 conference semifinals at MSG.\n\nMiller serves as a game analyst for TNT Sports, which is set to air Games 2 and, if necessary, 5.

Brian Anderson and Stan Van Gundy will join Miller and reprise their roles from Game 1, as will sideline reporter Chris Haynes.\n\nKnicks fans no doubt miss the familiarity of MSG Network, where Mike Breen and Walt \"Clyde\" Frazier serve as the voices of the regular season.

That's how it is. That's my job, to call it like I see it,\" Miller said, comparing his coverage to Troy Aikman and Tony Romo calling Dallas Cowboys games for ESPN and CBS respectively. \"There won't be any favoritism.

Listening to Reggie Miller and Stan Van Gundy isn't for the weak.\n\nBefore tip-off, Miller said, \"I've owned this city. I've owned this building.\" May 7 marked 29 years since Miller scored eight points in nine seconds to beat the Knicks in Game 1 of the 1995 Eastern Conference Semifinals.\n\nNot to diminish what was (unfortunately) an incredible feat, but Miller went 7-27 in games played at MSG. It's a stretch to say he owned the city and building. Still, TNT decided to have Miller on the call for the first Knicks-Pacers semifinals matchup in 11 years. Too bad he didn't get the end result he or Indiana wanted!\n\nWith under a minute left to play, fans at MSG broke out in a \"F*** you, Reggie\" chant.\n\nJosh Hart, who recorded another 48-minute game, strolled over to Miller to ensure the former Pacer knew what Knicks fans were chanting.\n\nOkay, Kendrick Perkins isn't technically a Knicks fan, and he tweeted before the game ended, but his opinion is still worth sharing. You'd think everyone tuned into the game to listen to Miller talk about his glory days rather than watch New York and Indiana in the year 2024.\n\nNever change, Frank.\n\nReggie had the best seat in the house! You know he was happy when the Pacers went into the half with a 10-point lead, but then Jalen Brunson happened. After missing the second quarter with a sore right foot, he scored 24 points in the second half.

After sharing a moment with Spike Lee before the game, Miller sat in with Brian Anderson and Stan Van Gundy to call the action.\n\nAs it became clear the Knicks would win the game, the MSG faithful started chanting \"F--- you, Reggie.\"\n\nA funny moment to be sure, but did Miller hear the chants? Josh Hart went over to make sure Miller heard what they were saying. Unfortunately for TNT, Miller's mic was still on.\n\nIf there was any question whether Hart was a New York basketball legend before hurling an F-bomb into Miller's mic during a playoff victory at MSG, well, that question has been answered.\n\nIn addition to swearing at Miller on national television during the playoffs, Hart had 19 points, 15 rebounds and seven assists.

Without Julius Randle, Mitchell Robinson, and Bojan Bogdanovic, the Knicks lost two more key players in Game 2 of their first round series against the Indiana Pacers. Jalen Brunson didn't play in the second quarter after suffering a foot injury, and OG Anunoby left the game in the third quarter with a hamstring injury.\n\nBrunson returned and led the Knicks to a thrilling comeback win, 130-121, over the Pacers. The Knicks have a 2-0 series lead after taking care of business at home. The Knicks are two wins away from reaching the conference finals for the first time since 2000.\n\nAs the Knicks were putting the finishing touches on their latest gritty victory, Josh Hart delivered a special message for one of New York's biggest rivals ever. Pacers legend Reggie Miller was calling the game on TNT, and the fans started chanting his name with a certain four-letter expletive attached as the clock was expiring in the fourth quarter. Hart walked up to Miller and said \"I don't know if you heard, but I think they said 'fuck you.'\"\n\nThe TV mics picked up Hart's message perfectly. Watch the video here:\n\nHart speaks for all Knicks fans on this one. There's nothing sweeter than beating the Pacers with Miller sitting in the front row.\n\nThe Knicks are Brunson's team right now, but Hart continues to feel like their emotional leader. He's playing the part of a hard-nosed star role player perfectly, right down to telling Reggie Miller to f*** off.\n\nThe Knicks are rolling right now, but Anunoby's injury hangs over their win. New York can't afford to lose any more players with the series going back to Indiana. The Pacers have played tough basketball, and shouldn't be discounted in this series. The mighty No. 1 seed Boston Celtics are likely waiting in the Eastern Conference Finals if the Knicks do advance.\n\nRight now, it's all gravy for the Knicks. The team is playing inspired basketball and winning hard-fought games in crunch time even as the injuries pile up. Telling Reggie Miller that Knicks fans hate him right to his face is just the icing on the cake.", "source": {"uri": "sbnation.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SB Nation"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ricky_o_donnell@sbnation.com", "name": "Ricky O'Donnell", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reggie_Miller", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Reggie Miller"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O.G._Anunoby", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "O.G.

But no celebrity is more associated with the franchise than filmmaker Spike Lee.\n\nLee, 67, has been a Knicks staple for decades. His dedication to New York City's NBA team has made him one of the most recognizable fans in the sport.\n\nThe Oscar winner's allegiance to the Knicks has tied him to some of the biggest moments in the franchise's history. But how did he end up a Knicks fan in the first place?

He's frequently seen chatting with the players, as he sits close enough that he can give them a piece of his mind.\n\nLee's most famous moment as a Knicks fan was his interaction with Pacers star Reggie Miller during Game 5 of the 1994 Eastern Conference Finals. Lee was credited for motivating Miller's legendary 24-point fourth quarter to complete a comeback win over the Knicks, but New York went on to win the series anyway.\n\nThe filmmaker has plenty more memorable moments as a Knicks superfan at Madison Square Garden, some of which you can watch below.\n\nLee stuck with the Knicks even during New York's darkest days as a franchise, and now he's seen it through as the 2024 squad looks to make a run to the Eastern Conference Finals for the first time in 24 years.", "source": {"uri": "sportingnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sporting News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spike_Lee", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Spike Lee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madison_Square_Garden", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Madison Square Garden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Rock", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chris Rock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tracy_Morgan", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tracy Morgan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Stiller", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ben Stiller"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fat_Joe", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fat Joe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sporting_News", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Sporting News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myles_Turner", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Myles Turner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willis_Reed", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Willis Reed"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Academy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1994_NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "1994 NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reggie_Miller", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reggie Miller"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay-Z", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jay-Z"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show_Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://ng-sportingnews.com/s3/files/styles/twitter_card_120x120/s3/2024-05/nba-plain--c47770bb-e376-46c5-8758-b91fefd7c348.jpeg?itok=f7MK3KV5", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546901", "eventUri": "eng-9546901", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 160, "relevance": 1}

Our Game 2 betting analysis and prediction", "body": "The Knicks will look to take a commanding 2-0 series lead over the Indiana Pacers in Game 2 at Madison Square Garden on Wednesday night.\n\nTrailing for most of the first half and down by as many as nine points early in the fourth quarter, New York rallied for a 121-117 win Monday night in Game 1 of the Eastern Conference semifinals.\n\nIf the Knicks are victorious in Game 2, it'll be the second straight playoff series they would be up by multiple games against their opponent.\n\nWill New York further extend its lead or can the Pacers earn a split on the road with the series shifting back to Indiana?\n\nHere's our betting breakdown on the spread, total and moneyline prediction for Game 2 at MSG:\n\nMore: From celebrities to diehards, how NY Knicks fans sitting courtside are rocking The Garden\n\nNY Knicks vs. Pacers spread: Knicks -5 (-110), Pacers +5.5 (-115)\n\nAfter being a 6-point favorite in Game 1, the betting lines for Game 2 are not much different with New York ranging from a 5 to 5.5-point point favorite on sportsbooks in New Jersey for Wednesday.\n\nIn four matchups this season, the Pacers are now 3-1 against the spread (ATS) this season (regular season and postseason).\n\nWhen the two organizations have faced off at MSG, Indiana has covered in two of the three meetings, with the lone exception being a 109-105 Knicks win on Feb. 1 when New York was a 2-point favorite.\n\nPacers point guard Tyrese Haliburton has notably struggled since making his first All-Star appearance in mid-February and that continued in Game 1, where he finished with a playoff-low six points on only six shot attempts despite playing 36 minutes.\n\nI expect Haliburton to bounce back and for Indiana to keep it close again in Game 2, covering this number.\n\nBetMGM is the only sportsbook in N.J. that currently offers the Pacers still at +5.5 with a price of -115 (Bet $115 to win $100).\n\nPrediction: Pacers +5.5 (-115)\n\nNY Knicks vs. Pacers total: Over 220 points (-110), Under 220.5 points (-110)\n\nKnown for terrific defense and low-scoring games, the total for the Knicks has exceeded 230-plus points in three of their last five contests.\n\nGiven the recent history, the over/under sits the highest its been so far for New York this postseason.\n\nEven with that being said, I'd still take the over here.\n\nThe Pacers are giving up 111.7 points per game to opponents in the playoffs, which featured a first round series against the Milwaukee Bucks -- who didn't have former MVP Giannis Antetokounmpo for all six games.\n\nWhile the Knicks only scored 49 points in the first half in Game 1, it was clear they found a rhythm in the final two quarters, as they scored 72 points in the second half.\n\nThe number 238 for total points might be out of the equation for Game 2, but I'm pretty confident these two teams combine to eclipse this total at MSG.\n\nIf you bet the over, 220 is the best number available with a price of -110 (Bet $110 to win $100) on a handful of sportsbooks.\n\nPrediction: Over 220 points (-110)\n\nKnicks' nemesis throughout the years: Knicks' all-time villains: Ranking fans' most hated opponents at Madison Square Garden\n\nNY Knicks vs. Pacers moneyline: Knicks -198 (Bet $198 to win $100), Pacers +170 (Bet $100 to win $170)\n\nThere's no denying the Pacers gave the Knicks a run for their money in Game 1. If not for late-game heroics from Jalen Brunson (21 of his 43 points came in the fourth quarter), New York could've easily found itself down 1-0 with a must-win scenario come Wednesday.\n\nHowever, that's not the case.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, I anticipate Haliburton will shoot more and have a bigger impact than he had on Monday night. He needs to if Indiana has any chance of reaching its first conference finals since in a decade (2013-14).\n\nWith that being said, I expect we see another close Knicks playoff game, as all but one outcome has been decided by single digits.\n\nIt's going to be another must-watch fourth quarter of Knicks basketball, with New York narrowly taking Game 2 and heading to the Hoosier State two wins away from their first Eastern Conference finals appearance since the turn of the century.\n\nDraftKings Sportsbook has the shortest odds at -198 (Bet $198 to win $100) for the Knicks to take a 2-0 series lead tonight.", "source": {"uri": "lohud.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Journal News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madison_Square_Garden", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Madison Square Garden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrese_Haliburton", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tyrese Haliburton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eastern Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sportsbook", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sportsbook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Point guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New Jersey"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Jersey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DraftKings", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "DraftKings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giannis_Antetokounmpo", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Giannis Antetokounmpo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalen_Brunson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jalen Brunson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee_Bucks", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee Bucks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Points_per_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Points per game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Gaming", "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Gaming", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Murder-Mystery_and_Deduction", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Murder-Mystery and Deduction", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/authoring/authoring-images/2024/05/07/PNJM/73597847007-usatsi-23207363.jpg?auto=webp&crop=4527,2547,x0,y235&format=pjpg&width=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546901", "eventUri": "eng-9546901", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-02-01", "textStart": 1338, "textEnd": 1344}], "sentiment": 0.2078431372549019, "wgt": 160, "relevance": 1}

However, Brunson would return in the third quarter to lead a big run to push New York to an 8-point edge entering the fourth.

Miller and the broadcast crew were fairly oblivious to the loud \"F**k You Reggie\" chant cascading down from the crowd (or at least did a good job ignoring it) until Josh Hart came over to their broadcast table to make sure Miller knew exactly what the New York faithful were saying.\n\nBrian Anderson's nervous laugh as Hart's f-bomb hit Miller's hot mic really makes this -- at that point the audience had heard that word very clearly a number of times by way of the chant.

It still hurts to write that.\n\nSo, as the Knicks wrapped up an impressive playoff victory despite missing many starters due to injury, the \"fuck you\" chorus began. It was obviously ignored by the broadcasting team, but they could not overlook Hart's approaching them during free throws to make sure Miller knew what the Knicks fans were chanting.\n\n\"I think they said 'fuck you,'\" Hart said to Miller, after which play-by-play announcer Brian Anderson said, \"Uh, oh. Josh Hart coming over and let Reggie have it\" with a chuckle.\n\nTo be fair, this was all good-natured trash talk, and Miller's continued claim that he \"owns\" this city, as he said in a pre-game interview, is the sort of fun-spirited braggadocio that makes him the perfect villain for Knicks fans.\n\nSince joining the Knicks, Hart has become a fan favorite because of his gritty play, incredible rebounding, and all-around hustle. He also co-hosts a podcast with his teammate Jalen Brunson, which is smart and funny and only adds to the legend of these two \"Nova Knicks.\"", "source": {"uri": "mediaite.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mediaite"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reggie_Miller", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Reggie Miller"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TNT_(American_TV_network)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TNT (American TV network)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madison_Square_Garden", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Madison Square Garden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuck", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fuck"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_throw", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Free throw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Hart", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Josh Hart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Anderson_(sportscaster)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brian Anderson (sportscaster)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalen_Brunson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jalen Brunson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_commentator", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sports commentator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show_Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://www.mediaite.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Screenshot-2024-05-09-at-7.18.06\u202fAM.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546901", "eventUri": "eng-9546901", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2705882352941176, "wgt": 152, "relevance": 1}

The five-time NBA All-Star had some interesting points during the game and it included veteran point guard Chris Paul.\n\nThe Pacers-Knicks series relives an old 90s rivalry and it has delivered on giving fans a dose of physical basketball. One of these moments came when Donte DiVincenzo brought the ball down before the mid-court while being chased by Myles Turner. DiVincenzo slowed down his speed, making the Pacers center hit him on his back.\n\nSeeing this play had Reggie Miller comparing it to Chris Paul and it had earned quite some interesting comments on social media. One fan transcribed it and intentionally replaced one word similar to how it sounded.\n\n\"I kinda saw this in years past from Chris Paul. When he would get ahead of you and just kinda stop and make the defender c** on his back,\" said @Jabberdome.\n\nChris Paul and the Golden State Warriors were eliminated in the NBA Western Conference Play-In Tournament and even if he is not playing, he seems to get into basketball discussions as expressed by 'The Cool'.\n\n\"Cp3 always catching strays,\" said @biohazard1029.\n\nOf course, some agree with Miller's comments on Chris Paul's dirty tactics on the basketball court.\n\n\"Classic CP.. all the time,\" said one fan.\n\n\"I expect nothing more from Chris Paul,\" said another fan.\n\n\"Chris Paul was out there getting his back shined every night,\" one fan said.\n\nIn the age of the internet, some basketball fans don't just see the comments but also the underlying message that many reacted to.\n\nReggie Miller gets the attention for multiple reasons\n\nStill fresh in many 90s basketball fans is the rivalry between Reggie Miller and the New York Knicks. ESPN even did a '30 for 30' documentary about it and this series gets the chance for basketball fans to rekindle the rivalry.\n\nRight before the game started, the former Indiana Pacers guard was asked if he was scared of coming to New York but gave a very 'Reggie Miller' response.\n\n\"People are like, 'Aren't you worried about going back to New York City and calling a game?' No! I've owned this city. I've owned this building! So why would I be worried about walking on out there?\" said Miller.\n\nSpike Lee also figured in the rivalry making headlines after trash-talking with each other during the 90s. Right before the game tipped off, the film director brought framed newspaper covers showing how he made headlines in his on-court spat with Miller and had it signed.\n\nKnicks fans have not forgotten how Reggie Miller torched them before and had some profane chants towards him before the game ended.\n\nGame 3 between the Pacers-Knicks will take place on May 10 at the Gainsbridge Fieldhouse Arena in Indianapolis, Indiana.

In his nearly 20 year NBA career, Miller was the bane of many Knicks fans' existence for his clutch shotmaking, trashtalking and gamesmanship.\n\nSome of Miller's most famous interactions came with Knicks superfan Spike Lee, with whom he has gone back and forth over the years.

No. I've owned this city, I've owned this building,\" said Miller on the broadcast. \"So why would I be worried about walking out there?\n\n\"I love when New Yorkers come up to me in the airport of walking around the city and the first thing that comes out of their mouth is, 'I hate you.

Turns out, it was none other than Stiller. See the interaction below at about the 90 second mark.\n\nMiller was later shown hugging it out on the sideline with Stiller.\n\nAs for Spike, came armed with two framed copies of New York Daily News and NY Post headlines commemorating their contretemps over the years, presenting them to Miller on the broadcast.", "source": {"uri": "deadline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Deadline"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tom_tapp@deadline.com", "name": "Tom Tapp", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reggie_Miller", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Reggie Miller"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Stiller", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ben Stiller"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madison_Square_Garden", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Madison Square Garden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tony Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TNT_(American_TV_network)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TNT (American TV network)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Academy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clutch_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Clutch (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inside_the_NBA", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Inside the NBA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spike_Lee", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spike Lee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Daily_News", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York Daily News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramount_Network", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paramount Network"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Post", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York Post"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Game_Design", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Game Design", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Walking", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Walking", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 86}], "image": "https://deadline.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Screenshot-2024-05-08-at-5.06.45\u202fPM.png?w=1024", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546901", "eventUri": "eng-9546901", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 145, "relevance": 1}

Former Pacers legend Reggie Miller, synonymous with tormenting the Knicks during his Hall of Fame career, called the game for TNT.\n\nPerkins, an ESPN analyst, accused the rival network of focusing too much on Miller's former feud with New York during the broadcast. He was waiting for an update on Knicks star Jalen Brunson, who exited the game with an apparent foot injury in the first half.\n\n\"Are we going to make this entire game about Reggie Miller? Or can I know if Big Body Brunson is going to return or not,\" Perkins asked on social media. \"Jesus Christ.\"\n\nMiller, who taunted Knicks superfan Spike Lee with a choke sign 20 years ago, put aside objectivity when playfully trash-talking his former foe before the game.\n\n\"I know people are going to be like, 'Aren't you worried about going back to New York City and calling this game?' No. I've owned this city. I've owned this building,\" Miller declared. \"So why would I be worried about walking on out there?\"\n\nThis isn't the first time Perkins has gone after TNT. The former center said last month it was \"obvious\" Shaquille O'Neal and Charley Barkley \"don't watch basketball\" based on how they covered the Knicks.\n\nThe Inside the NBA crew responded by showing and laughing at a clip of Blake Griffin dunking over Perkins. They called Perkins a \"roach\" and Barkley joked about getting called out by someone who averaged five points per game.\n\n\"I have great respect for both of those legends over there, Charles and Shaq,\" Perkins responded on The Michael Kay Show earlier this week, via Awful Announcing. \"The only problem that I had with it is the calling out on my name as a roach ... Other than that, it's all fun and games.

Year after year, the media will include the Knicks in talking points regardless of their record.\n\nFor the better part of the 21st century, the Knicks have been the laughingstock of the NBA, rarely making the playoffs yet always center stage of media coverage. That's changed recently, as the Knicks have emerged as one of the top teams in the Eastern Conference after decades of dormancy and mediocrity.\n\nThe franchise has reached the playoffs in three of the past four seasons and is in the second round for the second straight year. Jalen Brunson & Co. can take the Knicks to heights they haven not reached since 2000 -- the Eastern Conference Finals -- and since 1999 -- the NBA Finals.\n\nWith those two destinations in sight for New York, the Sporting News takes a dive into Knicks history, detailing the last time the Knicks won an NBA title.\n\nMORE: Timeline of every Knicks NBA Finals appearance\n\nNew York fans have been starved of an NBA Finals appearance for 25 years. But they've gone without a championship for more than 50.\n\nBehind a star-studded roster that included Walt Frazier, Willis Reed, Dave DeBusschere, Bill Bradley, Earl Monroe, and Jerry Lucas, the Knicks won their second NBA title in 1973. The first came in 1970 with a similar cast, and perhaps sweetest of all, both wins came against the Los Angeles Lakers.\n\nThe 1973 squad defeated the Lakers in five games, and Reed came away with his second Finals MVP trophy, becoming the first player to accomplish this feat. After a Game 1 loss in Los Angeles, the Knicks won four straight and closed the series out in L.A.\n\nReed posted 16.4 points and 9.2 rebounds per game in that series. Bradley led the team in scoring with 18.6 points per game, Frazier led with 5.2 assists per game and DeBusschere had a team-high 11.6 rebounds per game.\n\nThe 1973 title marked another crowning achievement for the late Hall of Famer, but Reed is most remembered for the 1970 NBA Finals.\n\nReed averaged 31.8 points and 15.0 rebounds per game through the first four games of the 1970 Finals. The series was tied, 2-2, and Reed tore a thigh muscle late in Game 5, which the Knicks won. He sat out Game 6 and was doubtful for Game 7.\n\nThat's when \"The Willis Reed Game\" was born. Reed jogged out of the tunnel and played in Game 7. He finished with just four points and three rebounds, but he played 27 minutes despite enduring a severe thigh injury four days prior. The Knicks went on to win fairly easily, establishing a 27-point lead at halftime.\n\nReed became the first player in NBA history to be named the Finals MVP, regular season MVP and All-Star game MVP in the same season. The NBA introduced the Finals MVP award in the 1969 NBA Finals.\n\nIn the years following the 1973 title, the franchise was quiet -- until the Knicks drafted Patrick Ewing No. 1 overall in the 1985 NBA Draft. New York went on to make 14 straight playoff appearances from 1988-2001.\n\nA majority of those appearances ended in the Eastern Conference semifinals, but the Ewing-led team reached the NBA Finals twice, in 1994 and 1999.

I have done nothing but praise TNT for its NBA coverage over the years, so I hate to do this, but Wednesday night was a rough night for the network.\n\nIt was a double whammy of bad. In going so over the top for Reggie Miller calling a game at Madison Square Garden, TNT left viewers in the dark for way too long about Jalen Brunson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s injury.\n\nWith Brunson pouring in 40 points per game night after night in the postseason, his disappearance with about three minutes left in the first quarter was about a billion times more important than the played-out \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Reggie Miller Show\u00e2\u20ac that TNT shoved down everyone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s throat for three hours.\n\nThis isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t something exclusive to TNT. When any sports network gets a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153storyline,\u00e2\u20ac they love to bludgeon viewers to death with it. But the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Miller is the No. 1 Enemy of New York\u00e2\u20ac narrative (1) isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t that relevant today, and (2) didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need nearly the amount of time TNT spent on it.\n\nMiller is working the Timberwolves-Nuggets series with Kevin Harlan for TNT, but with those teams having Wednesday off, TNT thought it would be fun to have the former Pacers legend work with Brian Anderson and Stan Van Gundy because he has a history with the Knicks.\n\nThe problem was that TNT tried to make Miller's presence more important than the game. First of all, outside of people in New York and Indiana, nobody cares about Miller\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s history with the Knicks. In addition, current Knicks and Pacers fans cared way more about the importance and ramifications of Game 2 than having a three-hour history lesson.\n\nBut there was Reggie on the pregame show. There was Reggie with Spike Lee. There was a highlight package of Reggie against the Knicks. There was more highlights of Reggie against the Knicks.\n\nIt was all too much and it became a problem when Brunson left the game late in the first quarter and viewers were left in the dark for a long time before sideline reporter Chris Haynes finally told us late in the second quarter that the superstar guard was questionable to return with a sore foot.\n\nFrom three minutes left in the first quarter to three minutes left in the second quarter, the audience got zero information about one of the most important players in the playoffs. However, the audience got information about ... Miller\u00e2\u20ac~s ancient history of being a thorn in the Knicks' side.\n\nWhen TNT first released its second-round broadcast assignments, I was bummed we wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be getting the great Kevin Harlan on the Knicks-Pacers series. After Wednesday night, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m thrilled Miller is headed to Minnesota for the next few days.\n\n2. Speaking of the NBA on TNT, this is what Warner Brothers Discovery (TNT\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s parent company) CEO David Zaslav said on Thursday about where negotiations stand between his company and the league, as we await word on whether NBC will steal the NBA package from TNT in the next round of television deals.\n\n3. A brand-new SI Media With Jimmy Traina podcast dropped this morning and it features a conversation with Katie Nolan.\n\nNolan, who is a lifelong Patriots fans, breaks down all aspects of The Roast of Tom Brady on Netflix: Best and worst roasters, what made her cringe, what was wrong with Ben Affleck, why was Bill Belichick so enjoyable, why was Kim Kardashian there, why was it so long and much, much more.\n\nNolan also talks about where her career is at, why she didn't join Dan Le Batard's Meadowlark Media when she was offered a job there, what she's looking for in sports media, her appearance on Celebrity Jeopardy! and more.\n\nFollowing Nolan, Sal Licata from WFAN and SNY joins me for our weekly \"Traina Thoughts\" segment. This week's topics include more on the Tom Brady roast, the Drake-Kendrick Lamar beef, the Kentucky Derby, Netflix possibly airing Christmas Day NFL games and more.\n\nYou can also listen to theSI Media With Jimmy Traina on Apple and Spotify. You can also watch it on Sports Illustrated\u00e2\u20ac~s YouTube channel.\n\n4. If this wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t on ESPN\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s official Twitter account, I 100% would\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve thought it was a fake tweet. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no doubt the officiating in the Pacers-Knicks series has been bad, and Indiana got screwed in a major way in Game 1 with that ridiculous offensive foul call on Myles Turner late in the game, but this right here is some high-level whining.\n\n5. I sent out this tweet on Sunday night during The Roast of Tom Brady.\n\nJulian Edelman has confirmed that I read the situation correctly. On the latest episode of his podcast, Edelman described a pre-roast scene in which Robert Kraft walked into a room that was filled with ex-Patriots players and Bill Belichick, thusly: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The tension in that room . . . could cut f---ing glass. That was so awkward.\u00e2\u20ac\n\n6. On Tuesday, I called into Chris \"Mad Dog\" Russo's SiriusXM show and begged him not to watch The Roast of Tom Brady because I knew he would hate it. That kind of shock humor is not Russo's thing at all. Here is my call to Russo.\n\nHowever, Mad Dog didn't listen to me. And then he gave us the exact reaction that I predicted he would have on First Take.\n\nMeanwhile, Russo repeatedly bashed me on his Wednesday SiriusXM show for loving the Brady roast while ignoring the fact that I was 100% correct in my assessment that he would hate it. As he would say, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153bad job outta you.\u00e2\u20ac", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TNT_(American_TV_network)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "TNT (American TV network)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reggie_Miller", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Reggie Miller"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Anderson_(sportscaster)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brian Anderson (sportscaster)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Harlan", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Harlan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stan_Van_Gundy", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stan Van Gundy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_postseason", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball postseason"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_on_ESPN", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA on ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madison_Square_Garden", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Madison Square Garden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Bros._Discovery", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Warner Bros.

New York's 2024 Playoffs run invokes memories of great Knicks teams of the past.\n\nOf course, in confronting the Knicks of the past, that means you need to confront Reggie Miller.\n\nThe fact that the Knicks are playing the Indiana Pacers is only invoking those memories even more. So too was the fact that Miller attended Game 2 of the Knicks-Pacers series as part of the TNT Sports crew. The longtime NBA analyst received a \"warm welcome back\" from the fans who filled The Garden on Wednesday night.\n\nEarlier this week, Miller 'warned' Knicks fans that \"the Boogeyman\" was coming. Miller, of course, was at the heart of one of the most memorable finishes in NBA Playoffs history. In Game 5 of the 1994 Eastern Conference Semifinals, Miller scored eight points in nine seconds to lift the Pacers over the Knicks, stunning them and Spike Lee. Miller famously made a \"choke\" sign directly at Lee, taunting him and the Knicks. New York got the last laugh on Miller in the end, but it's still one of the greatest performances we've ever seen.\n\nBut don't count WFAN's Evan Roberts among those who think Miller deserves that \"boogeyman\" status. A day after the Knicks defeated the Pacers with Miller in the house, Roberts went off, claiming Miller wasn't the player he thought he was against the Knicks. In turn, he helped to dispel the \"myths\" he believes exists.\n\n\"Reggie Miller did not always beat the New York Knicks. This is a lie being perpetrated by TNT and Reggie Miller like he's the 'Boogeyman.' Reggie, you're not the Boogeyman,\" Roberts said. \"You had some moments against the Knicks. No question! Eight points in nine seconds happened. I admit that. But you know what else happened, Reggie? TNT? You lost to the New York Knicks. Did you know that? You lost to the New York Knicks, that also happened.\"\n\n\"Reggie didn't own the Knicks. It's a lie! It's a lie!\" Roberts exclaimed.\n\nRoberts isn't necessarily wrong in what he says. But when moments like Miller's get mythologized like they have over the last three decades, then you get what we've gotten here.", "source": {"uri": "thecomeback.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Comeback"}, "authors": [{"uri": "chris_novak@thecomeback.com", "name": "Chris Novak", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reggie_Miller", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Reggie Miller"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2022 NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TNT_(American_TV_network)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TNT (American TV network)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spike_Lee", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spike Lee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1994_NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "1994 NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Appraisal_and_Valuation", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Appraisal and Valuation", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://cdn1.thecomeback.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/reggie-miller-knicks-630jpg.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546901", "eventUri": "eng-9546901", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1529411764705881, "wgt": 452991974, "relevance": 2}], "totalResults": 79, "page": 1, "count": 1, "pages": 79}}}

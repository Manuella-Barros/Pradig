The rest of the time, it was being repaired after rough seas broke it apart, detached to avoid further damage or paused because of security concerns.\n\nThe pier was never meant to be more than a stopgap measure while the Biden administration pushed Israel to allow more food and other supplies into Gaza through land routes, a far more efficient way to deliver relief. But even the modest goals for the pier are likely to fall short, some U.S. military officials say.\n\nWhen the pier was conceived, health authorities were warning that the territory was on the precipice of famine. In recent weeks, Israel has given relief organizations greater access, but the groups say the situation remains dire.\n\nThe Biden administration initially predicted that it would be September before surging seas would make the pier inoperable. But military officials are now warning aid organizations that the project could be dismantled as early as next month, a looming deadline that officials say they hope will pressure Israel to open more ground routes.\n\nPresident Joe Biden ordered the U.S. military to begin building the pier in March, at a time when he was being sharply criticized for not doing more to rein in Israel's military response to the Oct. 7 Hamas-led attacks.\n\nThe first truckloads of aid began moving ashore on May 17. Since then, the project has struggled, while many Gaza residents are experiencing immense hunger, aid groups say.\n\nIn the latest blow to the aid effort, the U.S. military said on Friday that it would temporarily move the pier to keep it from being damaged by high seas.\n\nThe decision \"is not made lightly but is necessary to ensure the temporary pier can continue to deliver aid in the future,\" the U.S. Central Command said in a post on social media, stating that the pier would be towed to Israel. Sabrina Singh, a Pentagon spokesperson, said on Monday the pier could be reattached and aid deliveries resumed later this week.\n\nThe pier \"is not working, at least not for Palestinians,\" Stephen Semler, a co-founder of the Security Policy Reform Institute, wrote in an essay for Responsible Statecraft, a Quincy Institute publication. Semler argued that the pier had succeeded only in providing \"humanitarian cover\" for the Biden administration's policy of supporting Israel's bombardment of Gaza.\n\nU.S. officials say that in addition to delivering aid with many of the land routes closed, the pier also threw a spotlight on the urgent need to provide more humanitarian assistance overall to Gaza. But the project's challenges have frustrated and disappointed top Biden administration officials.\n\nDespite the weather-related delays and other problems, there has been one bright spot: The pier has not yet been hit in an attack.\n\nEarlier this month, the Pentagon rejected claims on social media that the pier had been used in an Israeli raid that freed four hostages but that led to the deaths of scores of Palestinians.\n\nIn the hours after the rescue, video circulated online showing an Israeli military helicopter taking off from the beach with the U.S. pier in the background.\n\nAfter the videos emerged, U.S. Central Command said in a statement that the pier and \"its equipment, personnel and assets were not used in the operation to rescue hostages today in Gaza.\"\n\nAmerican military officials were especially concerned about possible attacks because reports had emerged after the rescue that the United States provided intelligence on the hostages before the operation.\n\nLast week, Maj. Gen. Patrick S. Ryder, the Pentagon press secretary, denounced \"inaccurate social media allegations\" that the pier was part of the rescue, but said that \"there was some type of helicopter activity\" near the pier during the operation.\n\nArlan Fuller, director of emergency response with Project Hope, said the image of \"the helicopter taking off from the beach really was contravening to the overall use of the humanitarian space.\" He added that the image \"muddies the waters\" and could put humanitarian workers on the pier in greater risk.\n\nAdded to that, Central Command had just announced that the pier was usable again after a nearly two-week hiatus for repairs when the hostage rescue effort took place. A day later, the World Food Program said it had again paused aid distribution from the pier because of security concerns.\n\nBiden surprised the Pentagon when he suddenly announced the pier in his State of the Union address. Army engineers built and deployed the pier in two months' time, with about 1,000 U.S. troops now involved in some part of the project.\n\nWhen Biden announced the project, officials predicted that it would help deliver as many as 2 million meals a day for Gaza residents. The Pentagon calls the project JLOTS, for Joint Logistics Over the Shore, a capability that it has previously used for humanitarian relief in Somalia, Kuwait and Haiti.\n\nOn the days that the pier has been in working order, it has enabled the delivery of thousands of tons of aid to Gaza, officials say.\n\nVice Adm. Brad Cooper, the Central Command deputy commander, recently said that the issues with the pier \"stemmed solely from unanticipated weather.\"\n\nUsually, spring and early summer on the shores of Gaza are calmer. \"Plan on X, and nature sends 2X,\" said Paul D. Eaton, a retired major general who was in Somalia in 1993 when the U.S. military put a pier in place there to deliver humanitarian aid to civilians caught in war.\n\nSeveral congressional Republicans have criticized the project for its cost and potential risk to U.S. troops.\n\n\"This irresponsible and expensive experiment defies all logic except the obvious political explanation: to appease the president's far-left flank,\" Sen. Roger Wicker of Mississippi, the senior Republican on the Armed Services Committee, said earlier this month.\n\nAid workers say the deliveries of food and other supplies have been slowed by bottlenecks for shipments at border crossings caused by lengthy inspections of trucks, limited operating hours and protests by Israelis.\n\nIsrael has argued that there are no limits on the amount of aid it allows to enter. It regularly blames disorganized aid groups -- as well as theft by Hamas -- for failure to deliver food to Palestinians efficiently.\n\nCentral Command said on Friday that 3,500 tons of aid had been delivered to shore using the pier since the operation started on May 17, with about 2,500 tons of that delivered since the pier was re-anchored and resumed operations on June 8.\n\nBut much of the aid that makes it through is not reaching Palestinians, aid groups said, because of the logistical and security issues, and looting.\n\nAid workers say the equivalent of only seven truckloads of assistance is arriving in Gaza via the pier each day, far short of the goal of eventually ramping up to 150 trucks per day.\n\n\"The volume is negligible,\" said J. Stephen Morrison, director of the Global Health Policy Center at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \"And the seas are just going to get rougher and rougher.\"", "source": {"uri": "seattletimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Seattle Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "helene_cooper@seattletimes.com", "name": "Helene Cooper", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "eric_schmitt@seattletimes.com", "name": "Eric Schmitt", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarian_aid", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Humanitarian aid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pier", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pier"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Armed_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Armed Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pentagon", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Pentagon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Central_Command", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Central Command"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hostage", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hostage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Famine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Famine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helicopter", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Helicopter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_S._Ryder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Patrick S.

Gen. Pat Ryder told reporters at a briefing on Tuesday.\n\nHowever, Ryder did not dispute a New York Times report that said the $230 million pier \"has largely failed in its mission\" to rush humanitarian aid to Gaza, and \"will probably end operations weeks earlier than originally expected.\"\n\nThe Times reported, \"In the month since it was attached to the shoreline, the pier has been in service only about 10 days. The rest of the time, it was being repaired after rough seas broke it apart, detached to avoid further damage or paused because of security concerns.\"\n\nLook, we've said all along, first of all, that the pier is a temporary measure. I don't have any dates to announce, in terms of when it will cease operations. Of course, as I just mentioned, we're looking forward to getting it operational again soon and to delivering aid. And, you know, we're going to capitalize on the conditions, you know, in terms of weather, to get as much aid across that pier as we can.\n\nPresident Joe Biden announced during his high-profile State of the Union address in March that he was directing the U.S. military to build the temporary pier.\n\nHe said:\n\nTonight, I'm directing the U.S. military to lead an emergency mission to establish a temporary pier in the Mediterranean on the Gaza coast that can receive large ships carrying food, water, medicine and temporary shelters. No U.S. boots will be on the ground. This temporary pier would enable a massive increase in the amount of humanitarian assistance getting into Gaza every day.\n\nAccording to a source, troops and their families were only given two days' notice in advance, before sending them off to the Middle East a week later to build and operate the pier. According to CNN, the idea of a temporary pier was considered as early as October.\n\nThe pier was envisioned to be able to transport 150 trucks a day of aid, but aid workers told the Times that the equivalent of seven truckloads a day were being sent over the pier in the roughly 10 days it has been in service.\n\nThe pier was opened on May 17, only to break apart eight days later, on May 25.\n\nPentagon officials blamed \"unanticipated\" weather, but naval experts say the pier -- formally known as the Joint Logistics Over-the-Shore System (JLOTS) -- cannot handle waves taller than about four feet and was never meant to be used in this kind of situation.\n\nBreitbart News last week obtained exclusive video of the pier being battered by waves shortly before it broke apart.\n\nAfter the pier broke into pieces it was detached from Gaza and towed to a port in Ashdod, Israel, for repair. About a week later, it was reattached to Gaza and reopened, only for operations to be suspended about a day later due to weather conditions. It was then detached again and towed back to Ashdod due to weather.\n\nThe Times reported \"military officials are now warning aid organizations that the project could be dismantled as early as next month.\" The paper called it a \"bright spot\" that the pier has \"not yet been hit in an attack.\"\n\nThe source told Breitbart News it was being targeted daily with mortars, bombs, and gunfire.\n\nAfter it was rumored that the pier was used in an Israel military operation to rescue hostages, the World Food Program announced it had paused distributing aid from the pier out of concern it jeopardized their workers' safety.\n\nA second source told Breitbart News that families are being told the mission for the roughly 1,000 American troops operating the pier would end either at the end of June or July.\n\nHowever, Ryder said there was no end date yet.\n\n\"I'm not tracking any established timeline at this point, in terms of when the pier will stop operating, again with the caveat that this was always intended to be a temporary pier. I'm not aware at this point of any established date of this is when we're going to stop,\" he said.\n\n\"When we have anything new to announce, we certainly will, but as of right now, that's where we're at,\" Ryder said.\n\nHe pushed back against the idea of the pier being a failure, saying 7.7 million pounds of aid have been delivered over the pier, which according to the Wall Street Journal, amounted to several days' worth of aid. It is not clear how much aid has actually reached people in Gaza, due to the difficulties in distributing that aid once on land.", "source": {"uri": "breitbart.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

The rest of the time she was under repair after rough seas broke her, detached to prevent further damage, or shut down for safety.\n\nThe pier was never intended to be anything more than a stopgap measure, while the Biden administration has pushed Israel to allow more food and other supplies to enter Gaza via land routes, a far more efficient means to deliver relief. But even modest goals for the pier may fall short, some U.S. military officials say.\n\nWhen the pier was designed, health authorities warned that the territory was on the brink of famine. In recent weeks, Israel has granted greater access to humanitarian organizations, but groups say the situation remains dire.\n\nThe Biden administration initially predicted it would be September before rising waters would render the pier unusable. But military officials are now warning aid organizations that the project could be dismantled as early as next month, a looming deadline that officials hope will put pressure on Israel to open more land routes.\n\nPresident Biden ordered the US military to begin construction of the pier in March, at a time when he was heavily criticized for not doing more to curb the Israeli military response to the Hamas attacks on October 7.\n\nThe first aid trucks began arriving on May 17. Since then, the project has struggled, while many Gaza residents experience immense hunger, according to humanitarian groups.\n\nIn a final blow to humanitarian efforts, the U.S. military announced Friday that it would temporarily relocate the pier to prevent it from being damaged by high seas.\n\nThe decision is not taken lightly but is necessary to ensure that the temporary pier can continue to deliver aid in the future, US Central Command said in a social media post, clarifying that the pier would be towed to Israel. Sabrina Singh, a Pentagon spokeswoman, said Monday that the pier could be reattached and aid deliveries could resume later this week.\n\nThe pier doesn't work, at least not for the Palestinians, wrote Stephen Semler, co-founder of the Security Policy Reform Institute, in an essay for Responsible Statecraft, a publication of the Quincy Institute. Mr. Semler argued that the pier had only succeeded in providing humanitarian cover for the Biden administration's policy of supporting Israel's bombardment of Gaza.\n\nU.S. officials say that in addition to providing aid while many land routes are closed, the pier also highlighted the urgent need to deliver more humanitarian aid to Gaza. But the project's challenges have frustrated and disappointed senior Biden administration officials.\n\nDespite weather delays and other issues, there is one positive: The pier has not yet been hit in an attack.\n\nEarlier this month, the Pentagon rejected claims on social media that the pier was used in an Israeli raid that freed four hostages but resulted in the deaths of many Palestinians.\n\nIn the hours following the rescue, a video circulated on the Internet showing an Israeli military helicopter taking off from the beach with the American pier in the background.\n\nAfter the videos were released, U.S. Central Command said in a statement that the pier, its equipment, personnel and resources were not used in today's hostage rescue operation in Gaza.\n\nU.S. military officials were particularly concerned about possible attacks because reports emerged after the rescue that the United States had provided intelligence on the hostages before the operation.\n\nLast week, Maj. Gen. Patrick S. Ryder, the Pentagon press secretary, denounced inaccurate claims on social media that the pier was part of the rescue, but said there had been some sort of helicopter activity near the pier during the operation.\n\nArlan Fuller, Project Hope's emergency response director, said the image of the helicopter taking off from the beach actually contravened the overall use of humanitarian space. He added that the image blurs the lines and could put aid workers on the dock at greater risk.\n\nAdditionally, Central Command had just announced that the pier was usable again after a nearly two-week hiatus for repairs during the hostage rescue operation. A day later, the World Food Program said it had again suspended aid distribution from the dock due to security concerns.\n\nMr. Biden surprised the Pentagon when he suddenly announced the pier in his State of the Union address. Army engineers built and deployed the pier in two months, with about 1,000 U.S. troops now involved in part of the project.\n\nWhen Mr. Biden announced the project, officials predicted it would provide up to two million meals a day to Gazans. The Pentagon calls the project JLOTS, for Joint Logistics Over the Shore, a capability it has already used for humanitarian aid in Somalia, Kuwait and Haiti.\n\nOn days when the jetty was operational, it transported thousands of tons of aid to Gaza, officials say.\n\nVice Adm. Brad Cooper, deputy commander of Central Command, recently said the problems with the pier stemmed solely from unforeseen weather conditions.\n\nUsually, spring and early summer on the coasts of Gaza are calmer. Plan for in the war.\n\nSeveral congressional Republicans have criticized the project for its cost and potential risks to U.S. troops.\n\nThis irresponsible and costly experiment defies all logic except the obvious political explanation: to appease the president's far-left wing, Sen. Roger Wicker of Mississippi, the top Republican, said earlier this month of the Committee on Armed Services.\n\nAid workers say deliveries of food and other supplies have been slowed by bottlenecks at border crossings caused by lengthy truck inspections, limited operating hours and protests by Israelis.\n\nIsrael has argued that there is no limit to the amount of aid it allows in. He regularly blames disorganized humanitarian groups and Hamas theft for failing to effectively deliver food to Palestinians.\n\nCentral Command said Friday that 3,500 tons of aid had been delivered ashore using the pier since the operation began on May 17, of which about 2,500 tons have been delivered since the pier was re-anchored and resumed operations on June 8.\n\nBut much of the aid that does manage to transit does not reach Palestinians, aid groups said, due to logistical and security problems, as well as looting.\n\nAid workers say the equivalent of just seven aid trucks arrive in Gaza via the jetty each day, far short of the target of 150 trucks per day.\n\nThe volume is negligible, said J. Stephen Morrison, director of the Global Health Policy Center at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. And the sea will become more and more rough.\n\nWhat Are The Main Benefits Of Comparing Car Insurance Quotes Online", "source": {"uri": "exbulletin.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ExBulletin"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarian_aid", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Humanitarian aid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pier", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pier"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Armed_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Armed Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pentagon", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Pentagon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Central_Command", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Central Command"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hostage", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hostage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relief", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Relief"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Israel Defense Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Famine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Famine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helicopter", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Helicopter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_S._Ryder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Patrick S.

But a string of logistical and weather problems have plagued the pier since it was built in mid-May, and now U.S. defense officials are warning aid groups that it may be shuttered permanently by as soon as next month.\n\nIf closed by that point, the pier will have likely experienced little success in its goal of getting aid to the Palestinians; it has only been operational for roughly 10 days in the month since it was constructed, according to the NYT.\n\n\"Supplies from the pier aren't flowing to Palestinians, and never really have,\" Stephen Semler, a national security expert at the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft, wrote in an essay last week. \"The reality is that the [pier] is not working, at least not for Palestinians.\"\n\nThe Mediterranean's choppy sea conditions and high winds have rattled the pier, routinely grinding operations to a halt. In one case, a stint of bad weather in late May broke the pier apart completely and sent it floating away, forcing officials to tow it northbound toward Israel for repairs.

But I honestly don't know what the new status is,\" White House National Security spokesman John Kirby told reporters on Monday.\n\nEven with a $230 million price tag, the pier was hastily built -- President Joe Biden only told the Pentagon his plans days before he announced it in March -- and never meant to withstand the conditions of the Mediterranean.

At that time, Joe Biden was in deep trouble with his radical left supporters because some Gazans were starving and Israel had slowed aid to a crawl.\n\nNo one ever gets around to explaining why Israel won't speed up aid to Gaza civilians. Maybe it has something to do with weapons and explosives being found in aid trucks that need to be thoroughly searched. At any rate, Gazans are dying of starvation, so Biden decided to \"do something about the problem.\"\n\nIn this case, he ordered the U.S. military to build a floating pier off the coast of Gaza. For the handsome sum of $230 million, Joe Biden bought himself a floating white elephant.\n\nFrom the time the pier became operational on May 17, completely foreseeable problems that were unforeseen by the Biden administration have plagued its operation. Incredibly, in the month the pier has been operating, it's unloaded food aid for only 10 days.\n\nFirst, there was the looting. Trucks rolling off the pier onto the causeway leading to the warehouse where food would be stored until distributed were mobbed by desperate people.\n\nPart of the problem, says the UN, is they didn't plan for the security of the trucks. \"We need to make sure that the necessary security and logistical arrangements are in place before we proceed,\" said the UN official.\n\nYes, yes, capital idea.\n\nThe pier's operation has been a clusterfark from the beginning.\n\nOn Tuesday, rather than face the additional embarrassment of the pier floating away again due to rough seas, the military decided to move the pier back to where it was constructed; Ashdod, Israel.\n\nThe decision \"is not made lightly but is necessary to ensure the temporary pier can continue to deliver aid in the future,\" the U.S. Central Command said.\n\nPart of the problem is that, in this case, \"Made in America\" leaves much to be desired.\n\nNew York Times:\n\nThe pier \"is not working, at least not for Palestinians,\" Stephen Semler, a co-founder of the Security Policy Reform Institute, wrote in an essay for Responsible Statecraft, a Quincy Institute publication. Mr. Semler argued that the pier had succeeded only in providing \"humanitarian cover\" for the Biden administration's policy of supporting Israel's bombardment of Gaza.\n\nU.S. officials say that in addition to delivering aid with many of the land routes closed, the pier also threw a spotlight on the urgent need to provide more humanitarian assistance overall to Gaza. But the project's challenges have frustrated and disappointed top Biden administration officials.\n\nDespite the weather-related delays and other problems, there has been one bright spot: The pier has not yet been hit in an attack.\n\nThe pier hasn't been attacked because it's been out of service far more often than it's been operational.\n\nBesides, why waste good ordinance on a pier that's self-destructing?\n\nExclusively for our VIPs: Netanyahu Disbands War Cabinet as Hezbollah Ratchets Up the Pressure on Israel in the North\n\nThe controversy that erupted, mostly on social media, about the pier being used in the Israeli hostage rescue operation has yet to be put to rest. Did the U.S.-built pier aid the Israelis in any way in rescuing the hostages?\n\nI certainly hope so. Just don't tell Hamas that.\n\nLast week, Maj. Gen. Patrick S. Ryder, the Pentagon press secretary, denounced \"inaccurate social media allegations\" that the pier was part of the rescue, but said that \"there was some type of helicopter activity\" near the pier during the operation.\n\nArlan Fuller, the director of emergency response with Project Hope, said the image of \"the helicopter taking off from the beach really was contravening to the overall use of the humanitarian space.\" He added that the image \"muddies the waters\" and could put humanitarian workers on the pier in greater risk.\n\nNo, Joe Biden shouldn't get credit for this \"humanitarian impulse.\" The pier had nothing to do with altruism and everything to do with Biden's re-election. The $230 million (or $320 million, depending on the source) pier is another in a long line of failures of the Biden administration.", "source": {"uri": "pjmedia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "PJ Media"}, "authors": [{"uri": "rick_moran@pjmedia.com", "name": "Rick Moran", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pier", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pier"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Armed_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Armed Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truck", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Truck"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Explosive", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Explosive"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causeway", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Causeway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_elephant", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "White elephant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Looting", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Looting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far-left_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Far-left politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aid", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starvation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Starvation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Central_Command", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Central Command"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarian_aid", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Humanitarian aid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reform_Judaism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Reform Judaism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warehouse", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Warehouse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashdod", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ashdod"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ashdod"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_general_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Major general (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cabinet of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hezbollah", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hezbollah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Netanyahu", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Benjamin Netanyahu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altruism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Altruism"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Immune_Disorders", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Immune Disorders", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 83}], "image": "https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2024/124/8090b213-ef61-48c3-8718-1b4e4b8e423e.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9663051", "eventUri": "eng-9663051", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-17", "textStart": 753, "textEnd": 759}], "sentiment": -0.1058823529411764, "wgt": 222, "relevance": 1}

But Israel must also do its part.\"\n\nIt took about 2 months to get the pier in place but almost exactly a month ago the military announced that the pier had been completed and was ready to start delivering food aid from ships to trucks.\n\nThe U.S. military finished installing a floating pier for the Gaza Strip on Thursday, with officials poised to begin ferrying badly needed humanitarian aid into the enclave besieged over seven months of intense fighting in the Israel-Hamas war.\n\nThe final, overnight construction sets up a complicated delivery process more than two months after U.S. President Joe Biden ordered it to help Palestinians facing starvation as food and other supplies fail to make it in as Israel recently seized the key Rafah border crossing in its push on that southern city on the Egyptian border.\n\nSince then almost nothing about it has gone as planned. Just over a week after the announcement that it was completed, the pier broke apart.\n\nMAY 25: High winds and heavy seas damage the pier and cause four U.S. Army vessels operating there to become beached, injuring three service members, including one who is in critical condition...\n\nMAY 28: Pentagon spokeswoman Sabrina Singh says large portions of the causeway are being pulled from the beach and moved to an Israeli port for repairs. The base of the causeway remains at the Gaza shore.\n\nThe pier was towed away and repaired and then returned to duty, but it was only a matter of days before rough seas prompted the US military to detach it again to prevent another disaster.\n\nThe US military will temporarily dismantle the humanitarian pier it constructed off the coast of Gaza and move it back to Israel on Friday night, amid concerns that heavy seas could once again break it just days after it resumed aid delivery operations, multiple US officials and US Central Command said.\n\nIt will be the second time in a matter of weeks that the fragile pier and causeway system, known as Joint Logistics over the Shore, or JLOTS, has had to be moved back to the Israeli port of Ashdod. It is a pre-emptive safety measure, a US official said, and aid operations across the pier will be suspended until sea conditions allow for it to be moved back into place.\n\nIn a word, the pier has been a failure, though one should probably add it was a very expensive failure.\n\nThe $230 million temporary pier that the U.S. military built on short notice to rush humanitarian aid to Gaza has largely failed in its mission, aid organizations say, and will probably end operations weeks earlier than originally expected.\n\nIn the month since it was attached to the shoreline, the pier has been in service only about 10 days. The rest of the time, it was being repaired after rough seas broke it apart, detached to avoid further damage or paused because of security concerns...\n\nThe Biden administration initially predicted that it would be September before surging seas would make the pier inoperable. But military officials are now warning aid organizations that the project could be dismantled as early as next month, a looming deadline that officials say they hope will pressure Israel to open more ground routes.\n\nI'm not sure where the NY Times got the $230 million figure for the cost of all this. An earlier report by the AP put the price tag at $320 million at a minimum.\n\nA U.S. Navy ship and several Army vessels involved in an American-led effort to bring more aid into the besieged Gaza Strip are offshore of the enclave and building out a floating platform for the operation that the Pentagon has said will cost at least $320 million.\n\nCan the actual cost have gone down given the delays, the damage to the pier when it broke apart and the grounding of the four US vessels. I don't see how that's possible. But whatever the case, we've gotten about 10 days of service out of the pier so far and even on the days it has been useful, the aid delivered didn't make it to ordinary Gazan people. Most of it winds up getting looted.\n\nNone of the aid that has been unloaded from the temporary pier the US constructed off the coast of Gaza has been delivered to the broader Palestinian population, as the US works with the UN and Israel to identify safe delivery routes inside the enclave, the Pentagon said on Tuesday.\n\nSeveral desperate Gazans intercepted trucks delivering aid from the pier over the weekend, leading the UN to suspend the delivery operations until the logistical challenges are resolved.\n\nCalling this a failure is being pretty generous at this point. It is an epic failure and embarrassment for the Biden administration and, unfortunately, for the United States.

But a string of logistical and weather problems have plagued the pier since it was built in mid-May, and now U.S. defense officials are warning aid groups that it may be shuttered permanently by as soon as next month. (RELATED: Biden Cuts Off His Own Supporters So Anti-Israel Protesters Can Shout Over Him)\n\nIf closed by that point, the pier will have likely experienced little success in its goal of getting aid to the Palestinians; it has only been operational for roughly 10 days in the month since it was constructed, according to the NYT.\n\n\"Supplies from the pier aren't flowing to Palestinians, and never really have,\" Stephen Semler, a national security expert at the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft, wrote in an essay last week. \"The reality is that the [pier] is not working, at least not for Palestinians.\"\n\nThe Mediterranean's choppy sea conditions and high winds have rattled the pier, routinely grinding operations to a halt. In one case, a stint of bad weather in late May broke the pier apart completely and sent it floating away, forcing officials to tow it northbound toward Israel for repairs. The pier was re-anchored to the shores of Gaza on June 7, but the United Nations' World Food Program stopped delivering from the pier two days later, citing security concerns.\n\nLess than a week later, the pier was detached from the shores again and brought back northward to avoid another round of bad weather.\n\n\"They did have weather-related issues. They had to dismantle it for the safety of everybody involved. But I honestly don't know what the new status is,\" White House National Security spokesman John Kirby told reporters on Monday.\n\nEven with a $230 million price tag, the pier was hastily built -- President Joe Biden only told the Pentagon his plans days before he announced it in March -- and never meant to withstand the conditions of the Mediterranean. The pier can only be operated during \"sea state three\" levels, meaning shorter and moderate waves. The Mediterranean is routinely at a \"sea state level four\" with higher waves typically between three and five feet.\n\nAid officials say the pier has failed in its goal of delivering between 150 truckloads of aid per day to the Palestinians, instead only hitting the equivalent of about seven truckloads per day, according to the NYT.\n\n\"The volume is negligible,\" J. Stephen Morrison, director of the Global Health Policy Center at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told the NYT. \"And the seas are just going to get rougher and rougher.\"\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

According to a report from The New York Times on Tuesday, military officials have begun telling aid organizations that the effort to maintain the aid pier will stop possibly within the month.\n\nThe Biden administration rushed the pier project in March as a means of increasing the flow of food and humanitarian assistance into Gaza where aid workers said the situation was desperate. U.S. officials at the beginning of the month estimated that $230 million had been spent on establishing the pier including more than $23 million to make repairs after the pier broke apart in rough weather at the end of May.\n\nCritics said the plan was poorly conceived from the start in part because it was in an exposed area. Also, it is more efficient to truck aid into the area but the pier was meant to apply pressure on Israel to permit more aid to reach Gaza. Frustrated, the U.S. turned to the pier saying it was a short-term effort only designed for the relative calm in the Mediterranean between April and September.\n\nThe pier took longer than anticipated to assemble and position with it finally opening in the middle of May but a week later was damaged by what the U.S. military command called \"unanticipated weather.\" It reopened in June but last Friday, the U.S. reported it was again being suspended and moved to the port of Ashdod. They said it was done to protect the crews working on the pier as well as to prevent more damage.\n\n\"The decision to temporarily relocate the pier is not made lightly but is necessary to ensure the temporary pier can continue to deliver aid in the future,\" CENTCOM said in its statement on Friday. They vowed to \"rapidly re-anchor\" it in Gaza when the heightened sea state subsided.\n\nTrucks so far have moved 7.7 million pounds of aid using the temporary pier (CENTCOM)\n\nRelief organizations said the project was also flawed because of the problems getting the aid from the pier to warehouses and distributed. An early convoy was overrun and looted. Later reports said safety considerations were preventing teams from receiving the aid. U.S. personnel were not permitted to leave the pier, but three soldiers were injured in a non-military incident. One was reported in critical condition and airlifted from Israel for treatment. Details were not released but it was believed to have been an accident with a forklift.\n\nThe U.S. is saying that as of June 14, a total of 7.7 million pounds of aid had been laded since the operation began on May 17. Since the pier was reopened on June 7, they had handled approximately 5.5 million pounds and commanders had said they were hopeful that volumes would be increased. By comparison, CENTCOM said so far, the U.S. has airdropped 2.3 million pounds of aid into Gaza.\n\nThe aid pier also became the focal point of partisan politics in Washington D.C.

The administration of US President Joe Biden initially predicted that it would be September before surging seas would make the pier inoperable.\n\nThe floating dock has only been in service for about ten days in total since it was inaugurated in mid-May due to weather damage, stormy seas, and security concerns. Aid organizations say the project has largely failed in its mission.\n\nThe pier \"is not working, at least not for Palestinians,\" Stephen Semler, co-founder of the Security Policy Reform Institute, wrote in an essay cited by the outlet. Semler reportedly argued that the pier had succeeded only in providing \"humanitarian cover\" for the Biden administration's policy of supporting Israel's bombardment of Gaza.\n\nAid started arriving into Gaza via the pier on May 17, with the US saying it had transported 137 trucks of aid to warehouses before it was announced on May 28 that operations on the floating dock were suspended for repairs.\n\nUS officials had repeatedly stated that the pier was never meant to be more than a stopgap measure and was just an additional way to help get more aid into Gaza amid the war.\n\nDistribution of food to the Palestinian enclave via the sea route was suspended again last Friday when the US military said it would temporarily move the pier to keep it from being damaged by high seas. \"The safety of our service members is a top priority and temporarily relocating the pier will prevent structural damage caused by the heightened sea state,\" the US Central Command (CENTCOM) stated in a social media post. About 1,000 US service members operate the pier.\n\nThe UN World Food Program, which works with the US to bring aid from the pier to warehouses in Gaza, suspended cooperation earlier this month for a \"security review\" amid concerns for its staff and allegations that the pier could have been used by the IDF during the Nuseirat hostage rescue operation early this month, which killed 270 Palestinians. The Pentagon quickly denied that the aid pier was used in the operation.\n\nThe UN has insisted that aid deliveries by land are the \"most viable, effective, and efficient\" way to combat the humanitarian crisis in the Palestinian enclave of 2.3 million people. At least 500 trucks a day are needed to enter Gaza, it said.\n\nIsrael declared war on Hamas after its militants raided southern Israeli settlements on October 7, leaving some 1,200 people dead and taking more than 200 hostages.

Unlike Hamas, the Biden administration is actually trying to help Palestinians. It deserves credit for the pier effort, even if mother nature and terrorist organizations have presented genuine challenges.\" -- Bradley Bowman, Senior Director of FDD's Center on Military and Political Power\n\nThe Pentagon announced on May 7 that the U.S. military had completed construction of the Gaza pier. However, bad weather initially prevented it from going into service. On May 17, the White House said that the first humanitarian aid to utilize the newly built temporary pier was unloaded that morning. The $320 million pier was operational for less than two weeks before it sustained damage on May 28 and was taken out of service for repairs. The pier reopened on June 7 after repairs before again being temporarily shut down from June 9-10 due to \"high seas.\"\n\nThe latest setback occurred on June 14, when U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM) announced it would temporarily relocate the pier due to \"expected high seas.\" CENTCOM said that \"after the period of expected high seas, the pier will be rapidly re-anchored to the coast of Gaza and resume delivering humanitarian aid to Gaza.\" When asked by reporters on June 18 when the pier would resume operations, General Ryder said, \"it will go operational again this week.\"\n\nSince the start of the war, 35,851 humanitarian aid trucks have been transferred to Gaza, Israel's Coordination of Government Activities in the Territories (COGAT) announced on June 19. COGAT stated on June 18 that Israel facilitated the transfer of 305 humanitarian aid trucks. More than 3,500 metric tons of humanitarian aid have been delivered via the pier to humanitarian organizations in Gaza, CENTCOM reported on June 14.\n\nIn a further sign that the United Nations (UN) has fallen short of its aid distribution goals, COGAT also noted on June 18 that \"the content of over 1,000 aid trucks\" was sitting on the Gazan side of the Kerem Shalom border crossing waiting \"to be picked up by UN aid agencies.\"\n\n\"The US-built pier for humanitarian aid delivery was always a long-shot,\" by Seth J.

But a string of logistical and weather problems have plagued the pier since it was built in mid-May, and now U.S. defense officials are warning aid groups that it may be shuttered permanently by as soon as next month.\n\nIf closed by that point, the pier will have likely experienced little success in its goal of getting aid to the Palestinians; it has only been operational for roughly 10 days in the month since it was constructed, according to the NYT.\n\n\"Supplies from the pier aren't flowing to Palestinians, and never really have,\" Stephen Semler, a national security expert at the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft, wrote in an essay last week. \"The reality is that the [pier] is not working, at least not for Palestinians.\"\n\nThe Mediterranean's choppy sea conditions and high winds have rattled the pier, routinely grinding operations to a halt. In one case, a stint of bad weather in late May broke the pier apart completely and sent it floating away, forcing officials to tow it northbound toward Israel for repairs. The pier was re-anchored to the shores of Gaza on June 7, but the United Nations' World Food Program stopped delivering from the pier two days later, citing security concerns.\n\nLess than a week later, the pier was detached from the shores again and brought back northward to avoid another round of bad weather.\n\n\"They did have weather-related issues. They had to dismantle it for the safety of everybody involved. But I honestly don't know what the new status is,\" White House National Security spokesman John Kirby told reporters on Monday.\n\nEven with a $230 million price tag, the pier was hastily built -- President Joe Biden only told the Pentagon his plans days before he announced it in March -- and never meant to withstand the conditions of the Mediterranean. The pier can only be operated during \"sea state three\" levels, meaning shorter and moderate waves. The Mediterranean is routinely at a \"sea state level four\" with higher waves typically between three and five feet.\n\nAid officials say the pier has failed in its goal of delivering between 150 truckloads of aid per day to the Palestinians, instead only hitting the equivalent of about seven truckloads per day, according to the NYT.\n\n\"The volume is negligible,\" J. Stephen Morrison, director of the Global Health Policy Center at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told the NYT. \"And the seas are just going to get rougher and rougher.\"", "source": {"uri": "dailycallernewsfoundation.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "dailycallernewsfoundation.org"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pier", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pier"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quincy_Institute_for_Responsible_Statecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediterranean_Sea", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mediterranean Sea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Food_Programme", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World Food Programme"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Morrison", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scott Morrison"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Kirby_(admiral)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "John Kirby (admiral)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_for_Strategic_and_International_Studies", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Center for Strategic and International Studies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pentagon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Pentagon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Atmospheric_Sciences", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Atmospheric Sciences", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Immune_Disorders", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Immune Disorders", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Education_and_Training/Health_and_Safety", "label": "dmoz/Business/Education and Training/Health and Safety", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 90}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9663051", "eventUri": "eng-9663051", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-07", "textStart": 1515, "textEnd": 1521}], "sentiment": -0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 204, "relevance": 1}

I don't have any dates to announce in terms of when it will cease operations.\n\n\"Of course, as I just mentioned, we're looking forward to getting it operational again soon, and to delivering aid,\" Ryder responded when asked if the peer could be dismantled as early as this coming month.\n\nThe US had resumed delivery of humanitarian aid via the pier, which was suspended last weekend because of rough seas.\n\nThe JLOTS -- the floating pier and the Trident pier -- became operational May 17 when trucks carrying humanitarian assistance began moving ashore via the pier.\n\nMore than 3,500 metric tons (3,858 tons) have been delivered through the maritime corridor for delivery by humanitarian organizations, said CENTCOM.\n\nUS President Joe Biden ordered the establishment of a sea route to deliver food and aid to Palestinians on March 8 amid Israeli restrictions and months of conflict in the enclave. -", "source": {"uri": "en.haberler.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Haberler.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pier", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pier"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Central_Command", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Central Command"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarian_aid", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Humanitarian aid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_general_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Major general (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pentagon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Pentagon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_waters", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "International waters"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashdod", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ashdod"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ashdod"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trident_(missile)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Trident (missile)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonne", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tonne"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truck", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Truck"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Immune_Disorders", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Immune Disorders", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Operating_Systems", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Operating Systems", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Customer_Service/Conferences", "label": "dmoz/Business/Customer Service/Conferences", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Cooperatives", "label": "dmoz/Business/Cooperatives", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Cooperatives/Retail_Trade", "label": "dmoz/Business/Cooperatives/Retail Trade", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 79}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9663051", "eventUri": "eng-9663051", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-17", "textStart": 1137, "textEnd": 1143}, {"amb": false, "date": "-03-08", "textStart": 1481, "textEnd": 1488}], "sentiment": -0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 202, "relevance": 1}

A persistent breakdown in law and order is rendering an aid route in south Gaza unusable, the UN and NGOs say, days after Israel's military said it would pause combat there to help aid reach desperate Palestinians.\n\nThe U.S. military-built pier in Gaza was unloading humanitarian aid again Thursday after being removed for a second time last week because of rough seas, the U.S. military said. The floating pier was re-anchored to Gaza's shoreline on Wednesday after facing a number of setbacks.\n\nAid groups have decried the plan to bring aid to Gaza by sea as a distraction that took pressure off Israel to open more land border crossings, which are far more productive at bringing aid into Gaza as Palestinians are facing widespread hunger.\n\nThe United Nations has suspended cooperation with the pier project since June 9, a day after the Israeli military used the area around the pier in a hostage rescue that killed more than 270 Palestinians. The U.S. and Israeli militaries say no part of the pier was used in the raid.\n\nMeanwhile, Israel's pledge to guard a new aid route into southern Gaza has fallen flat, as the U.N. and international aid organizations say a breakdown in law and order has made that route unusable. The situation has largely paralyzed aid distribution to the south -- particularly since Gaza's nearby Rafah crossing with Egypt was closed when Israel invaded the city early last month.\n\nWith Israel's war against Hamas now in its ninth month, international criticism is growing over the U.S.-backed campaign of systematic destruction in Gaza, at a huge cost in civilian lives.\n\nIsraeli ground offensives and bombardments have killed more than 37,100 people, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians in its count. The war has largely cut off the flow of food, medicine and basic goods to Gaza, which is now totally dependent on aid groups.\n\nIsrael launched the war after Hamas' Oct. 7 attack, in which militants stormed into southern Israel, killed some 1,200 people -- mostly civilians -- and abducted about 250.\n\nCurrently:\n\n-- The fate of the latest cease-fire proposal hinges on Netanyahu and Hamas' leader in Gaza.\n\n-- Israel's pledge to guard an aid route into Gaza falls flat as lawlessness blocks distribution.\n\n-- A rare public rift appears between Israel's political and military leadership over how the war in Gaza is being conducted.\n\n-- The leader of Lebanon's Hezbollah militant group warns archenemy Israel against wider war.\n\n-- Hundreds died during this year's Hajj pilgrimage in Saudi Arabia amid intense heat, officials say.\n\nFollow AP's coverage of the war in Gaza at https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war\n\nHere's the latest:\n\nUS military says 1.4 million pounds of aid unloaded since Gaza pier reopened\n\nWASHINGTON -- More than 656 metric tons, or 1.4 million pounds, of aid were delivered through the U.S. military-built pier in Gaza on Thursday in the hours after it resumed operations, Pentagon press secretary Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder said.\n\nThe pier was re-anchored to the beach in Gaza and started operating Wednesday after the military temporarily removed it due to weather, Ryder said. Aid groups have decried the pier as a distraction that took pressure off Israel to open more land border crossings, which are far more productive.\n\nSince the pier opened on May 17, more than 4,100 tons, or 9.1 million pounds, of food and aid have been delivered by sea and unloaded in Gaza. However, much of the aid has lingered in the storage area right by the pier, so although it was provided to Gaza, delivery trucks have not driven it into the people who need it most.\n\nRyder directed questions about aid distribution to the United Nation's World Food Program.\n\nThe U.N. has suspended cooperation with the U.S.-led pier project since June 9, a day after the Israeli military used the area around the pier in a hostage rescue that killed more than 270 Palestinians.\n\nThe U.S. and Israeli militaries say no part of the pier was used in the raid. The U.N. is concerned that any such use -- or even a perception of it by fighters and ordinary people in Gaza -- makes their continued role in the project untenable.\n\nAt issue are the safety of humanitarian workers, and humanitarian groups' principles of neutrality, the U.N. says.\n\nHamas says it plans a legal response to ICC prosecutor's request for arrest warrants for its leaders\n\nCAIRO -- Hamas says it is planning a legal response against the International Criminal Court chief prosecutor's request for arrest warrants against its top leaders.\n\nCalling the war crimes accusations against three of its top leaders -- Yahya Sinwar, Ismail Haniyeh, and Mohammed Deif -- \"baseless,\" Hamas said it would argue that Palestinians have \"the right, indeed the duty, to resist occupation by all means available, including armed resistance.\"\n\nHamas is already considered an international terrorist group by Israel and its Western allies, so it was unclear what the impact of its legal brief would be. Both Sinwar and Deif are believed to be hiding in Gaza. Haniyeh, the supreme leader of the Islamic militant group, is based in Qatar and frequently travels across the region. Qatar is not a member of the ICC.\n\nThe ICC's chief prosecutor, Karim Khan, said in May he was seeking the arrests of the three Hamas leaders, saying they bore responsibility for the attack on Israel Oct. 7, when the militants killed around 1,200 people and took some 250 hostage.\n\nKhan accused them of eight war crimes, among them rape, torture, taking hostages, and extermination. Khan said the same day he was seeking arrest warrants against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant.\n\nIn its statement Thursday, Hamas cast Khan as biased in Israel's favor. It said the prosecutor had \"erred in considering that the state of conflict began on October 7,\" asserting that the conflict began in 1948 with Israel's establishment.\n\nDuring the war surrounding Israel's independence, some 700,000 Palestinians fled or were forced their homes, an event the Palestinians refer as the \"Nakba,\" Arabic for catastrophe.\n\nA panel of three judges will decide whether to issue the arrest warrants and allow a case to proceed. The judges typically take two months to make such decisions.\n\nIsrael's Netanyahu bemoans 'personal attacks' after White House responds to his claims about weapons delays\n\nJERUSALEM -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has described White House statements regarding his claims that the U.S. is holding up weapons deliveries for Israel as \"personal attacks,\" but said he would endure these attacks provided Israel gets the munitions.\n\nEarlier Thursday, White House national security spokesman John Kirby said the U.S. is \"perplexed\" by Netanyahu's claims earlier this week that the U.S. was holding up the delivery of weapons and creating bottlenecks. Kirby said those claims were incorrect.\n\nNetanyahu, in a statement released by his office, said, \"I am ready to suffer personal attacks as long as Israel receives from the United States the ammunition that it needs in the war for its existence.\"\n\nNetanyahu has been facing growing domestic political problems, and analysts have said his comments Tuesday on weapons delivery delays were likely aimed to shore up support among his right-wing base in Israel and the country's supporters in the U.S., and didn't appear to indicate actual shortages of weapons.\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Tuesday the only pause in weapons deliveries was related to certain heavy bombs since May.\n\nU.S. President Joe Biden delayed sending the 2,000-pound bombs over concerns about Israel's killing of civilians in Gaza. Yet the administration has gone to lengths to avoid any suggestion that Israeli forces have crossed a red line in the deepening operation in the southern city of Rafah, which would trigger a more sweeping ban on arms transfers.\n\nUN is still reviewing whether it can safely take part in aid operation at US-built pier\n\nUNITED NATIONS -- The United Nations says it is still assessing whether it's safe for staff to participate in delivering humanitarian aid from the U.S.-built pier on Gaza's coast, which means no aid is being transported from the beach to U.N. warehouses.\n\nThere is currently no timeline for completing the assessment, U.N. deputy spokesman Farhan Haq told reporters Thursday. If the U.N. Department of Safety and Security decides the U.N. can resume operations, \"then the World Food Program stands ready to do so based on its core principles.\"\n\nThese core principles -- U.N. neutrality and independence in humanitarian activities -- were called into question during Israel's June 8 hostage rescue, which killed more than 270 Palestinians. An Israeli helicopter touched down near the U.S.-built pier and helped whisk away the hostages and an injured Israeli commando, according to the U.S. and Israeli militaries. Both forces deny the pier was used, saying the helicopter landed an unspecified distance south of the causeway.\n\nThe U.N. also hasn't been able to deliver aid using a new route in southern Gaza the Israeli military said it would secure during \"tactical pauses,\" Haq said.\n\nFighting may have decreased on the route from the Kerem Shalom crossing to Gaza's main north-south Salah al-Din road, he said, but there are other impediments and \"the lack of public order and safety is a major obstacle and requires concerted efforts and concrete measures to find a solution.\"\n\n\"We've made clear that it's the responsibility of Israel, the occupying power, to ensure that assistance can reach those who need it the most and to create an enabling environment,\" Haq said.\n\nHe said the U.N. is is in discussions with Israeli authorities including COGAT, the Israeli military body that oversees aid distribution in Gaza, to provide assurances so people don't panic and think an aid delivery is a one-time event and rush to convoys trying to take food and other items.\n\n\"Many households report having only one meal every day, with some having one meal every two or three days, relying mostly on bread, food sharing with other families and rationing stocks,\" he said.\n\nAccess to water is \"critically low\" and people line up for hours to collect it and are forced to rely on seawater for domestic use, Haq said. Communicable illnesses are spreading, sewage is overflowing, there is a proliferation of insects and vermin, and a near total lack of hygiene items.\n\nFrom June 1-18 there were 61 coordinated U.N. humanitarian missions to northern Gaza, he said. Of those, 28 were facilitated by Israeli authorities, eight were denied access, 16 were impeded, and nine were canceled for logistical, operational or security reasons.\n\nIn southern Gaza, he said, the U.N. humanitarian office led assessments at sites for displaced Palestinians from June 7-14 and found people living in overcrowded tents in need of repair that don't offer any protection from extreme heat.\n\nBiden administration is still 'perplexed' by Israel's Netanyahu saying US is withholding weapons\n\nWASHINGTON -- White House national security spokesman John Kirby said Thursday the U.S. remains \"perplexed\" by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's claims this week that the U.S. was holding up weapons for Israel and creating bottlenecks.\n\nKirby called the prime minister's comments \"disappointing, especially given that no other country is doing more to help Israel defend itself against the threat by Hamas and, quite frankly, other threats that they're facing in the region.\"\n\n\"It was vexing and disappointing to us, as much as it was incorrect. So, difficult to know exactly what was on his mind there,\" Kirby told reporters.\n\nNetanyahu's video message Tuesday comes as he faces growing domestic political problems. Analysts say it likely aimed to shore up support among his right-wing base in Israel as well as the country's supporters in the U.S., and doesn't appear to indicate on-the-ground shortages of weapons.\n\nThe Biden administration has provided crucial military and diplomatic support for Israel throughout the war against Hamas.\n\nPresident Joe Biden has delayed delivering certain heavy bombs since May over concerns about Israel's killing of civilians in Gaza. Yet the administration has gone to lengths to avoid any suggestion that Israeli forces have crossed a red line in the deepening operation in the southern city of Rafah, which would trigger a more sweeping ban on arms transfers.\n\nIsrael doesn't want to let the Red Cross inspect detention centers accused of brutal treatment against Palestinians from Gaza\n\nJERUSALEM - Israel remains opposed to allowing the International Committee of the Red Cross access to detention facilities accused of harshly treating Palestinians from Gaza and is working on creating an internal inspection system, state lawyers said Wednesday.\n\nThe Red Cross had access to Israeli detention facilities holding Palestinians until Oct. 7, when Israel sealed them off from external observation. Since then, testimonies have mounted from released Palestinians of brutal treatment at the detention centers, where they are held incommunicado and without trial.\n\nThe government lawyers wrote that Israeli lawmakers are examining a proposal to form an internal body that would visit the detention facilities, hear prisoners' complaints and communicate the information to Israeli authorities.\n\nThe body is \"expected to fulfill the purpose that the Red Cross has fulfilled until now,\" the lawyers wrote. They were responding to a coalition of rights groups asking Israel's highest court to grant the Red Cross access to the detention facilities.\n\nIn response, the main rights group petitioning the court said internal Israeli examiners could not substitute for international observers.\n\n\"Mounting testimonies reveal Israel has turned its detention facilities into a black hole for Palestinian prisoners enduring appalling conditions,\" said the Association for Civil Rights in Israel, adding that the government was \"investing a far-fetched mechanism in order to replace the accepted arrangement by the world.\"\n\nSince the Hamas attack Oct. 7, Israel has taken at least 4,000 Palestinians from Gaza into custody in Israel, interrogating them for potential ties to the militant group. Over 1,500 have been released, according to state figures.\n\nHamas has rejected Red Cross appeals to visit some 120 hostages it is believed to be holding. Israel has already pronounced 43 of the hostages dead.\n\nUS defense official confirms Gaza pier is bringing aid ashore\n\nWASHINGTON -- The U.S. military-built pier in Gaza was unloading humanitarian aid again Thursday after being removed for a second time last week because of rough seas, a U.S. defense official said. The pier was reattached to Gaza's shoreline on Wednesday, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss U.S. military operations.\n\nThe pier, which cost the U.S. at least $230 million, was meant to deliver humanitarian aid into Gaza via the U.N.'s World Food Program. It has faced a number of setbacks, operating for only about a week before getting blown apart by high winds in May. The U.S. military detached the floating causeway and moved it to an Israeli port last week so it wouldn't break apart again.\n\nAid groups have decried the pier as a distraction that took pressure off Israel to open more border crossings, which are far more productive at bringing aid into Gaza. Israel's war against Hamas has caused widespread devastation and made domestic food production nearly impossible, leaving Gaza totally dependent on aid groups for food, medicine and basic goods. Palestinians are facing widespread hunger.\n\nMeanwhile, the United Nations has suspended its cooperation with the U.S.-led pier project since June 9. U.N. officials say they want to evaluate whether the Israeli military used the area around the pier in a June 8 hostage rescue that killed more than 270 Palestinians, and whether any such use -- or even a perception of it by fighters and ordinary people in Gaza -- makes their continued role in the project untenable.\n\nThe U.S. and Israeli militaries say no part of the pier was used in the raid.\n\nAP writers Lolita C. Baldor and Ellen Knickmeyer contributed to this report.\n\nPier for delivering vital aid to Gaza is functioning again, Cyprus says\n\nNICOSIA, Cyprus -- Cyprus' Foreign Ministry said Thursday the U.S. military-built pier in Gaza is up and running again after being detached for a second time last week because of rough seas.\n\nCyprus plays a key role in the pier because a security and inspection station it built screens the international aid destined for Gaza. There was no immediate confirmation from the U.S.\n\nTheodoris Gotsis, a spokesperson for the Foreign Ministry, said the pier and the causeway in Gaza were both functioning. He said over the past 40 days, Cyprus has screened and loaded onto boats some 10,000 tons of aid for Gaza.\n\nThe U.S. military detached the causeway last week to prevent it from breaking apart again, as it did late last month when it was hit by bad weather.\n\nThe pier, used to deliver humanitarian aid into Gaza, has faced a number of setbacks since it was erected. It was operational for only about a week when it was blown apart by high winds in May and then removed again earlier this month.\n\nThe U.N.'s World Food Program, one of the main aid agencies to make use of the pier, had paused its distribution of aid coming from it earlier this month over security concerns. WFP could not immediately be reached for comment on whether it was resuming distribution.\n\nEU warns against threats against Cyprus from Hezbollah\n\nNICOSIA, Cyprus -- A spokesman for the European Union's executive arm says any threat against Cyprus is a threat against the bloc's 26 other member nations.\n\nPeter Stano made the remark Thursday in response to a question regarding Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah's threat that Cyprus could be implicated in a wider conflict if the island nation allows Israel to use its ports and airports to target Lebanon.\n\nStano said the EU fully supports Cyprus and that the trade bloc is in contact with \"a number of partners in the region,\" including Lebanon and Hezbollah, in order to de-escalate tension.\n\nCyprus has enjoyed increasingly tight relations with Israel in recent years, spawned by the discovery of undersea natural gas deposits in waters between the two neighbors. Cyprus has hosted joint Israeli-Cypriot military exercises, but has not ben involved in any military operations.\n\nCyprus government spokesman Konstantinos Letymbiotis repeated that any suggestion that Cyprus - either through its infrastructure or territory - would be involved in any military operation in Lebanon is \"totally groundless.\"\n\nLetymbiotis reiterated that the island nation \"is not part of the problem\" but \"part of the solution\" thanks to its regional diplomatic footprint.\n\nHezbollah says Israeli strikes kill 3 fighters in Lebanon\n\nThe Hezbollah militant group said at least three of its fighters were killed in Israeli strikes on Wednesday.\n\nLebanese state media reported multiple Israeli strikes along the border and in an area north of the coastal city of Tyre, about 30 kilometers (20 miles) from the frontier. The Israeli military said two Hezbollah launches damaged several vehicles in northern Israel.\n\nThe fighting came as Amos Hochstein, a senior adviser to U.S. President Joe Biden, returned to Israel after meeting with officials in Lebanon on Tuesday. There has been no word on whether he has made progress in his efforts to avoid a devastating regional war.\n\nKamel Mohanna, the head of the Amel Association, an NGO providing health services in Lebanon, said the group's primary health center in the town of Khiam was hit and damaged by Israeli shelling.\n\nHezbollah began attacking Israel almost immediately after the Israel-Hamas war erupted on Oct. 7. There have been near daily exchanges of fire, though most of the strikes are confined to an area within a few mostly confined to the area around the border.\n\nBut the fighting has escalated in recent weeks, raising fears that the clashes could boil over into a full-blown war. Israel's army announced late Tuesday that it has \"approved and validated\" plans for an offensive in Lebanon.\n\nIsraeli strikes already have killed more than 400 people in Lebanon, most of them Hezbollah fighters,", "source": {"uri": "hjnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Herald Journal"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@hjnews.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type":

Disassembly could begin in July, officials told New York Times.\n\nFirst announced as a White House aim in March during President Biden's State of the Union address, the pier required hundreds of millions of dollars and the work of some 1,000 service members to plan, assemble and operate. Now, the surrender on the pier idea comes after it was operational for just 10 days -- at $23 million each.\n\nThe pier will go down as one of history's costliest publicity stunts. The impetus for the pier was mounting political pressure on Biden -- particularly from his own party -- as Israel's response to the Oct. 7 Hamas invasion killed tens of thousands, displaced more than a million, and caused a territory-wide food and medical-supply crisis.\n\nBiden's pier announcement came a week after the Michigan primary, in which 13% of Democrats -- more than 100,000 people -- voted \"uncommitted\" as a means of condemning Biden's performance on Gaza, among other issues.\n\nThe pier fiasco is the latest demonstration of the US government's pathetic deference to Israel: Unable to persuade its perennial, multi-billion-dollar beneficiary to allow sufficient aid to pass through land crossings, the US government felt compelled to spend $230 million trying to bypass the blockade -- a blockade the same US government continued to facilitate via military and financial aid.\n\nThe pier opened for business on May 18, and got off to an inauspicious start: After desperate Palestinians mobbed and ransacked the first aid trucks before they could reach a distribution warehouse managed by the World Food Programme, the pier operation was paused for two days.\n\nThen, just a week after it opened, rough seas and high winds broke up the pier, with four associated vessels running aground. That prompted another halt in operations, as components were taken away to be repaired at an Israeli port. The pier was reassembled, but, on Friday, US Central Command announced it would be towed to Israel as high seas were again moving in.\n\nThe pier's cost isn't measured only in money: In May, a US service member was critically injured on the pier. After first being medevacked to an Israeli hospital, he was later flown to Brooke Army Medical Center in San Antonio, Texas, still in critical condition.\n\nOn Sunday, Israel announced a daytime-only \"tactical pause\" along a road that supplies the southern Gaza city of Rafah, with a goal of allowing humanitarian aid to flow. The pause is to last until further notice, but Israel made no adjustments to other potential aid entry points in the 25-mile long strip.\n\nLook for Donald Trump to throw some pier-fiasco jabs at Biden when the two square off in their first 2024 debate next Thursday at 9pm ET.", "source": {"uri": "zerohedge.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Zero Hedge"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The Defense Department has said the pier would return to the Gaza coast sometime this week, and while officials told the Times the causeway could soon be dismantled, DoD spokesman Patrick Ryder stressed that \"there is no indication right now that there are plans to stop using the pier to deliver aid.\"\n\nThough US officials have touted the pier as a way to deliver much-needed supplies to Gazans amid Israel's months-long bombing campaign, some humanitarian orgs have slammed the project as a farce. In late May, Michael Selby-Green, a media spokesperson for Islamic Relief, told the New Arab the effort was merely a \"distriction,\" noting that even at full capacity it could only cover a fraction of Gaza's needs.\n\n\"It's taken two-and-a-half months to build the pier and deliver the claimed 1,000 metric tonnes of aid, which is a drop in the ocean compared to what's needed in Gaza. Every day that passes pushes more families closer to starvation and puts more lives at risk,\" he added.\n\nDoctors Without Borders' director of communications in the UK, Sam Taylor, similarly described the pier as \"an illusion of improvement,\" while a spokesperson for the Norwegian Refugee Council called it an \"an expensive, time-consuming and unviable option as an aid route in the long run.\"\n\nThe US military has claimed that some 3,500 tons of aid has been delivered to Gaza using the makeshift pier, but aid groups say much of the supplies are not reaching those who need them, pointing to issues with security and logistics thanks to the ongoing war. According to the Times, the structure has facilitated just seven truckloads worth of aid per day, falling far short of an ultimate goal of 150 trucks, as well as the bare minimum of 500 trucks needed to sustain Gaza's population.", "source": {"uri": "news.antiwar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News From Antiwar.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Defense", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Defense"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pier", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pier"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Armed_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Armed Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pentagon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Pentagon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arabs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causeway", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Causeway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_Relief", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Islamic Relief"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_waters", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "International waters"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarian_aid", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Humanitarian aid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashdod", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ashdod"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ashdod"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norwegian_Refugee_Council", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Norwegian Refugee Council"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M\u00e9decins_Sans_Fronti\u00e8res", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starvation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Starvation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Logistics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonne", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tonne"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Immune_Disorders", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Immune Disorders", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Home_and_Garden/Emergency_Supplies", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Home and Garden/Emergency Supplies", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Education_and_Training/Health_and_Safety", "label": "dmoz/Business/Education and Training/Health and Safety", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Public_Health_and_Safety/First_Aid", "label": "dmoz/Health/Public Health and Safety/First Aid", "wgt": 13}], "image": "https://news.antiwar.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/awc_logo_for-circle-profile_600sq-01.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9663051", "eventUri": "eng-9663051", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 201, "relevance": 1}

Gen. Pat Ryder said during a briefing today. \"As far as airdrops go, we do have the capability and do intend to continue conducting airdrops.\"\n\nWhile the Defense Department has said that the Joint

announce in terms of when it will cease operations ... we're looking forward to getting it operational again soon and to delivering aid.\"\n\nThe pier was anchored to the Gaza shore on May 16 and since then, due to weather, has experienced both damage and temporary shutdowns.\n\nNevertheless, the pier has delivered a substantial amount of aid into Gaza, Ryder said.\n\n\"The big picture, whether it be by land, sea or air, [we're] employing all avenues to get assistance into Gaza,\" he said. \"Since the pier was put in place about a month ago, we've been able to shuttle over 3,500 metric tons, or 7.7 million pounds of aid onto the shore in Gaza, via this temporary pier.\"\n\nThe general added that the U.S would continue to work with aid groups, the United Nations, the Israelis and other partners to find ways to get additional aid into Gaza.\n\nIndependent of the floating pier, U.S. Central Command has worked both on its own and in partnership with the Royal Jordanian Air Force, since March, to conduct humanitarian airdrops of aid into Gaza.\n\nSince that time, Centcom has been involved in nearly 40 such missions into Gaza to deliver, among other things, more than 1,050 metric tons of bulk food, water and prepared meals.\n\nThe last such humanitarian air drop took place June 9, when a U.S. C-130 dropped more than 10 metric tons of \"meals ready to eat\" --

"body": "Aid organizations have said that the $230 million temporary pier constructed by the US military to expedite humanitarian aid to Gaza has not been successful in fulfilling its purpose and is likely to cease operations earlier than anticipated.\n\nThe pier has undergone repairs twice in the last month due to damage, while there is uncertainty as to whether the United Nations will continue to use it for humanitarian aid distribution to Palestinians.\n\nThe aid effort suffered another setback as the US military announced on Friday its decision to temporarily relocate the pier in order to protect it from potential damage caused by rough seas.\n\nWashington is now considering temporary dismantling and relocation of its pier off the coast of Gaza for the second time, citing concerns about poor conditions.\n\nThe decision \"is not made lightly but is necessary to ensure the temporary pier can continue to deliver aid in the future,\" the US Central Command said in a post on social media, stating that the pier would be moved to Israel.\n\nOver the past month, the pier has only been operational for approximately 10 days, as it required frequent repairs due to being damaged by rough seas, detached for safety reasons, or temporarily halted due to security concerns.\n\nAccording to certain American military officials, the pier's limited objectives are expected to be unattainable, despite its initial purpose as a temporary solution while the Biden administration negotiates with Israel to facilitate the transportation of essential goods to Gaza through land routes, which is considered a more effective method of providing relief.\n\nThe construction of the pier coincided with health authorities' warnings of an impending famine in the region and difficulty to have access to the people in need.\n\nAid groups report that despite the initial arrival of aid on May 17, the project has faced ongoing challenges, with a significant number of Gazans still enduring severe hunger.\n\nAccording to Gaza officials, as many as 3,500 children are currently at risk of starving to death, as the territory is \"rapidly\" drifting towards famine.\n\n\"3,500 children are threatened by death due to malnutrition and lack of nutritional supplements and vaccines which became part of the prohibited items to enter Gaza,\" the Gaza-based Government Media Office said in a statement.\n\n\"The crime of banning entry of food and medicine\" exacerbated the suffering of the Palestinians in Gaza, it added, referring to Israeli restrictions.", "source": {"uri":

Predictably, the pier was a target of Iran-backed terrorists in the region and rough weather repeatedly damaged the pier or made it necessary to move the pier to protected waters off Israel's coast.\n\nWhile it was always described as a \"temporary\" piece of infrastructure that was supposed to facilitate the delivery of humanitarian aid to residents of the enclave, the pier is now slated to be dismantled months earlier than initially anticipated as it has utterly failed to do what Biden said it would and only continues to endanger American service members.\n\nAccording to a New York Times report on the latest Biden blunder, the administration \"initially predicted that it would be September before surging seas would make the pier inoperable...But military officials are now warning aid organizations that the project could be dismantled as early as next month.\"\n\nWhat's more, the pier \"has been in service only about 10 days\" since it entered use on May 17 and the \"rest of the time, it was being repaired after rough seas broke it apart, detached to avoid further damage or paused because of security concerns.\" One such instance of weather-induced damage came with a $22 million repair bill, also footed by American taxpayers.\n\nAs Foundation for Defense of Democracies (FDD) Senior Advisor Richard Goldberg noted in an FDD release this week, Biden's pier \"was political, not practical\" and \"never made a lot of sense to do it this way.\"\n\n\"We should be helping the people of Gaza by supporting Israel in defeating Hamas and pushing allies to send aid through non-UNRWA channels -- not with virtue signaling intended to amplify Hamas disinformation and undermine Israel,\" Goldberg emphasized.\n\nAs Townhall reported previously, terrorist targeting of the pier necessitated heavier U.S. defenses to be installed nearby in an attempt to save the structure from being completely blown to bits. We also reported in late May that the Pentagon \"did not believe\" any of the 569 metric tons worth of aid delivered to Gaza across the pier in its early days had made it into the hands of the enclave's residents for whom it was intended.\n\nMost recently, U.S. forces had to detach the pier from Gaza's shore and tow it to calmer waters off the coast of Israel due to anticipated high seas in its intended location, as Katie reported last week.\n\nThe Biden administration's decision to construct the boondoggle also, as the Times noted in its coverage, served to throw \"a spotlight on the urgent need to provide more humanitarian assistance overall to Gaza,\" even as Hamas continues to carry out rocket attacks against border crossings where aid enters Gaza and then steal any aid that enters the enclave for its terrorists.\n\n\"There is a genuine humanitarian crisis in Gaza, caused both by the war Hamas started and the systematic strategy the terror group employs to maximize Palestinian suffering for the purposes of demonizing Israel and depriving it of American security assistance,\" reminded Bradley Bowman, the senior director of FDD's Center on Military and Political Power.", "source": {"uri": "townhall.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Townhall"}, "authors": [{"uri": "spencer_brown@townhall.com", "name": "Spencer Brown", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pier", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pier"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarian_aid", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Humanitarian aid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundation_for_Defense_of_Democracies", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Foundation for Defense of Democracies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enclave_and_exclave", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Enclave and exclave"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disinformation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Disinformation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_waters", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International waters"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarian_crisis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Humanitarian crisis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rocket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonne", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tonne"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pentagon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Pentagon"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Immune_Disorders", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Immune Disorders", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 74}], "image": "https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2024/124/8090b213-ef61-48c3-8718-1b4e4b8e423e.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9663051", "eventUri": "eng-9663051", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-17", "textStart": 1138, "textEnd": 1144}], "sentiment": -0.3411764705882353, "wgt": 197, "relevance": 1}

In recent weeks, Israel has given relief organizations greater access, but the groups say the situation remains dire.'\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/18/us/politics/gaza-pier-israel-aid.html", "source": {"uri": "democraticunderground.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Democratic Underground"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pier", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pier"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relief", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Relief"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Famine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Famine"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Organizations", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Roads_and_Highways/Route_66", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Roads and Highways/Route 66", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Disaster_Relief_and_Recovery", "label": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Disaster Relief and Recovery", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Real_Estate/Undeveloped_or_Vacant", "label": "dmoz/Business/Real Estate/Undeveloped or Vacant", "wgt": 9}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9663051", "eventUri": "eng-9663051", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 196, "relevance": 1}

The floating pier was re-anchored to Gaza's shoreline on Wednesday after facing a number of setbacks.\n\nAid groups have decried the plan to bring aid to Gaza by sea as a distraction that took pressure off Israel to open more land border crossings, which are far more productive at bringing aid into Gaza as Palestinians are facing widespread hunger.\n\nThe United Nations has suspended cooperation with the pier project since June 9, a day after the Israeli military used the area around the pier in a hostage rescue that killed more than 270 Palestinians. The U.S. and Israeli militaries say no part of the pier was used in the raid.\n\nMeanwhile, Israel's pledge to guard a new aid route into southern Gaza has fallen flat, as the U.N. and international aid organizations say a breakdown in law and order has made that route unusable. The situation has largely paralyzed aid distribution to the south -- particularly since Gaza's nearby Rafah crossing with Egypt was closed when Israel invaded the city early last month.\n\nWith Israel's war against Hamas now in its ninth month, international criticism is growing over the U.S.-backed campaign of systematic destruction in Gaza, at a huge cost in civilian lives.\n\nIsraeli ground offensives and bombardments have killed more than 37,100 people, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians in its count. The war has largely cut off the flow of food, medicine and basic goods to Gaza, which is now totally dependent on aid groups.\n\nIsrael launched the war after Hamas' Oct. 7 attack, in which militants stormed into southern Israel, killed some 1,200 people -- mostly civilians -- and abducted about 250.\n\nCurrently:\n\n-- The fate of the latest cease-fire proposal hinges on Netanyahu and Hamas' leader in Gaza.\n\n-- Israel's pledge to guard an aid route into Gaza falls flat as lawlessness blocks distribution.\n\n-- A rare public rift appears between Israel's political and military leadership over how the war in Gaza is being conducted.\n\n-- The leader of Lebanon's Hezbollah militant group warns archenemy Israel against wider war.\n\n-- Hundreds died during this year's Hajj pilgrimage in Saudi Arabia amid intense heat, officials say.\n\nFollow AP's coverage of the war in Gaza at https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war\n\nHere's the latest:\n\nUS military says 1.4 million pounds of aid unloaded since Gaza pier reopened\n\nWASHINGTON -- More than 656 metric tons, or 1.4 million pounds, of aid were delivered through the U.S. military-built pier in Gaza on Thursday in the hours after it resumed operations, Pentagon press secretary Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder said.\n\nThe pier was re-anchored to the beach in Gaza and started operating Wednesday after the military temporarily removed it due to weather, Ryder said. Aid groups have decried the pier as a distraction that took pressure off Israel to open more land border crossings, which are far more productive.\n\nSince the pier opened on May 17, more than 4,100 tons, or 9.1 million pounds, of food and aid have been delivered by sea and unloaded in Gaza. However, much of the aid has lingered in the storage area right by the pier, so although it was provided to Gaza, delivery trucks have not driven it into the people who need it most.\n\nRyder directed questions about aid distribution to the United Nation's World Food Program.\n\nThe U.N. has suspended cooperation with the U.S.-led pier project since June 9, a day after the Israeli military used the area around the pier in a hostage rescue that killed more than 270 Palestinians.\n\nThe U.S. and Israeli militaries say no part of the pier was used in the raid. The U.N. is concerned that any such use -- or even a perception of it by fighters and ordinary people in Gaza -- makes their continued role in the project untenable.\n\nAt issue are the safety of humanitarian workers, and humanitarian groups' principles of neutrality, the U.N. says.\n\nHamas says it plans a legal response to ICC prosecutor's request for arrest warrants for its leaders\n\nCAIRO -- Hamas says it is planning a legal response against the International Criminal Court chief prosecutor's request for arrest warrants against its top leaders.\n\nCalling the war crimes accusations against three of its top leaders -- Yahya Sinwar, Ismail Haniyeh, and Mohammed Deif -- \"baseless,\" Hamas said it would argue that Palestinians have \"the right, indeed the duty, to resist occupation by all means available, including armed resistance.\"\n\nHamas is already considered an international terrorist group by Israel and its Western allies, so it was unclear what the impact of its legal brief would be. Both Sinwar and Deif are believed to be hiding in Gaza. Haniyeh, the supreme leader of the Islamic militant group, is based in Qatar and frequently travels across the region. Qatar is not a member of the ICC.\n\nThe ICC's chief prosecutor, Karim Khan, said in May he was seeking the arrests of the three Hamas leaders, saying they bore responsibility for the attack on Israel Oct. 7, when the militants killed around 1,200 people and took some 250 hostage.\n\nKhan accused them of eight war crimes, among them rape, torture, taking hostages, and extermination. Khan said the same day he was seeking arrest warrants against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant.\n\nIn its statement Thursday, Hamas cast Khan as biased in Israel's favor. It said the prosecutor had \"erred in considering that the state of conflict began on October 7,\" asserting that the conflict began in 1948 with Israel's establishment.\n\nDuring the war surrounding Israel's independence, some 700,000 Palestinians fled or were forced their homes, an event the Palestinians refer as the \"Nakba,\" Arabic for catastrophe.\n\nA panel of three judges will decide whether to issue the arrest warrants and allow a case to proceed. The judges typically take two months to make such decisions.\n\nIsrael's Netanyahu bemoans 'personal attacks' after White House responds to his claims about weapons delays\n\nJERUSALEM -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has described White House statements regarding his claims that the U.S. is holding up weapons deliveries for Israel as \"personal attacks,\" but said he would endure these attacks provided Israel gets the munitions.\n\nEarlier Thursday, White House national security spokesman John Kirby said the U.S. is \"perplexed\" by Netanyahu's claims earlier this week that the U.S. was holding up the delivery of weapons and creating bottlenecks. Kirby said those claims were incorrect.\n\nNetanyahu, in a statement released by his office, said, \"I am ready to suffer personal attacks as long as Israel receives from the United States the ammunition that it needs in the war for its existence.\"\n\nNetanyahu has been facing growing domestic political problems, and analysts have said his comments Tuesday on weapons delivery delays were likely aimed to shore up support among his right-wing base in Israel and the country's supporters in the U.S., and didn't appear to indicate actual shortages of weapons.\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Tuesday the only pause in weapons deliveries was related to certain heavy bombs since May.\n\nU.S. President Joe Biden delayed sending the 2,000-pound bombs over concerns about Israel's killing of civilians in Gaza. Yet the administration has gone to lengths to avoid any suggestion that Israeli forces have crossed a red line in the deepening operation in the southern city of Rafah, which would trigger a more sweeping ban on arms transfers.\n\nUN is still reviewing whether it can safely take part in aid operation at US-built pier\n\nUNITED NATIONS -- The United Nations says it is still assessing whether it's safe for staff to participate in delivering humanitarian aid from the U.S.-built pier on Gaza's coast, which means no aid is being transported from the beach to U.N. warehouses.\n\nThere is currently no timeline for completing the assessment, U.N. deputy spokesman Farhan Haq told reporters Thursday. If the U.N. Department of Safety and Security decides the U.N. can resume operations, \"then the World Food Program stands ready to do so based on its core principles.\"\n\nThese core principles -- U.N. neutrality and independence in humanitarian activities -- were called into question during Israel's June 8 hostage rescue, which killed more than 270 Palestinians. An Israeli helicopter touched down near the U.S.-built pier and helped whisk away the hostages and an injured Israeli commando, according to the U.S. and Israeli militaries. Both forces deny the pier was used, saying the helicopter landed an unspecified distance south of the causeway.\n\nThe U.N. also hasn't been able to deliver aid using a new route in southern Gaza the Israeli military said it would secure during \"tactical pauses,\" Haq said.\n\nFighting may have decreased on the route from the Kerem Shalom crossing to Gaza's main north-south Salah al-Din road, he said, but there are other impediments and \"the lack of public order and safety is a major obstacle and requires concerted efforts and concrete measures to find a solution.\"\n\n\"We've made clear that it's the responsibility of Israel, the occupying power, to ensure that assistance can reach those who need it the most and to create an enabling environment,\" Haq said.\n\nHe said the U.N. is is in discussions with Israeli authorities including COGAT, the Israeli military body that oversees aid distribution in Gaza, to provide assurances so people don't panic and think an aid delivery is a one-time event and rush to convoys trying to take food and other items.\n\n\"Many households report having only one meal every day, with some having one meal every two or three days, relying mostly on bread, food sharing with other families and rationing stocks,\" he said.\n\nAccess to water is \"critically low\" and people line up for hours to collect it and are forced to rely on seawater for domestic use, Haq said. Communicable illnesses are spreading, sewage is overflowing, there is a proliferation of insects and vermin, and a near total lack of hygiene items.\n\nFrom June 1-18 there were 61 coordinated U.N. humanitarian missions to northern Gaza, he said. Of those, 28 were facilitated by Israeli authorities, eight were denied access, 16 were impeded, and nine were canceled for logistical, operational or security reasons.\n\nIn southern Gaza, he said, the U.N. humanitarian office led assessments at sites for displaced Palestinians from June 7-14 and found people living in overcrowded tents in need of repair that don't offer any protection from extreme heat.\n\nBiden administration is still 'perplexed' by Israel's Netanyahu saying US is withholding weapons\n\nWASHINGTON -- White House national security spokesman John Kirby said Thursday the U.S. remains \"perplexed\" by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's claims this week that the U.S. was holding up weapons for Israel and creating bottlenecks.\n\nKirby called the prime minister's comments \"disappointing, especially given that no other country is doing more to help Israel defend itself against the threat by Hamas and, quite frankly, other threats that they're facing in the region.\"\n\n\"It was vexing and disappointing to us, as much as it was incorrect. So, difficult to know exactly what was on his mind there,\" Kirby told reporters.\n\nNetanyahu's video message Tuesday comes as he faces growing domestic political problems. Analysts say it likely aimed to shore up support among his right-wing base in Israel as well as the country's supporters in the U.S., and doesn't appear to indicate on-the-ground shortages of weapons.\n\nThe Biden administration has provided crucial military and diplomatic support for Israel throughout the war against Hamas.\n\nPresident Joe Biden has delayed delivering certain heavy bombs since May over concerns about Israel's killing of civilians in Gaza. Yet the administration has gone to lengths to avoid any suggestion that Israeli forces have crossed a red line in the deepening operation in the southern city of Rafah, which would trigger a more sweeping ban on arms transfers.\n\nIsrael doesn't want to let the Red Cross inspect detention centers accused of brutal treatment against Palestinians from Gaza\n\nJERUSALEM - Israel remains opposed to allowing the International Committee of the Red Cross access to detention facilities accused of harshly treating Palestinians from Gaza and is working on creating an internal inspection system, state lawyers said Wednesday.\n\nThe Red Cross had access to Israeli detention facilities holding Palestinians until Oct. 7, when Israel sealed them off from external observation. Since then, testimonies have mounted from released Palestinians of brutal treatment at the detention centers, where they are held incommunicado and without trial.\n\nThe government lawyers wrote that Israeli lawmakers are examining a proposal to form an internal body that would visit the detention facilities, hear prisoners' complaints and communicate the information to Israeli authorities.\n\nThe body is \"expected to fulfill the purpose that the Red Cross has fulfilled until now,\" the lawyers wrote. They were responding to a coalition of rights groups asking Israel's highest court to grant the Red Cross access to the detention facilities.\n\nIn response, the main rights group petitioning the court said internal Israeli examiners could not substitute for international observers.\n\n\"Mounting testimonies reveal Israel has turned its detention facilities into a black hole for Palestinian prisoners enduring appalling conditions,\" said the Association for Civil Rights in Israel, adding that the government was \"investing a far-fetched mechanism in order to replace the accepted arrangement by the world.\"\n\nSince the Hamas attack Oct. 7, Israel has taken at least 4,000 Palestinians from Gaza into custody in Israel, interrogating them for potential ties to the militant group. Over 1,500 have been released, according to state figures.\n\nHamas has rejected Red Cross appeals to visit some 120 hostages it is believed to be holding. Israel has already pronounced 43 of the hostages dead.\n\nUS defense official confirms Gaza pier is bringing aid ashore\n\nWASHINGTON -- The U.S. military-built pier in Gaza was unloading humanitarian aid again Thursday after being removed for a second time last week because of rough seas, a U.S. defense official said. The pier was reattached to Gaza's shoreline on Wednesday, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss U.S. military operations.\n\nThe pier, which cost the U.S. at least $230 million, was meant to deliver humanitarian aid into Gaza via the U.N.'s World Food Program. It has faced a number of setbacks, operating for only about a week before getting blown apart by high winds in May. The U.S. military detached the floating causeway and moved it to an Israeli port last week so it wouldn't break apart again.\n\nAid groups have decried the pier as a distraction that took pressure off Israel to open more border crossings, which are far more productive at bringing aid into Gaza. Israel's war against Hamas has caused widespread devastation and made domestic food production nearly impossible, leaving Gaza totally dependent on aid groups for food, medicine and basic goods. Palestinians are facing widespread hunger.\n\nMeanwhile, the United Nations has suspended its cooperation with the U.S.-led pier project since June 9. U.N. officials say they want to evaluate whether the Israeli military used the area around the pier in a June 8 hostage rescue that killed more than 270 Palestinians, and whether any such use -- or even a perception of it by fighters and ordinary people in Gaza -- makes their continued role in the project untenable.\n\nThe U.S. and Israeli militaries say no part of the pier was used in the raid.\n\nAP writers Lolita C. Baldor and Ellen Knickmeyer contributed to this report.\n\nPier for delivering vital aid to Gaza is functioning again, Cyprus says\n\nNICOSIA, Cyprus -- Cyprus' Foreign Ministry said Thursday the U.S. military-built pier in Gaza is up and running again after being detached for a second time last week because of rough seas.\n\nCyprus plays a key role in the pier because a security and inspection station it built screens the international aid destined for Gaza. There was no immediate confirmation from the U.S.\n\nTheodoris Gotsis, a spokesperson for the Foreign Ministry, said the pier and the causeway in Gaza were both functioning. He said over the past 40 days, Cyprus has screened and loaded onto boats some 10,000 tons of aid for Gaza.\n\nThe U.S. military detached the causeway last week to prevent it from breaking apart again, as it did late last month when it was hit by bad weather.\n\nThe pier, used to deliver humanitarian aid into Gaza, has faced a number of setbacks since it was erected. It was operational for only about a week when it was blown apart by high winds in May and then removed again earlier this month.\n\nThe U.N.'s World Food Program, one of the main aid agencies to make use of the pier, had paused its distribution of aid coming from it earlier this month over security concerns. WFP could not immediately be reached for comment on whether it was resuming distribution.\n\nEU warns against threats against Cyprus from Hezbollah\n\nNICOSIA, Cyprus -- A spokesman for the European Union's executive arm says any threat against Cyprus is a threat against the bloc's 26 other member nations.\n\nPeter Stano made the remark Thursday in response to a question regarding Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah's threat that Cyprus could be implicated in a wider conflict if the island nation allows Israel to use its ports and airports to target Lebanon.\n\nStano said the EU fully supports Cyprus and that the trade bloc is in contact with \"a number of partners in the region,\" including Lebanon and Hezbollah, in order to de-escalate tension.\n\nCyprus has enjoyed increasingly tight relations with Israel in recent years, spawned by the discovery of undersea natural gas deposits in waters between the two neighbors. Cyprus has hosted joint Israeli-Cypriot military exercises, but has not ben involved in any military operations.\n\nCyprus government spokesman Konstantinos Letymbiotis repeated that any suggestion that Cyprus - either through its infrastructure or territory - would be involved in any military operation in Lebanon is \"totally groundless.\"\n\nLetymbiotis reiterated that the island nation \"is not part of the problem\" but \"part of the solution\" thanks to its regional diplomatic footprint.\n\nHezbollah says Israeli strikes kill 3 fighters in Lebanon\n\nThe Hezbollah militant group said at least three of its fighters were killed in Israeli strikes on Wednesday.\n\nLebanese state media reported multiple Israeli strikes along the border and in an area north of the coastal city of Tyre, about 30 kilometers (20 miles) from the frontier. The Israeli military said two Hezbollah launches damaged several vehicles in northern Israel.\n\nThe fighting came as Amos Hochstein, a senior adviser to U.S. President Joe Biden, returned to Israel after meeting with officials in Lebanon on Tuesday. There has been no word on whether he has made progress in his efforts to avoid a devastating regional war.\n\nKamel Mohanna, the head of the Amel Association, an NGO providing health services in Lebanon, said the group's primary health center in the town of Khiam was hit and damaged by Israeli shelling.\n\nHezbollah began attacking Israel almost immediately after the Israel-Hamas war erupted on Oct. 7. There have been near daily exchanges of fire, though most of the strikes are confined to an area within a few mostly confined to the area around the border.\n\nBut the fighting has escalated in recent weeks, raising fears that the clashes could boil over into a full-blown war. Israel's army announced late Tuesday that it has \"approved and validated\" plans for an offensive in Lebanon.\n\nIsraeli strikes already have killed more than 400 people in Lebanon, most of them Hezbollah fighters,", "source": {"uri": "news-gazette.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The News-Gazette"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@news-gazette.com", "name": "Associated Press",

Prior to that, four vessels that had stabilized the pier broke off due to choppy waters, which forced its closure.\n\nThe Biden administration announced plans for the pier in March as a way to get crucial aid to Palestinians as basic necessities remain scarce in Gaza.\n\nThe pier's failure has come as Israel conducts a sizable operation in Rafah, with tanks rolling into the heart of the city for the first time since the war began.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nRyder said he wasn't aware of plans to dismantle the pier.\n\n\"I'm not tracking any established timeline at this point, in terms of when the pier will stop operating, again with the caveat that this was always intended to be a temporary pier,\" he said. \"I'm not aware at this point of any established date of this is when we're going to stop.\"", "source": {"uri": "foxnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fox News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "louis_casiano@foxnews.com", "name": "Louis Casiano", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pier", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pier"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_City", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gaza City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fox News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_general_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Major general (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Air_Force", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Air Force"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Armed_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Armed Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pentagon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Pentagon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Looting", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Looting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediterranean_Sea", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mediterranean Sea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convoy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Convoy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tank", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafah", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rafah"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rafah"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Immune_Disorders", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Immune Disorders", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Education_and_Training/Health_and_Safety", "label": "dmoz/Business/Education and Training/Health and Safety", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Public_Health_and_Safety/First_Aid", "label": "dmoz/Health/Public Health and Safety/First Aid", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 52}], "image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/05/1024/512/AP24135501722571.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9663051", "eventUri": "eng-9663051", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.207843137254902, "wgt": 194, "relevance": 1}

About 1,000 US service members operate the pier.\n\nThe UN World Food Program, which works with the US to bring aid from the pier to warehouses in Gaza, suspended cooperation earlier this month for a \"security review\" amid concerns for its staff and allegations that the pier could have been used by the Israeli army during the military operation in the Nuseirat refugee camp, which led to the killing of 274 Palestinians, three Israeli captives and the release of four others.\n\nThe Pentagon quickly denied that the aid pier was used in the operation.\n\nThe UN has insisted that aid deliveries by land are the \"most viable, effective, and efficient\" way to combat the humanitarian crisis in the Palestinian enclave of 2.3 million people. At least 500 trucks a day are needed to enter Gaza, it said.\n\nFake Aid Truck Used to Carry Out Rescue Operation - US 'Special Cell' Participated in Nuseirat Massacre\n\nCurrently on trial before the International Court of Justice for genocide against Palestinians, Israel has been waging a devastating war on Gaza since October 7.\n\nAccording to Gaza's Ministry of Health, 37,431 Palestinians have been killed, and 85,653 wounded in Israel's ongoing genocide in Gaza starting on October 7.\n\nMoreover, at least 7,000 people are unaccounted for, presumed dead under the rubble of their homes throughout the Strip.\n\nPalestinian and international organizations say that the majority of those killed and wounded are women and children.\n\nGAZA LIVE BLOG: Massacres in Rafah, Nuseirat | Gallant to Visit Washington | US Pier Reconnected - Day 258\n\nThe Israeli war has resulted in an acute famine, mostly in northern Gaza, resulting in the death of many Palestinians, mostly children.\n\nThe Israeli aggression has also resulted in the forceful displacement of nearly two million people from all over the Gaza Strip, with the vast majority of the displaced forced into the densely crowded southern city of Rafah near the border with Egypt - in what has become Palestine's largest mass exodus since the 1948 Nakba.\n\nIsrael says that 1,200 soldiers and civilians were killed during the Al-Aqsa Flood Operation on October 7.

The official didn't offer a timeline for when those deliveries would restart. But they're expected soon.\n\nEven when they do, the aid rolling into Gaza won't immediately reach the Palestinian people -- more than 1 million of whom face \"catastrophic levels of hunger,\" according to the United Nations World Food Programme.\n\nThe WFP is responsible for distributing the humanitarian support but paused its deliveries June 9 due to concerns over worker safety. A day before, Executive Director Cindy McCain said, two warehouses had been hit by rockets, leaving one worker injured.\n\nIn the meantime, the crates moving from the pier into Gaza are only filling the nearby storage sites.\n\nFollowing its completion in mid-May, the pier has been a debacle for the U.S. military. It was damaged by stormy weather little over a week later, leaving it out of commission until June 8. U.S. Central Command announced it would detach the pier last week, expecting rough seas that might again cause damage.\n\nIn addition, multiple U.S. service members have sustained noncombatant injuries while working on the humanitarian site.\n\nSince its installation, the pier has only been operational for about 10 days and delivered 3,500 metric tons of aid for further transport the aid into Gaza, according to Pentagon spokesperson Sabrina Singh. The Pentagon insists that the pier is a \"temporary measure\" and that a sufficient amount of aid can only come through land routes into Gaza.\n\nPentagon Press Secretary Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder said in a briefing that he doesn't have a date on when the pier will cease operations.\n\nAside from weather conditions, another concern is when the WFP will resume their distribution.\n\nThe same day WFP warehouses were rocketed, an Israeli-held raid rescued four hostages and killed at least 274 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which is run by the terrorist group Hamas. The Israeli rescue unit used an area near the pier during its operation, leading WFP to conduct a security review on whether they can safely continue operations.\n\nMcCain said in a CBS \"Face the Nation\" interview that she is unsure how the warehouses got rocketed since they are \"deconflicted\" from the Israeli military.\n\nIn a briefing with reporters last week, Ryder affirmed multiple times that the Israeli Defense Forces used no part of the pier or humanitarian staging ground to launch its hostage-rescue operation.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarianism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Humanitarianism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Food_Programme", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "World Food Programme"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pier", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pier"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Armed_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Armed Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_waters", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "International waters"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pentagon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Pentagon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cindy_McCain", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cindy McCain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-combatant", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Non-combatant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Central_Command", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Central Command"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rocket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonne", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tonne"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Health,_Palestine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Health, Palestine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face_the_Nation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Face the Nation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_general_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Major general (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Israel Defense Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CBS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House_Press_Secretary", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "White House Press Secretary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hostage", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hostage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_McCain", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "John McCain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Defense", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Defense", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Immune_Disorders", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Immune Disorders", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Military_Science", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Military Science", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Rockets", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Rockets", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 75}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/snMOz7lffEQzpJY7VXMCIg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/military_times_968/ad6a5cb91c78c62944d402f548e6c365", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9663051", "eventUri": "eng-9663051", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-09", "textStart": 655, "textEnd": 661}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-08", "textStart": 1104, "textEnd": 1110}], "sentiment": -0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 193, "relevance": 1}

The United Nations has suspended its cooperation with the pier project since June 9 and is conducting a security review.\n\nWith Israel's war against Hamas now in its ninth month, international criticism is growing over the U.S.-backed campaign of systematic destruction in Gaza, at a huge cost in civilian lives.\n\nIsraeli ground offensives and bombardments have killed more than 37,100 people, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians in its count. The war has largely cut off the flow of food, medicine and basic goods to Gaza, which is now totally dependent on aid groups.\n\nIsrael launched the war after Hamas' Oct. 7 attack, in which militants stormed into southern Israel, killed some 1,200 people -- mostly civilians -- and abducted about 250.\n\n-- A rare public rift appears between Israel's political and military leadership over how the war in Gaza is being conducted.\n\n-- The leader of Lebanon's Hezbollah militant group warns archenemy Israel against wider war.\n\n-- Hundreds died during this year's Hajj pilgrimage in Saudi Arabia amid intense heat, officials say.\n\nFollow AP's coverage of the war in Gaza at https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war\n\nHere's the latest:\n\nIsrael doesn't want to let the Red Cross inspect detention centers accused of brutal treatment against Palestinians from Gaza\n\nJERUSALEM - Israel remains opposed to allowing the International Committee of the Red Cross access to detention facilities accused of harshly treating Palestinians from Gaza and is working on creating an internal inspection system, state lawyers said Wednesday.\n\nThe Red Cross had access to Israeli detention facilities holding Palestinians until Oct. 7, when Israel sealed them off from external observation. Since then, testimonies have mounted from released Palestinians of brutal treatment at the detention centers, where they are held incommunicado and without trial.\n\nThe government lawyers wrote that Israeli lawmakers are examining a proposal to form an internal body that would visit the detention facilities, hear prisoners' complaints and communicate the information to Israeli authorities.\n\nThe body is \"expected to fulfill the purpose that the Red Cross has fulfilled until now,\" the lawyers wrote. They were responding to a coalition of rights groups asking Israel's highest court to grant the Red Cross access to the detention facilities.\n\nIn response, the main rights group petitioning the court said internal Israeli examiners could not substitute for international observers.\n\n\"Mounting testimonies reveal Israel has turned its detention facilities into a black hole for Palestinian prisoners enduring appalling conditions,\" said the Association for Civil Rights in Israel, adding that the government was \"investing a far-fetched mechanism in order to replace the accepted arrangement by the world.\"\n\nSince the Hamas attack Oct. 7, Israel has taken at least 4,000 Palestinians from Gaza into custody in Israel, interrogating them for potential ties to the militant group. Over 1,500 have been released, according to state figures.\n\nHamas has rejected Red Cross appeals to visit some 120 hostages it is believed to be holding. Israel has already pronounced 43 of the hostages dead.\n\nUS defense official confirms Gaza pier is bringing aid ashore\n\nWASHINGTON -- The U.S. military-built pier in Gaza was unloading humanitarian aid again Thursday after being removed for a second time last week because of rough seas, a U.S. defense official said. The pier was reattached to Gaza's shoreline on Wednesday, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss U.S. military operations.\n\nThe pier, which cost the U.S. at least $230 million, was meant to deliver humanitarian aid into Gaza via the U.N.'s World Food Program. It has faced a number of setbacks, operating for only about a week before getting blown apart by high winds in May. The U.S. military detached the floating causeway and moved it to an Israeli port last week so it wouldn't break apart again.\n\nAid groups have decried the pier as a distraction that took pressure off Israel to open more border crossings, which are far more productive at bringing aid into Gaza. Israel's war against Hamas has caused widespread devastation and made domestic food production nearly impossible, leaving Gaza totally dependent on aid groups for food, medicine and basic goods. Palestinians are facing widespread hunger.\n\nMeanwhile, the United Nations has suspended its cooperation with the U.S.-led pier project since June 9. U.N. officials say they want to evaluate whether the Israeli military used the area around the pier in a June 8 hostage rescue that left more than 270 Palestinians dead, and whether any such use -- or even a perception of it by fighters and ordinary people in Gaza -- makes their continued role in the project untenable.\n\nThe U.S. and Israeli militaries say no part of the pier was used in the raid.\n\n___\n\nAP writers Lolita C. Baldor and Ellen Knickmeyer contributed to this report.\n\nPier for delivering vital aid to Gaza is functioning again, Cyprus says\n\nNICOSIA, Cyprus -- Cyprus' Foreign Ministry said Thursday the U.S. military-built pier in Gaza is up and running again after being detached for a second time last week because of rough seas.\n\nCyprus plays a key role in the pier because a security and inspection station it built screens the international aid destined for Gaza. There was no immediate confirmation from the U.S.\n\nTheodoris Gotsis, a spokesperson for the Foreign Ministry, said the pier and the causeway in Gaza were both functioning. He said over the past 40 days, Cyprus has screened and loaded onto boats some 10,000 tons of aid for Gaza.\n\nThe U.S. military detached the causeway last week to prevent it from breaking apart again, as it did late last month when it was hit by bad weather.\n\nThe pier, used to deliver humanitarian aid into Gaza, has faced a number of setbacks since it was erected. It was operational for only about a week when it was blown apart by high winds in May and then removed again earlier this month.\n\nThe U.N.'s World Food Program, one of the main aid agencies to make use of the pier, had paused its distribution of aid coming from it earlier this month over security concerns. WFP could not immediately be reached for comment on whether it was resuming distribution.\n\nEU warns against threats against Cyprus from Hezbollah\n\nNICOSIA, Cyprus -- A spokesman for the European Union's executive arm says any threat against Cyprus is a threat against the bloc's 26 other member nations.\n\nPeter Stano made the remark Thursday in response to a question regarding Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah's threat that Cyprus could be implicated in a wider conflict if the island nation allows Israel to use its ports and airports to target Lebanon.\n\nStano said the EU fully supports Cyprus and that the trade bloc is in contact with \"a number of partners in the region,\" including Lebanon and Hezbollah, in order to de-escalate tension.\n\nCyprus has enjoyed increasingly tight relations with Israel in recent years, spawned by the discovery of undersea natural gas deposits in waters between the two neighbors. Cyprus has hosted joint Israeli-Cypriot military exercises, but has not ben involved in any military operations.\n\nCyprus government spokesman Konstantinos Letymbiotis repeated that any suggestion that Cyprus - either through its infrastructure or territory - would be involved in any military operation in Lebanon is \"totally groundless.\"\n\nLetymbiotis reiterated that the island nation \"is not part of the problem\" but \"part of the solution\" thanks to its regional diplomatic footprint.\n\nHezbollah says Israeli strikes kill 3 fighters in Lebanon\n\nThe Hezbollah militant group said at least three of its fighters were killed in Israeli strikes on Wednesday.\n\nLebanese state media reported multiple Israeli strikes along the border and in an area north of the coastal city of Tyre, about 30 kilometers (20 miles) from the frontier. The Israeli military said two Hezbollah launches damaged several vehicles in northern Israel.\n\nThe fighting came as Amos Hochstein, a senior adviser to U.S. President Joe Biden, returned to Israel after meeting with officials in Lebanon on Tuesday. There has been no word on whether he has made progress in his efforts to avoid a devastating regional war.\n\nKamel Mohanna, the head of the Amel Association, an NGO providing health services in Lebanon, said the group's primary health center in the town of Khiam was hit and damaged by Israeli shelling.\n\nHezbollah began attacking Israel almost immediately after the Israel-Hamas war erupted on Oct. 7. There have been near daily exchanges of fire, though most of the strikes are confined to an area within a few mostly confined to the area around the border.\n\nBut the fighting has escalated in recent weeks, raising fears that the clashes could boil over into a full-blown war. Israel's army announced late Tuesday that it has \"approved and validated\" plans for an offensive in Lebanon.\n\nIsraeli strikes already have killed more than 400 people in Lebanon, most of them Hezbollah fighters,", "source": {"uri": "tribtown.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Tribune"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@tribtown.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author",

But now the news gets even worse for Biden's folly as officials say that the pier -- originally designed to be in operation at least through September -- may be permanently shuttered as soon as next month.\n\nEven the administration cheerleaders over at the New York Times had to admit the thing's a disaster:\n\nThe $230 million temporary pier that the U.S. military built on short notice to rush humanitarian aid to Gaza has largely failed in its mission, aid organizations say, and will probably end operations weeks earlier than originally expected.\n\nIn the month since it was attached to the shoreline, the pier has been in service only about 10 days. The rest of the time, it was being repaired after rough seas broke it apart, detached to avoid further damage or paused because of security concerns.\n\nBut now the news gets worse: it's probably going to be shuttered for good by July:\n\nThe Biden administration initially predicted that it would be September before surging seas would make the pier inoperable. But military officials are now warning aid organizations that the project could be dismantled as early as next month\n\nWant some answers on what the current status is? Don't ask White House National Security Communications Advisor John Kirby because he has no clue:\n\nThe hastily built pier was designed to withstand level three sea state conditions -- but the Mediterranean routinely experiences level four. Oops.\n\n\"Supplies from the pier aren't flowing to Palestinians, and never really have,\" Stephen Semler, a national security expert at the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft, wrote in an essay last week. \"The reality is that the [pier] is not working, at least not for Palestinians.\"\n\nThis idea was hastily conceived, hastily designed, and now it's looking like it's hastily making its way into the \"Engineering Disasters\" guidebook.

(U.S. Central Command via AP, File)\n\nThe U.S. military-built pier in Gaza was unloading humanitarian aid again Thursday after being removed for a second time last week because of rough seas, a U.S. defense official said. The pier was reattached to Gaza's shoreline on Wednesday, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss U.S. military operations.\n\nThe pier, which cost the U.S. at least $230 million, was meant to deliver humanitarian aid into Gaza via the U.N.'s World Food Program.

The United Nations has suspended its cooperation with the pier project since June 9 and is conducting a security review.\n\nWith Israel's war against Hamas now in its ninth month, international criticism is growing over the U.S.-backed campaign of systematic destruction in Gaza, at a huge cost in civilian lives.\n\nIsraeli ground offensives and bombardments have killed more than 37,100 people, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians in its count. The war has largely cut off the flow of food, medicine and basic goods to Gaza, which is now totally dependent on aid groups.\n\nIsrael launched the war after Hamas' Oct. 7 attack, in which militants stormed into southern Israel, killed some 1,200 people -- mostly civilians -- and abducted about 250.\n\n-- A rare public rift appears between Israel's political and military leadership over how the war in Gaza is being conducted.\n\n-- The leader of Lebanon's Hezbollah militant group warns archenemy Israel against wider war.\n\n-- Hundreds died during this year's Hajj pilgrimage in Saudi Arabia amid intense heat, officials say.\n\nFollow AP's coverage of the war in Gaza at https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war\n\nHere's the latest: Israel doesn't want to let the Red Cross inspect detention centers accused of brutal treatment against Palestinians from Gaza\n\nJERUSALEM - Israel remains opposed to allowing the International Committee of the Red Cross access to detention facilities accused of harshly treating Palestinians from Gaza and is working on creating an internal inspection system, state lawyers said Wednesday.\n\nThe Red Cross had access to Israeli detention facilities holding Palestinians until Oct. 7, when Israel sealed them off from external observation. Since then, testimonies have mounted from released Palestinians of brutal treatment at the detention centers, where they are held incommunicado and without trial.\n\nThe government lawyers wrote that Israeli lawmakers are examining a proposal to form an internal body that would visit the detention facilities, hear prisoners' complaints and communicate the information to Israeli authorities.\n\nThe body is \"expected to fulfill the purpose that the Red Cross has fulfilled until now,\" the lawyers wrote. They were responding to a coalition of rights groups asking Israel's highest court to grant the Red Cross access to the detention facilities.\n\nIn response, the main rights group petitioning the court said internal Israeli examiners could not substitute for international observers.\n\n\"Mounting testimonies reveal Israel has turned its detention facilities into a black hole for Palestinian prisoners enduring appalling conditions,\" said the Association for Civil Rights in Israel, adding that the government was \"investing a far-fetched mechanism in order to replace the accepted arrangement by the world.\"\n\nSince the Hamas attack Oct. 7, Israel has taken at least 4,000 Palestinians from Gaza into custody in Israel, interrogating them for potential ties to the militant group. Over 1,500 have been released, according to state figures.\n\nHamas has rejected Red Cross appeals to visit some 120 hostages it is believed to be holding. Israel has already pronounced 43 of the hostages dead. US defense official confirms Gaza pier is bringing aid ashore\n\nWASHINGTON -- The U.S. military-built pier in Gaza was unloading humanitarian aid again Thursday after being removed for a second time last week because of rough seas, a U.S. defense official said. The pier was reattached to Gaza's shoreline on Wednesday, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss U.S. military operations.\n\nThe pier, which cost the U.S. at least $230 million, was meant to deliver humanitarian aid into Gaza via the U.N.'s World Food Program. It has faced a number of setbacks, operating for only about a week before getting blown apart by high winds in May. The U.S. military detached the floating causeway and moved it to an Israeli port last week so it wouldn't break apart again.\n\nAid groups have decried the pier as a distraction that took pressure off Israel to open more border crossings, which are far more productive at bringing aid into Gaza. Israel's war against Hamas has caused widespread devastation and made domestic food production nearly impossible, leaving Gaza totally dependent on aid groups for food, medicine and basic goods. Palestinians are facing widespread hunger.\n\nMeanwhile, the United Nations has suspended its cooperation with the U.S.-led pier project since June 9. U.N. officials say they want to evaluate whether the Israeli military used the area around the pier in a June 8 hostage rescue that left more than 270 Palestinians dead, and whether any such use -- or even a perception of it by fighters and ordinary people in Gaza -- makes their continued role in the project untenable.\n\nThe U.S. and Israeli militaries say no part of the pier was used in the raid.\n\n___\n\nAP writers Lolita C. Baldor and Ellen Knickmeyer contributed to this report. Pier for delivering vital aid to Gaza is functioning again, Cyprus says\n\nNICOSIA, Cyprus -- Cyprus' Foreign Ministry said Thursday the U.S. military-built pier in Gaza is up and running again after being detached for a second time last week because of rough seas.\n\nCyprus plays a key role in the pier because a security and inspection station it built screens the international aid destined for Gaza. There was no immediate confirmation from the U.S.\n\nTheodoris Gotsis, a spokesperson for the Foreign Ministry, said the pier and the causeway in Gaza were both functioning. He said over the past 40 days, Cyprus has screened and loaded onto boats some 10,000 tons of aid for Gaza.\n\nThe U.S. military detached the causeway last week to prevent it from breaking apart again, as it did late last month when it was hit by bad weather.\n\nThe pier, used to deliver humanitarian aid into Gaza, has faced a number of setbacks since it was erected. It was operational for only about a week when it was blown apart by high winds in May and then removed again earlier this month.\n\nThe U.N.'s World Food Program, one of the main aid agencies to make use of the pier, had paused its distribution of aid coming from it earlier this month over security concerns. WFP could not immediately be reached for comment on whether it was resuming distribution. EU warns against threats against Cyprus from Hezbollah\n\nNICOSIA, Cyprus -- A spokesman for the European Union's executive arm says any threat against Cyprus is a threat against the bloc's 26 other member nations.\n\nPeter Stano made the remark Thursday in response to a question regarding Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah's threat that Cyprus could be implicated in a wider conflict if the island nation allows Israel to use its ports and airports to target Lebanon.\n\nStano said the EU fully supports Cyprus and that the trade bloc is in contact with \"a number of partners in the region,\" including Lebanon and Hezbollah, in order to de-escalate tension.\n\nCyprus has enjoyed increasingly tight relations with Israel in recent years, spawned by the discovery of undersea natural gas deposits in waters between the two neighbors. Cyprus has hosted joint Israeli-Cypriot military exercises, but has not ben involved in any military operations.\n\nCyprus government spokesman Konstantinos Letymbiotis repeated that any suggestion that Cyprus - either through its infrastructure or territory - would be involved in any military operation in Lebanon is \"totally groundless.\"\n\nLetymbiotis reiterated that the island nation \"is not part of the problem\" but \"part of the solution\" thanks to its regional diplomatic footprint. Hezbollah says Israeli strikes kill 3 fighters in Lebanon\n\nThe Hezbollah militant group said at least three of its fighters were killed in Israeli strikes on Wednesday.\n\nLebanese state media reported multiple Israeli strikes along the border and in an area north of the coastal city of Tyre, about 30 kilometers (20 miles) from the frontier. The Israeli military said two Hezbollah launches damaged several vehicles in northern Israel.\n\nThe fighting came as Amos Hochstein, a senior adviser to U.S. President Joe Biden, returned to Israel after meeting with officials in Lebanon on Tuesday. There has been no word on whether he has made progress in his efforts to avoid a devastating regional war.\n\nKamel Mohanna, the head of the Amel Association, an NGO providing health services in Lebanon, said the group's primary health center in the town of Khiam was hit and damaged by Israeli shelling.\n\nHezbollah began attacking Israel almost immediately after the Israel-Hamas war erupted on Oct. 7. There have been near daily exchanges of fire, though most of the strikes are confined to an area within a few mostly confined to the area around the border.\n\nBut the fighting has escalated in recent weeks, raising fears that the clashes could boil over into a full-blown war. Israel's army announced late Tuesday that it has \"approved and validated\" plans for an offensive in Lebanon.\n\nIsraeli strikes already have killed more than 400 people in Lebanon, most of them Hezbollah fighters,", "source": {"uri": "hosted.ap.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Associated Press"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type":

The floating pier was re-anchored to Gaza's shoreline on Wednesday after facing a number of setbacks.\n\nAid groups have decried the plan to bring aid to Gaza by sea as a distraction that took pressure off Israel to open more land border crossings, which are far more productive at bringing aid into Gaza as Palestinians are facing widespread hunger.\n\nThe United Nations has suspended cooperation with the pier project since June 9, a day after the Israeli military used the area around the pier in a hostage rescue that killed more than 270 Palestinians. The U.S. and Israeli militaries say no part of the pier was used in the raid.\n\nMeanwhile, Israel's pledge to guard a new aid route into southern Gaza has fallen flat, as the U.N. and international aid organizations say a breakdown in law and order has made that route unusable. The situation has largely paralyzed aid distribution to the south -- particularly since Gaza's nearby Rafah crossing with Egypt was closed when Israel invaded the city early last month.\n\nWith Israel's war against Hamas now in its ninth month, international criticism is growing over the U.S.-backed campaign of systematic destruction in Gaza, at a huge cost in civilian lives.\n\nIsraeli ground offensives and bombardments have killed more than 37,100 people, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians in its count. The war has largely cut off the flow of food, medicine and basic goods to Gaza, which is now totally dependent on aid groups.\n\nIsrael launched the war after Hamas' Oct. 7 attack, in which militants stormed into southern Israel, killed some 1,200 people -- mostly civilians -- and abducted about 250.\n\n-- Israel's pledge to guard an aid route into Gaza falls flat as lawlessness blocks distribution.\n\n-- A rare public rift appears between Israel's political and military leadership over how the war in Gaza is being conducted.\n\n-- The leader of Lebanon's Hezbollah militant group warns archenemy Israel against wider war.\n\n-- Hundreds died during this year's Hajj pilgrimage in Saudi Arabia amid intense heat, officials say.\n\nFollow AP's coverage of the war in Gaza at https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war\n\nHere's the latest:\n\nWASHINGTON -- More than 656 metric tons, or 1.4 million pounds, of aid were delivered through the U.S. military-built pier in Gaza on Thursday in the hours after it resumed operations, Pentagon press secretary Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder said.\n\nThe pier was re-anchored to the beach in Gaza and started operating Wednesday after the military temporarily removed it due to weather, Ryder said. Aid groups have decried the pier as a distraction that took pressure off Israel to open more land border crossings, which are far more productive.\n\nSince the pier opened on May 17, more than 4,100 tons, or 9.1 million pounds, of food and aid have been delivered by sea and unloaded in Gaza. However, much of the aid has lingered in the storage area right by the pier, so although it was provided to Gaza, delivery trucks have not driven it into the people who need it most.\n\nRyder directed questions about aid distribution to the United Nation's World Food Program.\n\nThe U.N. has suspended cooperation with the U.S.-led pier project since June 9, a day after the Israeli military used the area around the pier in a hostage rescue that killed more than 270 Palestinians.\n\nThe U.S. and Israeli militaries say no part of the pier was used in the raid. The U.N. is concerned that any such use -- or even a perception of it by fighters and ordinary people in Gaza -- makes their continued role in the project untenable.\n\nAt issue are the safety of humanitarian workers, and humanitarian groups' principles of neutrality, the U.N. says.\n\nCAIRO -- Hamas says it is planning a legal response against the International Criminal Court chief prosecutor's request for arrest warrants against its top leaders.\n\nCalling the war crimes accusations against three of its top leaders -- Yahya Sinwar, Ismail Haniyeh, and Mohammed Deif -- \"baseless,\" Hamas said it would argue that Palestinians have \"the right, indeed the duty, to resist occupation by all means available, including armed resistance.\"\n\nHamas is already considered an international terrorist group by Israel and its Western allies, so it was unclear what the impact of its legal brief would be. Both Sinwar and Deif are believed to be hiding in Gaza. Haniyeh, the supreme leader of the Islamic militant group, is based in Qatar and frequently travels across the region. Qatar is not a member of the ICC.\n\nThe ICC's chief prosecutor, Karim Khan, said in May he was seeking the arrests of the three Hamas leaders, saying they bore responsibility for the attack on Israel Oct. 7, when the militants killed around 1,200 people and took some 250 hostage.\n\nKhan accused them of eight war crimes, among them rape, torture, taking hostages, and extermination. Khan said the same day he was seeking arrest warrants against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant.\n\nIn its statement Thursday, Hamas cast Khan as biased in Israel's favor. It said the prosecutor had \"erred in considering that the state of conflict began on October 7,\" asserting that the conflict began in 1948 with Israel's establishment.\n\nDuring the war surrounding Israel's independence, some 700,000 Palestinians fled or were forced their homes, an event the Palestinians refer as the \"Nakba,\" Arabic for catastrophe.\n\nA panel of three judges will decide whether to issue the arrest warrants and allow a case to proceed. The judges typically take two months to make such decisions.\n\nJERUSALEM -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has described White House statements regarding his claims that the U.S. is holding up weapons deliveries for Israel as \"personal attacks,\" but said he would endure these attacks provided Israel gets the munitions.\n\nEarlier Thursday, White House national security spokesman John Kirby said the U.S. is \"perplexed\" by Netanyahu's claims earlier this week that the U.S. was holding up the delivery of weapons and creating bottlenecks. Kirby said those claims were incorrect.\n\nNetanyahu, in a statement released by his office, said, \"I am ready to suffer personal attacks as long as Israel receives from the United States the ammunition that it needs in the war for its existence.\"\n\nNetanyahu has been facing growing domestic political problems, and analysts have said his comments Tuesday on weapons delivery delays were likely aimed to shore up support among his right-wing base in Israel and the country's supporters in the U.S., and didn't appear to indicate actual shortages of weapons.\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Tuesday the only pause in weapons deliveries was related to certain heavy bombs since May.\n\nU.S. President Joe Biden delayed sending the 2,000-pound bombs over concerns about Israel's killing of civilians in Gaza. Yet the administration has gone to lengths to avoid any suggestion that Israeli forces have crossed a red line in the deepening operation in the southern city of Rafah, which would trigger a more sweeping ban on arms transfers.\n\nUNITED NATIONS -- The United Nations says it is still assessing whether it's safe for staff to participate in delivering humanitarian aid from the U.S.-built pier on Gaza's coast, which means no aid is being transported from the beach to U.N. warehouses.\n\nThere is currently no timeline for completing the assessment, U.N. deputy spokesman Farhan Haq told reporters Thursday. If the U.N. Department of Safety and Security decides the U.N. can resume operations, \"then the World Food Program stands ready to do so based on its core principles.\"\n\nThese core principles -- U.N. neutrality and independence in humanitarian activities -- were called into question during Israel's June 8 hostage rescue, which killed more than 270 Palestinians. An Israeli helicopter touched down near the U.S.-built pier and helped whisk away the hostages and an injured Israeli commando, according to the U.S. and Israeli militaries. Both forces deny the pier was used, saying the helicopter landed an unspecified distance south of the causeway.\n\nThe U.N. also hasn't been able to deliver aid using a new route in southern Gaza the Israeli military said it would secure during \"tactical pauses,\" Haq said.\n\nFighting may have decreased on the route from the Kerem Shalom crossing to Gaza's main north-south Salah al-Din road, he said, but there are other impediments and \"the lack of public order and safety is a major obstacle and requires concerted efforts and concrete measures to find a solution.\"\n\n\"We've made clear that it's the responsibility of Israel, the occupying power, to ensure that assistance can reach those who need it the most and to create an enabling environment,\" Haq said.\n\nHe said the U.N. is is in discussions with Israeli authorities including COGAT, the Israeli military body that oversees aid distribution in Gaza, to provide assurances so people don't panic and think an aid delivery is a one-time event and rush to convoys trying to take food and other items.\n\n\"Many households report having only one meal every day, with some having one meal every two or three days, relying mostly on bread, food sharing with other families and rationing stocks,\" he said.\n\nAccess to water is \"critically low\" and people line up for hours to collect it and are forced to rely on seawater for domestic use, Haq said. Communicable illnesses are spreading, sewage is overflowing, there is a proliferation of insects and vermin, and a near total lack of hygiene items.\n\nFrom June 1-18 there were 61 coordinated U.N. humanitarian missions to northern Gaza, he said. Of those, 28 were facilitated by Israeli authorities, eight were denied access, 16 were impeded, and nine were canceled for logistical, operational or security reasons.\n\nIn southern Gaza, he said, the U.N. humanitarian office led assessments at sites for displaced Palestinians from June 7-14 and found people living in overcrowded tents in need of repair that don't offer any protection from extreme heat.\n\nWASHINGTON -- White House national security spokesman John Kirby said Thursday the U.S. remains \"perplexed\" by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's claims this week that the U.S. was holding up weapons for Israel and creating bottlenecks.\n\nKirby called the prime minister's comments \"disappointing, especially given that no other country is doing more to help Israel defend itself against the threat by Hamas and, quite frankly, other threats that they're facing in the region.\"\n\n\"It was vexing and disappointing to us, as much as it was incorrect. So, difficult to know exactly what was on his mind there,\" Kirby told reporters.\n\nNetanyahu's video message Tuesday comes as he faces growing domestic political problems. Analysts say it likely aimed to shore up support among his right-wing base in Israel as well as the country's supporters in the U.S., and doesn't appear to indicate on-the-ground shortages of weapons.\n\nThe Biden administration has provided crucial military and diplomatic support for Israel throughout the war against Hamas.\n\nPresident Joe Biden has delayed delivering certain heavy bombs since May over concerns about Israel's killing of civilians in Gaza. Yet the administration has gone to lengths to avoid any suggestion that Israeli forces have crossed a red line in the deepening operation in the southern city of Rafah, which would trigger a more sweeping ban on arms transfers.\n\nJERUSALEM - Israel remains opposed to allowing the International Committee of the Red Cross access to detention facilities accused of harshly treating Palestinians from Gaza and is working on creating an internal inspection system, state lawyers said Wednesday.\n\nThe Red Cross had access to Israeli detention facilities holding Palestinians until Oct. 7, when Israel sealed them off from external observation. Since then, testimonies have mounted from released Palestinians of brutal treatment at the detention centers, where they are held incommunicado and without trial.\n\nThe government lawyers wrote that Israeli lawmakers are examining a proposal to form an internal body that would visit the detention facilities, hear prisoners' complaints and communicate the information to Israeli authorities.\n\nThe body is \"expected to fulfill the purpose that the Red Cross has fulfilled until now,\" the lawyers wrote. They were responding to a coalition of rights groups asking Israel's highest court to grant the Red Cross access to the detention facilities.\n\nIn response, the main rights group petitioning the court said internal Israeli examiners could not substitute for international observers.\n\n\"Mounting testimonies reveal Israel has turned its detention facilities into a black hole for Palestinian prisoners enduring appalling conditions,\" said the Association for Civil Rights in Israel, adding that the government was \"investing a far-fetched mechanism in order to replace the accepted arrangement by the world.\"\n\nSince the Hamas attack Oct. 7, Israel has taken at least 4,000 Palestinians from Gaza into custody in Israel, interrogating them for potential ties to the militant group. Over 1,500 have been released, according to state figures.\n\nHamas has rejected Red Cross appeals to visit some 120 hostages it is believed to be holding. Israel has already pronounced 43 of the hostages dead.\n\nWASHINGTON -- The U.S. military-built pier in Gaza was unloading humanitarian aid again Thursday after being removed for a second time last week because of rough seas, a U.S. defense official said. The pier was reattached to Gaza's shoreline on Wednesday, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss U.S. military operations.\n\nThe pier, which cost the U.S. at least $230 million, was meant to deliver humanitarian aid into Gaza via the U.N.'s World Food Program. It has faced a number of setbacks, operating for only about a week before getting blown apart by high winds in May. The U.S. military detached the floating causeway and moved it to an Israeli port last week so it wouldn't break apart again.\n\nAid groups have decried the pier as a distraction that took pressure off Israel to open more border crossings, which are far more productive at bringing aid into Gaza. Israel's war against Hamas has caused widespread devastation and made domestic food production nearly impossible, leaving Gaza totally dependent on aid groups for food, medicine and basic goods. Palestinians are facing widespread hunger.\n\nMeanwhile, the United Nations has suspended its cooperation with the U.S.-led pier project since June 9. U.N. officials say they want to evaluate whether the Israeli military used the area around the pier in a June 8 hostage rescue that killed more than 270 Palestinians, and whether any such use -- or even a perception of it by fighters and ordinary people in Gaza -- makes their continued role in the project untenable.\n\nThe U.S. and Israeli militaries say no part of the pier was used in the raid.\n\n___\n\nAP writers Lolita C. Baldor and Ellen Knickmeyer contributed to this report.\n\nNICOSIA, Cyprus -- Cyprus' Foreign Ministry said Thursday the U.S. military-built pier in Gaza is up and running again after being detached for a second time last week because of rough seas.\n\nCyprus plays a key role in the pier because a security and inspection station it built screens the international aid destined for Gaza. There was no immediate confirmation from the U.S.\n\nTheodoris Gotsis, a spokesperson for the Foreign Ministry, said the pier and the causeway in Gaza were both functioning. He said over the past 40 days, Cyprus has screened and loaded onto boats some 10,000 tons of aid for Gaza.\n\nThe U.S. military detached the causeway last week to prevent it from breaking apart again, as it did late last month when it was hit by bad weather.\n\nThe pier, used to deliver humanitarian aid into Gaza, has faced a number of setbacks since it was erected. It was operational for only about a week when it was blown apart by high winds in May and then removed again earlier this month.\n\nThe U.N.'s World Food Program, one of the main aid agencies to make use of the pier, had paused its distribution of aid coming from it earlier this month over security concerns. WFP could not immediately be reached for comment on whether it was resuming distribution.\n\nNICOSIA, Cyprus -- A spokesman for the European Union's executive arm says any threat against Cyprus is a threat against the bloc's 26 other member nations.\n\nPeter Stano made the remark Thursday in response to a question regarding Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah's threat that Cyprus could be implicated in a wider conflict if the island nation allows Israel to use its ports and airports to target Lebanon.\n\nStano said the EU fully supports Cyprus and that the trade bloc is in contact with \"a number of partners in the region,\" including Lebanon and Hezbollah, in order to de-escalate tension.\n\nCyprus has enjoyed increasingly tight relations with Israel in recent years, spawned by the discovery of undersea natural gas deposits in waters between the two neighbors. Cyprus has hosted joint Israeli-Cypriot military exercises, but has not ben involved in any military operations.\n\nCyprus government spokesman Konstantinos Letymbiotis repeated that any suggestion that Cyprus - either through its infrastructure or territory - would be involved in any military operation in Lebanon is \"totally groundless.\"\n\nLetymbiotis reiterated that the island nation \"is not part of the problem\" but \"part of the solution\" thanks to its regional diplomatic footprint.\n\nThe Hezbollah militant group said at least three of its fighters were killed in Israeli strikes on Wednesday.\n\nLebanese state media reported multiple Israeli strikes along the border and in an area north of the coastal city of Tyre, about 30 kilometers (20 miles) from the frontier. The Israeli military said two Hezbollah launches damaged several vehicles in northern Israel.\n\nThe fighting came as Amos Hochstein, a senior adviser to U.S. President Joe Biden, returned to Israel after meeting with officials in Lebanon on Tuesday. There has been no word on whether he has made progress in his efforts to avoid a devastating regional war.\n\nKamel Mohanna, the head of the Amel Association, an NGO providing health services in Lebanon, said the group's primary health center in the town of Khiam was hit and damaged by Israeli shelling.\n\nHezbollah began attacking Israel almost immediately after the Israel-Hamas war erupted on Oct. 7. There have been near daily exchanges of fire, though most of the strikes are confined to an area within a few mostly confined to the area around the border.\n\nBut the fighting has escalated in recent weeks, raising fears that the clashes could boil over into a full-blown war. Israel's army announced late Tuesday that it has \"approved and validated\" plans for an offensive in Lebanon.\n\nIsraeli strikes already have killed more than 400 people in Lebanon, most of them Hezbollah fighters,", "source": {"uri": "hosted.ap.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Associated Press"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Gaza_War", "type":

Since then, testimonies have mounted from released Palestinians of brutal treatment at the detention centers, where they are held incommunicado and without trial.\n\nThe government lawyers wrote that Israeli lawmakers are examining a proposal to form an internal body that would visit the detention facilities, hear prisoners' complaints and communicate the information to Israeli authorities.\n\nThe body is \"expected to fulfill the purpose that the Red Cross has fulfilled until now,\" the lawyers wrote. They were responding to a coalition of rights groups asking Israel's highest court to grant the Red Cross access to the detention facilities.\n\nIn response, the main rights group petitioning the court said internal Israeli examiners could not substitute for international observers.\n\n\"Mounting testimonies reveal Israel has turned its detention facilities into a black hole for Palestinian prisoners enduring appalling conditions,\" said the Association for Civil Rights in Israel, adding that the government was \"investing a far-fetched mechanism in order to replace the accepted arrangement by the world.\"\n\nSince the Hamas attack Oct. 7, Israel has taken at least 4,000 Palestinians from Gaza into custody in Israel, interrogating them for potential ties to the militant group. Over 1,500 have been released, according to state figures.\n\nHamas has rejected Red Cross appeals to visit some 120 hostages it is believed to be holding. Israel has already pronounced 43 of the hostages dead.\n\nUS defense official confirms Gaza pier is bringing aid ashore\n\nWASHINGTON -- The U.S. military-built pier in Gaza was unloading humanitarian aid again Thursday after being removed for a second time last week because of rough seas, a U.S. defense official said. The pier was reattached to Gaza's shoreline on Wednesday, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss U.S. military operations.\n\nThe pier, which cost the U.S. at least $230 million, was meant to deliver humanitarian aid into Gaza via the U.N.'s World Food Program. It has faced a number of setbacks, operating for only about a week before getting blown apart by high winds in May. The U.S. military detached the floating causeway and moved it to an Israeli port last week so it wouldn't break apart again.\n\nAid groups have decried the pier as a distraction that took pressure off Israel to open more border crossings, which are far more productive at bringing aid into Gaza. Israel's war against Hamas has caused widespread devastation and made domestic food production nearly impossible, leaving Gaza totally dependent on aid groups for food, medicine and basic goods. Palestinians are facing widespread hunger.\n\nMeanwhile, the United Nations has suspended its cooperation with the U.S.-led pier project since June 9. U.N. officials say they want to evaluate whether the Israeli military used the area around the pier in a June 8 hostage rescue that left more than 270 Palestinians dead, and whether any such use -- or even a perception of it by fighters and ordinary people in Gaza -- makes their continued role in the project untenable.\n\nThe U.S. and Israeli militaries say no part of the pier was used in the raid.\n\nAP writers Lolita C. Baldor and Ellen Knickmeyer contributed to this report.\n\nPier for delivering vital aid to Gaza is functioning again, Cyprus says\n\nNICOSIA, Cyprus -- Cyprus' Foreign Ministry said Thursday the U.S. military-built pier in Gaza is up and running again after being detached for a second time last week because of rough seas.\n\nCyprus plays a key role in the pier because a security and inspection station it built screens the international aid destined for Gaza. There was no immediate confirmation from the U.S.\n\nTheodoris Gotsis, a spokesperson for the Foreign Ministry, said the pier and the causeway in Gaza were both functioning. He said over the past 40 days, Cyprus has screened and loaded onto boats some 10,000 tons of aid for Gaza.\n\nThe U.S. military detached the causeway last week to prevent it from breaking apart again, as it did late last month when it was hit by bad weather.\n\nThe pier, used to deliver humanitarian aid into Gaza, has faced a number of setbacks since it was erected. It was operational for only about a week when it was blown apart by high winds in May and then removed again earlier this month.\n\nThe U.N.'s World Food Program, one of the main aid agencies to make use of the pier, had paused its distribution of aid coming from it earlier this month over security concerns. WFP could not immediately be reached for comment on whether it was resuming distribution.\n\nEU warns against threats against Cyprus from Hezbollah\n\nNICOSIA, Cyprus -- A spokesman for the European Union's executive arm says any threat against Cyprus is a threat against the bloc's 26 other member nations.\n\nPeter Stano made the remark Thursday in response to a question regarding Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah's threat that Cyprus could be implicated in a wider conflict if the island nation allows Israel to use its ports and airports to target Lebanon.\n\nStano said the EU fully supports Cyprus and that the trade bloc is in contact with \"a number of partners in the region,\" including Lebanon and Hezbollah, in order to de-escalate tension.\n\nCyprus has enjoyed increasingly tight relations with Israel in recent years, spawned by the discovery of undersea natural gas deposits in waters between the two neighbors. Cyprus has hosted joint Israeli-Cypriot military exercises, but has not ben involved in any military operations.\n\nCyprus government spokesman Konstantinos Letymbiotis repeated that any suggestion that Cyprus - either through its infrastructure or territory - would be involved in any military operation in Lebanon is \"totally groundless.\"\n\nLetymbiotis reiterated that the island nation \"is not part of the problem\" but \"part of the solution\" thanks to its regional diplomatic footprint.\n\nHezbollah says Israeli strikes kill 3 fighters in Lebanon\n\nThe Hezbollah militant group said at least three of its fighters were killed in Israeli strikes on Wednesday.\n\nLebanese state media reported multiple Israeli strikes along the border and in an area north of the coastal city of Tyre, about 30 kilometers (20 miles) from the frontier. The Israeli military said two Hezbollah launches damaged several vehicles in northern Israel.\n\nThe fighting came as Amos Hochstein, a senior adviser to U.S. President Joe Biden, returned to Israel after meeting with officials in Lebanon on Tuesday. There has been no word on whether he has made progress in his efforts to avoid a devastating regional war.\n\nKamel Mohanna, the head of the Amel Association, an NGO providing health services in Lebanon, said the group's primary health center in the town of Khiam was hit and damaged by Israeli shelling.\n\nHezbollah began attacking Israel almost immediately after the Israel-Hamas war erupted on Oct. 7. There have been near daily exchanges of fire, though most of the strikes are confined to an area within a few mostly confined to the area around the border.\n\nBut the fighting has escalated in recent weeks, raising fears that the clashes could boil over into a full-blown war. Israel's army announced late Tuesday that it has \"approved and validated\" plans for an offensive in Lebanon.\n\nIsraeli strikes already have killed more than 400 people in Lebanon, most of them Hezbollah fighters,", "source": {"uri": "register-herald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Beckley Register-Herald"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@register-herald.com", "name": "Associated

The resumption of aid deliveries follows reports that the Pentagon could soon end the project, which a number of humanitarian organizations have criticized as woefully inadequate.\n\nAccording to unnamed US officials cited by Reuters and the Associated Press, the pier was expected to renew operations on Thursday, having been towed back to Gaza the day prior. The structure was moved to waters off Ashdod, Israel last week for the second time during high seas, which previously caused severe damage to the pier.\n\nKnown as the Joint Logistics Over-the-Shore (JLOTS), the floating pier and causeway were constructed by the US military last March and began facilitating aid shipments in May.\n\nWhile the effort reportedly cost the US taxpayer some $320 million - not including the price of repairs - it has been operational for only 10 days since it went online on May 17, according to the New York Times. In addition to stormy weather conditions, logistical and security complications have prompted several delays and pauses.\n\nThe Joe Biden administration had voiced high hopes for the pier, predicting it could eventually transfer 150 truckloads of aid into Gaza each day. Bogged down by near-constant problems, however, the structure has moved the equivalent of just seven trucks daily, aid groups told NYT.\n\nThe pier project has come under fire from numerous humanitarian organizations, which have instead pushed to deliver the aid by land, arguing the sea route is fraught with practical challenges amid Israel's months-long bombing campaign.\n\n\"We continue to stress the fact that there are much easier and cost-efficient means to deliver aid, which are the [border] crossings, which aren't operating at full capacity,\" Shaina Low, a spokesperson for the Norwegian Refugee Council, told the New Humanitarian. \"We know that there are hundreds of trucks just waiting outside of Gaza on the Egyptian side of the border, waiting to get in.\"\n\nThough the pier was originally set to be dismantled sometime in September, when yearly weather changes would make operations impossible, unnamed officials told the Times earlier this week that the structure could be removed as early as next month. While they did not specify a reason, the officials said the move could pressure Israel to reopen more land routes into Gaza, virtually all of which have been closed down due to the ongoing war.", "source": {"uri": "news.antiwar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News From Antiwar.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pier", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pier"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Armed_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Armed Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarian_aid", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Humanitarian aid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pentagon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Pentagon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashdod", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ashdod"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ashdod"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causeway", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Causeway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Logistics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norwegian_Refugee_Council", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Norwegian Refugee Council"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Immune_Disorders", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Immune Disorders", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Education_and_Training/Health_and_Safety", "label": "dmoz/Business/Education and Training/Health and Safety", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Public_Health_and_Safety/First_Aid", "label": "dmoz/Health/Public Health and Safety/First Aid", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Moving_and_Relocating", "label": "dmoz/Home/Moving and Relocating", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Moving_and_Relocating/Moving", "label": "dmoz/Home/Moving and Relocating/Moving", "wgt": 15}], "image": "https://news.antiwar.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/awc_logo_for-circle-profile_600sq-01.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9663051", "eventUri": "eng-9663051", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-17", "textStart": 1040, "textEnd": 1046}], "sentiment": -0.1607843137254902, "wgt": 186, "relevance": 1}

The pier was reattached to Gaza's shoreline on Wednesday, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss U.S. military operations.\n\nThe pier, which cost the U.S. at least $230 million, was meant to deliver humanitarian aid into Gaza via the U.N.'s World Food Program.

The United Nations has suspended its cooperation with the pier project since June 9 and is conducting a security review.\n\nWith Israel's war against Hamas now in its ninth month, international criticism is growing over the U.S.-backed campaign of systematic destruction in Gaza, at a huge cost in civilian lives.\n\nIsraeli ground offensives and bombardments have killed more than 37,100 people, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians in its count. The war has largely cut off the flow of food, medicine and basic goods to Gaza, which is now totally dependent on aid groups.\n\nIsrael launched the war after Hamas' Oct. 7 attack, in which militants stormed into southern Israel, killed some 1,200 people -- mostly civilians -- and abducted about 250.\n\nCurrently:\n\n-- The fate of the latest cease-fire proposal hinges on Netanyahu and Hamas' leader in Gaza.\n\n-- A rare public rift appears between Israel's political and military leadership over how the war in Gaza is being conducted.\n\n-- The leader of Lebanon's Hezbollah militant group warns archenemy Israel against wider war.\n\n-- Hundreds died during this year's Hajj pilgrimage in Saudi Arabia amid intense heat, officials say.\n\nFollow AP's coverage of the war in Gaza at https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war\n\nHere's the latest:\n\nIsrael doesn't want to let the Red Cross inspect detention centers accused of brutal treatment against Palestinians from Gaza\n\nJERUSALEM - Israel remains opposed to allowing the International Committee of the Red Cross access to detention facilities accused of harshly treating Palestinians from Gaza and is working on creating an internal inspection system, state lawyers said Wednesday.\n\nThe Red Cross had access to Israeli detention facilities holding Palestinians until Oct. 7, when Israel sealed them off from external observation. Since then, testimonies have mounted from released Palestinians of brutal treatment at the detention centers, where they are held incommunicado and without trial.\n\nThe government lawyers wrote that Israeli lawmakers are examining a proposal to form an internal body that would visit the detention facilities, hear prisoners' complaints and communicate the information to Israeli authorities.\n\nThe body is \"expected to fulfill the purpose that the Red Cross has fulfilled until now,\" the lawyers wrote. They were responding to a coalition of rights groups asking Israel's highest court to grant the Red Cross access to the detention facilities.\n\nIn response, the main rights group petitioning the court said internal Israeli examiners could not substitute for international observers.\n\n\"Mounting testimonies reveal Israel has turned its detention facilities into a black hole for Palestinian prisoners enduring appalling conditions,\" said the Association for Civil Rights in Israel, adding that the government was \"investing a far-fetched mechanism in order to replace the accepted arrangement by the world.\"\n\nSince the Hamas attack Oct. 7, Israel has taken at least 4,000 Palestinians from Gaza into custody in Israel, interrogating them for potential ties to the militant group. Over 1,500 have been released, according to state figures.\n\nHamas has rejected Red Cross appeals to visit some 120 hostages it is believed to be holding. Israel has already pronounced 43 of the hostages dead.\n\nUS defense official confirms Gaza pier is bringing aid ashore\n\nWASHINGTON -- The U.S. military-built pier in Gaza was unloading humanitarian aid again Thursday after being removed for a second time last week because of rough seas, a U.S. defense official said. The pier was reattached to Gaza's shoreline on Wednesday, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss U.S. military operations.\n\nThe pier, which cost the U.S. at least $230 million, was meant to deliver humanitarian aid into Gaza via the U.N.'s World Food Program. It has faced a number of setbacks, operating for only about a week before getting blown apart by high winds in May. The U.S. military detached the floating causeway and moved it to an Israeli port last week so it wouldn't break apart again.\n\nAid groups have decried the pier as a distraction that took pressure off Israel to open more border crossings, which are far more productive at bringing aid into Gaza. Israel's war against Hamas has caused widespread devastation and made domestic food production nearly impossible, leaving Gaza totally dependent on aid groups for food, medicine and basic goods. Palestinians are facing widespread hunger.\n\nMeanwhile, the United Nations has suspended its cooperation with the U.S.-led pier project since June 9. U.N. officials say they want to evaluate whether the Israeli military used the area around the pier in a June 8 hostage rescue that left more than 270 Palestinians dead, and whether any such use -- or even a perception of it by fighters and ordinary people in Gaza -- makes their continued role in the project untenable.\n\nThe U.S. and Israeli militaries say no part of the pier was used in the raid.\n\nAP writers Lolita C. Baldor and Ellen Knickmeyer contributed to this report.\n\nPier for delivering vital aid to Gaza is functioning again, Cyprus says\n\nNICOSIA, Cyprus -- Cyprus' Foreign Ministry said Thursday the U.S. military-built pier in Gaza is up and running again after being detached for a second time last week because of rough seas.\n\nCyprus plays a key role in the pier because a security and inspection station it built screens the international aid destined for Gaza. There was no immediate confirmation from the U.S.\n\nTheodoris Gotsis, a spokesperson for the Foreign Ministry, said the pier and the causeway in Gaza were both functioning. He said over the past 40 days, Cyprus has screened and loaded onto boats some 10,000 tons of aid for Gaza.\n\nThe U.S. military detached the causeway last week to prevent it from breaking apart again, as it did late last month when it was hit by bad weather.\n\nThe pier, used to deliver humanitarian aid into Gaza, has faced a number of setbacks since it was erected. It was operational for only about a week when it was blown apart by high winds in May and then removed again earlier this month.\n\nThe U.N.'s World Food Program, one of the main aid agencies to make use of the pier, had paused its distribution of aid coming from it earlier this month over security concerns. WFP could not immediately be reached for comment on whether it was resuming distribution.\n\nEU warns against threats against Cyprus from Hezbollah\n\nNICOSIA, Cyprus -- A spokesman for the European Union's executive arm says any threat against Cyprus is a threat against the bloc's 26 other member nations.\n\nPeter Stano made the remark Thursday in response to a question regarding Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah's threat that Cyprus could be implicated in a wider conflict if the island nation allows Israel to use its ports and airports to target Lebanon.\n\nStano said the EU fully supports Cyprus and that the trade bloc is in contact with \"a number of partners in the region,\" including Lebanon and Hezbollah, in order to de-escalate tension.\n\nCyprus has enjoyed increasingly tight relations with Israel in recent years, spawned by the discovery of undersea natural gas deposits in waters between the two neighbors. Cyprus has hosted joint Israeli-Cypriot military exercises, but has not ben involved in any military operations.\n\nCyprus government spokesman Konstantinos Letymbiotis repeated that any suggestion that Cyprus - either through its infrastructure or territory - would be involved in any military operation in Lebanon is \"totally groundless.\"\n\nLetymbiotis reiterated that the island nation \"is not part of the problem\" but \"part of the solution\" thanks to its regional diplomatic footprint.\n\nHezbollah says Israeli strikes kill 3 fighters in Lebanon\n\nThe Hezbollah militant group said at least three of its fighters were killed in Israeli strikes on Wednesday.\n\nLebanese state media reported multiple Israeli strikes along the border and in an area north of the coastal city of Tyre, about 30 kilometers (20 miles) from the frontier. The Israeli military said two Hezbollah launches damaged several vehicles in northern Israel.\n\nThe fighting came as Amos Hochstein, a senior adviser to U.S. President Joe Biden, returned to Israel after meeting with officials in Lebanon on Tuesday. There has been no word on whether he has made progress in his efforts to avoid a devastating regional war.\n\nKamel Mohanna, the head of the Amel Association, an NGO providing health services in Lebanon, said the group's primary health center in the town of Khiam was hit and damaged by Israeli shelling.\n\nHezbollah began attacking Israel almost immediately after the Israel-Hamas war erupted on Oct. 7. There have been near daily exchanges of fire, though most of the strikes are confined to an area within a few mostly confined to the area around the border.\n\nBut the fighting has escalated in recent weeks, raising fears that the clashes could boil over into a full-blown war. Israel's army announced late Tuesday that it has \"approved and validated\" plans for an offensive in Lebanon.\n\nIsraeli strikes already have killed more than 400 people in Lebanon, most of them Hezbollah fighters,\n\nCOPYRIGHT 2024 BY CHANNEL 3000.

Dismantled Early | AVA", "body": "Afghan Voice Agency (AVA) - Monitoring: The pier has undergone repairs twice in the last month due to damage, while there is uncertainty as to whether the United Nations will continue to use it for humanitarian aid distribution to Palestinians.\n\nThe aid effort suffered another setback as the US military announced on Friday its decision to temporarily relocate the pier in order to protect it from potential damage caused by rough seas.\n\nWashington is now considering temporary dismantling and relocation of its pier off the coast of Gaza for the second time, citing concerns about poor conditions.\n\nThe decision \"is not made lightly but is necessary to ensure the temporary pier can continue to deliver aid in the future,\" the US Central Command said in a post on social media, stating that the pier would be moved to Israel.\n\nOver the past month, the pier has only been operational for approximately 10 days, as it required frequent repairs due to being damaged by rough seas, detached for safety reasons, or temporarily halted due to security concerns.\n\nAccording to certain American military officials, the pier's limited objectives are expected to be unattainable, despite its initial purpose as a temporary solution while the Biden administration negotiates with Israel to facilitate the transportation of essential goods to Gaza through land routes, which is considered a more effective method of providing relief.\n\nThe construction of the pier coincided with health authorities' warnings of an impending famine in the region and difficulty to have access to the people in need.\n\nAid groups report that despite the initial arrival of aid on May 17, the project has faced ongoing challenges, with a significant number of Gazans still enduring severe hunger.\n\nAccording to Gaza officials, as many as 3,500 children are currently at risk of starving to death, as the territory is \"rapidly\" drifting towards famine.\n\n\"3,500 children are threatened by death due to malnutrition and lack of nutritional supplements and vaccines which became part of the prohibited items to enter Gaza,\" the Gaza-based Government Media Office said in a statement.\n\n\"The crime of banning entry of food and medicine\" exacerbated the suffering of the Palestinians in Gaza, it added, referring to Israeli restrictions./Press tv", "source": {"uri": "avapress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "\u062e\u0628\u0631\u06af\u0632\u0627\u0631\u06cc \u0635\u062f\u0627\u06cc

One day later, on May 17, the first trucks carrying humanitarian aid began rolling down the temporary pier.\n\nThe cost is now reported to be $230 million, its price drop attributed partly to British contributions.\n\nThere have been, and continue to be, serious problems, most of them related to unanticipated weather conditions.\n\nOn May 25, high winds and heavy seas caused four vessels that are used to stabilize the floating pier to break free from their anchors and become beached after losing power.\n\nThree days later, a portion of the Trident Pier that was anchored into the Gaza coastline was damaged also in heavy seas.\n\nThe pier was removed from its location on the Gaza coast and taken to the Israeli port of Ashdod where it was repaired and then returned to Gaza.\n\nA couple of weeks later, amid concerns that heavy seas would once again damage the pier, it was dismantled and moved back to the Israeli port of Ashod.\n\nOn June 7, the pier was reopened and humanitarian aid was once again being delivered to the people of Gaza.\n\nHowever, it was once again temporarily shut down June 9-10, due to high seas, and deliveries resumed on June 11.\n\nAnd just last Friday, the Pentagon said it would tow back the pier to Ashdod \"to prevent structural damage caused by the heightened sea state.\"\n\nThe pier has now, once again, been re-anchored.\n\nAlthough the pier has been fully in service for only about ten days since it was attached to the shoreline, over 3,500 metric tons (7.7 million pounds) of humanitarian aid have been delivered through the maritime corridor.\n\nIn addition to weather and sea conditions problems, JLOTS has been fraught with logistical problems, security concerns, looting of the cargo coming off the pier by desperate Palestinians. Some U.S. servicemembers have also suffered accidental injuries.\n\nAnd, from the very beginning, there has been political sniping by some in Congress.\n\nTwo weeks ago, citing some of the JLOTS setbacks, Senator Roger Wicker, the top Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee, said, \"This irresponsible and expensive experiment defies all logic except the obvious political explanation: to appease the President's far-left flank. This needs to end immediately.\"\n\nThe concerns and sniping have now grown into a full-blown attack on the project, bordering on gloating over the setbacks, especially by the right-wing media.\n\nCalling it \"Biden's $230M Gaza boondoggle...folly,\" RedState proudly crows that it predicted it would be \"an abject failure.\"\n\nHotAir, writes, \"Calling this a failure is being pretty generous at this point. It is an epic failure and embarrassment for the Biden administration and, unfortunately, for the United States.\"\n\nAnd now, \"[a] pair of bills advanced last week in the House [seeking] to end the mission that was billed as the Biden administration's flagship effort to aid Palestinian civilians on the brink of starvation after months of Israel's bombardment of the Gaza Strip in its war against Hamas.\"\n\nDuring the House Appropriations Committee's debate, Rep. Betty McCollum, D-Minn said:", "source": {"uri": "themoderatevoice.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Moderate Voice"}, "authors": [{"uri": "dorian_de_wind@themoderatevoice.com", "name": "Dorian

Gen. Pat Ryder said.\n\nThe pier was re-anchored to the beach in Gaza and started operating Wednesday after the military temporarily removed it due to weather, Ryder said. Aid groups have decried the pier as a distraction that took pressure off Israel to open more land border crossings, which are far more productive.\n\nSince the pier opened on May 17, more than 4,100 tons, or 9.1 million pounds, of food and aid have been delivered by sea and unloaded in Gaza. However, much of the aid has lingered in the storage area right by the pier, so although it was provided to Gaza, delivery trucks have not driven it into the people who need it most.\n\nRyder directed questions about aid distribution to the United Nation's World Food Program.\n\nThe U.N. has suspended cooperation with the U.S.-led pier project since June 9, a day after the Israeli military used the area around the pier in a hostage rescue that killed more than 270 Palestinians.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nThe U.S. and Israeli militaries say no part of the pier was used in the raid.

Both Sinwar and Deif are believed to be hiding in Gaza. Haniyeh, the supreme leader of the Islamic militant group, is based in Qatar and frequently travels across the region. Qatar is not a member of the ICC.\n\nThe ICC's chief prosecutor, Karim Khan, said in May he was seeking the arrests of the three Hamas leaders, saying they bore responsibility for the attack on Israel Oct. 7, when the militants killed around 1,200 people and took some 250 hostage.\n\nKhan accused them of eight war crimes, among them rape, torture, taking hostages, and extermination. Khan said the same day he was seeking arrest warrants against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant.\n\nIn its statement Thursday, Hamas cast Khan as biased in Israel's favor. It said the prosecutor had \"erred in considering that the state of conflict began on October 7,\" asserting that the conflict began in 1948 with Israel's establishment.\n\nDuring the war surrounding Israel's independence, some 700,000 Palestinians fled or were forced their homes, an event the Palestinians refer as the \"Nakba,\" Arabic for catastrophe.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nA panel of three judges will decide whether to issue the arrest warrants and allow a case to proceed.

Kirby said those claims were incorrect.\n\nNetanyahu, in a statement released by his office, said, \"I am ready to suffer personal attacks as long as Israel receives from the United States the ammunition that it needs in the war for its existence.\"\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nNetanyahu has been facing growing domestic political problems, and analysts have said his comments Tuesday on weapons delivery delays were likely aimed to shore up support among his right-wing base in Israel and the country's supporters in the U.S., and didn't appear to indicate actual shortages of weapons.\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Tuesday the only pause in weapons deliveries was related to certain heavy bombs since May.\n\nU.S. President Joe Biden delayed sending the 2,000-pound bombs over concerns about Israel's killing of civilians in Gaza. Yet the administration has gone to lengths to avoid any suggestion that Israeli forces have crossed a red line in the deepening operation in the southern city of Rafah, which would trigger a more sweeping ban on arms transfers.\n\nUN is still reviewing whether it can safely take part in aid operation at US-built pier\n\nUNITED NATIONS -- The United Nations says it is still assessing whether it's safe for staff to participate in delivering humanitarian aid from the U.S.-built pier on Gaza's coast, which means no aid is being transported from the beach to U.N. warehouses.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nThere is currently no timeline for completing the assessment, U.N. deputy spokesman Farhan Haq told reporters Thursday. If the U.N. Department of Safety and Security decides the U.N. can resume operations, \"then the World Food Program stands ready to do so based on its core principles.\"\n\nThese core principles -- U.N. neutrality and independence in humanitarian activities -- were called into question during Israel's June 8 hostage rescue, which killed more than 270 Palestinians. An Israeli helicopter touched down near the U.S.-built pier and helped whisk away the hostages and an injured Israeli commando, according to the U.S. and Israeli militaries. Both forces deny the pier was used, saying the helicopter landed an unspecified distance south of the causeway.\n\nThe U.N. also hasn't been able to deliver aid using a new route in southern Gaza the Israeli military said it would secure during \"tactical pauses,\" Haq said.\n\nFighting may have decreased on the route from the Kerem Shalom crossing to Gaza's main north-south Salah al-Din road, he said, but there are other impediments and \"the lack of public order and safety is a major obstacle and requires concerted efforts and concrete measures to find a solution.\"\n\n\"We've made clear that it's the responsibility of Israel, the occupying power, to ensure that assistance can reach those who need it the most and to create an enabling environment,\" Haq said.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nHe said the U.N. is is in discussions with Israeli authorities including COGAT, the Israeli military body that oversees aid distribution in Gaza, to provide assurances so people don't panic and think an aid delivery is a one-time event and rush to convoys trying to take food and other items.\n\n\"Many households report having only one meal every day, with some having one meal every two or three days, relying mostly on bread, food sharing with other families and rationing stocks,\" he said.\n\nAccess to water is \"critically low\" and people line up for hours to collect it and are forced to rely on seawater for domestic use, Haq said. Communicable illnesses are spreading, sewage is overflowing, there is a proliferation of insects and vermin, and a near total lack of hygiene items.\n\nFrom June 1-18 there were 61 coordinated U.N. humanitarian missions to northern Gaza, he said. Of those, 28 were facilitated by Israeli authorities, eight were denied access, 16 were impeded, and nine were canceled for logistical, operational or security reasons.\n\nIn southern Gaza, he said, the U.N. humanitarian office led assessments at sites for displaced Palestinians from June 7-14 and found people living in overcrowded tents in need of repair that don't offer any protection from extreme heat.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nBiden administration is still 'perplexed' by Israel's Netanyahu saying US is withholding weapons\n\nWASHINGTON -- White House national security spokesman John Kirby said Thursday the U.S. remains \"perplexed\" by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's claims this week that the U.S. was holding up weapons for Israel and creating bottlenecks.\n\nKirby called the prime minister's comments \"disappointing, especially given that no other country is doing more to help Israel defend itself against the threat by Hamas and, quite frankly, other threats that they're facing in the region.\"\n\n\"It was vexing and disappointing to us, as much as it was incorrect. So, difficult to know exactly what was on his mind there,\" Kirby told reporters.\n\nNetanyahu's video message Tuesday comes as he faces growing domestic political problems. Analysts say it likely aimed to shore up support among his right-wing base in Israel as well as the country's supporters in the U.S., and doesn't appear to indicate on-the-ground shortages of weapons.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nThe Biden administration has provided crucial military and diplomatic support for Israel throughout the war against Hamas.\n\nPresident Joe Biden has delayed delivering certain heavy bombs since May over concerns about Israel's killing of civilians in Gaza.

Since then, testimonies have mounted from released Palestinians of brutal treatment at the detention centers, where they are held incommunicado and without trial.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nThe government lawyers wrote that Israeli lawmakers are examining a proposal to form an internal body that would visit the detention facilities, hear prisoners' complaints and communicate the information to Israeli authorities.\n\nThe body is \"expected to fulfill the purpose that the Red Cross has fulfilled until now,\" the lawyers wrote. They were responding to a coalition of rights groups asking Israel's highest court to grant the Red Cross access to the detention facilities.\n\nIn response, the main rights group petitioning the court said internal Israeli examiners could not substitute for international observers.\n\n\"Mounting testimonies reveal Israel has turned its detention facilities into a black hole for Palestinian prisoners enduring appalling conditions,\" said the Association for Civil Rights in Israel, adding that the government was \"investing a far-fetched mechanism in order to replace the accepted arrangement by the world.\"\n\nSince the Hamas attack Oct. 7, Israel has taken at least 4,000 Palestinians from Gaza into custody in Israel, interrogating them for potential ties to the militant group. Over 1,500 have been released, according to state figures.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nHamas has rejected Red Cross appeals to visit some 120 hostages it is believed to be holding.

The pier was reattached to Gaza's shoreline on Wednesday, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss U.S. military operations.\n\nThe pier, which cost the U.S. at least $230 million, was meant to deliver humanitarian aid into Gaza via the U.N.'s World Food Program. It has faced a number of setbacks, operating for only about a week before getting blown apart by high winds in May. The U.S. military detached the floating causeway and moved it to an Israeli port last week so it wouldn't break apart again.\n\nAid groups have decried the pier as a distraction that took pressure off Israel to open more border crossings, which are far more productive at bringing aid into Gaza. Israel's war against Hamas has caused widespread devastation and made domestic food production nearly impossible, leaving Gaza totally dependent on aid groups for food, medicine and basic goods. Palestinians are facing widespread hunger.\n\nMeanwhile, the United Nations has suspended its cooperation with the U.S.-led pier project since June 9. U.N. officials say they want to evaluate whether the Israeli military used the area around the pier in a June 8 hostage rescue that killed more than 270 Palestinians, and whether any such use -- or even a perception of it by fighters and ordinary people in Gaza -- makes their continued role in the project untenable.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nThe U.S. and Israeli militaries say no part of the pier was used in the raid.\n\n___\n\nAP writers Lolita C.

There was no immediate confirmation from the U.S.\n\nTheodoris Gotsis, a spokesperson for the Foreign Ministry, said the pier and the causeway in Gaza were both functioning. He said over the past 40 days, Cyprus has screened and loaded onto boats some 10,000 tons of aid for Gaza.\n\nThe U.S. military detached the causeway last week to prevent it from breaking apart again, as it did late last month when it was hit by bad weather.\n\nThe pier, used to deliver humanitarian aid into Gaza, has faced a number of setbacks since it was erected. It was operational for only about a week when it was blown apart by high winds in May and then removed again earlier this month.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nThe U.N.'s World Food Program, one of the main aid agencies to make use of the pier, had paused its distribution of aid coming from it earlier this month over security concerns.

Cyprus has hosted joint Israeli-Cypriot military exercises, but has not ben involved in any military operations.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nCyprus government spokesman Konstantinos Letymbiotis repeated that any suggestion that Cyprus - either through its infrastructure or territory - would be involved in any military operation in Lebanon is \"totally groundless.\"\n\nLetymbiotis reiterated that the island nation \"is not part of the problem\" but \"part of the solution\" thanks to its regional diplomatic footprint.\n\nHezbollah says Israeli strikes kill 3 fighters in Lebanon\n\nThe Hezbollah militant group said at least three of its fighters were killed in Israeli strikes on Wednesday.\n\nLebanese state media reported multiple Israeli strikes along the border and in an area north of the coastal city of Tyre, about 30 kilometers (20 miles) from the frontier. The Israeli military said two Hezbollah launches damaged several vehicles in northern Israel.\n\nThe fighting came as Amos Hochstein, a senior adviser to U.S. President Joe Biden, returned to Israel after meeting with officials in Lebanon on Tuesday. There has been no word on whether he has made progress in his efforts to avoid a devastating regional war.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nKamel Mohanna, the head of the Amel Association, an NGO providing health services in Lebanon, said the group's primary health center in the town of Khiam was hit and damaged by Israeli shelling.\n\nHezbollah began attacking Israel almost immediately after the Israel-Hamas war erupted on Oct. 7. There have been near daily exchanges of fire, though most of the strikes are confined to an area within a few mostly confined to the area around the border.\n\nBut the fighting has escalated in recent weeks, raising fears that the clashes could boil over into a full-blown war. Israel's army announced late Tuesday that it has \"approved and validated\" plans for an offensive in Lebanon.\n\nIsraeli strikes already have killed more than 400 people in Lebanon, most of them

The United Nations has suspended its cooperation with the pier project since June 9 and is conducting a security review.\n\nWith Israel's war against Hamas now in its ninth month, international criticism is growing over the U.S.-backed campaign of systematic destruction in Gaza, at a huge cost in civilian lives.\n\nIsraeli ground offensives and bombardments have killed more than 37,100 people, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians in its count. The war has largely cut off the flow of food, medicine and basic goods to Gaza, which is now totally dependent on aid groups.\n\nIsrael launched the war after Hamas' Oct. 7 attack, in which militants stormed into southern Israel, killed some 1,200 people -- mostly civilians -- and abducted about 250.\n\nCurrently:\n\n-- The fate of the latest cease-fire proposal hinges on Netanyahu and Hamas' leader in Gaza.\n\n-- A rare public rift appears between Israel's political and military leadership over how the war in Gaza is being conducted.\n\n-- The leader of Lebanon's Hezbollah militant group warns archenemy Israel against wider war.\n\n-- Hundreds died during this year's Hajj pilgrimage in Saudi Arabia amid intense heat, officials say.\n\nFollow AP's coverage of the war in Gaza at https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war\n\nHere's the latest:\n\nJERUSALEM - Israel remains opposed to allowing the International Committee of the Red Cross access to detention facilities accused of harshly treating Palestinians from Gaza and is working on creating an internal inspection system, state lawyers said Wednesday.\n\nThe Red Cross had access to Israeli detention facilities holding Palestinians until Oct. 7, when Israel sealed them off from external observation. Since then, testimonies have mounted from released Palestinians of brutal treatment at the detention centers, where they are held incommunicado and without trial.\n\nThe government lawyers wrote that Israeli lawmakers are examining a proposal to form an internal body that would visit the detention facilities, hear prisoners' complaints and communicate the information to Israeli authorities.\n\nThe body is \"expected to fulfill the purpose that the Red Cross has fulfilled until now,\" the lawyers wrote. They were responding to a coalition of rights groups asking Israel's highest court to grant the Red Cross access to the detention facilities.\n\nIn response, the main rights group petitioning the court said internal Israeli examiners could not substitute for international observers.\n\n\"Mounting testimonies reveal Israel has turned its detention facilities into a black hole for Palestinian prisoners enduring appalling conditions,\" said the Association for Civil Rights in Israel, adding that the government was \"investing a far-fetched mechanism in order to replace the accepted arrangement by the world.\"\n\nSince the Hamas attack Oct. 7, Israel has taken at least 4,000 Palestinians from Gaza into custody in Israel, interrogating them for potential ties to the militant group. Over 1,500 have been released, according to state figures.\n\nHamas has rejected Red Cross appeals to visit some 120 hostages it is believed to be holding. Israel has already pronounced 43 of the hostages dead.\n\nWASHINGTON -- The U.S. military-built pier in Gaza was unloading humanitarian aid again Thursday after being removed for a second time last week because of rough seas, a U.S. defense official said. The pier was reattached to Gaza's shoreline on Wednesday, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss U.S. military operations.\n\nThe pier, which cost the U.S. at least $230 million, was meant to deliver humanitarian aid into Gaza via the U.N.'s World Food Program. It has faced a number of setbacks, operating for only about a week before getting blown apart by high winds in May. The U.S. military detached the floating causeway and moved it to an Israeli port last week so it wouldn't break apart again.\n\nAid groups have decried the pier as a distraction that took pressure off Israel to open more border crossings, which are far more productive at bringing aid into Gaza. Israel's war against Hamas has caused widespread devastation and made domestic food production nearly impossible, leaving Gaza totally dependent on aid groups for food, medicine and basic goods. Palestinians are facing widespread hunger.\n\nMeanwhile, the United Nations has suspended its cooperation with the U.S.-led pier project since June 9. U.N. officials say they want to evaluate whether the Israeli military used the area around the pier in a June 8 hostage rescue that left more than 270 Palestinians dead, and whether any such use -- or even a perception of it by fighters and ordinary people in Gaza -- makes their continued role in the project untenable.\n\nThe U.S. and Israeli militaries say no part of the pier was used in the raid.\n\nAP writers Lolita C. Baldor and Ellen Knickmeyer contributed to this report.\n\nNICOSIA, Cyprus -- Cyprus' Foreign Ministry said Thursday the U.S. military-built pier in Gaza is up and running again after being detached for a second time last week because of rough seas.\n\nCyprus plays a key role in the pier because a security and inspection station it built screens the international aid destined for Gaza. There was no immediate confirmation from the U.S.\n\nTheodoris Gotsis, a spokesperson for the Foreign Ministry, said the pier and the causeway in Gaza were both functioning. He said over the past 40 days, Cyprus has screened and loaded onto boats some 10,000 tons of aid for Gaza.\n\nThe U.S. military detached the causeway last week to prevent it from breaking apart again, as it did late last month when it was hit by bad weather.\n\nThe pier, used to deliver humanitarian aid into Gaza, has faced a number of setbacks since it was erected. It was operational for only about a week when it was blown apart by high winds in May and then removed again earlier this month.\n\nThe U.N.'s World Food Program, one of the main aid agencies to make use of the pier, had paused its distribution of aid coming from it earlier this month over security concerns. WFP could not immediately be reached for comment on whether it was resuming distribution.\n\nNICOSIA, Cyprus -- A spokesman for the European Union's executive arm says any threat against Cyprus is a threat against the bloc's 26 other member nations.\n\nPeter Stano made the remark Thursday in response to a question regarding Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah's threat that Cyprus could be implicated in a wider conflict if the island nation allows Israel to use its ports and airports to target Lebanon.\n\nStano said the EU fully supports Cyprus and that the trade bloc is in contact with \"a number of partners in the region,\" including Lebanon and Hezbollah, in order to de-escalate tension.\n\nCyprus has enjoyed increasingly tight relations with Israel in recent years, spawned by the discovery of undersea natural gas deposits in waters between the two neighbors. Cyprus has hosted joint Israeli-Cypriot military exercises, but has not ben involved in any military operations.\n\nCyprus government spokesman Konstantinos Letymbiotis repeated that any suggestion that Cyprus - either through its infrastructure or territory - would be involved in any military operation in Lebanon is \"totally groundless.\"\n\nLetymbiotis reiterated that the island nation \"is not part of the problem\" but \"part of the solution\" thanks to its regional diplomatic footprint.\n\nThe Hezbollah militant group said at least three of its fighters were killed in Israeli strikes on Wednesday.\n\nLebanese state media reported multiple Israeli strikes along the border and in an area north of the coastal city of Tyre, about 30 kilometers (20 miles) from the frontier. The Israeli military said two Hezbollah launches damaged several vehicles in northern Israel.\n\nThe fighting came as Amos Hochstein, a senior adviser to U.S. President Joe Biden, returned to Israel after meeting with officials in Lebanon on Tuesday. There has been no word on whether he has made progress in his efforts to avoid a devastating regional war.\n\nKamel Mohanna, the head of the Amel Association, an NGO providing health services in Lebanon, said the group's primary health center in the town of Khiam was hit and damaged by Israeli shelling.\n\nHezbollah began attacking Israel almost immediately after the Israel-Hamas war erupted on Oct. 7. There have been near daily exchanges of fire, though most of the strikes are confined to an area within a few mostly confined to the area around the border.\n\nBut the fighting has escalated in recent weeks, raising fears that the clashes could boil over into a full-blown war. Israel's army announced late Tuesday that it has \"approved and validated\" plans for an offensive in Lebanon.\n\nIsraeli strikes already have killed more than 400 people in Lebanon, most of them Hezbollah fighters,", "source": {"uri": "wral.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WRAL"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 5,

A persistent breakdown in law and order is rendering an aid route in south Gaza unusable, the UN and NGOs say, days after Israel's military said it would pause combat there to help aid reach desperate Palestinians.\n\nThe U.S.-built pier in Gaza was unloading humanitarian aid again Thursday after being removed for a second time last week because of rough seas, the U.S. military said. The floating pier was anchored back on Gaza's shoreline Wednesday after facing a number of setbacks.\n\nAid groups have sharply criticized the plan to bring aid by sea into Gaza, saying it's a distraction to take pressure off Israel to open more land border crossings that are far more productive. Palestinians face widespread hunger as the war has largely cut off the flow of food, medicine and basic goods to Gaza, which is now totally dependent on aid.\n\nThe United Nations has suspended cooperation with the pier project since June 9, a day after the Israeli military used the area around the pier in a hostage rescue that killed more than 270 Palestinians. The U.S. and Israeli militaries say no part of the pier was used in the raid.\n\nMeanwhile, Israel's pledge to guard a new aid route into southern Gaza has fallen flat, as the U.N. and international aid organizations say a breakdown in law and order has made that route unusable. The situation has largely paralyzed aid distribution to southern and central Gaza -- particularly since the Rafah crossing with Egypt was closed by Israel's invasion of the city early last month.\n\nIsrael's war against Hamas, now in its ninth month, faces growing international criticism over the U.S.-backed campaign of systematic destruction in Gaza, at a huge cost in civilian lives.\n\nIsraeli ground offensives and bombardments have killed more than 37,100 people, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians in its count.\n\nIsrael launched the war after Hamas' Oct. 7 attack, in which militants stormed into southern Israel, killed some 1,200 people -- mostly civilians -- and abducted about 250.\n\nCurrently:\n\n-- The fate of the latest cease-fire proposal hinges on Netanyahu and Hamas' leader in Gaza.\n\n-- Israel's pledge to guard an aid route into Gaza falls flat as lawlessness blocks distribution.\n\n-- A rare public rift appears between Israel's political and military leadership over how the war in Gaza is being conducted.\n\n-- The leader of Lebanon's Hezbollah militant group warns archenemy Israel against wider war.\n\n-- Hundreds died during this year's Hajj pilgrimage in Saudi Arabia amid intense heat, officials say.\n\nFollow AP's coverage of the war in Gaza at https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war\n\nHere's the latest:\n\nIsrael's pledge to guard an aid route into Gaza falls flat as lawlessness blocks distribution\n\nJERUSALEM -- A breakdown in law and order n southern Gaza has made a new route to deliver aid unusable, according to the United Nations and international humanitarian organizations, just days after Israel declared the safe corridor.\n\nWith thousands of truckloads of aid piled up, groups of armed men are regularly blocking convoys, holding drivers at gunpoint and rifling through their cargo, according to a U.N. official who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to brief the media on the issue.\n\nThe lawlessness is a major obstacle to aid distribution for southern and central Gaza. In those areas, an estimated 1.3 million Palestinians displaced from Rafah -- more than half of Gaza's entire population -- are now sheltering in tent camps and cramped apartments without adequate food, water, or medical supplies.\n\nIsrael announced Sunday it would observe daily pauses in combat along a route stretching from Kerem Shalom, the strip's only operational aid crossing in the south, to the nearby city of Khan Younis.\n\nThe head of the U.N.'s World Food Program said Thursday that the pause has made \"no difference at all\" in aid distribution efforts. \"We haven't been able to get in,\" said Cindy McCain in an interview with Al-Monitor. \"We've had to reroute some of our trucks. They've been looted. As you know, we've been shot at and we've been rocketed.\"\n\nThe Israeli military body in charge of coordinating humanitarian aid efforts, COGAT, did not respond to multiple requests for comment.\n\nThe U.N. official familiar with the aid effort said that there's been no sign of Israeli activity along the route. The U.N. tried to send a convoy of 60 trucks down the road Tuesday to pick up aid at Kerem Shalom. But 35 of the trucks were intercepted by armed men, the official said.\n\nIn recent days, the groups have moved closer to the crossing and set up roadblocks to halt trucks loaded with supplies, the U.N. official said. They have searched the pallets for smuggled cigarettes, a rare luxury in a territory where a single smoke can go for $25.\n\nThe U.N. official said that 25 trucks of flour used the route Tuesday. Some private commercial trucks also got through -- many of which used armed security to deter groups seeking to seize their cargo. An AP reporter stationed along the road Monday saw at least eight trucks pass by, armed security guards riding on top.\n\nAP writer Julia Frankel contributed.\n\nUS military says 1.4 million pounds of aid unloaded since Gaza pier reopened\n\nWASHINGTON -- More than 656 metric tons, or 1.4 million pounds, of aid were delivered through the U.S. military-built pier in Gaza on Thursday in the hours after it resumed operations, Pentagon press secretary Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder said.\n\nThe pier was re-anchored to the beach in Gaza and started operating Wednesday after the military temporarily removed it due to weather, Ryder said. Aid groups have decried the pier as a distraction that took pressure off Israel to open more land border crossings, which are far more productive.\n\nSince the pier opened on May 17, more than 4,100 tons, or 9.1 million pounds, of food and aid have been delivered by sea and unloaded in Gaza. However, much of the aid has lingered in the storage area right by the pier, so although it was provided to Gaza, delivery trucks have not driven it into the people who need it most.\n\nRyder directed questions about aid distribution to the United Nation's World Food Program.\n\nThe U.N. has suspended cooperation with the U.S.-led pier project since June 9, a day after the Israeli military used the area around the pier in a hostage rescue that killed more than 270 Palestinians.\n\nThe U.S. and Israeli militaries say no part of the pier was used in the raid. The U.N. is concerned that any such use -- or even a perception of it by fighters and ordinary people in Gaza -- makes their continued role in the project untenable.\n\nAt issue are the safety of humanitarian workers, and humanitarian groups' principles of neutrality, the U.N. says.\n\nHamas says it plans a legal response to ICC prosecutor's request for arrest warrants for its leaders\n\nCAIRO -- Hamas says it is planning a legal response against the International Criminal Court chief prosecutor's request for arrest warrants against its top leaders.\n\nCalling the war crimes accusations against three of its top leaders -- Yahya Sinwar, Ismail Haniyeh, and Mohammed Deif -- \"baseless,\" Hamas said it would argue that Palestinians have \"the right, indeed the duty, to resist occupation by all means available, including armed resistance.\"\n\nHamas is already considered an international terrorist group by Israel and its Western allies, so it was unclear what the impact of its legal brief would be. Both Sinwar and Deif are believed to be hiding in Gaza. Haniyeh, the supreme leader of the Islamic militant group, is based in Qatar and frequently travels across the region. Qatar is not a member of the ICC.\n\nThe ICC's chief prosecutor, Karim Khan, said in May he was seeking the arrests of the three Hamas leaders, saying they bore responsibility for the attack on Israel Oct. 7, when the militants killed around 1,200 people and took some 250 hostage.\n\nKhan accused them of eight war crimes, among them rape, torture, taking hostages, and extermination. Khan said the same day he was seeking arrest warrants against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant.\n\nIn its statement Thursday, Hamas cast Khan as biased in Israel's favor. It said the prosecutor had \"erred in considering that the state of conflict began on October 7,\" asserting that the conflict began in 1948 with Israel's establishment.\n\nDuring the war surrounding Israel's independence, some 700,000 Palestinians fled or were forced their homes, an event the Palestinians refer as the \"Nakba,\" Arabic for catastrophe.\n\nA panel of three judges will decide whether to issue the arrest warrants and allow a case to proceed. The judges typically take two months to make such decisions.\n\nIsrael's Netanyahu bemoans 'personal attacks' after White House responds to his claims about weapons delays\n\nJERUSALEM -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has described White House statements regarding his claims that the U.S. is holding up weapons deliveries for Israel as \"personal attacks,\" but said he would endure these attacks provided Israel gets the munitions.\n\nEarlier Thursday, White House national security spokesman John Kirby said the U.S. is \"perplexed\" by Netanyahu's claims earlier this week that the U.S. was holding up the delivery of weapons and creating bottlenecks. Kirby said those claims were incorrect.\n\nNetanyahu, in a statement released by his office, said, \"I am ready to suffer personal attacks as long as Israel receives from the United States the ammunition that it needs in the war for its existence.\"\n\nNetanyahu has been facing growing domestic political problems, and analysts have said his comments Tuesday on weapons delivery delays were likely aimed to shore up support among his right-wing base in Israel and the country's supporters in the U.S., and didn't appear to indicate actual shortages of weapons.\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Tuesday the only pause in weapons deliveries was related to certain heavy bombs since May.\n\nU.S. President Joe Biden delayed sending the 2,000-pound bombs over concerns about Israel's killing of civilians in Gaza. Yet the administration has gone to lengths to avoid any suggestion that Israeli forces have crossed a red line in the deepening operation in the southern city of Rafah, which would trigger a more sweeping ban on arms transfers.\n\nUN is still reviewing whether it can safely take part in aid operation at US-built pier\n\nUNITED NATIONS -- The United Nations says it is still assessing whether it's safe for staff to participate in delivering humanitarian aid from the U.S.-built pier on Gaza's coast, which means no aid is being transported from the beach to U.N. warehouses.\n\nThere is currently no timeline for completing the assessment, U.N. deputy spokesman Farhan Haq told reporters Thursday. If the U.N. Department of Safety and Security decides the U.N. can resume operations, \"then the World Food Program stands ready to do so based on its core principles.\"\n\nThese core principles -- U.N. neutrality and independence in humanitarian activities -- were called into question during Israel's June 8 hostage rescue, which killed more than 270 Palestinians. An Israeli helicopter touched down near the U.S.-built pier and helped whisk away the hostages and an injured Israeli commando, according to the U.S. and Israeli militaries. Both forces deny the pier was used, saying the helicopter landed an unspecified distance south of the causeway.\n\nThe U.N. also hasn't been able to deliver aid using a new route in southern Gaza the Israeli military said it would secure during \"tactical pauses,\" Haq said.\n\nFighting may have decreased on the route from the Kerem Shalom crossing to Gaza's main north-south Salah al-Din road, he said, but there are other impediments and \"the lack of public order and safety is a major obstacle and requires concerted efforts and concrete measures to find a solution.\"\n\n\"We've made clear that it's the responsibility of Israel, the occupying power, to ensure that assistance can reach those who need it the most and to create an enabling environment,\" Haq said.\n\nHe said the U.N. is is in discussions with Israeli authorities including COGAT, the Israeli military body that oversees aid distribution in Gaza, to provide assurances so people don't panic and think an aid delivery is a one-time event and rush to convoys trying to take food and other items.\n\n\"Many households report having only one meal every day, with some having one meal every two or three days, relying mostly on bread, food sharing with other families and rationing stocks,\" he said.\n\nAccess to water is \"critically low\" and people line up for hours to collect it and are forced to rely on seawater for domestic use, Haq said. Communicable illnesses are spreading, sewage is overflowing, there is a proliferation of insects and vermin, and a near total lack of hygiene items.\n\nFrom June 1-18 there were 61 coordinated U.N. humanitarian missions to northern Gaza, he said. Of those, 28 were facilitated by Israeli authorities, eight were denied access, 16 were impeded, and nine were canceled for logistical, operational or security reasons.\n\nIn southern Gaza, he said, the U.N. humanitarian office led assessments at sites for displaced Palestinians from June 7-14 and found people living in overcrowded tents in need of repair that don't offer any protection from extreme heat.\n\nBiden administration is still 'perplexed' by Israel's Netanyahu saying US is withholding weapons\n\nWASHINGTON -- White House national security spokesman John Kirby said Thursday the U.S. remains \"perplexed\" by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's claims this week that the U.S. was holding up weapons for Israel and creating bottlenecks.\n\nKirby called the prime minister's comments \"disappointing, especially given that no other country is doing more to help Israel defend itself against the threat by Hamas and, quite frankly, other threats that they're facing in the region.\"\n\n\"It was vexing and disappointing to us, as much as it was incorrect. So, difficult to know exactly what was on his mind there,\" Kirby told reporters.\n\nNetanyahu's video message Tuesday comes as he faces growing domestic political problems. Analysts say it likely aimed to shore up support among his right-wing base in Israel as well as the country's supporters in the U.S., and doesn't appear to indicate on-the-ground shortages of weapons.\n\nThe Biden administration has provided crucial military and diplomatic support for Israel throughout the war against Hamas.\n\nPresident Joe Biden has delayed delivering certain heavy bombs since May over concerns about Israel's killing of civilians in Gaza. Yet the administration has gone to lengths to avoid any suggestion that Israeli forces have crossed a red line in the deepening operation in the southern city of Rafah, which would trigger a more sweeping ban on arms transfers.\n\nIsrael doesn't want to let the Red Cross inspect detention centers accused of brutal treatment against Palestinians from Gaza\n\nJERUSALEM - Israel remains opposed to allowing the International Committee of the Red Cross access to detention facilities accused of harshly treating Palestinians from Gaza and is working on creating an internal inspection system, state lawyers said Wednesday.\n\nThe Red Cross had access to Israeli detention facilities holding Palestinians until Oct. 7, when Israel sealed them off from external observation. Since then, testimonies have mounted from released Palestinians of brutal treatment at the detention centers, where they are held incommunicado and without trial.\n\nThe government lawyers wrote that Israeli lawmakers are examining a proposal to form an internal body that would visit the detention facilities, hear prisoners' complaints and communicate the information to Israeli authorities.\n\nThe body is \"expected to fulfill the purpose that the Red Cross has fulfilled until now,\" the lawyers wrote. They were responding to a coalition of rights groups asking Israel's highest court to grant the Red Cross access to the detention facilities.\n\nIn response, the main rights group petitioning the court said internal Israeli examiners could not substitute for international observers.\n\n\"Mounting testimonies reveal Israel has turned its detention facilities into a black hole for Palestinian prisoners enduring appalling conditions,\" said the Association for Civil Rights in Israel, adding that the government was \"investing a far-fetched mechanism in order to replace the accepted arrangement by the world.\"\n\nSince the Hamas attack Oct. 7, Israel has taken at least 4,000 Palestinians from Gaza into custody in Israel, interrogating them for potential ties to the militant group. Over 1,500 have been released, according to state figures.\n\nHamas has rejected Red Cross appeals to visit some 120 hostages it is believed to be holding. Israel has already pronounced 43 of the hostages dead.\n\nUS defense official confirms Gaza pier is bringing aid ashore\n\nWASHINGTON -- The U.S. military-built pier in Gaza was unloading humanitarian aid again Thursday after being removed for a second time last week because of rough seas, a U.S. defense official said.

The pier was reattached to Gaza's shoreline on Wednesday, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss U.S. military operations.\n\nThe pier, which cost the U.S. at least $230 million, was meant to deliver humanitarian aid into Gaza via the U.N.'s World Food Program. It has faced a number of setbacks.\n\nAid groups have decried the pier as a distraction that took pressure off Israel to open more border crossings, which are far more productive at bringing aid into Gaza as Palestinians are facing widespread hunger. The United Nations has suspended its cooperation with the pier project since June 9 and is conducting a security review.\n\nWith Israel's war against Hamas now in its ninth month, international criticism is growing over the U.S.-backed campaign of systematic destruction in Gaza, at a huge cost in civilian lives.\n\nIsraeli ground offensives and bombardments have killed more than 37,100 people, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians in its count. The war has largely cut off the flow of food, medicine and basic goods to Gaza, which is now totally dependent on aid groups.\n\nIsrael launched the war after Hamas' Oct. 7 attack, in which militants stormed into southern Israel, killed some 1,200 people -- mostly civilians -- and abducted about 250.\n\n-- A rare public rift appears between Israel's political and military leadership over how the war in Gaza is being conducted.\n\n-- The leader of Lebanon's Hezbollah militant group warns archenemy Israel against wider war.\n\n-- Hundreds died during this year's Hajj pilgrimage in Saudi Arabia amid intense heat, officials say.\n\nFollow AP's coverage of the war in Gaza at https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war\n\nHere's the latest:\n\nWASHINGTON -- White House national security spokesman John Kirby said Thursday the U.S. remains \"perplexed\" by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's claims this week that the U.S. was holding up weapons for Israel and creating bottlenecks.\n\nKirby called the prime minister's comments \"disappointing, especially given that no other country is doing more to help Israel defend itself against the threat by Hamas and, quite frankly, other threats that they're facing in the region.\"\n\n\"It was vexing and disappointing to us, as much as it was incorrect. So, difficult to know exactly what was on his mind there,\" Kirby told reporters.\n\nNetanyahu's video message Tuesday comes as he faces growing domestic political problems. Analysts say it likely aimed to shore up support among his right-wing base in Israel as well as the country's supporters in the U.S., and doesn't appear to indicate on-the-ground shortages of weapons.\n\nThe Biden administration has provided crucial military and diplomatic support for Israel throughout the war against Hamas.\n\nPresident Joe Biden has delayed delivering certain heavy bombs since May over concerns about Israel's killing of civilians in Gaza. Yet the administration has gone to lengths to avoid any suggestion that Israeli forces have crossed a red line in the deepening operation in the southern city of Rafah, which would trigger a more sweeping ban on arms transfers.\n\nJERUSALEM - Israel remains opposed to allowing the International Committee of the Red Cross access to detention facilities accused of harshly treating Palestinians from Gaza and is working on creating an internal inspection system, state lawyers said Wednesday.\n\nThe Red Cross had access to Israeli detention facilities holding Palestinians until Oct. 7, when Israel sealed them off from external observation. Since then, testimonies have mounted from released Palestinians of brutal treatment at the detention centers, where they are held incommunicado and without trial.\n\nThe government lawyers wrote that Israeli lawmakers are examining a proposal to form an internal body that would visit the detention facilities, hear prisoners' complaints and communicate the information to Israeli authorities.\n\nThe body is \"expected to fulfill the purpose that the Red Cross has fulfilled until now,\" the lawyers wrote. They were responding to a coalition of rights groups asking Israel's highest court to grant the Red Cross access to the detention facilities.\n\nIn response, the main rights group petitioning the court said internal Israeli examiners could not substitute for international observers.\n\n\"Mounting testimonies reveal Israel has turned its detention facilities into a black hole for Palestinian prisoners enduring appalling conditions,\" said the Association for Civil Rights in Israel, adding that the government was \"investing a far-fetched mechanism in order to replace the accepted arrangement by the world.\"\n\nSince the Hamas attack Oct. 7, Israel has taken at least 4,000 Palestinians from Gaza into custody in Israel, interrogating them for potential ties to the militant group. Over 1,500 have been released, according to state figures.\n\nHamas has rejected Red Cross appeals to visit some 120 hostages it is believed to be holding. Israel has already pronounced 43 of the hostages dead.\n\nWASHINGTON -- The U.S. military-built pier in Gaza was unloading humanitarian aid again Thursday after being removed for a second time last week because of rough seas, a U.S. defense official said.

Now military officials are warning aid organizations that JLOTS could be dismantled as early as July, The New York Times reported.\n\nThe cost of transporting the pier from the U.S. and constructing it off the Gaza coast was initially estimated at $320 million. Officials later said the cost would be $230 million. Meanwhile, JLOTS has faced several challenges since it was anchored onto the Gaza shore May 16.\n\n\"The pier was political, not practical. It never made a lot of sense to do it this way,\" said Richard Goldberg, a senior adviser with the Foundation for Defense of Democracies think tank. \"We should be helping the people of Gaza by supporting Israel in defeating Hamas and pushing allies to send aid ... not with virtue signaling intended to amplify Hamas information and undermine Israel.\"\n\nThe floating pier has endured extended shutdowns and repair periods because of harsh sea conditions. Pentagon officials expect JLOTS to be operational again this week after it was towed to Ashdod, Israel, Friday to avoid damage from the high seas.\n\nU.N. officials said the toll on civilians living in the Palestinian enclave has been devastating since Israeli forces invaded Gaza following the Hamas raid into Israel on Oct. 7 that slaughtered at least 1,200 people and resulted in hundreds taken hostage. The battles between Israel and Hamas are making it nearly impossible for aid organizations to deliver supplies, said Carl Skau, deputy executive director of the U.N.'s World Food Program.\n\n\"It is getting harder to do our job. Staff spend five to eight hours waiting at checkpoints every day. Missiles hit our premises, despite being conflicted. The breakdown of law and order means we also face looting and violence amid a large security vacuum,\" Mr. Skau said.\n\nThe humanitarian situation in southern Gaza is deteriorating, and Mr. Shau said he fears it could soon see the same catastrophic levels of hunger that were recorded in the northern areas.\n\n\"A million people have been pushed out of Rafah and are trapped in a highly congested area along the beach in the burning southern heat,\" he said.\n\nThe Defense Department said the JLOTS pier allowed for 7.7 million pounds of aid to reach the Gaza shore. Air Force Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder, the Pentagon spokesman, on Tuesday said he didn't have any information about a date for JLOTS to cease operations.\n\n\"We've said all along, first of all, that the pier is a temporary measure,\" Gen. Ryder told reporters. \"We're going to capitalize on the conditions in terms of weather to get as much aid across that pier as we can.\"", "source": {"uri": "washingtontimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mike_glenn@washingtontimes.com", "name": "Mike Glenn", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pier", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pier"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarian_aid", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Humanitarian aid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_enclaves", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Palestinian enclaves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundation_for_Defense_of_Democracies", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Foundation for Defense of Democracies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_waters", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "International waters"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Israel Defense Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Defense", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Defense"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Think_tank", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Think tank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashdod", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ashdod"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ashdod"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_checkpoint", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Security checkpoint"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Looting", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Looting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Food_Programme", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World Food Programme"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Air_Force", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Air Force"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_sterling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pound sterling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pentagon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Pentagon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafah", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rafah"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rafah"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Immune_Disorders", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Immune Disorders", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Military_Science", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Military Science", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 67}], "image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2024/06/14/United_States_Gaza_Aid_95284_c0-111-2998-1858_s1770x1032.jpg?e38815f611d5b8947cd981e661ccb2b8f0acf317", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9663051", "eventUri": "eng-9663051", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-16", "textStart": 738, "textEnd": 744}, {"amb": false, "date": "-10-07", "textStart": 1559, "textEnd": 1565}], "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "wgt": 165, "relevance": 1}

Buy a Day Pass or just this story using our new Digital Wallet\n\nThe U.S. military-built pier in Gaza was unloading humanitarian aid again Thursday after being removed for a second time last week because of rough seas, a U.S. defense official said. The pier was reattached to Gaza's shoreline on Wednesday, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss U.S. military operations.\n\nThe pier, which cost the U.S. at least $230 million, was meant to deliver humanitarian aid into Gaza via the U.N.'s World Food Program. It has faced a number of setbacks.\n\nAid groups have decried the pier as a distraction that took pressure off Israel to open more border crossings, which are far more productive at bringing aid into Gaza as Palestinians are facing widespread hunger. The United Nations has suspended its cooperation with the pier project since June 9 and is conducting a security review.\n\nWith Israel's war against Hamas now in its ninth month, international criticism is growing over the U.S.-backed campaign of systematic destruction in Gaza, at a huge cost in civilian lives.\n\nIsraeli ground offensives and bombardments have killed more than 37,100 people, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians in its count. The war has largely cut off the flow of food, medicine and basic goods to Gaza, which is now totally dependent on aid groups.\n\nIsrael launched the war after Hamas' Oct. 7 attack, in which militants stormed into southern Israel, killed some 1,200 people -- mostly civilians -- and abducted about 250.\n\nCurrently:\n\n-- The fate of the latest cease-fire proposal hinges on Netanyahu and Hamas' leader in Gaza.\n\n-- A rare public rift appears between Israel's political and military leadership over how the war in Gaza is being conducted.\n\n-- The leader of Lebanon's Hezbollah militant group warns archenemy Israel against wider war.\n\n-- Hundreds died during this year's Hajj pilgrimage in Saudi Arabia amid intense heat, officials say.\n\nFollow AP's coverage of the war in Gaza at https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war\n\nHere's the latest:\n\nIsrael doesn't want to let the Red Cross inspect detention centers accused of brutal treatment against Palestinians from Gaza\n\nJERUSALEM - Israel remains opposed to allowing the International Committee of the Red Cross access to detention facilities accused of harshly treating Palestinians from Gaza and is working on creating an internal inspection system, state lawyers said Wednesday.\n\nThe Red Cross had access to Israeli detention facilities holding Palestinians until Oct. 7, when Israel sealed them off from external observation. Since then, testimonies have mounted from released Palestinians of brutal treatment at the detention centers, where they are held incommunicado and without trial.\n\nThe government lawyers wrote that Israeli lawmakers are examining a proposal to form an internal body that would visit the detention facilities, hear prisoners' complaints and communicate the information to Israeli authorities.\n\nThe body is \"expected to fulfill the purpose that the Red Cross has fulfilled until now,\" the lawyers wrote. They were responding to a coalition of rights groups asking Israel's highest court to grant the Red Cross access to the detention facilities.\n\nIn response, the main rights group petitioning the court said internal Israeli examiners could not substitute for international observers.\n\n\"Mounting testimonies reveal Israel has turned its detention facilities into a black hole for Palestinian prisoners enduring appalling conditions,\" said the Association for Civil Rights in Israel, adding that the government was \"investing a far-fetched mechanism in order to replace the accepted arrangement by the world.\"\n\nSince the Hamas attack Oct. 7, Israel has taken at least 4,000 Palestinians from Gaza into custody in Israel, interrogating them for potential ties to the militant group. Over 1,500 have been released, according to state figures.\n\nHamas has rejected Red Cross appeals to visit some 120 hostages it is believed to be holding. Israel has already pronounced 43 of the hostages dead.\n\nUS defense official confirms Gaza pier is bringing aid ashore\n\nWASHINGTON -- The U.S. military-built pier in Gaza was unloading humanitarian aid again Thursday after being removed for a second time last week because of rough seas, a U.S. defense official said. The pier was reattached to Gaza's shoreline on Wednesday, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss U.S. military operations.\n\nThe pier, which cost the U.S. at least $230 million, was meant to deliver humanitarian aid into Gaza via the U.N.'s World Food Program. It has faced a number of setbacks, operating for only about a week before getting blown apart by high winds in May. The U.S. military detached the floating causeway and moved it to an Israeli port last week so it wouldn't break apart again.\n\nAid groups have decried the pier as a distraction that took pressure off Israel to open more border crossings, which are far more productive at bringing aid into Gaza. Israel's war against Hamas has caused widespread devastation and made domestic food production nearly impossible, leaving Gaza totally dependent on aid groups for food, medicine and basic goods. Palestinians are facing widespread hunger.\n\nMeanwhile, the United Nations has suspended its cooperation with the U.S.-led pier project since June 9. U.N. officials say they want to evaluate whether the Israeli military used the area around the pier in a June 8 hostage rescue that left more than 270 Palestinians dead, and whether any such use -- or even a perception of it by fighters and ordinary people in Gaza -- makes their continued role in the project untenable.\n\nThe U.S. and Israeli militaries say no part of the pier was used in the raid.\n\nAP writers Lolita C. Baldor and Ellen Knickmeyer contributed to this report.\n\nPier for delivering vital aid to Gaza is functioning again, Cyprus says\n\nNICOSIA, Cyprus -- Cyprus' Foreign Ministry said Thursday the U.S. military-built pier in Gaza is up and running again after being detached for a second time last week because of rough seas.\n\nCyprus plays a key role in the pier because a security and inspection station it built screens the international aid destined for Gaza. There was no immediate confirmation from the U.S.\n\nTheodoris Gotsis, a spokesperson for the Foreign Ministry, said the pier and the causeway in Gaza were both functioning. He said over the past 40 days, Cyprus has screened and loaded onto boats some 10,000 tons of aid for Gaza.\n\nThe U.S. military detached the causeway last week to prevent it from breaking apart again, as it did late last month when it was hit by bad weather.\n\nThe pier, used to deliver humanitarian aid into Gaza, has faced a number of setbacks since it was erected. It was operational for only about a week when it was blown apart by high winds in May and then removed again earlier this month.\n\nThe U.N.'s World Food Program, one of the main aid agencies to make use of the pier, had paused its distribution of aid coming from it earlier this month over security concerns. WFP could not immediately be reached for comment on whether it was resuming distribution.\n\nEU warns against threats against Cyprus from Hezbollah\n\nNICOSIA, Cyprus -- A spokesman for the European Union's executive arm says any threat against Cyprus is a threat against the bloc's 26 other member nations.\n\nPeter Stano made the remark Thursday in response to a question regarding Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah's threat that Cyprus could be implicated in a wider conflict if the island nation allows Israel to use its ports and airports to target Lebanon.\n\nStano said the EU fully supports Cyprus and that the trade bloc is in contact with \"a number of partners in the region,\" including Lebanon and Hezbollah, in order to de-escalate tension.\n\nCyprus has enjoyed increasingly tight relations with Israel in recent years, spawned by the discovery of undersea natural gas deposits in waters between the two neighbors. Cyprus has hosted joint Israeli-Cypriot military exercises, but has not ben involved in any military operations.\n\nCyprus government spokesman Konstantinos Letymbiotis repeated that any suggestion that Cyprus - either through its infrastructure or territory - would be involved in any military operation in Lebanon is \"totally groundless.\"\n\nLetymbiotis reiterated that the island nation \"is not part of the problem\" but \"part of the solution\" thanks to its regional diplomatic footprint.\n\nHezbollah says Israeli strikes kill 3 fighters in Lebanon\n\nThe Hezbollah militant group said at least three of its fighters were killed in Israeli strikes on Wednesday.\n\nLebanese state media reported multiple Israeli strikes along the border and in an area north of the coastal city of Tyre, about 30 kilometers (20 miles) from the frontier. The Israeli military said two Hezbollah launches damaged several vehicles in northern Israel.\n\nThe fighting came as Amos Hochstein, a senior adviser to U.S. President Joe Biden, returned to Israel after meeting with officials in Lebanon on Tuesday. There has been no word on whether he has made progress in his efforts to avoid a devastating regional war.\n\nKamel Mohanna, the head of the Amel Association, an NGO providing health services in Lebanon, said the group's primary health center in the town of Khiam was hit and damaged by Israeli shelling.\n\nHezbollah began attacking Israel almost immediately after the Israel-Hamas war erupted on Oct. 7. There have been near daily exchanges of fire, though most of the strikes are confined to an area within a few mostly confined to the area around the border.\n\nBut the fighting has escalated in recent weeks, raising fears that the clashes could boil over into a full-blown war. Israel's army announced late Tuesday that it has \"approved and validated\" plans for an offensive in Lebanon.\n\nIsraeli strikes already have killed more than 400 people in Lebanon, most of them Hezbollah fighters,", "source": {"uri": "news-gazette.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The News-Gazette"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@news-gazette.com", "name": "Associated Press",

Damage by rough seas forced work to be suspended twice and it was towed into the Israeli port of Ashdod for repairs.\n\nMeanwhile, independent aid agencies have been reluctant to use the facility due to collaboration between the US and Israel over the pier.\n\nThe World Food Programme, which coordinates operations, has paused deliveries since June 4th after Israel helicoptered four hostages rescued from Hamas to the pier's onshore base. During the raid to free the hostages, Israel attacked Gaza's Nuseirat refugee camp, killing more than 270 Palestinians, the Gaza health authorities reported.\n\nUS officials argue the pier was only every supposed to act as a stopgap measure while the Biden administration pushed Israel to allow more food and other supplies into Gaza through land routes. Last week, the US House of Representatives advanced twin bills to defund the pier project.\n\nPalestinian refugee agency Unrwa has warned that Gaza's hospitals lack medicines to treat more than 50,000 children for acute malnutrition. Unwra's operations director for Gaza, Scott Anderson, cautioned that \"the law-and-order environment in Gaza is not enabling the efficient delivery of aid\".\n\nThe most effective way of getting aid into Gaza currently is by land, although only five of the official crossings from Israel into Gaza remain open and convoys continue to be threatened by fighting and pillaged by starving Palestinians. Incidents of looting soared after Israeli snipers fired at Gazan police accompanying lorries and they were left unguarded.\n\nThe Israeli army last weekend opened an aid route along Salaheddin road from the Kerem Shalom crossing to Khan Younis in Gaza from 8am to 7pm each day.\n\nIsrael said 62 commercial trucks used the corridor on Tuesday, while the head of UN humanitarian affairs in Gaza, Georgios Petropoulos, told CNN the road has been \"used by the UN to move goods for days\".\n\nHowever, UN children's fund spokesman James Elder said the Israeli army's initiative could not replace a ceasefire.", "source": {"uri": "irishtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Irish Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "michael_jansen@irishtimes.com", "name": "Michael Jansen", "type": "author",

It has a rod sticking out of the top. As the waves roll past, the object becomes momentarily submerged before reappearing.\n\nTom Gillin, the ocean rescue director for Flagler Beach, said lifeguards noticed it about two weeks ago swinging back and forth, but still attached to the pier. Then it broke off.\n\n\"It's heavy,\" he said. \"There's a big piece connected to the bottom of it and that's why it's staying in the position that it's in right now and it's not moving.\"\n\nHe said it might be a piling with fiberglass sheathing on the bottom, which might be the reason it is stuck.\n\nThe pier has been closed since Tropical Storm Ian tore off a chunk of the iconic wooden structure in September 2022.\n\nBut Ian was not the first to pummel the pier. Hurricane Irma damaged it in 2017. Hurricane Matthew bit off 160 feet in 2018. The damage from Matthew closed the pier for more than eight months and cost more than $900,000 to repair.\n\nIan also damaged the Daytona Beach Pier and the Sunglow Pier in Daytona Beach Shores. While the Daytona Beach Pier has since reopened, the Sunglow Pier and its restaurant, Crabby Joe's, remains closed.\n\nWhile work has not started yet, Flagler Beach is in the process of replacing the battered structure with a tougher pier supported by concrete structures.\n\nGillin said people should not be swimming or surfing within 150 feet of the pier. And the debris is within that area.\n\n\"People shouldn't be close to the pier anyway. So as long as it's there, it doesn't pose a danger to anybody\"\n\nHe said the plan is to haul it out of the water. But he is not optimistic that will work. He believes a larger, heavier section of the object is underwater.\n\n\"We will try to do is get a tow rope out there and see if we can try to pull it up on the beach and get it out of the way,\" Gillin said. \"My suspicion is that we are not going to be able to do that.

The war has largely cut off the flow of food, medicine and basic goods to Gaza, which is now totally dependent on aid groups.\n\nIsrael launched the war after Hamas' Oct. 7 attack, in which militants stormed into southern Israel, killed some 1,200 people -- mostly civilians -- and abducted about 250.\n\nCurrently:\n\n-- The fate of the latest cease-fire proposal hinges on Netanyahu and Hamas' leader in Gaza.\n\n-- A rare public rift appears between Israel's political and military leadership over how the war in Gaza is being conducted.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n-- The leader of Lebanon's Hezbollah militant group warns archenemy Israel against wider war.\n\n-- Hundreds died during this year's Hajj pilgrimage in Saudi Arabia amid intense heat, officials say.\n\nFollow AP's coverage of the war in Gaza at https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war\n\nHere's the latest:\n\nIsrael doesn't want to let the Red Cross inspect detention centers accused of brutal treatment against Palestinians from Gaza\n\nJERUSALEM - Israel remains opposed to allowing the International Committee of the Red Cross access to detention facilities accused of harshly treating Palestinians from Gaza and is working on creating an internal inspection system, state lawyers said Wednesday.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nThe Red Cross had access to Israeli detention facilities holding Palestinians until Oct. 7, when Israel sealed them off from external observation. Since then, testimonies have mounted from released Palestinians of brutal treatment at the detention centers, where they are held incommunicado and without trial.\n\nThe government lawyers wrote that Israeli lawmakers are examining a proposal to form an internal body that would visit the detention facilities, hear prisoners' complaints and communicate the information to Israeli authorities.\n\nThe body is \"expected to fulfill the purpose that the Red Cross has fulfilled until now,\" the lawyers wrote. They were responding to a coalition of rights groups asking Israel's highest court to grant the Red Cross access to the detention facilities.\n\nIn response, the main rights group petitioning the court said internal Israeli examiners could not substitute for international observers.\n\n\"Mounting testimonies reveal Israel has turned its detention facilities into a black hole for Palestinian prisoners enduring appalling conditions,\" said the Association for Civil Rights in Israel, adding that the government was \"investing a far-fetched mechanism in order to replace the accepted arrangement by the world.\"\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nSince the Hamas attack Oct. 7, Israel has taken at least 4,000 Palestinians from Gaza into custody in Israel, interrogating them for potential ties to the militant group.

Israel has already pronounced 43 of the hostages dead.\n\nUS defense official confirms Gaza pier is bringing aid ashore\n\nWASHINGTON -- The U.S. military-built pier in Gaza was unloading humanitarian aid again Thursday after being removed for a second time last week because of rough seas, a U.S. defense official said. The pier was reattached to Gaza's shoreline on Wednesday, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss U.S. military operations.\n\nThe pier, which cost the U.S. at least $230 million, was meant to deliver humanitarian aid into Gaza via the U.N.'s World Food Program. It has faced a number of setbacks, operating for only about a week before getting blown apart by high winds in May. The U.S. military detached the floating causeway and moved it to an Israeli port last week so it wouldn't break apart again.\n\nAid groups have decried the pier as a distraction that took pressure off Israel to open more border crossings, which are far more productive at bringing aid into Gaza. Israel's war against Hamas has caused widespread devastation and made domestic food production nearly impossible, leaving Gaza totally dependent on aid groups for food, medicine and basic goods. Palestinians are facing widespread hunger.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nMeanwhile, the United Nations has suspended its cooperation with the U.S.-led pier project since June 9. U.N. officials say they want to evaluate whether the Israeli military used the area around the pier in a June 8 hostage rescue that left more than 270 Palestinians dead, and whether any such use -- or even a perception of it by fighters and ordinary people in Gaza -- makes their continued role in the project untenable.\n\nThe U.S. and Israeli militaries say no part of the pier was used in the raid.\n\n___\n\nAP writers Lolita C. Baldor and Ellen Knickmeyer contributed to this report.\n\nPier for delivering vital aid to Gaza is functioning again, Cyprus says\n\nNICOSIA, Cyprus -- Cyprus' Foreign Ministry said Thursday the U.S. military-built pier in Gaza is up and running again after being detached for a second time last week because of rough seas.\n\nCyprus plays a key role in the pier because a security and inspection station it built screens the international aid destined for Gaza. There was no immediate confirmation from the U.S.\n\nTheodoris Gotsis, a spokesperson for the Foreign Ministry, said the pier and the causeway in Gaza were both functioning. He said over the past 40 days, Cyprus has screened and loaded onto boats some 10,000 tons of aid for Gaza.\n\nThe U.S. military detached the causeway last week to prevent it from breaking apart again, as it did late last month when it was hit by bad weather.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nThe pier, used to deliver humanitarian aid into Gaza, has faced a number of setbacks since it was erected. It was operational for only about a week when it was blown apart by high winds in May and then removed again earlier this month.\n\nThe U.N.'s World Food Program, one of the main aid agencies to make use of the pier, had paused its distribution of aid coming from it earlier this month over security concerns. WFP could not immediately be reached for comment on whether it was resuming distribution.\n\nEU warns against threats against Cyprus from Hezbollah\n\nNICOSIA, Cyprus -- A spokesman for the European Union's executive arm says any threat against Cyprus is a threat against the bloc's 26 other member nations.\n\nPeter Stano made the remark Thursday in response to a question regarding Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah's threat that Cyprus could be implicated in a wider conflict if the island nation allows Israel to use its ports and airports to target Lebanon.\n\nStano said the EU fully supports Cyprus and that the trade bloc is in contact with \"a number of partners in the region,\" including Lebanon and Hezbollah, in order to de-escalate tension.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nCyprus has enjoyed increasingly tight relations with Israel in recent years, spawned by the discovery of undersea natural gas deposits in waters between the two neighbors. Cyprus has hosted joint Israeli-Cypriot military exercises, but has not ben involved in any military operations.\n\nCyprus government spokesman Konstantinos Letymbiotis repeated that any suggestion that Cyprus - either through its infrastructure or territory - would be involved in any military operation in Lebanon is \"totally groundless.\"\n\nLetymbiotis reiterated that the island nation \"is not part of the problem\" but \"part of the solution\" thanks to its regional diplomatic footprint.\n\nHezbollah says Israeli strikes kill 3 fighters in Lebanon\n\nThe Hezbollah militant group said at least three of its fighters were killed in Israeli strikes on Wednesday.\n\nLebanese state media reported multiple Israeli strikes along the border and in an area north of the coastal city of Tyre, about 30 kilometers (20 miles) from the frontier. The Israeli military said two Hezbollah launches damaged several vehicles in northern Israel.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nThe fighting came as Amos Hochstein, a senior adviser to U.S. President Joe Biden, returned to Israel after meeting with officials in Lebanon on Tuesday. There has been no word on whether he has made progress in his efforts to avoid a devastating regional war.\n\nKamel Mohanna, the head of the Amel Association, an NGO providing health services in Lebanon, said the group's primary health center in the town of Khiam was hit and damaged by Israeli shelling.\n\nHezbollah began attacking Israel almost immediately after the Israel-Hamas war erupted on Oct. 7. There have been near daily exchanges of fire, though most of the strikes are confined to an area within a few mostly confined to the area around the border.\n\nBut the fighting has escalated in recent weeks, raising fears that the clashes could boil over into a full-blown war. Israel's army announced late Tuesday that it has \"approved and validated\" plans for an offensive in Lebanon.\n\nIsraeli strikes already have killed more than 400 people in Lebanon, most of them

The U.S. military detached the floating causeway and moved it to an Israeli port last week so it wouldn't break apart again.\n\nThe United Nations says it is still assessing whether it's safe for staff to participate in delivering humanitarian aid from the U.S.-built pier, which means no aid is being transported from the beach to U.N. warehouses.\n\nThere is currently no timeline for completing the assessment, U.N. deputy spokesman Farhan Haq told reporters Thursday. If the U.N. Department of Safety and Security decides the U.N. can resume operations, \"then the World Food Program stands ready to do so based on its core principles.\"\n\nThese core principles -- U.N. neutrality and independence in humanitarian activities -- were called into question during Israel's June 8 hostage rescue. An Israeli helicopter touched down near the U.S.-built pier and helped whisk away the hostages and an injured Israeli commando, according to the U.S. and Israeli militaries.\n\nBoth forces deny the pier was used, saying the helicopter landed an unspecified distance south of the causeway.\n\nThe U.N. also hasn't been able to deliver aid using a new route in southern Gaza the Israeli military said it would secure during \"tactical pauses,\" Haq said.\n\nFighting may have decreased on the route from the Kerem Shalom crossing to Gaza's main north-south Salah al-Din road, he said, but there are other impediments and \"the lack of public order and safety is a major obstacle and requires concerted efforts and concrete measures to find a solution.\"", "source": {"uri": "reviewjournal.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Las Vegas Review-Journal"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarian_aid", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Humanitarian aid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pier", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pier"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Armed_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Armed Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Food_Programme", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World Food Programme"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causeway", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Causeway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Port"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hostage", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hostage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutral_country", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Neutral country"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commando", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Commando"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Independence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saladin", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Saladin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Israel Defense Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concrete", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Concrete"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helicopter", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Helicopter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerem_Shalom", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kerem Shalom"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kerem Shalom"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Military", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Military", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Defense", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Defense", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Immune_Disorders", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Immune Disorders", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Military_Science", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Military Science", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Military", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Military", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 49}], "image": "https://www.reviewjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/19309340_web1_19309303-4559bbd1edb144019ed2991101e9c844.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9663051", "eventUri": "eng-9663051", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-08", "textStart": 1417, "textEnd": 1423}], "sentiment": 0.1607843137254903, "wgt": 154, "relevance": 1}

The war has largely cut off the flow of food, medicine and basic goods to Gaza, which is now totally dependent on aid groups.\n\nIsrael launched the war after Hamas' Oct. 7 attack, in which militants stormed into southern Israel, killed some 1,200 people -- mostly civilians -- and abducted about 250.\n\nCurrently:\n\n-- The fate of the latest cease-fire proposal hinges on Netanyahu and Hamas' leader in Gaza.\n\n-- A rare public rift appears between Israel's political and military leadership over how the war in Gaza is being conducted.\n\n-- The leader of Lebanon's Hezbollah militant group warns archenemy Israel against wider war.\n\n-- Hundreds died during this year's Hajj pilgrimage in Saudi Arabia amid intense heat, officials say.\n\nFollow AP's coverage of the war in Gaza at https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war\n\nHere's the latest:\n\nIsrael doesn't want to let the Red Cross inspect detention centers accused of brutal treatment against Palestinians from Gaza\n\nJERUSALEM - Israel remains opposed to allowing the International Committee of the Red Cross access to detention facilities accused of harshly treating Palestinians from Gaza and is working on creating an internal inspection system, state lawyers said Wednesday.\n\nThe Red Cross had access to Israeli detention facilities holding Palestinians until Oct. 7, when Israel sealed them off from external observation. Since then, testimonies have mounted from released Palestinians of brutal treatment at the detention centers, where they are held incommunicado and without trial.\n\nThe government lawyers wrote that Israeli lawmakers are examining a proposal to form an internal body that would visit the detention facilities, hear prisoners' complaints and communicate the information to Israeli authorities.\n\nThe body is \"expected to fulfill the purpose that the Red Cross has fulfilled until now,\" the lawyers wrote. They were responding to a coalition of rights groups asking Israel's highest court to grant the Red Cross access to the detention facilities.\n\nIn response, the main rights group petitioning the court said internal Israeli examiners could not substitute for international observers.\n\n\"Mounting testimonies reveal Israel has turned its detention facilities into a black hole for Palestinian prisoners enduring appalling conditions,\" said the Association for Civil Rights in Israel, adding that the government was \"investing a far-fetched mechanism in order to replace the accepted arrangement by the world.\"\n\nSince the Hamas attack Oct. 7, Israel has taken at least 4,000 Palestinians from Gaza into custody in Israel, interrogating them for potential ties to the militant group. Over 1,500 have been released, according to state figures.\n\nHamas has rejected Red Cross appeals to visit some 120 hostages it is believed to be holding. Israel has already pronounced 43 of the hostages dead.\n\nUS defense official confirms Gaza pier is bringing aid ashore\n\nWASHINGTON -- The U.S. military-built pier in Gaza was unloading humanitarian aid again Thursday after being removed for a second time last week because of rough seas, a U.S. defense official said. The pier was reattached to Gaza's shoreline on Wednesday, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss U.S. military operations.\n\nThe pier, which cost the U.S. at least $230 million, was meant to deliver humanitarian aid into Gaza via the U.N.'s World Food Program. It has faced a number of setbacks, operating for only about a week before getting blown apart by high winds in May. The U.S. military detached the floating causeway and moved it to an Israeli port last week so it wouldn't break apart again.\n\nAid groups have decried the pier as a distraction that took pressure off Israel to open more border crossings, which are far more productive at bringing aid into Gaza. Israel's war against Hamas has caused widespread devastation and made domestic food production nearly impossible, leaving Gaza totally dependent on aid groups for food, medicine and basic goods. Palestinians are facing widespread hunger.\n\nMeanwhile, the United Nations has suspended its cooperation with the U.S.-led pier project since June 9. U.N. officials say they want to evaluate whether the Israeli military used the area around the pier in a June 8 hostage rescue that left more than 270 Palestinians dead, and whether any such use -- or even a perception of it by fighters and ordinary people in Gaza -- makes their continued role in the project untenable.\n\nThe U.S. and Israeli militaries say no part of the pier was used in the raid.\n\nPier for delivering vital aid to Gaza is functioning again, Cyprus says\n\nNICOSIA, Cyprus -- Cyprus' Foreign Ministry said Thursday the U.S. military-built pier in Gaza is up and running again after being detached for a second time last week because of rough seas.\n\nCyprus plays a key role in the pier because a security and inspection station it built screens the international aid destined for Gaza. There was no immediate confirmation from the U.S.\n\nTheodoris Gotsis, a spokesperson for the Foreign Ministry, said the pier and the causeway in Gaza were both functioning. He said over the past 40 days, Cyprus has screened and loaded onto boats some 10,000 tons of aid for Gaza.\n\nThe U.S. military detached the causeway last week to prevent it from breaking apart again, as it did late last month when it was hit by bad weather.\n\nThe pier, used to deliver humanitarian aid into Gaza, has faced a number of setbacks since it was erected. It was operational for only about a week when it was blown apart by high winds in May and then removed again earlier this month.\n\nThe U.N.'s World Food Program, one of the main aid agencies to make use of the pier, had paused its distribution of aid coming from it earlier this month over security concerns. WFP could not immediately be reached for comment on whether it was resuming distribution.\n\nEU warns against threats against Cyprus from Hezbollah\n\nNICOSIA, Cyprus -- A spokesman for the European Union's executive arm says any threat against Cyprus is a threat against the bloc's 26 other member nations.\n\nPeter Stano made the remark Thursday in response to a question regarding Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah's threat that Cyprus could be implicated in a wider conflict if the island nation allows Israel to use its ports and airports to target Lebanon.\n\nStano said the EU fully supports Cyprus and that the trade bloc is in contact with \"a number of partners in the region,\" including Lebanon and Hezbollah, in order to de-escalate tension.\n\nCyprus has enjoyed increasingly tight relations with Israel in recent years, spawned by the discovery of undersea natural gas deposits in waters between the two neighbors. Cyprus has hosted joint Israeli-Cypriot military exercises, but has not ben involved in any military operations.\n\nCyprus government spokesman Konstantinos Letymbiotis repeated that any suggestion that Cyprus - either through its infrastructure or territory - would be involved in any military operation in Lebanon is \"totally groundless.\"\n\nLetymbiotis reiterated that the island nation \"is not part of the problem\" but \"part of the solution\" thanks to its regional diplomatic footprint.\n\nHezbollah says Israeli strikes kill 3 fighters in Lebanon\n\nThe Hezbollah militant group said at least three of its fighters were killed in Israeli strikes on Wednesday.\n\nLebanese state media reported multiple Israeli strikes along the border and in an area north of the coastal city of Tyre, about 30 kilometers (20 miles) from the frontier. The Israeli military said two Hezbollah launches damaged several vehicles in northern Israel.\n\nThe fighting came as Amos Hochstein, a senior adviser to U.S. President Joe Biden, returned to Israel after meeting with officials in Lebanon on Tuesday. There has been no word on whether he has made progress in his efforts to avoid a devastating regional war.\n\nKamel Mohanna, the head of the Amel Association, an NGO providing health services in Lebanon, said the group's primary health center in the town of Khiam was hit and damaged by Israeli shelling.\n\nHezbollah began attacking Israel almost immediately after the Israel-Hamas war erupted on Oct. 7. There have been near daily exchanges of fire, though most of the strikes are confined to an area within a few mostly confined to the area around the border.\n\nBut the fighting has escalated in recent weeks, raising fears that the clashes could boil over into a full-blown war. Israel's army announced late Tuesday that it has \"approved and validated\" plans for an offensive in Lebanon.\n\nIsraeli strikes already have killed more than 400 people in Lebanon, most of them

A persistent breakdown in law and order is rendering an aid route in south Gaza unusable, the UN and NGOs say, days after Israel's military said it would pause combat there to help aid reach desperate Palestinians.\n\nJERUSALEM (AP) -- The Israeli military said Sunday that it was establishing a new safe corridor to deliver aid into southern Gaza. But days later, this self-declared \"tactical pause\" has brought little relief to desperate Palestinians.\n\nThe United Nations and international aid organizations say a breakdown in law and order has made the aid route unusable.\n\nWith thousands of truckloads of aid piled up, groups of armed men are regularly blocking convoys, holding drivers at gunpoint and rifling through their cargo, according to a U.N. official who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to brief the media on the issue.\n\nHe said lawlessness has emerged as the main obstacle to aid distribution in southern Gaza -- where an estimated 1.3 million Palestinians displaced from Rafah, or more than half of Gaza's entire population, are now sheltering in tent camps and cramped apartments without adequate food, water, or medical supplies.\n\nHere is a closer look at the security challenges facing the U.N. and aid organizations.\n\nIsrael's 'tactical pause' stymied\n\nIsrael said Sunday it would observe daily pauses in combat along a route stretching from Kerem Shalom -- the strip's only operational aid crossing in the south -- to the nearby city of Khan Younis. Before the pause, aid organizations had reported that the need to coordinate trucks' movement with the Israelis in an active combat zone was slowing aid distribution.\n\nThe U.N. official familiar with the aid effort said that there has been no sign of Israeli activity along the route. The U.N. tried to send a convoy of 60 trucks down the road Tuesday to pick up aid at Kerem Shalom. But 35 of the trucks were intercepted by armed men, the official said.\n\nIn recent days, armed men have moved closer to the crossing and set up roadblocks to halt trucks loaded with supplies, the U.N. official said.

A million people have been pushed out of Rafah and are trapped in a highly congested area along the beach in the burning summer heat. We drove through rivers of sewage.\"\n\nMore than one million people have been forced out of the southern city of Rafah since the onset of the Israeli forces' ground operation there on May 7, the UN said.\n\nAn estimated 60,000 to 75,000 people remain in the Al Mawasi area of Rafah and 750 people in Rafah city as of May 17, it said.\n\nDisplaced Gazans are living in overcrowded makeshift shelters and tents that are in dire need of repair and do not offer any protection from extreme heat, it added.\n\nAt least 37,396 people have been killed and 85,523 injured in Gaza during more than eight months of war between Israel and Palestinian militants, the Health Ministry in the territory said in its latest update on Wednesday.\n\nOn Wednesday, Reuters quoted medical sources as saying that nine Palestinians were killed in an Israeli strike that hit a group of citizens and merchants in the southern Gaza Strip as they waited for convoys of aid lorries carrying goods through the Kerem Shalom crossing.\n\nMeanwhile, a floating pier on Gaza's coast is expected to resume operations on Thursday to unload much-needed humanitarian aid for Palestinians, two US officials told Reuters.\n\nThe officials said the pier had been reattached to the shore on Wednesday after being removed last Friday due to poor sea conditions.\n\nAid began arriving via the US-built pier on May 17, and the UN said it transported 137 lorry-loads to warehouses, amounting to about 900 tonnes.\n\nThe operation of the pier has been disrupted by rough seas that caused damage, as well as poor weather and security considerations.\n\nUS President Joe Biden announced the plan to build the pier in March as fears grew of famine in Gaza, a Hamas-run enclave of 2.3 million people, during the war between Israel and the Palestinian militants.\n\nThe US military estimates that operation of the pier will cost more than $200 million for the first 90 days and involve about 1,000 service members.", "source": {"uri":

But days later, this self-declared \"tactical pause\" has brought little relief to desperate Palestinians.\n\nThe United Nations and international aid organizations say a breakdown in law and order has made the aid route unusable.\n\nWith thousands of truckloads of aid piled up, groups of armed men are regularly blocking convoys, holding drivers at gunpoint and rifling through their cargo, according to a U.N. official who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to brief the media on the issue.\n\nHe said lawlessness has emerged as the main obstacle to aid distribution in southern Gaza -- where an estimated 1.3 million Palestinians displaced from Rafah, or more than half of Gaza's entire population, are now sheltering in tent camps and cramped apartments without adequate food, water, or medical supplies.\n\nHere is a closer look at the security challenges facing the U.N. and aid organizations.\n\nIsrael's 'tactical pause' stymied\n\nIsrael said Sunday it would observe daily pauses in combat along a route stretching from Kerem Shalom -- the strip's only operational aid crossing in the south -- to the nearby city of Khan Younis. Before the pause, aid organizations had reported that the need to coordinate trucks' movement with the Israelis in an active combat zone was slowing aid distribution.\n\nThe U.N. official familiar with the aid effort said that there has been no sign of Israeli activity along the route. The U.N. tried to send a convoy of 60 trucks down the road Tuesday to pick up aid at Kerem Shalom. But 35 of the trucks were intercepted by armed men, the official said.\n\nIn recent days, armed men have moved closer to the crossing and set up roadblocks to halt trucks loaded with supplies, the U.N. official said. They have rifled through the pallets in search of smuggled cigarettes, a rare luxury in a territory where a single smoke can go for $25.\n\nThe surge in lawlessness is a result of growing desperation in Gaza and the power vacuum that left by Hamas's waning power over the territory, said Mkhaimar Abusada, an associate professor of political science at Al-Azhar University in Gaza who is now in Cairo.\n\nWith the territory's police force targeted by Israel, he said, crime has reemerged as an untreated issue in Gaza.\n\n\"After Hamas came to power, one of the things that they brought under their control was the lawlessness of the so-called big clans,\" said Abusada. \"Now, that's left for the Palestinians on their own to deal with it. So once again, we are seeing shootings between families, there are thefts, all the bad things are happening.\"\n\nUNRWA, the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees, used to deploy local Palestinian police to escort aid convoys, but many refused to continue serving after airstrikes killed at least eight police officers in Rafah, the agency said.\n\nIsrael says the police are legitimate targets because they are controlled by Hamas.\n\nIs any aid still getting into Gaza?\n\nThe situation has largely paralyzed aid distribution to the south -- particularly since Gaza's nearby Rafah crossing with Egypt was closed when Israel invaded the city early last month.\n\nThe U.N. official said that 25 trucks of flour used the route Tuesday. Some private commercial trucks also got through -- many of which used armed security to deter groups seeking to seize their cargo. An AP reporter stationed along the road Monday saw at least eight trucks pass by, armed security guards riding on top.\n\nBefore Israel's offensive into the city of Rafah, hundreds of fuel trucks routinely entered the area.\n\nThe U.N. has now begun rerouting some fuel trucks through northern Gaza. Farhan Haq, a U.N. spokesman, said five fuel trucks entered Gaza Wednesday. The U.N. humanitarian office reported that these were the first fuel deliveries since early June and supplies remain scarce.\n\nAid groups say only a ceasefire and a reopening of the Rafah crossing could significantly increase aid flow to the area.\n\nThe military body in charge of coordinating humanitarian aid efforts, COGAT, did not respond to multiple requests for comment.\n\nSecurity concerns also afflict aid from U.S. pier project\n\nThe U.S. installed a pier off Gaza's coast last month, aiming to provide an additional route for aid to enter Gaza.

But days later, this self-declared \"tactical pause\" has brought little relief to desperate Palestinians.\n\nThe United Nations and international aid organizations say a breakdown in law and order has made the aid route unusable.\n\nWith thousands of truckloads of aid piled up, groups of armed men are regularly blocking convoys, holding drivers at gunpoint and rifling through their cargo, according to a U.N. official who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to brief the media on the issue.\n\nHe said lawlessness has emerged as the main obstacle to aid distribution in southern Gaza -- where an estimated 1.3 million Palestinians displaced from Rafah, or more than half of Gaza's entire population, are now sheltering in tent camps and cramped apartments without adequate food, water, or medical supplies.\n\nHere is a closer look at the security challenges facing the U.N. and aid organizations.\n\nIsrael said Sunday it would observe daily pauses in combat along a route stretching from Kerem Shalom -- the strip's only operational aid crossing in the south -- to the nearby city of Khan Younis. Before the pause, aid organizations had reported that the need to coordinate trucks' movement with the Israelis in an active combat zone was slowing aid distribution.\n\nThe U.N. official familiar with the aid effort said that there has been no sign of Israeli activity along the route. The U.N. tried to send a convoy of 60 trucks down the road Tuesday to pick up aid at Kerem Shalom. But 35 of the trucks were intercepted by armed men, the official said.\n\nIn recent days, armed men have moved closer to the crossing and set up roadblocks to halt trucks loaded with supplies, the U.N. official said. They have rifled through the pallets in search of smuggled cigarettes, a rare luxury in a territory where a single smoke can go for $25.\n\nThe surge in lawlessness is a result of growing desperation in Gaza and the power vacuum that left by Hamas' waning power over the territory, said Mkhaimar Abusada, an associate professor of political science at Al-Azhar University in Gaza who is now in Cairo.\n\nWith the territory's police force targeted by Israel, he said, crime has reemerged as an untreated issue in Gaza.\n\n\"After Hamas came to power, one of the things that they brought under their control was the lawlessness of the so-called big clans,\" said Abusada. \"Now, that's left for the Palestinians on their own to deal with it. So once again, we are seeing shootings between families, there are thefts, all the bad things are happening.\"\n\nUNRWA, the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees, used to deploy local Palestinian police to escort aid convoys, but many refused to continue serving after airstrikes killed at least eight police officers in Rafah, the agency said.\n\nIsrael says the police are legitimate targets because they are controlled by Hamas.\n\nThe situation has largely paralyzed aid distribution to the south -- particularly since Gaza's nearby Rafah crossing with Egypt was closed when Israel invaded the city early last month.\n\nThe U.N. official said that 25 trucks of flour used the route Tuesday. Some private commercial trucks also got through -- many of which used armed security to deter groups seeking to seize their cargo. An AP reporter stationed along the road Monday saw at least eight trucks pass by, armed security guards riding on top.\n\nBefore Israel's offensive into the city of Rafah, hundreds of fuel trucks routinely entered the area.\n\nThe U.N. has now begun rerouting some fuel trucks through northern Gaza. Farhan Haq, a U.N. spokesman, said five fuel trucks entered Gaza Wednesday. The U.N. humanitarian office reported that these were the first fuel deliveries since early June and supplies remain scarce.\n\nAid groups say only a cease-fire and a reopening of the Rafah crossing could significantly increase aid flow to the area.\n\nThe military body in charge of coordinating humanitarian aid efforts, COGAT, did not respond to multiple requests for comment.\n\nThe U.S. installed a pier off Gaza's coast last month, aiming to provide an additional route for aid to enter Gaza. But the ambitious project has suffered repeated logistical and security setbacks.\n\nCyprus, a partner in the effort, said the pier was up and running again Thursday after being detached for a second time last week because of rough seas. COGAT said Thursday there were \"hundreds of aid pallets awaiting collection and distribution by the U.N. aid agencies.\"\n\nBut there, too, security concerns are hindering distribution of aid.\n\nThe U.N. suspended its cooperation with the pier on June 9 -- a day after rumors swirled that the Israeli military had used the area in a hostage rescue operation that left over 270 Palestinians dead. Photos of the operation have shown an Israeli helicopter in the vicinity of the pier.\n\nBoth Israel and the U.S. deny the pier was used in the operation. But the perception that the pier was used for military purposes could endanger humanitarian workers and threaten humanitarian groups' principles of neutrality, the U.N. says.\n\nAid workers said they are working with the Israelis to find a solution, but that the security burden falls squarely on Israel's shoulders.\n\nU.N. and other humanitarian officials, including Samantha Power, head of the U.S. Agency for International Development, met with Israel's military chief and COGAT officials this week to seek solutions.\n\nUSAID said afterward that the meeting ended with promises of specific actions, but gave no details.", "source": {"uri": "newsmax.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NewsMax"}, "authors": [{"uri": "julia_frankel@newsmax.com", "name": "Julia Frankel", "type": "author",

However, the pilings and base are steel instead of wood.\n\nThe former structure had a wood base. When it was dismantled, most of the pilings had been rotting and were unsafe.\n\n\"What we are trying to do is match what we had before,\" Mitchell said. \"The look will be very similar to what it was prior.\"\n\nSummerland council had earlier earmarked $300,000 of its $4.533 million Growing Communities Fund money for the pier replacement. This was in addition to $200,000 set aside by Summerland council to remove the old pier.\n\nThe pier has a long history as a community landmark.\n\nIn 1910, the Canadian Pacific Railway wharf had been built at the site, and was in use until the 1970s. When the wharf was constructed, Okanagan Lake was a primary transportation corridor in the region.\n\nLater, the wharf had deteriorated and was eventually dismantled.\n\nIn 1999, a new pier, on the same footprint, was opened. That pier was the result of community fundraising initiatives. It had become a popular summer recreation spot on the lakefront in Summerland.\n\nAn official opening of the rebuilt pier is expected for July 11.\n\nThe Rotary Club of Summerland is raising money for amenities for the pier. The preferred amenities identified by the community in 2023 included additional benches, a shade structure, a rope swing, a jumping board, aquatic stairs, lighting on the railing, a slide, a stepped-down platform, solar lighting on the shade structure and a floating dock and ramp.\n\nThe amenities will not be included when the pier is reopened, as the permit for the work only covers the replacement of the original pier.

So once again, we are seeing shootings between families, there are thefts, all the bad things are happening.\"\n\nUNRWA, the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees, used to deploy local Palestinian police to escort aid convoys, but many refused to continue serving after airstrikes killed at least eight police officers in Rafah, the agency said.\n\nIsrael says the police are legitimate targets because they are controlled by Hamas.\n\nThe situation has largely paralyzed aid distribution to the south - particularly since Gaza\u00b4s nearby Rafah crossing with Egypt was closed when Israel invaded the city early last month.\n\nThe U.N. official said that 25 trucks of flour used the route Tuesday. Some private commercial trucks also got through - many of which used armed security to deter groups seeking to seize their cargo. An AP reporter stationed along the road Monday saw at least eight trucks pass by, armed security guards riding on top.\n\nBefore Israel\u00b4s offensive into the city of Rafah, hundreds of fuel trucks routinely entered the area.\n\nThe U.N. has now begun rerouting some fuel trucks through northern Gaza. Farhan Haq, a U.N. spokesman, said five fuel trucks entered Gaza Wednesday. The U.N. humanitarian office reported that these were the first fuel deliveries since early June and supplies remain scarce.\n\nAid groups say only a ceasefire and a reopening of the Rafah crossing could significantly increase aid flow to the area.\n\nThe military body in charge of coordinating humanitarian aid efforts, COGAT, did not respond to multiple requests for comment.\n\nThe U.S. installed a pier off Gaza\u00b4s coast last month, aiming to provide an additional route for aid to enter Gaza. But the ambitious project has suffered repeated logistical and security setbacks.\n\nCyprus, a partner in the effort, said the pier was up and running again Thursday after being detached for a second time last week because of rough seas. COGAT said Thursday there were \"hundreds of aid pallets awaiting collection and distribution by the U.N. aid agencies.\"\n\nBut there, too, security concerns are hindering distribution of aid.\n\nThe U.N. suspended its cooperation with the pier on June 9 - a day after rumors swirled that the Israeli military had used the area in a hostage rescue operation that left over 270 Palestinians dead. Photos of the operation have shown an Israeli helicopter in the vicinity of the pier.\n\nBoth Israel and the U.S. deny the pier was used in the operation. But the perception that the pier was used for military purposes could endanger humanitarian workers, and threaten humanitarian groups\u00b4 principles of of neutrality, the U.N. says.\n\nAid workers said they are working with the Israelis to find a solution, but that the security burden falls squarely on Israel\u00b4s shoulders.\n\nU.N. and other humanitarian officials, including Samantha Power, head of the U.S. Agency for International Development, met with Israel\u00b4s military chief and COGAT officials this week to seek solutions.\n\nUSAID said afterward that the meeting ended with promises of specific actions, but gave no details.\n\n--\n\nAP correspondents Ellen Knickmeyer in Washington and Edith M.

The pier was damaged in rough seas and there were reports that much of the aid arriving by sea was hijacked by armed gunmen before it could be distributed..\n\nThe failures associated with the pier are just the latest in the efforts to distribute food, water, medicine and fuel across the beleaguered coastal enclave during the nine-month war.\n\n[ Entire Palestinian families killed, according to wire agency's report on war ]\n\nParachute drops by a number of countries have also proved to be an inadequate solution. Some two dozen residents have reportedly lost their lives when parachutes failed to open or when residents drowned in the sea trying to reach aid drops, or when they were crushed in stampedes.\n\nThe most efficient method of aid delivery is overland but Egypt's closure of the Rafah crossing, after Israel's seizure of the Palestinian side of the terminal last month, left Kerem Shalom as the only major access route for aid deliveries in southern Gaza.\n\n[ US preparing to temporarily remove Gaza pier due to sea conditions, official says ]\n\nInternational aid organisations have warned of a dire humanitarian situation, urging Israel to allow more aid in.\n\nWorld Health Organisation director general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said last week a significant proportion of Gaza's population was facing \"catastrophic hunger and famine-like conditions\".\n\nAid agencies claim the number of aid trucks entering Gaza continues to be well below what is required.\n\nThe UN humanitarian agency, the Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs, reported that, in May the daily average number of trucks delivering humanitarian aid into Gaza - excluding fuel - was 97, down from 169 in April and 139 in March. Prior to the outbreak of the war on October 7th, about 500 trucks were entering Gaza every day, but that number included consumer goods and raw materials, in addition to humanitarian aid.\n\nIsrael strongly denies it is deliberately withholding aid and has urged the UN and aid agencies to increase distribution capacity. Israel claims much of the aid that does reach Gaza is hijacked by Hamas gunmen and criminal gangs who then sell it at local markets.\n\n[ Netanyahu hits back at Israeli army spokesman who says Hamas cannot be eliminated ]\n\nIsraeli officials also deny claims that Gaza faces famine, noting the conclusions on June 4th of the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC), a multi-agency initiative to improve analysis of food security issues, that it could not confirm the situation in Gaza is a \"famine\". The IPC said, however, that whether or not a famine classification was confirmed \"does not in any manner change the fact that extreme human suffering is without a doubt currently ongoing in the Gaza Strip\".", "source": {"uri": "irishtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Irish Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft_hijacking", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Aircraft hijacking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarian_aid", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Humanitarian aid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parachute", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Parachute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "World Health Organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enclave_and_exclave", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Enclave and exclave"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Famine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Famine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pentagon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Pentagon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Medicine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafah_Border_Crossing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rafah Border Crossing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tedros_Adhanom", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tedros Adhanom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aid", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerem_Shalom", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kerem Shalom"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kerem Shalom"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_Food_Security_Phase_Classification", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Integrated Food Security Phase Classification"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Netanyahu", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Benjamin Netanyahu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Israel Defense Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aid_agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aid agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raw_material", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Raw material"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Food security"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Disabilities", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Disabilities", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Immune_Disorders", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Immune Disorders", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Home_and_Garden/Emergency_Supplies", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Home and Garden/Emergency Supplies", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Education_and_Training/Health_and_Safety", "label": "dmoz/Business/Education and Training/Health and Safety", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Public_Health_and_Safety/First_Aid", "label": "dmoz/Health/Public Health and Safety/First Aid", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 56}], "image": "https://www.irishtimes.com/resizer/BGy2LHUz7V_zBRLfzrg_QvXpXrM=/1200x630/filters:format(jpg):quality(70)/cloudfront-eu-central-1.images.arcpublishing.com/irishtimes/FEJREIBZ4DASH5ZAVO2OF3BTOE.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9663051", "eventUri": "eng-9663051", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-10-07", "textStart": 2220, "textEnd": 2231}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-04", "textStart": 2810, "textEnd": 2818}], "sentiment": -0.4196078431372549, "wgt": 143, "relevance": 1}

One group of Palestinian men demanded entry to a U.N. warehouse last week to secure a stash of cigarettes they knew was inside, according to the Journal.\n\nThe smuggling operation only enhances the dangers for aid convoys operating in Gaza, which have already faced mobs of Palestinians stopping them in their tracks.\n\nDemand for cigarettes skyrocketed in early May when Israeli forces seized control of the Rafah crossing between Gaza and Egypt. They closed the border to virtually all trade, cutting off a previously steady flow of tobacco products into Gaza.\n\nOpportunists then began smuggling the product into the region via the aid packages coming in to United Nations facilities from all over the world.\n\nGROWING CONTROVERSY OVER BIDEN'S GAZA PIER FUELS CONCERNS OVER COST, SECURITY\n\nThe danger has contributed to aid groups' refusal to make deliveries beyond the Gaza border.

It was operational for only about a week when it was blown apart by high winds in May and then removed again earlier this month.\n\nNewsletters", "source": {"uri": "djournal.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Journal"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@djournal.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_City", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gaza City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hezbollah", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hezbollah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiryat_Shmona", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kiryat Shmona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kiryat Shmona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebanon", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lebanon"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Lebanon"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarian_aid", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Humanitarian aid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Food_Programme", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World Food Programme"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyprus", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cyprus"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Cyprus"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Women", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Women", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Customer_Service/Conferences", "label": "dmoz/Business/Customer Service/Conferences", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "wgt": 10}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/djournal.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/6/4d/64d5a3e0-2353-5b7d-b2c2-159acb8970d6/66729eee4c8ea.image.jpg?crop=1763%2C926%2C0%2C125&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9663051", "eventUri": "eng-9663051", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-10-07", "textStart": 206, "textEnd": 212}, {"amb": false, "date": "2019-06-", "textStart": 101, "textEnd": 108}], "sentiment": -0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 117, "relevance": 1}

After rough seas scattered parts of the project across the Eastern Mediterranean in late May, forcing it to shut down, the pier was repaired and sent back into action.\n\nBut less than a week later, heavy swells again suspended operations. The latest report is that the entire effort may be scrapped months early.\n\nThe failure to solve the problem of Gaza's notoriously choppy waters obscured a more fundamental challenge that has plagued all plans, Biden's included, to surge humanitarian assistance to suffering Gazans: Hamas's determination to ensure such efforts fail.\n\nBiden unveiled his initiative to aid Gaza by sea in his March State of the Union address. As Gaza has no port, Biden directed $320 million and two months of efforts by 1000 U.S. troops to build a temporary pier.\n\nLess than two weeks after the pier became operational, large ocean surges common to the area broke it apart. Viral videos captured the flotsam washing ashore miles away in Israel.\n\nThat embarrassment diverted attention from the even tougher problem: only a fraction of the aid the pier briefly handled reached innocent Palestinians. Once loaded onto international aid agency trucks and sent forth into Gaza's badlands, much of the supplies have been looted.\n\nHamas steals aid to supply its troops, fill its coffers, and maintain its political control. Recent reporting by one of Israel's top journalists suggests the scale of the problem: Hamas may have earned $120 to $200 million taxing aid or selling it on the black market.\n\nGaza's treacherous streets, like its treacherous waters, were known well in advance of Biden's State of the Union address. The long pole in the humanitarian tent was never about ensuring that adequate amounts of aid entered Gaza but rather that aid was actually reaching needy Gazans. Without first answering the question of how supplies will be securely delivered, any effort to surge assistance will founder.\n\nMany have proposed that the Palestinian Authority, friendly Arab countries, or an international coalition take control and secure aid shipments into Gaza. While in theory desirable, there's one problem: no capable outside force seems ready to put its troops and prestige on the line for such a dangerous and politically charged mission. History also cautions that such coalitions, when formed, commonly suffer from inadequate contributions and crippling and shifting patchworks of donor-nation limitations on their troops' activities, problems especially likely in Gaza.\n\nSaddling Israeli or American forces with the primary tasks would inflame problems further. At the same time, the Palestinian Authority remains incapable of confronting Hamas and, absent significant revamping, unacceptable to Israel, whose cooperation would be essential.\n\nAs for troops from Arab states, the downside risks are enormous. Imagine the geopolitical implications of an errant Israeli attack on Hamas that kills troops from an Abraham Accords country deployed to secure an aid convoy. The prospect of jeopardizing the Accords -- the greatest advance in regional peace in decades -- would spur Hamas and its Iranian sponsors to even greater provocations.\n\nIn the months following October 7, we participated in a bipartisan task force of former U.S. officials that closely studied the challenges of addressing Gaza's humanitarian crisis while working to defeat Hamas and get to a better \"day after.\" Starting in early January, we proposed an interim solution to top U.S., Israeli, Saudi, and UAE officials: the creation of a private, internationally-supported foundation, which we called the \"Trust for Gaza Relief and Reconstruction.\" Friendly states would help fund the foundation and select its leaders.\n\nThe approach was designed to give willing countries, including friendly Arab states, a way to deepen their engagement in addressing the urgent needs of innocent Palestinians without putting their own national prestige and militaries directly into the line of fire alongside Israeli troops.\n\nThe Trust would provide prominent roles for Palestinians from Gaza, the West Bank, and the diaspora who seek a post-Hamas future. The Trust would be prepared to support a revamped Palestinian Authority once it proved capable of taking on greater responsibility in Gaza.\n\nOn the vital question of securing the Trust's humanitarian operations, our approach was intensely practical. If there is a lack of sufficient Palestinian or international forces, the Trust could temporarily augment security by hiring private security companies (PSCs) with proven records of responsible operations under the supervision of Western armies.\n\nAfter a disastrous incident involving PSCs in Iraq in 2007, U.S. military leaders imposed much stricter requirements on contractors -- including tighter rules of engagement, extensive monitoring, and harsh consequences for wrongdoing. According to U.S. officials we interviewed who developed this more rigorous system of accountability, PSCs subsequently operated with significant success over years of stressful missions. These officials were confident that PSCs so supervised could responsibly secure convoys, guard humanitarian encampments, and protect VIPs in Gaza, especially as they would have the support of Israeli forces eager to help foil Hamas attacks.\n\nThe Trust would similarly retain experienced former flag officers to oversee PSC behavior and promptly discipline or fire transgressors. While no force is likely to perform perfectly in Gaza's extremely challenging conditions, ignoring security entails even greater risks. Allowing the perfect to be the enemy of the good jeopardizes both important humanitarian aid efforts and U.S. national security concerns.\n\nWhether or not Biden's pier has reached its final act, the saga only underscores the need for the administration and Congress to get serious about ensuring that humanitarian operations deliver success rather than empower Hamas and warm the reputed heart of the Ayatollah.\n\nJohn Hannah, Wax Senior Fellow at the Jewish Institute for National Security of America, served in both Republican and Democratic administrations, including as national security

The content of 1,100 aid trucks is waiting to be collected from the Gazan side of Kerem Shalom.\" The figures did not include the undelivered pallets of aid offloaded from the US pier.\n\nDistribution of aid has been mired in controversy and failures in recent days.\n\nThe Wall St. Journal reported on Tuesday that Palestinians have been smuggling cigarettes hidden in the aid deliveries, and that Palestinians have been attacking the convoys to get to the tobacco. According to the report, the attacks have led to more than 1,000 truckloads of undelivered aid piling up on the Gaza side of the Kerem Shalom border crossing.\n\nMeanwhile, a US-built offshore pier will be dismantled weeks ahead of schedule due to a combination of high seas and security concerns, the New York Times reported on Tuesday. Built at a cost of $230 million, the pier was only operational for 10 days.\n\nA UN committee of experts said in a recently released report that there is \"no supporting evidence\" to conclude that there is a famine in Gaza while an Israeli acaemdic study concluded that Hamas is the biggest threat to food security in Gaza.\n\nWhen Hamas slashed food prices in April, Gaza residents told The Press Service of Israel that the problem wasn't a lack of food but a shortage of money for families to purchase it.\n\nAt least 1,200 people were killed, and 252 Israelis and foreigners were taken hostage in Hamas's attacks on Israeli communities near the Gaza border on October 7.

We [are continuing] with our efforts - now it is your duty to complete the job,\" the statement added.\n\nCOGAT also posted on social media a video of hundreds of pallets of aid sitting in the sun.\n\n\"This is an areal [sic] view of the loading and unloading area of the JLOTS,\" COGAT tweeted, referring to a USD 230 million offshore pier built by the US Navy. \"Here too, just like the Gazan side of Kerem Shalom pallets of aid are waiting to be picked up and distributed by the @UN aid agencies for days.\"\n\nCOGAT reported that 285 aid trucks were transferred to the Gaza Strip via the Kerem Shalom and Erez crossings.\n\nHowever, it noted that \"Only 88 aid trucks were collected by UN aid agencies and the private sector. 33 trucks were collected from the Erez crossing, and only 55 trucks were collected from Kerem Shalom. The content of 1,100 aid trucks is waiting to be collected from the Gazan side of Kerem Shalom.\" The figures did not include the undelivered pallets of aid offloaded from the US pier.\n\nDistribution of aid has been mired in controversy and failures in recent days.\n\nThe Wall St. Journal reported on Tuesday that Palestinians have been smuggling cigarettes hidden in the aid deliveries, and that Palestinians have been attacking the convoys to get to the tobacco. According to the report, the attacks have led to more than 1,000 truckloads of undelivered aid piling up on the Gaza side of the Kerem Shalom border crossing.\n\nMeanwhile, a US-built offshore pier will be dismantled weeks ahead of schedule due to a combination of high seas and security concerns, the New York Times reported on Tuesday. Built at a cost of $230 million, the pier was only operational for 10 days.\n\nA UN committee of experts said in a recently released report that there is \"no supporting evidence\" to conclude that there is a famine in Gaza while an Israeli acaemdic study concluded that Hamas is the biggest threat to food security in Gaza.\n\nWhen Hamas slashed food prices in April, Gaza residents told The Press Service of Israel that the problem wasn't a lack of food but a shortage of money for families to purchase it.\n\nAt least 1,200 people were killed, and 252 Israelis and foreigners were taken hostage in Hamas's attacks on Israeli communities near the Gaza border on October 7. Of the 116 remaining hostages, more than 30 are believed dead.

The floating pier was anchored back on Gaza's shoreline Wednesday after facing a number of setbacks.\n\nAid groups have sharply criticized the plan to bring aid by sea into Gaza, saying it's a distraction to take pressure off Israel to open more land border crossings that are far more productive. Palestinians face widespread hunger as the war has largely cut off the flow of food, medicine and basic goods to Gaza, which is now totally dependent on aid.\n\nThe United Nations has suspended cooperation with the pier project since June 9, a day after the Israeli military used the area around the pier in a hostage rescue that killed more than 270 Palestinians. The U.S. and Israeli militaries say no part of the pier was used in the raid.\n\nMeanwhile, Israel's pledge to guard a new aid route into southern Gaza has fallen flat, as the U.N. and international aid organizations say a breakdown in law and order has made that route unusable. The situation has largely paralyzed aid distribution to southern and central Gaza -- particularly since the Rafah crossing with Egypt was closed by Israel's invasion of the city early last month.\n\nIsrael's war against Hamas, now in its ninth month, faces growing international criticism over the U.S.-backed campaign of systematic destruction in Gaza, at a huge cost in civilian lives.\n\nIsraeli ground offensives and bombardments have killed more than 37,100 people, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians in its count.\n\nIsrael launched the war after Hamas' Oct. 7 attack, in which militants stormed into southern Israel, killed some 1,200 people -- mostly civilians -- and abducted about 250.\n\nCurrently:\n\n-- The fate of the latest cease-fire proposal hinges on Netanyahu and Hamas' leader in Gaza.\n\n-- Israel's pledge to guard an aid route into Gaza falls flat as lawlessness blocks distribution.\n\n-- A rare public rift appears between Israel's political and military leadership over how the war in Gaza is being conducted.\n\n-- The leader of Lebanon's Hezbollah militant group warns archenemy Israel against wider war.\n\n-- Hundreds died during this year's Hajj pilgrimage in Saudi Arabia amid intense heat, officials say.\n\nFollow AP's coverage of the war in Gaza at https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war\n\nHere's the latest:\n\nIsrael's pledge to guard an aid route into Gaza falls flat as lawlessness blocks distribution\n\nJERUSALEM -- A breakdown in law and order n southern Gaza has made a new route to deliver aid unusable, according to the United Nations and international humanitarian organizations, just days after Israel declared the safe corridor.\n\nWith thousands of truckloads of aid piled up, groups of armed men are regularly blocking convoys, holding drivers at gunpoint and rifling through their cargo, according to a U.N. official who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to brief the media on the issue.\n\nThe lawlessness is a major obstacle to aid distribution for southern and central Gaza. In those areas, an estimated 1.3 million Palestinians displaced from Rafah -- more than half of Gaza's entire population -- are now sheltering in tent camps and cramped apartments without adequate food, water, or medical supplies.\n\nIsrael announced Sunday it would observe daily pauses in combat along a route stretching from Kerem Shalom, the strip's only operational aid crossing in the south, to the nearby city of Khan Younis.\n\nThe head of the U.N.'s World Food Program said Thursday that the pause has made \"no difference at all\" in aid distribution efforts. \"We haven't been able to get in,\" said Cindy McCain in an interview with Al-Monitor. \"We've had to reroute some of our trucks. They've been looted. As you know, we've been shot at and we've been rocketed.\"\n\nThe Israeli military body in charge of coordinating humanitarian aid efforts, COGAT, did not respond to multiple requests for comment.\n\nThe U.N. official familiar with the aid effort said that there's been no sign of Israeli activity along the route. The U.N. tried to send a convoy of 60 trucks down the road Tuesday to pick up aid at Kerem Shalom. But 35 of the trucks were intercepted by armed men, the official said.\n\nIn recent days, the groups have moved closer to the crossing and set up roadblocks to halt trucks loaded with supplies, the U.N. official said. They have searched the pallets for smuggled cigarettes, a rare luxury in a territory where a single smoke can go for $25.\n\nThe U.N. official said that 25 trucks of flour used the route Tuesday. Some private commercial trucks also got through -- many of which used armed security to deter groups seeking to seize their cargo. An AP reporter stationed along the road Monday saw at least eight trucks pass by, armed security guards riding on top.\n\nAP writer Julia Frankel contributed.\n\nUS military says 1.4 million pounds of aid unloaded since Gaza pier reopened\n\nWASHINGTON -- More than 656 metric tons, or 1.4 million pounds, of aid were delivered through the U.S. military-built pier in Gaza on Thursday in the hours after it resumed operations, Pentagon press secretary Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder said.\n\nThe pier was re-anchored to the beach in Gaza and started operating Wednesday after the military temporarily removed it due to weather, Ryder said. Aid groups have decried the pier as a distraction that took pressure off Israel to open more land border crossings, which are far more productive.\n\nSince the pier opened on May 17, more than 4,100 tons, or 9.1 million pounds, of food and aid have been delivered by sea and unloaded in Gaza. However, much of the aid has lingered in the storage area right by the pier, so although it was provided to Gaza, delivery trucks have not driven it into the people who need it most.\n\nRyder directed questions about aid distribution to the United Nation's World Food Program.\n\nThe U.N. has suspended cooperation with the U.S.-led pier project since June 9, a day after the Israeli military used the area around the pier in a hostage rescue that killed more than 270 Palestinians.\n\nThe U.S. and Israeli militaries say no part of the pier was used in the raid. The U.N. is concerned that any such use -- or even a perception of it by fighters and ordinary people in Gaza -- makes their continued role in the project untenable.\n\nAt issue are the safety of humanitarian workers, and humanitarian groups' principles of neutrality, the U.N. says.\n\nHamas says it plans a legal response to ICC prosecutor's request for arrest warrants for its leaders\n\nCAIRO -- Hamas says it is planning a legal response against the International Criminal Court chief prosecutor's request for arrest warrants against its top leaders.\n\nCalling the war crimes accusations against three of its top leaders -- Yahya Sinwar, Ismail Haniyeh, and Mohammed Deif -- \"baseless,\" Hamas said it would argue that Palestinians have \"the right, indeed the duty, to resist occupation by all means available, including armed resistance.\"\n\nHamas is already considered an international terrorist group by Israel and its Western allies, so it was unclear what the impact of its legal brief would be. Both Sinwar and Deif are believed to be hiding in Gaza. Haniyeh, the supreme leader of the Islamic militant group, is based in Qatar and frequently travels across the region. Qatar is not a member of the ICC.\n\nThe ICC's chief prosecutor, Karim Khan, said in May he was seeking the arrests of the three Hamas leaders, saying they bore responsibility for the attack on Israel Oct. 7, when the militants killed around 1,200 people and took some 250 hostage.\n\nKhan accused them of eight war crimes, among them rape, torture, taking hostages, and extermination. Khan said the same day he was seeking arrest warrants against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant.\n\nIn its statement Thursday, Hamas cast Khan as biased in Israel's favor. It said the prosecutor had \"erred in considering that the state of conflict began on October 7,\" asserting that the conflict began in 1948 with Israel's establishment.\n\nDuring the war surrounding Israel's independence, some 700,000 Palestinians fled or were forced their homes, an event the Palestinians refer as the \"Nakba,\" Arabic for catastrophe.\n\nA panel of three judges will decide whether to issue the arrest warrants and allow a case to proceed. The judges typically take two months to make such decisions.\n\nIsrael's Netanyahu bemoans 'personal attacks' after White House responds to his claims about weapons delays\n\nJERUSALEM -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has described White House statements regarding his claims that the U.S. is holding up weapons deliveries for Israel as \"personal attacks,\" but said he would endure these attacks provided Israel gets the munitions.\n\nEarlier Thursday, White House national security spokesman John Kirby said the U.S. is \"perplexed\" by Netanyahu's claims earlier this week that the U.S. was holding up the delivery of weapons and creating bottlenecks. Kirby said those claims were incorrect.\n\nNetanyahu, in a statement released by his office, said, \"I am ready to suffer personal attacks as long as Israel receives from the United States the ammunition that it needs in the war for its existence.\"\n\nNetanyahu has been facing growing domestic political problems, and analysts have said his comments Tuesday on weapons delivery delays were likely aimed to shore up support among his right-wing base in Israel and the country's supporters in the U.S., and didn't appear to indicate actual shortages of weapons.\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Tuesday the only pause in weapons deliveries was related to certain heavy bombs since May.\n\nU.S. President Joe Biden delayed sending the 2,000-pound bombs over concerns about Israel's killing of civilians in Gaza. Yet the administration has gone to lengths to avoid any suggestion that Israeli forces have crossed a red line in the deepening operation in the southern city of Rafah, which would trigger a more sweeping ban on arms transfers.\n\nUN is still reviewing whether it can safely take part in aid operation at US-built pier\n\nUNITED NATIONS -- The United Nations says it is still assessing whether it's safe for staff to participate in delivering humanitarian aid from the U.S.-built pier on Gaza's coast, which means no aid is being transported from the beach to U.N. warehouses.\n\nThere is currently no timeline for completing the assessment, U.N. deputy spokesman Farhan Haq told reporters Thursday. If the U.N. Department of Safety and Security decides the U.N. can resume operations, \"then the World Food Program stands ready to do so based on its core principles.\"\n\nThese core principles -- U.N. neutrality and independence in humanitarian activities -- were called into question during Israel's June 8 hostage rescue, which killed more than 270 Palestinians. An Israeli helicopter touched down near the U.S.-built pier and helped whisk away the hostages and an injured Israeli commando, according to the U.S. and Israeli militaries. Both forces deny the pier was used, saying the helicopter landed an unspecified distance south of the causeway.\n\nThe U.N. also hasn't been able to deliver aid using a new route in southern Gaza the Israeli military said it would secure during \"tactical pauses,\" Haq said.\n\nFighting may have decreased on the route from the Kerem Shalom crossing to Gaza's main north-south Salah al-Din road, he said, but there are other impediments and \"the lack of public order and safety is a major obstacle and requires concerted efforts and concrete measures to find a solution.\"\n\n\"We've made clear that it's the responsibility of Israel, the occupying power, to ensure that assistance can reach those who need it the most and to create an enabling environment,\" Haq said.\n\nHe said the U.N. is is in discussions with Israeli authorities including COGAT, the Israeli military body that oversees aid distribution in Gaza, to provide assurances so people don't panic and think an aid delivery is a one-time event and rush to convoys trying to take food and other items.\n\n\"Many households report having only one meal every day, with some having one meal every two or three days, relying mostly on bread, food sharing with other families and rationing stocks,\" he said.\n\nAccess to water is \"critically low\" and people line up for hours to collect it and are forced to rely on seawater for domestic use, Haq said. Communicable illnesses are spreading, sewage is overflowing, there is a proliferation of insects and vermin, and a near total lack of hygiene items.\n\nFrom June 1-18 there were 61 coordinated U.N. humanitarian missions to northern Gaza, he said. Of those, 28 were facilitated by Israeli authorities, eight were denied access, 16 were impeded, and nine were canceled for logistical, operational or security reasons.\n\nIn southern Gaza, he said, the U.N. humanitarian office led assessments at sites for displaced Palestinians from June 7-14 and found people living in overcrowded tents in need of repair that don't offer any protection from extreme heat.\n\nBiden administration is still 'perplexed' by Israel's Netanyahu saying US is withholding weapons\n\nWASHINGTON -- White House national security spokesman John Kirby said Thursday the U.S. remains \"perplexed\" by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's claims this week that the U.S. was holding up weapons for Israel and creating bottlenecks.\n\nKirby called the prime minister's comments \"disappointing, especially given that no other country is doing more to help Israel defend itself against the threat by Hamas and, quite frankly, other threats that they're facing in the region.\"\n\n\"It was vexing and disappointing to us, as much as it was incorrect. So, difficult to know exactly what was on his mind there,\" Kirby told reporters.\n\nNetanyahu's video message Tuesday comes as he faces growing domestic political problems. Analysts say it likely aimed to shore up support among his right-wing base in Israel as well as the country's supporters in the U.S., and doesn't appear to indicate on-the-ground shortages of weapons.\n\nThe Biden administration has provided crucial military and diplomatic support for Israel throughout the war against Hamas.\n\nPresident Joe Biden has delayed delivering certain heavy bombs since May over concerns about Israel's killing of civilians in Gaza. Yet the administration has gone to lengths to avoid any suggestion that Israeli forces have crossed a red line in the deepening operation in the southern city of Rafah, which would trigger a more sweeping ban on arms transfers.\n\nIsrael doesn't want to let the Red Cross inspect detention centers accused of brutal treatment against Palestinians from Gaza\n\nJERUSALEM - Israel remains opposed to allowing the International Committee of the Red Cross access to detention facilities accused of harshly treating Palestinians from Gaza and is working on creating an internal inspection system, state lawyers said Wednesday.\n\nThe Red Cross had access to Israeli detention facilities holding Palestinians until Oct. 7, when Israel sealed them off from external observation. Since then, testimonies have mounted from released Palestinians of brutal treatment at the detention centers, where they are held incommunicado and without trial.\n\nThe government lawyers wrote that Israeli lawmakers are examining a proposal to form an internal body that would visit the detention facilities, hear prisoners' complaints and communicate the information to Israeli authorities.\n\nThe body is \"expected to fulfill the purpose that the Red Cross has fulfilled until now,\" the lawyers wrote. They were responding to a coalition of rights groups asking Israel's highest court to grant the Red Cross access to the detention facilities.\n\nIn response, the main rights group petitioning the court said internal Israeli examiners could not substitute for international observers.\n\n\"Mounting testimonies reveal Israel has turned its detention facilities into a black hole for Palestinian prisoners enduring appalling conditions,\" said the Association for Civil Rights in Israel, adding that the government was \"investing a far-fetched mechanism in order to replace the accepted arrangement by the world.\"\n\nSince the Hamas attack Oct. 7, Israel has taken at least 4,000 Palestinians from Gaza into custody in Israel, interrogating them for potential ties to the militant group. Over 1,500 have been released, according to state figures.\n\nHamas has rejected Red Cross appeals to visit some 120 hostages it is believed to be holding. Israel has already pronounced 43 of the hostages dead.\n\nUS defense official confirms Gaza pier is bringing aid ashore\n\nWASHINGTON -- The U.S. military-built pier in Gaza was unloading humanitarian aid again Thursday after being removed for a second time last week because of rough seas, a U.S. defense official said. The pier was reattached to Gaza's shoreline on Wednesday, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss U.S. military operations.\n\nThe pier, which cost the U.S. at least $230 million, was meant to deliver humanitarian aid into Gaza via the U.N.'s World Food Program. It has faced a number of setbacks, operating for only about a week before getting blown apart by high winds in May. The U.S. military detached the floating causeway and moved it to an Israeli port last week so it wouldn't break apart again.\n\nAid groups have decried the pier as a distraction that took pressure off Israel to open more border crossings, which are far more productive at bringing aid into Gaza. Israel's war against Hamas has caused widespread devastation and made domestic food production nearly impossible, leaving Gaza totally dependent on aid groups for food, medicine and basic goods. Palestinians are facing widespread hunger.\n\nMeanwhile, the United Nations has suspended its cooperation with the U.S.-led pier project since June 9. U.N. officials say they want to evaluate whether the Israeli military used the area around the pier in a June 8 hostage rescue that killed more than 270 Palestinians, and whether any such use -- or even a perception of it by fighters and ordinary people in Gaza -- makes their continued role in the project untenable.\n\nThe U.S. and Israeli militaries say no part of the pier was used in the raid.\n\nAP writers Lolita C. Baldor and Ellen Knickmeyer contributed to this report.\n\nPier for delivering vital aid to Gaza is functioning again, Cyprus says\n\nNICOSIA, Cyprus -- Cyprus' Foreign Ministry said Thursday the U.S. military-built pier in Gaza is up and running again after being detached for a second time last week because of rough seas.\n\nCyprus plays a key role in the pier because a security and inspection station it built screens the international aid destined for Gaza. There was no immediate confirmation from the U.S.\n\nTheodoris Gotsis, a spokesperson for the Foreign Ministry, said the pier and the causeway in Gaza were both functioning. He said over the past 40 days, Cyprus has screened and loaded onto boats some 10,000 tons of aid for Gaza.\n\nThe U.S. military detached the causeway last week to prevent it from breaking apart again, as it did late last month when it was hit by bad weather.\n\nThe pier, used to deliver humanitarian aid into Gaza, has faced a number of setbacks since it was erected. It was operational for only about a week when it was blown apart by high winds in May and then removed again earlier this month.\n\nThe U.N.'s World Food Program, one of the main aid agencies to make use of the pier, had paused its distribution of aid coming from it earlier this month over security concerns. WFP could not immediately be reached for comment on whether it was resuming distribution.\n\nEU warns against threats against Cyprus from Hezbollah\n\nNICOSIA, Cyprus -- A spokesman for the European Union's executive arm says any threat against Cyprus is a threat against the bloc's 26 other member nations.\n\nPeter Stano made the remark Thursday in response to a question regarding Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah's threat that Cyprus could be implicated in a wider conflict if the island nation allows Israel to use its ports and airports to target Lebanon.\n\nStano said the EU fully supports Cyprus and that the trade bloc is in contact with \"a number of partners in the region,\" including Lebanon and Hezbollah, in order to de-escalate tension.\n\nCyprus has enjoyed increasingly tight relations with Israel in recent years, spawned by the discovery of undersea natural gas deposits in waters between the two neighbors. Cyprus has hosted joint Israeli-Cypriot military exercises, but has not ben involved in any military operations.\n\nCyprus government spokesman Konstantinos Letymbiotis repeated that any suggestion that Cyprus - either through its infrastructure or territory - would be involved in any military operation in Lebanon is \"totally groundless.\"\n\nLetymbiotis reiterated that the island nation \"is not part of the problem\" but \"part of the solution\" thanks to its regional diplomatic footprint.\n\nHezbollah says Israeli strikes kill 3 fighters in Lebanon\n\nThe Hezbollah militant group said at least three of its fighters were killed in Israeli strikes on Wednesday.\n\nLebanese state media reported multiple Israeli strikes along the border and in an area north of the coastal city of Tyre, about 30 kilometers (20 miles) from the frontier. The Israeli military said two Hezbollah launches damaged several vehicles in northern Israel.\n\nThe fighting came as Amos Hochstein, a senior adviser to U.S. President Joe Biden, returned to Israel after meeting with officials in Lebanon on Tuesday. There has been no word on whether he has made progress in his efforts to avoid a devastating regional war.\n\nKamel Mohanna, the head of the Amel Association, an NGO providing health services in Lebanon, said the group's primary health center in the town of Khiam was hit and damaged by Israeli shelling.\n\nHezbollah began attacking Israel almost immediately after the Israel-Hamas war erupted on Oct. 7. There have been near daily exchanges of fire, though most of the strikes are confined to an area within a few mostly confined to the area around the border.\n\nBut the fighting has escalated in recent weeks, raising fears that the clashes could boil over into a full-blown war. Israel's army announced late Tuesday that it has \"approved and validated\" plans for an offensive in Lebanon.\n\nIsraeli strikes already have killed more than 400 people in Lebanon, most of them Hezbollah fighters,", "source": {"uri": "santamariatimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Santa Maria Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@santamariatimes.com", "name": "Associated

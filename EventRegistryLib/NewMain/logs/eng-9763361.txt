In the new Times/Siena poll, Harris was faring better among groups President Joe Biden had been the weakest in, especially younger voters and nonwhite voters.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris begins a 103-day sprint for the presidency in a virtual tie with former President Donald Trump, according to the latest New York Times/Siena College poll, as her fresh candidacy was quickly reuniting a Democratic Party that had been deeply fractured over President Joe Biden.\n\nJust days after the president abandoned his campaign under pressure from party leaders, the poll showed Democrats rallying behind Harris as the presumptive nominee, with only 14% saying they would prefer another option. An overwhelming 70% of Democratic voters said they wanted the party to speedily consolidate behind her rather than engage in a more competitive and drawn-out process.\n\nHer swift reassembling of the Democratic coalition appeared to help narrow Trump's significant advantage over Biden of only a few weeks ago. Harris was receiving 93% support from Democrats, the same share that Trump was getting from Republicans.\n\nOverall, Trump leads Harris 48% to 47% among likely voters in a head-to-head match. That is a marked improvement for Democrats when compared with the Times/Siena poll in early July that showed Biden behind by 6 percentage points, in the aftermath of the poor debate performance that eventually drove him from the race.\n\nTrump leads Harris 48% to 46% among registered voters. He had led among registered voters by nine percentage points over Biden in the post-debate poll.\n\nThe survey provides a snapshot of the presidential race in the middle of one of the most volatile and unpredictable periods in modern U.S. history. Democrats suddenly have a new nominee. And, less than two weeks after Trump survived an assassination attempt, his favorability rating rose to the highest level it has ever been in a national New York Times survey.\n\nIn some ways, the poll showed a reset to where the race was before Biden imploded on a debate stage in Atlanta: months of a narrow but steady Trump edge in the national polling averages. But in other ways, the new poll provided intriguing hints at how a Harris candidacy could remake the political coalitions and map that will determine the outcome of the 2024 election.\n\nHarris was faring better among groups that Biden had been the weakest in, especially younger voters and nonwhite voters. At the same time, some Democrats fear she might not retain the same strengths that Biden has had among older voters, for whom the poll does show some erosion of Democratic support.\n\nThe poll showed Harris garnering about 60% support from voters younger than 30 and Hispanic voters, groups Biden had consistently struggled with. Among voters younger than 45, Harris was ahead by 10 percentage points, less than three weeks after Trump had held a narrow edge with that group over Biden.\n\nBecause the survey was of voters nationwide, the impact of Harris' candidacy in particular battleground states was not immediately clear. But a Democratic candidate with greater appeal to younger and more diverse voters could put renewed focus on the Sun Belt states of Nevada, Arizona and Georgia, which had been threatening to slip off the swing-state map for Biden.\n\nHarris has emerged as the Democratic Party's expected nominee after a tumultuous few weeks. Biden stepped aside Sunday, following a month of drawn-out questions about his mental faculties following a poor debate performance at the end of June. In the interim, Trump escaped an assassination attempt, named Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, as his running mate and formally accepted his party's nomination at the Republican National Convention.\n\nHarris is on a glide path toward next month's Democratic convention as she seeks to become the first woman, first Black woman and first person of South Asian descent to serve as a U.S. president.\n\n\"Her being president or even being in the running is very important just for history,\" said Summer Nesbitt, a 27-year-old school tutor near Detroit who supports the vice president. But Nesbitt, who is Black, added that she found some of Harris' explicit appeals to Black voters a turnoff. \"I don't think that you have to try to pretend to be more down or be more Black just so you can get the Black vote. Just be yourself.\"\n\nVoters are more tuned into the race. Just before the June debate, 48% of voters said they were paying a lot of attention to the presidential campaign. That figure now stands at 64%, though the interest of independents continues to lag behind that of Democrats and Republicans.\n\nThe national mood remains bleak, but noticeably less so, with 61% seeing the country headed in the wrong direction, which is lower than in recent months.\n\nHarris faces some structural challenges as November approaches. She is the sitting vice president at a time when 75% of voters rated the nation's economic conditions as \"fair\" or \"poor.\" And significantly more voters see Trump as a strong leader than those who say the same of Harris.\n\nThe country's view of Harris has also brightened, with her favorable rating rising by 10 percentage points since February. Harris enters the campaign with a favorable rating of 46%, better than Biden's, but still behind Trump's.\n\nViews of all three -- Trump, Biden and Harris -- split dramatically along gender lines. For the most part, men like Trump while women don't. Women like Biden and Harris, while men don't.\n\nTrump's favorable rating ticked up to 48%. This comes not long after the indelible images of him rising to his feet after an assassination attempt at a Pennsylvania rally, pumping his fist in the air as blood streaked across his face, shouting, \"Fight! Fight! Fight!\"\n\n\"Honestly the way he handled it after the fact, the way he pretty much stood up in defiance of what happened, kind of gave me that sense of pride that I hadn't felt when it came to our country in a while,\" said Eddie Otzoy, a 29-year-old contractor in Los Angeles, who had voted for Hillary Clinton in 2016 and Biden in 2020, but is now backing Trump. \"Once the assassination attempt happened, it made me feel like they wanted to shut him up for a reason.\"\n\nNearly 90% of voters said they approved of Biden's decision to exit the race, a view shared by Democrats, Republicans and independents alike.\n\nPerhaps as a result, Harris has almost instantly united the party behind her, to a far greater degree than Biden had been able to in the last two years. Nearly 4 in 5 Democrats or voters who lean toward the Democratic Party said they would like to nominate her. In contrast, only 48% of Democrats had said they wanted Biden as the nominee just three weeks ago.\n\nA majority of Democrats said they felt enthusiastic about Harris as the nominee, with only 10% dissatisfied or angry.\n\n\"It would be a larger setback for the Democrats if they try to find someone else to try to fill in,\" said Michael Newman, a 59-year-old contractor in Arlington, Texas, who is supporting Harris. \"She has a pretty good insight on the goals that Biden was working on.\"\n\nBiden's decision not to seek reelection -- \"I revere this office, but I love my country more,\" he said in a national address Wednesday evening -- has resulted in a sharp spike in his favorability rating. The 7-point jump in his favorable rating after three of the most brutal weeks of his presidency -- as party leaders questioned his mental competence and fitness -- suggested that voter frustration with Biden may have been based not just on how he was governing but the fact that the 81-year-old president was seeking a second term.\n\nBiden's 43% favorability rating was his best showing since 2022.\n\nIn a multicandidate race, less than a single percentage point separated Trump and Harris, with Harris at 44% and Trump at 43% after rounding.\n\nIndependent candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s share of the vote continues to drop, hitting just 5% of likely voters in the new survey. He was the only third-party candidate above 1%.\n\nAmong Harris and Trump's greatest strengths in the poll were that voters saw them as intelligent and having the right temperament to handle the job. Harris gets slightly higher marks for her smarts; 66% of voters say \"intelligent\" describes her well, compared with 59% for Trump.\n\nNeither candidate holds an edge on the ability to unify the country, a sign that perhaps, in this era of deep political polarization, few believe national unity is even possible.\n\nHere are the key things to know about this Times/Siena poll:\n\n-- We spoke with 1,142 registered voters across the country from July 22 to 24, 2024.\n\n-- Times/Siena polls are conducted by telephone, using live interviewers, in both English and Spanish. About 96% of respondents were contacted on a cellphone for this poll.\n\n-- Voters are selected for the survey from a list of registered voters. The list contains information on the demographic characteristics of every registered voter, allowing us to make sure we reach the right number of voters of each party, race and region. For this poll, we placed more than 140,000 calls to nearly 54,000 voters.\n\n-- To further ensure that the results reflect the entire voting population, not just those willing to take a poll, we give more weight to respondents from demographic groups that are underrepresented among survey respondents, such as people without a college degree.\n\n-- The poll's margin of sampling error among registered voters is plus or minus 3.3 percentage points. In theory, this means that the results should reflect the views of the overall population most of the time, though many other challenges create additional sources of error. When computing the difference between two values -- such as a candidate's lead in a race -- the margin of error is twice as large.", "source": {"uri": "staradvertiser.com", "dataType": "news",

Harris 2024 Polls: Trump Loses 5 Points In Latest Major Survey -- But Still Leads Harris", "body": "Former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris are in a neck-and-neck contest nearly 100 days before the election, with the latest poll showing Harris gaining five points on Trump compared to President Joe Biden's standing in the wake of his consequential June 27 debate against Trump.\n\nThe New York Times/Siena poll found voters are more tuned into the race in the aftermath of the June 27 Biden-Trump debate. Some 64% percent of respondents now say they're paying a lot of attention to the contest, compared to 48% prior to the debate.\n\nTrump leads Harris by five or fewer points in four of five battleground states, according to an Emerson College survey released Thursday that found them tied in Wisconsin. Harris performs better than Biden in all five states: Michigan, Pennsylvania, Arizona and Georgia, in addition to Wisconsin.\n\nMost polls taken prior to Biden ending his bid found the president and Harris performing roughly the same against Trump, who had slightly expanded his narrow lead over Biden in the wake of Biden's disastrous June debate performance. A Forbes/HarrisX poll conducted July 19-21 showed Trump leading both Biden and Harris by six points, a two-point jump in his lead over Harris and a four-point increase in his lead over Biden since the groups' previous poll conducted July 13-15. A Yahoo/YouGov poll conducted July 19-22 found Trump and Harris tied in a head-to-head matchup, and Harris trailing by two points in a six-way race with third-party candidates on the ballot. A CBS News/YouGov poll conducted last week showed Trump leading Harris by three points and Biden by five. An Economist/YouGov poll conducted July 13-16 found Biden would lose to Trump 41% to 43%, while Harris would perform slightly worse, losing to Trump 39% to 44%.\n\n1.9. That's how many points Trump leads Harris by in Real Clear Politics' polling average, which includes the Morning Consult poll and nine others conducted before Biden dropped out. The average does not include the Reuters/Ipsos poll released Tuesday. Trump led Biden by 3.1 points as of Sunday, when Biden dropped out of the race, a 1.6-point increase from June 27, the day of the debate, according to Real Clear Politics' polling average.\n\nTrump campaign pollster Tony Fabrizio predicted a \"short term\" bump in polls for Harris in the coming weeks as her entrance into the race is expected to re-energize Democrats, referring to the anticipated boost as a \"Harris Honeymoon,\" in a memo released shortly after the Reuters/Ipsos poll was made public.\n\nBiden dropped out of the race Sunday after resisting growing calls from within his own party to end his re-election bid in the wake of the June 27 debate. Prior to dropping out, Biden trailed Trump by 3.1 points in the RealClearPolitics average, a 1.6-point jump since the debate. Biden immediately endorsed Harris and she announced plans to seek the nomination. The party has quickly coalesced around her, with all Democratic governors and the majority of Democrats in Congress backing her. On Monday, she effectively clinched the Democratic nomination as more than half of all delegates have announced plans to formally vote to nominate her -- something the party is expected to do in the first week of August. A NPR/PBS/Marist poll found 87% of respondents think Biden's decision to drop out of the race was the right thing to do, while 41% of voters, including 65% of Democrats, think it increases the party's chances of winning in November.\n\nTrump's Lead Over Biden And Harris Jumped After RNC, HarrisX/Forbes Poll Finds (Forbes)", "source": {"uri": "forbes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Forbes"},

An overwhelming 70% of Democratic voters said they wanted the party to speedily consolidate behind her rather than engage in a more competitive and drawn-out process.\n\nHer swift reassembling of the Democratic coalition appeared to help narrow Trump's significant advantage over Biden of only a few weeks ago. Harris was receiving 93% support from Democrats, the same share that Trump was getting from Republicans.\n\nOverall, Trump leads Harris 48% to 47% among likely voters in a head-to-head match. That is a marked improvement for Democrats when compared with the Times/Siena poll in early July that showed Biden behind by 6 percentage points, in the aftermath of the poor debate performance that eventually drove him from the race.\n\nRelated Story: How to Decode Kamala Harris's Foreign Policy\n\nTrump leads Harris 48% to 46% among registered voters. He had led among registered voters by nine percentage points over Biden in the post-debate poll.\n\nHarris was faring better among groups that Biden had been the weakest in, especially younger voters and nonwhite voters. At the same time, some Democrats fear she might not retain the same strengths that Biden has had among older voters, for whom the poll does show some erosion of Democratic support.\n\nThe poll showed Harris garnering about 60% support from voters younger than 30 and Hispanic voters, groups Biden had consistently struggled with. Among voters younger than 45, Harris was ahead by 10 percentage points, less than three weeks after Trump had held a narrow edge with that group over Biden.\n\nBecause the survey was of voters nationwide, the impact of Harris' candidacy in particular battleground states was not immediately clear. But a Democratic candidate with greater appeal to younger and more diverse voters could put renewed focus on the Sun Belt states of Nevada, Arizona and Georgia, which had been threatening to slip off the swing-state map for Biden.\n\nRelated Story: Biden Will Make a Case for His Legacy - and for Harris to Continue It ...\n\nHarris has emerged as the Democratic Party's expected nominee after a tumultuous few weeks. Biden stepped aside Sunday, following a month of drawn-out questions about his mental faculties following a poor debate performance at the end of June. In the interim, Trump escaped an assassination attempt, named Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, as his running mate and formally accepted his party's nomination at the Republican National Convention.\n\nHarris is on a glide path toward next month's Democratic convention as she seeks to become the first woman, first Black woman and first person of South Asian descent to serve as a U.S. president.\n\nRelated Story: Did the Harris Entrance Reset the Polling Against Trump?\n\nHarris faces some structural challenges as November approaches. She is the sitting vice president at a time when 75% of voters rated the nation's economic conditions as \"fair\" or \"poor.\" And significantly more voters see Trump as a strong leader than those who say the same of Harris.\n\nThe country's view of Harris has also brightened, with her favorable rating rising by 10 percentage points since February. Harris enters the campaign with a favorable rating of 46%, better than Biden's, but still behind Trump's.\n\nViews of all three -- Trump, Biden and Harris -- split dramatically along gender lines. For the most part, men like Trump while women don't. Women like Biden and Harris, while men don't.\n\nTrump's favorable rating ticked up to 48%. This comes not long after the indelible images of him rising to his feet after an assassination attempt at a Pennsylvania rally, pumping his fist in the air as blood streaked across his face, shouting, \"Fight! Fight! Fight!\"\n\n\"Honestly the way he handled it after the fact, the way he pretty much stood up in defiance of what happened, kind of gave me that sense of pride that I hadn't felt when it came to our country in a while,\" said Eddie Otzoy, a 29-year-old contractor in Los Angeles, who had voted for Hillary Clinton in 2016 and Biden in 2020, but is now backing Trump. \"Once the assassination attempt happened, it made me feel like they wanted to shut him up for a reason.\"\n\nNearly 90% of voters said they approved of Biden's decision to exit the race, a view shared by Democrats, Republicans and independents alike.\n\nRelated Story: How to Decode Kamala Harris's Foreign Policy\n\nPerhaps as a result, Harris has almost instantly united the party behind her, to a far greater degree than Biden had been able to in the last two years. Nearly 4 in 5 Democrats or voters who lean toward the Democratic Party said they would like to nominate her. In contrast, only 48% of Democrats had said they wanted Biden as the nominee just three weeks ago.\n\nIn a multicandidate race, less than a single percentage point separated Trump and Harris, with Harris at 44% and Trump at 43% after rounding.\n\nIndependent candidate Robert F.

An overwhelming 70% of Democratic voters said they wanted the party to speedily consolidate behind her rather than engage in a more competitive and drawn-out process.\n\nHer swift reassembling of the Democratic coalition appeared to help narrow Trump's significant advantage over Biden of only a few weeks ago. Harris was receiving 93% support from Democrats, the same share that Trump was getting from Republicans.\n\nOverall, Trump leads Harris 48% to 47% among likely voters in a head-to-head match. That is a marked improvement for Democrats when compared with the Times/Siena poll in early July that showed Biden behind by 6 percentage points, in the aftermath of the poor debate performance that eventually drove him from the race.\n\nTrump leads Harris 48% to 46% among registered voters. He had led among registered voters by nine percentage points over Biden in the post-debate poll.\n\nThe survey provides a snapshot of the presidential race in the middle of one of the most volatile and unpredictable periods in modern US history. Democrats suddenly have a new nominee. And, less than two weeks after Trump survived an assassination attempt, his favourability rating rose to the highest level it has ever been in a national New York Times survey.\n\nIn some ways, the poll showed a reset to where the race was before Biden imploded on a debate stage in Atlanta: months of a narrow but steady Trump edge in the national polling averages. But in other ways, the new poll provided intriguing hints at how a Harris candidacy could remake the political coalitions and map that will determine the outcome of the 2024 election.\n\nHarris was faring better among groups that Biden had been the weakest in, especially younger voters and non-white voters. At the same time, some Democrats fear she might not retain the same strengths that Biden has had among older voters, for whom the poll does show some erosion of Democratic support.\n\nThe poll showed Harris garnering about 60% support from voters younger than 30 and Hispanic voters, groups Biden had consistently struggled with. Among voters younger than 45, Harris was ahead by 10 percentage points, less than three weeks after Trump had held a narrow edge with that group over Biden.\n\nBecause the survey was of voters nationwide, the impact of Harris' candidacy in particular battleground states was not immediately clear. But a Democratic candidate with greater appeal to younger and more diverse voters could put renewed focus on the Sun Belt states of Nevada, Arizona and Georgia, which had been threatening to slip off the swing-state map for Biden.\n\nHarris has emerged as the Democratic Party's expected nominee after a tumultuous few weeks. Biden stepped aside on Sunday (Monday NZT), following a month of drawn-out questions about his mental faculties after a poor debate performance at the end of June. In the interim, Trump escaped an assassination attempt, named Senator J.D. Vance as his running mate, and formally accepted his party's nomination at the Republican National Convention.\n\nHarris is on a glide path toward next month's Democratic convention as she seeks to become the first woman, first Black woman and first person of South Asian descent to serve as a US president.\n\n\"Her being president or even being in the running is very important just for history,\" said Summer Nesbitt, a 27-year-old school tutor near Detroit who supports the vice president. But Nesbitt, who is Black, added that she found some of Harris' explicit appeals to Black voters a turnoff. \"I don't think that you have to try to pretend to be more down or be more Black just so you can get the Black vote. Just be yourself.\"\n\nVoters are more tuned into the race. Just before the June debate, 48% of voters said they were paying a lot of attention to the presidential campaign. That figure now stands at 64%, though the interest of independents continues to lag behind that of Democrats and Republicans.\n\nThe national mood remains bleak, but noticeably less so, with 61% seeing the country headed in the wrong direction, which is lower than in recent months.\n\nHarris faces some structural challenges as November approaches. She is the sitting vice president at a time when 75% of voters rated the nation's economic conditions as \"fair\" or \"poor\". And significantly more voters see Trump as a strong leader than those who say the same of Harris.\n\nThe country's view of Harris has also brightened, with her favourable rating rising by 10 percentage points since February. Harris enters the campaign with a favourable rating of 46%, better than Biden's, but still behind Trump's.\n\nViews of all three -- Trump, Biden and Harris -- split dramatically along gender lines. For the most part, men like Trump while women don't. Women like Biden and Harris, while men don't.\n\nTrump's favourable rating ticked up to 48%. This comes not long after the indelible images of him rising to his feet after an assassination attempt at a Pennsylvania rally, pumping his fist in the air as blood streaked across his face, shouting, \"Fight! Fight! Fight!\"\n\n\"Honestly the way he handled it after the fact, the way he pretty much stood up in defiance of what happened, kind of gave me that sense of pride that I hadn't felt when it came to our country in a while,\" said Eddie Otzoy, a 29-year-old contractor in Los Angeles, who had voted for Hillary Clinton in 2016 and Biden in 2020, but is now backing Trump. \"Once the assassination attempt happened, it made me feel like they wanted to shut him up for a reason.\"\n\nNearly 90% of voters said they approved of Biden's decision to exit the race, a view shared by Democrats, Republicans and independents alike.\n\nPerhaps as a result, Harris has almost instantly united the party behind her, to a far greater degree than Biden had been able to in the last two years. Nearly four in five Democrats or voters who lean toward the Democratic Party said they would like to nominate her. In contrast, only 48% of Democrats had said they wanted Biden as the nominee just three weeks ago.\n\nA majority of Democrats said they felt enthusiastic about Harris as the nominee, with only 10% dissatisfied or angry.\n\n\"It would be a larger setback for the Democrats if they try to find someone else to try to fill in,\" said Michael Newman, a 59-year-old contractor in Arlington, Texas, who is supporting Harris. \"She has a pretty good insight on the goals that Biden was working on.\"\n\nBiden's decision not to seek reelection -- \"I revere this office, but I love my country more,\" he said in a national address on Wednesday evening -- has resulted in a sharp spike in his favourability rating. The 7-point jump in his favourable rating after three of the most brutal weeks of his presidency suggested that voter frustration with Biden may have been based not just on how he was governing but the fact that the 81-year-old president was seeking a second term.\n\nBiden's 43% favorability rating was his best showing since 2022.\n\nIn a multicandidate race, less than a single percentage point separated Trump and Harris, with Harris at 44% and Trump at 43% after rounding.\n\nIndependent candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s share of the vote continues to drop, hitting just 5% of likely voters in the new survey. He was the only third-party candidate above 1%.\n\nAmong Harris and Trump's greatest strengths in the poll were that voters saw them as intelligent and having the right temperament to handle the job. Harris gets slightly higher marks for her smarts; 66% of voters say \"intelligent\" describes her well, compared with 59% for Trump.\n\nNeither candidate holds an edge on the ability to unify the country, a sign that perhaps, in this era of deep political polarisation, few believe national unity is even possible.\n\nWritten by: Shane Goldmacher, Ruth Igielnik and Camille Baker", "source": {"uri": "nzherald.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title": "NZ Herald"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage_point", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Percentage point"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_John_F._Kennedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Assassination of John F.

(And by \"prepare,\" I really just mean \"lie, manipulate and espouse bigotry and willful ignorance to a bigoted and willfully ignorant constituency that loves to be lied to and manipulated.\")\n\nBut wouldn't it be wild if Harris won?\n\nHarris has only been a presidential prospect for about a week and already there's at least one poll that has her with a slim lead over Donald Trump. The Reuters/Ipsos poll conducted on Monday and Tuesday has the presumptive Democratic nominee leading Trump 44% to 42%, a difference within the 3-percentage-point margin of error. Reuters noted that \"Harris and Trump were tied at 44% in a July 15-16 poll, and Trump led by one percentage point in a July 1-2 poll, both within the same margin of error.\"\n\nTo be sure, most polls have Trump ahead of Harris, but by slimmer margins than what Trump was leading President Joe Biden by leading up to Biden's announcement that he was stepping aside and endorsing Harris as his replacement. In fact, a new CNN poll has Trump in the lead (49% to 46%), but it also shows Harris is gaining more Trump voters than Trump is gaining Biden voters.\n\nFrom Newsweek:\n\nStill, the poll found that 95 percent of Biden's supporters are continuing to stick with Harris, while she is winning over 5 percent of Trump's former supporters.\n\nTrump is winning over a smaller number of Biden's supporters, according to the poll. Three percent of those who previously backed Biden are now supporting Trump, who retained 92 percent of his past supporters.\n\nHarris is winning 94 percent of Democrats, while Trump is winning 91 percent of Republicans. However, he continues to hold a narrow lead among independent voters (46 percent to 43 percent).\n\nThe poll, conducted from July 22 to 23, surveyed 1,631 registered voters who had previously participated in CNN surveys in April or June. Its margin of error is plus or minus 3 percentage points.\n\nMost polls don't appear to have Harris trailing Trump by more than three percentage points, which is a glaring improvement from the abysmal polling data Biden was facing, which had Trump up by as many as six percentage points. In contrast, Trump leads Harris by two points (47% to 45%) in a Morning Consult poll, and by only one point (46% to 45%) in a NPR/PBS/Marist poll. An Economist/YouGov poll conducted Sunday to Tuesday showed Trump leading Harris 44% to 41%.\n\nAgain, we're only a week in. Wouldn't it be wild if she won? Wouldn't it be the epitome of poetic irony if the MAGA world continued to flood the internet and media with blatantly racist and sexist attacks on Harris and it all backfired, resulting in Trump-humping troglodytes having to watch her ascension to the Oval Office?\n\nIs a Harris victory still a long shot? Sure.

Three percent of those who previously backed Biden are now supporting Trump, who retained 92 percent of his past supporters.\n\nHarris is winning 94 percent of Democrats, while Trump is winning 91 percent of Republicans. However, he continues to hold a narrow lead among independent voters (46 percent to 43 percent).\n\nThe poll, conducted from July 22 to 23, surveyed 1,631 registered voters who had previously participated in CNN surveys in April or June. Its margin of error is plus or minus 3 percentage points.\n\nMost polls don't appear to have Harris trailing Trump by more than 3 percentage points, which is a glaring improvement from the abysmal polling data Biden was facing, which had Trump up by as many as 6 percentage points. In contrast, Trump leads Harris by two points (47% to 45%) in a Morning Consult poll, and by only one point (46% to 45%) in a NPR/PBS/Marist poll. An Economist/YouGov poll conducted Sunday to Tuesday showed Trump leading Harris 44% to 41%.\n\nAgain, we're only a week in. Wouldn't it be wild if she won? Wouldn't it be the epitome of poetic irony if the MAGA world continued to flood the internet and media with blatantly racist and sexist attacks on Harris and it all backfired, resulting in Trump-humping troglodytes having to watch her ascension to the Oval Office?\n\nIs a Harris victory still a long shot? Sure. But this race, at the very least, is getting interesting.\n\nSEE ALSO:\n\nKamala Harris Using Beyonc\u00e9's Song \"Freedom\" As Her Campaign Music Is Giving Best Life Ever\n\nSocial Media Calls Trump A 'Coward' For Trying To Dodge ABC Debate Against Kamala Harris\n\nThe post New Poll Shows Kamala Harris Leading Donald Trump While Others Show Her Narrowing Trump's Lead appeared first on NewsOne.\n\nNew Poll Shows Kamala Harris Leading Donald Trump While Others Show Her Narrowing Trump's Lead was originally published on newsone.com", "source": {"uri": "theurbandaily.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Urban Daily"}, "authors": [{"uri": "zack_linly@theurbandaily.com", "name": "Zack Linly", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrimination", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Discrimination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage_point", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Percentage point"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ipsos", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ipsos"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Washington_Post", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Washington Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newsweek", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Newsweek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_America_Great_Again", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Make America Great Again"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_voter", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Independent voter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oval_Office", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oval Office"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PBS", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "PBS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouGov", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "YouGov"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NPR", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NPR"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beyonc\u00e9", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Beyonc\u00e9"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Broadcasting_Company", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American Broadcasting Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sexism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Economist", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Economist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Racism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morning_Consult", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Morning Consult"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/General_Merchandise/O", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/General Merchandise/O", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://newsone.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/22/2024/07/17219231223017.jpg?strip=all&quality=80&w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9763361", "eventUri": "eng-9763361", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-15", "dateEnd": "2024-07-16", "textStart": 955, "textEnd": 965}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-01", "dateEnd": "2024-07-02", "textStart": 1015, "textEnd": 1023}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-22", "dateEnd": "2024-07-23", "textStart": 2056, "textEnd": 2069}], "sentiment": 0.2156862745098038, "wgt": 181, "relevance": 1}

That appears to be happening -- Biden wasted no time throwing his support behind Harris on Sunday and was followed by a wave of other prominent Democrats, including several governors who had been considered strong contenders for the nomination themselves.\n\nThe New York Times reported that Harris' popularity among Democrats is even with Trump's popularity among Republicans -- around 93%.\n\nDemocratic National Convention delegates are expected to formally vote to make Harris their nominee by Aug. 7. The DNC is scheduled for Aug. 19 to 22 in Chicago.\n\nShe has yet to announce a running mate.\n\nThe Trump campaign issued a memo earlier this week in which its pollster Tony Fabrizio downplayed an expected bump in the polls for Harris, dubbing it the \"Harris honeymoon.\" Fabrizio said in the memo that he expects Trump to sail ahead once the race \"settles back down.\"", "source": {"uri": "huffpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "HuffPost"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sara_boboltz@huffpost.com", "name": "Sara Boboltz", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2020_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2020 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siena_College", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Siena College"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_National_Committee", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democratic National Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_National_Convention", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democratic National Convention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opinion_poll", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Opinion poll"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Politics", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online_Issues_Polls", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online Issues Polls", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/66a29d9a220000b004ff0824.jpeg?cache=FKe6TEVj5k&ops=1200_630", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9763361", "eventUri": "eng-9763361", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-22", "dateEnd": "2024-07-24", "textStart": 719, "textEnd": 737}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-19", "dateEnd": "2024-08-22", "textStart": 1869, "textEnd": 1882}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-27", "textStart": 1167, "textEnd": 1174}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-07", "textStart": 1836, "textEnd": 1842}], "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 178, "relevance": 1}

Harris performs better than Biden in all five states: Michigan, Pennsylvania, Arizona and Georgia, in addition to Wisconsin.\n\nMost polls taken prior to Biden ending his bid found the president and Harris performing roughly the same against Trump, who had slightly expanded his narrow lead over Biden in the wake of Biden's disastrous June debate performance. A Forbes/HarrisX poll conducted July 19-21 showed Trump leading both Biden and Harris by six points, a two-point jump in his lead over Harris and a four-point increase in his lead over Biden since the groups' previous poll conducted July 13-15. A Yahoo/YouGov poll conducted July 19-22 found Trump and Harris tied in a head-to-head matchup, and Harris trailing by two points in a six-way race with third-party candidates on the ballot. A CBS News/YouGov poll conducted last week showed Trump leading Harris by three points and Biden by five. An Economist/YouGov poll conducted July 13-16 found Biden would lose to Trump 41% to 43%, while Harris would perform slightly worse, losing to Trump 39% to 44%.\n\n1.9.

Prior to dropping out, Biden trailed Trump by 3.1 points in the RealClearPolitics average, a 1.6-point jump since the debate. Biden immediately endorsed Harris and she announced plans to seek the nomination. The party has quickly coalesced around her, with all Democratic governors and the majority of Democrats in Congress backing her. On Monday, she effectively clinched the Democratic nomination as more than half of all delegates have announced plans to formally vote to nominate her -- something the party is expected to do in the first week of August.\n\nTrump's Lead Over Biden And Harris Jumped After RNC, HarrisX/Forbes Poll Finds (Forbes)", "source": {"uri": "forbes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Forbes"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouGov", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "YouGov"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisconsin", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wisconsin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wisconsin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emerson_College", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Emerson College"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_state", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Swing state"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ipsos", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ipsos"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS_News", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "CBS News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RealClearPolitics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "RealClearPolitics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forbes", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Forbes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Economist", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Economist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morning_Consult", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Morning Consult"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_National_Committee", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Republican National Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/66a0023f79933504cab0fd65/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=600&width=1200&fit=bounds", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9763361", "eventUri": "eng-9763361", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-19", "dateEnd": "2024-07-21", "textStart": 785, "textEnd": 795}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-13", "dateEnd": "2024-07-15", "textStart": 986, "textEnd": 996}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-19", "dateEnd": "2024-07-22", "textStart": 1028, "textEnd": 1038}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-13", "dateEnd": "2024-07-16", "textStart": 1330, "textEnd": 1340}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-27", "textStart": 1816, "textEnd": 1823, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": -0.1058823529411764, "wgt": 178, "relevance": 1}

Which is to say, not much at all.\n\nIn the first significant battleground-state poll series since Joe Biden withdrew, Emerson College finds Donald Trump still up in Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, and Pennsylvania. Kamala Harris does better than Biden was doing in these states, but her entry has not changed the trajectory anywhere except possibly in Wisconsin ... where she only ties Trump:\n\nNew Emerson College Polling/The Hill polling in five swing states finds Vice President Kamala Harris trailing former President Donald Trump in four states, and tied in Wisconsin. In Arizona, 49% support Trump and 44% support Harris. In Georgia, 48% support Trump and 46% Harris. In Michigan, 46% support Trump and 45% Harris. In Pennsylvania, 48% support Trump and 46% Harris. In Wisconsin, 47% support Harris and Trump respectively.\n\nSupport for Harris surpassed Biden's support from earlier this month in all five states; in Arizona, by four points (Biden's 40% to Harris' 44%), Georgia by five points (41% to 46%), Michigan by three points (42% to 45%), Pennsylvania by three points (43% to 46%), and Wisconsin by four points (43% to 47%).\n\nThat's at least an improvement, but ... it's not much, and it's clearly not enough. It only resets the race to the post-State of the Union status quo:\n\n\"Harris has recovered a portion of the vote for the Democrats on the presidential ticket since the fallout after the June 27 debate,\" Spencer Kimball, executive director of Emerson College Polling, said. \"Harris' numbers now reflect similar support levels to those of Biden back in March.\"\n\nHarris might not be the only one improving. RCP doesn't have aggregation yet on battleground polling for Trump v Harris, but their Trump v Biden aggregation numbers are still up. In each of these states, Trump's Emerson numbers are the same or better in each state than the RCP aggregate averages against Biden. Harris isn't taking votes away from Trump, but just picking up voters that left Biden -- and may not be all that enthusiastic about Harris once she has to directly compete on the campaign trail.\n\nThat's the key issue when viewing these polls. Harris is too well known to be a cipher to voters, so the question is whether she can improve on her dreadful favorability ratings by direct engagement. Newsmax suggests that Harris may be getting a honeymoon effect in these surveys conducted on Monday and Tuesday this week, but that's not a good sign either. Harris has big problems with campaigning on her own, as she proved in 2019, and even the Biden White House kept her under wraps after June 2021 after a series of media fumbles and gaffes. This honeymoon period is likely measuring Peak Kamala, which is to say Untested Kamala.\n\nNewsmax also picks up on another bad sign in this poll. Just like Biden, Harris underperforms other Democrats on the same ballots, in most cases significantly:\n\nIn Arizona, Democrat Ruben Gallego leads Republican Kari Lake 46% to 42%.\n\nIn Michigan, Democrat Elissa Slotkin leads Republican Mike Rogers 45% to 41%.\n\nIn Pennsylvania, Democrat Sen. Bob Casey leads Republican David McCormick 48% to 44%.\n\nIn Wisconsin, Democrat Sen. Tammy Baldwin leads Republican Eric Hovde 49% to 43%.\n\nSo Harris has the same problem that Biden has -- she underperforms other Democrats. Ostensibly, that's what created the Dump Biden panic and had Democrats gently suggest that Biden \"pass the torch.\" And this is in the honeymoon phase of Harris' campaign.\n\nDemocrats have bet big on The Anointment, and they clearly think that Harris can improve her standing by going out to engage the national American electorate. They seem to forget that Harris has done that since 2019, and that this has been the result:\n\nOver the past week alone, six out of seven pollsters have Harris' favorability in negative double digits. The only exception is the most recent NPR/Marist poll that found it at -2. The current RCP aggregate average is -12.3, all from polls that took place when it became fairly obvious that Biden would have to exit the race and that Harris would be the most likely replacement. That hasn't improved her standing with voters at all. And unless voters start seeing a very different Kamala Harris, Democrats won't see a different election than what they had before they chased Biden out of the race.", "source": {"uri": "hotair.com",

The Democrats are EXCITED again! They're ENTHUSIASTIC about Vice President Kamala Harris running for president. They're EXUBERANT about their candidate.\n\nWhen the new Reuters poll dropped showing Harris beating Donald Trump 44-42%, many Democrats nearly swooned. Harris is the answer to Democrat's prayers (if any of them pray anymore).\n\nI hate to throw cold water on the Democrats' premature victory celebration, but there's a race that still needs to be run. And Harris is still behind Donald Trump in swing states that the Democratic Party keeps saying she absolutely, positively has to win in order to capture the presidency.\n\nThe Emerson College swing state poll came out today, and despite all the enthusiasm, excitement, and exuberance, Donald Trump still leads or is tied in all of them.\n\nIn Arizona, 49% support Trump and 44% support Harris. In Georgia, 48% support Trump and 46% Harris. In Michigan, 46% support Trump and 45% Harris. In Pennsylvania, 48% support Trump and 46% Harris. In Wisconsin, 47% support Harris and Trump respectively.\n\nHarris is doing better than Biden compared to the previous Emerson swing state poll. But how long will this first blush of excitement for Harris last? Allow the Trump campaign and the Republicans to show America just who Harris is and what she wants for America, and Harris's numbers will begin to slip, especially in Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania.\n\nIf Trump can win any one of those states, Biden's path to 270 electoral votes becomes much more difficult. Victory by Trump in two of those states and Harris can pack her bags for California.\n\n\"Harris has recovered a portion of the vote for the Democrats on the presidential ticket since the fallout after the June 27 debate,\" said Spencer Kimball, executive director of Emerson College Polling. \"Harris's numbers now reflect similar support levels to those of Biden back in March.\"\n\nNaturally, the Biden campaign celebrated: \"We're close!\"\n\n\"With a popular message, a strong record on the issues that matter most to swing voters, multiple pathways to 270 electoral voters, and unprecedented enthusiasm on her side, the Vice President is in a strong position to take on Donald Trump and win in 104 days,\" Jen O'Malley Dillon, chair of the Harris campaign, wrote in a memo Wednesday.\n\nWe're not going to hear the word \"inflation\" from Harris on the stump. Nor are we going to hear the word \"border.\" We are going to hear a lot about \"abortion,\" which about 40% of voters will see as a negative. O'Malley Dillon failed to mention that the \"multiple pathways to 270 electoral votes\" are only possible if Harris wins Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania.\n\nOne wildcard in the polls will be Harris's choice of vice president. The choice of a swing state governor or senator might be important. In a close election, a vice president who brings a swing state along with them would be invaluable.\n\nUSA Today:\n\nHarris' electoral chances could also sway based on her choice in running mate. The Harris campaign has said little about who is top contender, but the rumored roster includes rising stars like North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper and Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly.\n\nSwing state constituents seem to prefer one of their own: 36% of Arizona voters want Kelly for the job; 27% of Michiganders would like to see their governor, Gretchen Whitmer; and 40% of Pennsylvania voters prefer their governor, Josh Shapiro, according to the recent poll.\n\nUltimately, Harris will be judged by her record as both a vice president and presidential candidate in 2020. Trump should like his odds if that's the case.", "source": {"uri": "pjmedia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "PJ Media"}, "authors": [{"uri": "rick_moran@pjmedia.com", "name": "Rick Moran", "type":

She may be helped by a so-called \"honeymoon\" period amid positive media coverage and relief by some voters over Biden stepping aside for a younger, more energetic candidate.\n\nEven the Trump campaign is acknowledging that it's losing ground.\n\n\"Given what has happened over the past couple of days and her impending VP choice, there is no question that Harris will get her bump earlier than the Democratic Convention,\" Trump pollster Tony Fabrizio wrote in a memo this week that was shared with reporters. \"And that bump is likely to start showing itself over the next few days and will last a while until the race settles back down.\"", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morning_Consult", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Morning Consult"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Electoral_College", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Electoral College"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisconsin", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wisconsin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wisconsin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emerson_College", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Emerson College"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ipsos", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ipsos"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hill_(newspaper)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Hill (newspaper)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_state", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Swing state"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_National_Convention", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democratic National Convention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opinion_poll", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Opinion poll"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Tile_Games/Spectrangle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Tile Games/Spectrangle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/Xz2lP2Gsj1dqfDPReyCSwQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/salon_articles_879/ddaac19a0ec71fa89a9feb7b3e733f8a", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9763361", "eventUri": "eng-9763361", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1607843137254903, "wgt": 173, "relevance": 1}

The 46% to 48% difference is slightly better for Harris compared to how Biden polled on average - three percentage points behind the Republican presidential nominee, 47% to 44%.\n\nA New York Times/Siena College poll conducted in the battleground state of Pennsylvania from July 9-11, before Biden dropped out and before the assassination attempt on Trump at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, showed Harris was only behind by one percentage point in a hypothetical matchup against Trump.\n\nIn Virginia, Harris had a five percentage point lead, compared to Biden only polling ahead of Trump in the same state by a razor-thin margin, according to the Times.

About two in 10 Democrats do not believe she would, and another two in 10 say they do not know enough to say.\n\nCLICK TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nResults of a CNN poll conducted by SSRS and released on July 2 indicated that three-quarters of voters say the Democratic Party would have a better chance of keeping the White House with someone else other than Biden at the top of the party's ticket.

But the vice president has the closed the gap between the Democratic and GOP ticket, since President Joe Biden dropped his reelection bid and made way for Harris' to run instead.\n\nTrump's biggest lead was in Arizona, five points above Harris. He was ahead of her by two points in Georgia and Pennsylvania, and by one point in Michigan. In Wisconsin, the candidates were tied.\n\nCompared to another Emerson College poll earlier this month, the former president led Biden by about twofold in those same states. Arizona was again his best state, ahead of Biden 46% to 36%, and in Wisconsin, 46% of voters supported Trump compared to 43% support for Biden.\n\nThe president said it was time to pass the torch to a new generation of leaders in an Oval Office address Wednesday evening, following a tumultuous June debate and rising public doubts from Democratic lawmakers, donors and voters.\n\nHis speech came days after Biden first announced his decision to drop out of the race. Harris quickly followed with her own campaign, receiving the president's endorsement. So far, she has seen record-breaking fundraising and a swell in enthusiasm, particularly from young voters and other crucial voting blocs.\n\n\"Harris has recovered a portion of the vote for the Democrats on the presidential ticket since the fallout after the June 27 debate,\" said Spencer Kimball, executive director of Emerson College Polling. \"Harris' numbers now reflect similar support levels to those of Biden back in March.\"\n\nHer campaign outlined a \"path to victory\" that included gaining support in battleground states.\n\n\"With a popular message, a strong record on the issues that matter most to swing voters, multiple pathways to 270 electoral voters, and unprecedented enthusiasm on her side, the Vice President is in a strong position to take on Donald Trump and win in 104 days,\" Jen O'Malley Dillon, chair of the Harris campaign, wrote in a memo Wednesday.\n\nHarris' electoral chances could also sway based on her choice in running mate. The Harris campaign has said little about who is top contender, but the rumored roster includes rising stars like North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper and Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly.\n\nHarris' VP options: From Josh Shapiro to Mark Kelly, sizing up the slate's pros and cons\n\nSwing state constituents seem to prefer one of their own: 36% of Arizona voters want Kelly

The 46% to 48% difference is slightly better for Harris compared to how Biden polled on average - three percentage points behind the Republican presidential nominee, 47% to 44%.\n\nA New York Times/Siena College poll conducted in the battleground state of Pennsylvania from July 9-11, before Biden dropped out and before the assassination attempt on Trump at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, showed Harris was only behind by one percentage point in a hypothetical matchup against Trump.\n\nIn Virginia, Harris had a five percentage point lead, compared to Biden only polling ahead of Trump in the same state by a razor-thin margin, according to the Times. Harris polled slightly better than Biden in both states among Black voters, younger voters and women.\n\nHARRIS OUTPERFORMS BIDEN IN 2024 SHOWDOWN WITH TRUMP: POLL\n\nAccording to a Washington Post-ABC News-Ipsos poll conducted July 5-9, 70% of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents indicated that they would be \"satisfied\" if Biden withdrew from the race and Harris was nominated to run as the 2024 Democratic presidential candidate.\n\nIn an open-ended question, that poll showed 29% of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents named Harris as their pick for the Democratic nomination if Biden bowed out.\n\nNEW POLL REVEALS WHAT DEMOCRATS THINK OF HARRIS AS PRESIDENT\n\nSeven percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents referenced California Gov. Gavin Newsom, while 4% said they wanted former first lady Michelle Obama as Biden's replacement. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg and Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer each had 3% of support, though half of Democrats did not specify an alternative candidate.\n\nAs pressure mounted from Democrat lawmakers and donors for Biden to step aside, a poll from the AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research released last week found that about six in 10 Democrats believe that Harris would do a good job as president herself. About two in 10 Democrats do not believe she would, and another two in 10 say they do not know enough to say.\n\nCLICK TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nResults of a CNN poll conducted by SSRS and released on July 2 indicated that three-quarters of voters say the Democratic Party would have a better chance of keeping the White House with someone else other than Biden at the top of the party's ticket. In a hypothetical match-up, 47% of registered voters supported Trump compared to 45% for Harris, a difference that fell within the survey's margin of error.\n\nFox News' Chris Pandolfo contributed to this report.", "source": {"uri": "foxnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fox News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "danielle_wallace@foxnews.com", "name": "Danielle Wallace", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage_point", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Percentage point"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2020_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2020 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_&_Friends", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fox & Friends"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siena_College", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Siena College"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_John_F._Kennedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assassination of John F.

(Brendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nDemocratic Party elites have all but coronated Vice President Kamala Harris as their new presidential nominee, after pushing President Joe Biden out of his own reelection campaign. But even so-called mainstream media outlets warn that she may not succeed against former President Donald Trump.\n\nA recent New York Times analysis piece ranked Harris as the least likely to beat Trump out of a slate of 10 Democratic stars and stalwarts.\n\nPennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro was rated as the most likely Democrat candidate to beat Trump, followed by Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona, Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, and Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer.\n\nHarris, meanwhile, was rated as the riskiest choice to oppose Trump and a less exciting candidate for the Democratic base than Whitmer, Kelly, Shapiro, or Sen. Raphael Warnock of Georgia.\n\nEight NYT writers and contributors were asked to assess the potential nominees. Left-wing journalist Ross Barkan noted that Harris has \"a feeble electoral track record -- she struggled badly in 2020 and barely, before then, won her first attorney general race in California.\" But he observed that the backing of a unified Democratic Party may give Harris a potential boost in voter enthusiasm.\n\nEx-Republican Josh Barro wrote that Harris \"has no demonstrated appeal to swing voters, and she cannot run away from the Biden-Harris record on inflation and immigration. Her best arguments are that she's not old and she's not Trump.\" However, Barro anticipated that those two qualities may appeal to Democratic voters.\n\nRoss Douthat, a contributing editor at National Review, summarized Harris by saying: \"A mediocre politician from a deep-blue state with low national approval ratings, she may find a way to win, but she would be nobody's top choice were she not the top choice of the president. Relief at Biden's exit will generate a lot of professed enthusiasm, but it will be fake.\"\n\nPamela Paul, former editor of The New York Times Book Review, called Harris \"one of the weakest elements of [Biden's] administration\" and \"a fundamentally weak candidate.\"\n\n\"She fizzled out early in her first presidential run and floundered in the vice presidency,\" Paul said.\n\nA YouGov poll published Sunday found that Harris' popularity as a nominee is low, even within her own party. Overall, a mere 37% of American voters responded that Harris should be the Democratic Party's nominee.\n\nAmong Democrats, 60% said they supported Harris as their nominee, with a total of 40% either opposed to her or unsure of her. A paltry 30% of independent voters said they approved of Harris as the Democratic Party's nominee, while 36% wanted \"someone else,\" and 34% were \"not sure.\"\n\nNumerous other polls have shown that, even bolstered by what Trump team pollster Tony Fabrizio called the \"Harris Honeymoon\" polling bump, the vice president is trailing behind the Republican nominee.\n\nA Morning Consult survey showed Trump leading Harris by two percentage points (47% to 45%) nationally. A Quinnipiac poll found similar numbers, with Trump leading Harris 49% to 47%. However, Trump's lead over Harris is even more commanding among independent voters: 55% to 41%.\n\nEven among young voters (ages 18 to 34), Trump leads Harris by nearly 20 points, according to Quinnipiac. This despite the vice president's inundating the internet with TikTok and Instagram videos of herself dancing at political events in what Axios called an effort to appeal to Gen Z voters.\n\nPrior to Biden's abandoning the presidential race, a Harris X poll found that Trump had a nine-point lead over Harris (50% to 41%) in a then-hypothetical head-to-head contest.\n\nFurthermore, polls indicate that Harris will have particular difficulty in battleground states. Prior to Biden's dropping out of the race, but clearly anticipating the event, Emerson College asked swing state voters whether Harris \"has earned the right to be the next Democratic nominee for president.\"\n\nA clear majority of voters responded \"no\" in Arizona (58%), Georgia (58.6%), Michigan (57.3%), Nevada (54.1%), North Carolina (56.9%), Pennsylvania (56.7%), and Wisconsin (58.2%).\n\nAnother Emerson College survey found that while Trump polled 46% to 43% against Biden nationally, he polled 49% to 43% against Harris in a then-hypothetical matchup.\n\nThe Democratic political action committee Clean and Prosperous America also found in a series of polls that Trump is leading Harris across swing states. The former president leads the vice president by six points (46% to 40%) in Arizona, five points (46% to 41%) in Michigan, two points (45% to 43%) in Pennsylvania, and four points (48% to 44%) in North Carolina.\n\nAccording to the Washington Examiner, Keystone State Democrats are disappointed with Harris as the party's likely nominee. Sen. John Fetterman, D-Pa., criticized party elites for betraying Biden, even as Shapiro, the governor, offered Harris his full support and endorsement.\n\nThe Washington Examiner reported that T.J. Rooney, former chairman of the Pennsylvania Democratic Party, said that \"if you thought Hillary Clinton had problems connecting with the all-important smaller Pennsylvania counties in 2016 -- the ones such as Erie that ultimately cost her the election -- Harris, because of her views on fossil fuels, will struggle even more so.\"\n\nRooney explained that Harris's \"worldview,\" especially her position on fracking, will negatively affect her chances in the crucial battleground state. Keystone College political science professor Jeff Brauer said that with Harris replacing Biden at the top of the ticket, \"the chances for Democrats in this all-critical state certainly diminish.\" He explained that Harris's policies are \"too liberal\" and that if she is the nominee, then Pennsylvania will be an even more difficult win for Democrats.\n\nAccording to The Hill, swing state Democrats are also concerned that Harris' demonstrably liberal policies could hurt Democratic candidates in contentious states and districts.\n\n\"Democratic senators had worried that lack of voter enthusiasm for Biden would hurt Democratic turnout in Senate battleground states,\" The Hill wrote. \"Democrats don't know for sure whether Harris as their nominee for president will drive minority and young voters to the polls in significantly higher numbers than Biden would have in November.\"\n\nThe Trump campaign has already started hammering Harris on her left-wing policies and positions. A recent spate of ads labels the vice president as \"Weak. Failed. Dangerously liberal.\" Particular emphasis is laid on Harris's failure to secure the nation's southern border after being named Biden's \"border czar\" in 2021.\n\n\"I think she is going to be, hopefully, frankly for this country, I think similar things are going to happen to her that happened to her before,\" Trump told reporters Tuesday during a conference call, referring to Harris' failed attempt to secure the Democratic Party's presidential nomination in 2019.\n\n\"So, if she campaigns that way now, and this is only going to be tougher -- although she does have a lot of support from the fake news, there's no question about that -- but if she campaigns the way she campaigned then, I suspect she won't be too tough,\" Trump said.\n\nThe former president also observed that Harris is \"the same as Biden but much more radical.\"\n\n\"This country doesn't want a radical left person to destroy it,\" Trump said. \"She's far more open borders than he is. She wants things that nobody wants. ... Take a look at San Francisco now compared to before she became the district attorney, and you see what she'll do to our country.\"\n\nTrump added: \"I think she'll be easier than Biden because he was slightly more mainstream, but not by much.\"", "source": {"uri": "dailysignal.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Daily Signal"}, "authors": [{"uri": "s_a_mccarthy@dailysignal.com", "name": "S.A.

(Samuel Corum/Getty Images)\n\nPolls taken after President Joe Biden dropped out of the race on Sunday show that Vice President Kamala Harris has made up much of the ground lost in the past few disastrous weeks for Democrats, excitement over her candidacy resulting in her now pulling roughly even or better against former President Donald Trump in national and swing-state surveys.\n\nA poll by Morning Consult, released Thursday, gives Harris a 1-point lead over Trump, compared to Biden's 4-point deficit in the last Morning Consult survey, taken when president was still in the race.\n\nThanks to the Electoral College, November's election will be decided by a number of swing states along the Rust and Sun Belts where Harris, while still generally trailing Trump, has made a significant advance from Biden's collapsing position.\n\nA poll conducted by Emerson College and The Hill, released Thursday, shows Trump leading Harris by 5 points in Arizona (49-44), 2 points in Georgia (48-46), 1 point in Michigan (46-45), and 2 points in Pennsylvania (48-46); the two candidates tied in Wisconsin (47-47). That a significant improvement for Democrats, with Harris outperforming Biden by 5 points in Georgia, 4 points in Arizona and Wisconsin, and 3 points in Michigan and Pennsylvania.\n\nA Reuters/Ipsos poll released earlier this week, meanwhile, found that Harris enjoys a 2-point lead over Trump, nationally, a marked improvement from Biden, who was 2 points under, although both were within the survey's margin of error. The poll found that most voters believe that Harris is \"mentally sharp,\" a concern that had hovered over Biden for years and then was vastly amplified following his debate with Trump in June.\n\nHarris may have more work to do, but the trends are pointing in the right direction. She may be helped by a so-called \"honeymoon\" period amid positive media coverage and relief by some voters over Biden stepping aside for a younger, more energetic candidate.\n\nEven the Trump campaign is acknowledging that its losing ground.\n\n\"Given what has happened over the past couple of days and her impending VP choice, there is no question that Harris will get her bump earlier than the Democratic Convention,\" Trump pollster Tony Fabrizio wrote in a memo this week that was shared with reporters. \"And that bump is likely to start showing itself over the next few days and will last a while until the race settles back down.\"", "source": {"uri": "salon.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Salon.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro (D) was rated as the most likely candidate to beat Trump, followed by Senator Mark Kelly (D-Ariz.), Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear (D), and Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer (D). Harris, meanwhile, was rated as the riskiest choice to oppose Trump and a less exciting candidate for the Democratic base than Whitmer, Kelly, Shapiro, or Georgia Senator Raphael Warnock (D).\n\nEight NYT writers and contributors were asked to assess the potential nominees. Left-wing journalist Ross Barkan noted that Harris has \"a feeble electoral track record -- she struggled badly in 2020 and barely, before then, won her first attorney general race in California,\" but he observed that the backing of a unified Democratic Party may give her a potential boost in voter enthusiasm. Ex-Republican Josh Barro wrote that Harris \"has no demonstrated appeal to swing voters, and she cannot run away from the Biden-Harris record on inflation and immigration. Her best arguments are that she's not old and she's not Trump.\" However, he anticipated that those two qualities may appeal to Democratic voters.\n\nRoss Douthat, a contributing editor at National Review, summarized Harris by saying, \"A mediocre politician from a deep-blue state with low national approval ratings, she may find a way to win, but she would be nobody's top choice were she not the top choice of the president. Relief at Biden's exit will generate a lot of professed enthusiasm, but it will be fake.\" Former New York Times Book Review Editor Pamela Paul called Harris \"one of the weakest elements of [Biden's] administration\" and \"a fundamentally weak candidate. She fizzled out early in her first presidential run and floundered in the vice presidency.\"\n\nSUPPORT LIFENEWS! If you want to help fight abortion, please donate to LifeNews.com!\n\nA YouGov poll published on Sunday found that Harris's popularity as a nominee is low, even within her own party. Overall, a mere 37% of American voters responded that Harris should be the Democratic Party's nominee. Among Democrats, 60% supported Harris as their nominee, with a total of 40% either opposed to her or unsure of her. A paltry 30% of Independent voters approved of Harris as the Democratic Party's nominee, while 36% wanted \"someone else,\" and 34% were \"not sure.\"\n\nNumerous other polls have shown that, even bolstered by what Trump team pollster Tony Fabrizio called the \"Harris Honeymoon\" polling bump, the vice president is trailing behind the Republican nominee. A Morning Consult survey showed Trump leading Harris by two points (47% to 45%) nationally. A Quinnipiac poll found similar numbers, with Trump leading Harris 49% to 47%. However, Trump's lead over Harris is even more commanding among Independent voters: 55% to 41%. Even among young voters (aged 18 to 34), Trump leads Harris by nearly 20 points, according to Quinnipiac. This despite the vice president inundating the internet with TikTok and Instagram videos of herself dancing at political events in what Axios called an effort to appeal to Gen Z voters. Prior to Biden abandoning the presidential race, a HarrisX poll found that Trump had a nine-point lead over Harris (50% to 41%) in a then-hypothetical head-to-head contest.\n\nFurthermore, polls indicate that Harris will have particular difficulty in battleground states. Prior to Biden dropping out of the race, but clearly anticipating the event, Emerson College asked swing state voters whether or not Harris \"has earned the right to be the next Democratic nominee for president.\" A clear majority of voters responded \"no\" in Arizona (58%), Georgia (58.6%), Michigan (57.3%), Nevada (54.1%), North Carolina (56.9%), Pennsylvania (56.7%), and Wisconsin (58.2%). Another Emerson College survey found that while Trump polled 46% to 43% against Biden nationally, he polled 49% to 43% against Harris in a then-hypothetical matchup.\n\nThe Democratic political action committee (PAC) Clean and Prosperous America also found in a series of polls that Trump is leading Harris across swing states. The former president leads the vice president by six points (46% to 40%) in Arizona, by five points (46% to 41%) in Michigan, by two points (45% to 43%) in Pennsylvania, and by four points (48% to 44%) in North Carolina.\n\nAccording to the Washington Examiner, Keystone State Democrats are disappointed with Harris as the party's likely nominee. Senator John Fetterman (D-Pa.) criticized party elites for betraying Biden, even while Governor Shapiro offered Harris his full support and endorsement. The Washington Examiner reported that former Pennsylvania Democratic Party Chairman T.J. Rooney said that \"if you thought Hillary Clinton had problems connecting with the all-important smaller Pennsylvania counties in 2016 -- the ones such as Erie that ultimately cost her the election -- Harris, because of her views on fossil fuels, will struggle even more so.\"\n\nRooney explained that Harris's \"worldview,\" especially her position on fracking, will negatively impact her chances in the crucial battleground state. Keystone College political science professor Jeff Brauer said that with Harris replacing Biden at the top of the ticket, \"the chances for Democrats in this all-critical state certainly diminish.\" He explained that Harris's policies are \"too liberal\" and that if she is named nominee, then Pennsylvania will be an even more difficult win for Democrats.\n\nAccording to The Hill, swing state Democrats are also concerned that Harris's demonstrably liberal policies could hurt Democratic candidates in contentious states and districts. \"Democratic senators had worried that lack of voter enthusiasm for Biden would hurt Democratic turnout in Senate battleground states,\" it wrote. \"Democrats don't know for sure whether Harris as their nominee for president will drive minority and young voters to the polls in significantly higher numbers than Biden would have in November.\"\n\nThe Trump campaign has already started hammering Harris on her left-wing policies and positions. A recent spate of ads labels the vice president \"Weak. Failed. Dangerously liberal.\" Particular emphasis is laid on Harris's failure to secure the nation's southern border after being named Biden's \"border czar\" in 2021. \"I think she is going to be, hopefully, frankly for this country, I think similar things are going to happen to her that happened to her before,\" Trump told reporters during a Tuesday conference call, referring to Harris's failed attempt to secure the Democratic Party's presidential nomination in 2019. \"So, if she campaigns that way now, and this is only going to be tougher -- although she does have a lot of support from the fake news, there's no question about that -- but if she campaigns the way she campaigned then, I suspect she won't be too tough.\"\n\nThe former president also observed that Harris is \"the same as Biden but much more radical.\" He continued, \"This country doesn't want a radical left person to destroy it. She's far more open borders than he is. She wants things that nobody wants. ... Take a look at San Francisco now compared to before she became the district attorney, and you see what she'll do to our country.\" Trump concluded, \"I think she'll be easier than Biden because he was slightly more mainstream but not by much.\"", "source": {"uri": "lifenews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Life News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "steven_ertelt@lifenews.com", "name": "Steven Ertelt",

It is a noticeable improvement from when Biden trailed Trump by 6 percentage points during the July New York Times/Siena College poll when the president had a disastrous debate performance in late June.\n\nAmong registered voters, Trump beats Harris by 48% to 46%, which also falls within the poll's margin of error. Biden trailed Trump by 9 percentage points among registered voters after the debate, which gave credence to Democratic lawmakers who began publicly calling for Biden to end his campaign.\n\nSince Biden announced he was no longer running for president, Harris has quickly galvanized support among Democrats behind her campaign. The vice president has 3,284 delegates who have pledged to support her, far more than the 1,976 delegates needed to secure the nomination, according to an Associated Press survey, and has amassed more than $126 million in fundraising.\n\nJust 14% of those surveyed said they wanted another candidate for the Democratic ticket, and the overwhelming majority, 70%, said they wanted the party to coalesce around Harris. The support is another example of the high-energy momentum she has gained since Biden, 81, dropped out.\n\nThe majority of participants, 65%, said they strongly approved of Biden exiting the race and another 22% said they somewhat approved of Biden's decision. Harris, 59, is a generation younger than Trump, 78, helping her to nullify GOP attacks that Biden was too old to serve another four years in the White House.\n\nHer relative youthfulness and her campaign's ability to lean into social media memes have given the Democratic Party new hope that they have a fighting chance against Trump in the November election. Harris polls at 60% support among voters under 30 and at 60% with Hispanic voters, a key constituency in battleground states that will determine the election. Before the June debate, only 48% of voters paid much attention to the election. Now that figure has risen to 64%.\n\nThe party will meet at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago next month, but before then, it will hold a virtual roll call before Aug. 7 to comply with state ballot certification deadlines. Barring any unforeseen surprises, Harris is likely to have secured the nomination and announced her vice presidential pick.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nBut the poll did have a few warning signs for Harris. Her favorability has risen from 36% in February to 46% in July, which is higher than Biden at 43% but behind Trump at 48%.

She still trails Donald Trump in each state, but she's now within just a few percentage points -- ground she has a chance of making up over the next 100-plus days until the general election.\n\nThe key bit is her marked improvement over Joe Biden. The Harris campaign didn't unveil its first ad until Thursday, after the Emerson poll was taken, meaning the numbers are virtually unaffected by anything she has done since taking the wheel.\n\nHer entrance alone has given Democrats a boost in each of those states over Emerson's poll taken earlier in July. Her numbers were up over Biden's by four percentage points in Wisconsin and Arizona, three percentage points in Pennsylvania and Michigan, and five percentage points in Georgia. Younger voters in particular were among her biggest gains.\n\nThe result comes the same day a Morning Consult poll showed Harris narrowly ahead of Trump with voters nationally, and a New York Times/Siena College poll showed Harris cutting the Democrats' national polling deficit down from six percentage points earlier this month to just one percentage point today.\n\nThe Republican nominee has seen his momentum stall in the immediate wake of the Trumpified Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, where he spent four days boosting his profile. Harris, meanwhile, has seen a fundraising surge to the tune of $126 million in four days and watched as her party has lined up behind her rather than begin a painful open primary process.\n\nThe sudden shift in the race's dynamic has resulted in Trump crying foul and complaining in Truth Social posts that his party wasted millions of dollars running against Joe Biden before Democrats held their own nominating convention. Harris will be crowned her party's nominee, at least ceremoniously, at the Democrats' convention in August.\n\nHer first ad released on Thursday leaned heavily into the concept of freedom -- economic freedom, safety from gun violence, as well as abortion rights and LGBTQ+ rights. It was also set to a Beyonce soundtrack, signalling the energy of her campaign in the wake of Biden's decision on Sunday to finally heed calls urging him to step aside.\n\nA Trump campaign spokeperson pointed to the former president's continued lead in each of the five swing states in a polling memo sent to reporters on Monday, prior to the release of the latest Emerson poll (which was taken on Monday and Tuesday).\n\n\"Even if Democrat Party insiders and donors are able to successfully annoint disgraced border czar Kamala Harris as the new nominee -- disenfranchising millions of Democrat primary voters in the process -- it won't save them. Democrats can't name a single state where Kamala Harris would perform better than Crooked Joe would have. In fact, President Trump crushes Kamala Harris in every poll,\" said Dylan Johnson.\n\nThe Emerson poll's credibility interval for each state was 3.4 percentage points.\n\nAfter a devastating debate performance knocked Biden out of the race in a dragged-out cycle that began back in June, Harris is currently set to debate her opponent for the first time some time in September. The two campaigns have been invited to a debate by Fox News on September 17.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The former president's 2-point lead is within the poll's margin of error, meaning that the candidates are in a virtual tie.\n\nThe survey was conducted in the 48 hours following Harris's campaign launch. The vice president has received a wave of support from Democrats after President Joe Biden suspended his reelection campaign on Sunday and subsequently endorsed Harris to take his place at the top of the party's ticket.\n\nThursday's poll is a good sign for Democrats, who for weeks were divided among themselves over if Biden should remain in the race. In a Times/Siena poll conducted in the days following the first presidential debate (June 28 to July 2), Biden was trailing Trump by 6 percentage points among likely voters.\n\nIn the days leading up to Biden's decision to drop out of the election, the former president had taken his biggest lead over Biden in national polling, according to analysis from FiveThirtyEight.\n\nThe Times' survey released on Thursday also found that 70 percent of respondents who indicated that they were a Democrat or Democratic-leaning voter said that the party should \"unite behind\" Harris quickly to make her the formal nominee. The Democratic National Convention will kick-off in Chicago on August 15, although the convention's rules committee passed a proposal on Wednesday that will allow delegates to begin virtually voting on a presidential nominee at the start of next, per a report from the Associated Press.\n\nWhile data is still relatively limited on how Harris could fare against Trump in November, several polls released this week have shown that the vice president is preferred by key demographics, including union members and women voters. Reuters and Ipsos also released a poll on Wednesday that found a majority of Americans think that Trump, who turned 78 last month, is too old to work in government, one of the major points of criticism that plagued Biden at 81 years old.\n\nTrump's campaign cautioned in a memo earlier this week about a potential \"Harris Honeymoon\" in polling in response to the vice president's entry into the presidential race. The note, written by Trump pollster Tony Fabrizio, said that while Democrats may experience a boost in polling over the next several weeks, the \"fundamentals of the race stay the same.\"\n\nNewsweek reached out to Trump's campaign via email on Thursday for additional comment.\n\nIn recent days, the former president has attacked Harris -- who he calls \"Lyin' Kamala\" -- for being \"more radical\" than Biden and has attempted to blame her for the White House policies along the U.S. southern boarder.\n\nHarris's campaign message has focused on her past experience as a local prosecutor and state attorney general in California, telling supporters at her first rally in Wisconsin on Tuesday that she \"knows Donald Trump's type.\" The former president was convicted on 34 counts of falsifying business records in May and was found liable of sexual assault and defamation in the spring of 2023.", "source": {"uri": "newsweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsweek"}, "authors": [{"uri":

These numbers include polls from both before and after Biden exited the race and endorsed Harris.\n\nIt is mostly unclear whether that seismic shift has changed the race.\n\nDemocratic strategist David Axelrod warned Tuesday that Trump is a \"pretty substantial favorite\" over Harris.\n\nAnother high-profile Democratic strategist, James Carville, said Wednesday that Harris is off to a strong start and people are feeling better, but \"that excitement's gotta be tempered with realism, and the realism is, she has a tough campaign to run.\"\n\nThe outcome of the election will come down to six battleground states.\n\nHere's where things stand in them.\n\nTrump leads Harris by a sizable 7.2 points in The Hill/DDHQ average in Arizona. That's a slightly wider lead than the former president enjoyed over Biden, though all the polls predated his exit.\n\nArizona has the lowest concentration of Black voters of any of the battleground states, which could contribute to Harris's uphill climb there. Just 5.7 percent of the Arizona population is Black, according to U.S. Census Bureau figures.\n\nHarris is of Jamaican and Indian parentage and would be the first Black female president if elected.\n\nArizona saw one of Biden's narrowest victories in 2020, when he prevailed by less than half a percentage point.\n\nSen. Mark Kelly (D-Ariz.) is reported to be on Harris's vice presidential shortlist, which could perhaps transform the race in the state. But Arizona looks a stretch for the vice president right now.\n\nThe Hill/DDHQ average, which includes polls from before Biden decided to step aside, shows Trump leading Harris by 4.6 points in Georgia. He had led Biden by 3.7 points.\n\nThe only poll to appear since Biden's shock announcement showed a closer race -- Trump was up by just 1 point in the survey, from Landmark Communications.\n\nGeorgia has the largest Black population, proportionately, of any battleground; roughly 1-in-3 Georgians is Black.\n\nIt's important to underline, though, that while Harris does somewhat better with Black voters than Biden in some surveys, the margins are pretty modest.\n\nIn a Quinnipiac University poll released Monday, for example, Harris commanded the support of 81 percent of Black voters. Biden was on 76 percent Black support.\n\nTrump leads Harris by 2.2 points in the Wolverine State, exactly the same margin as Biden.\n\nThere have, however, been no major Michigan polls since Harris effectively claimed the nomination.\n\nIsrael's assault on Gaza is an especially salient issue in Michigan, which has the highest concentration of Arab Americans of any state. In the Democratic primary back in February, an \"uncommitted\" option -- widely seen as a protest vote against Biden's strongly pro-Israel stance -- drew 13 percent support.\n\nThere is a general consensus that Harris has been a bit more sympathetic than Biden to the broad Palestinian cause. She caused a stir within Democratic circles when she called for a temporary truce in March, before Biden had done so.\n\nThat being said, it's far from clear that Harris's policy on Israel and Gaza would be fundamentally different from Biden's.\n\nThe vice president notably did not attend Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's Wednesday speech to a joint session of Congress. Her aides noted she had a preexisting commitment in Indiana.\n\nIn the DDHQ polling average, Trump leads Harris by more than 8 points here. But, again, no significant polling has emerged from the Silver State since she became the de facto nominee.\n\nAlmost 30 percent of Nevada's population is Latino, which could -- maybe -- provide some hope for Harris.\n\nIn a Wednesday memo, Harris campaign Chair Jen O'Malley Dillon -- who had served in the same role in the Biden campaign -- argued:\n\n\"Harris is more popular than Trump among undecided, independent, and third-party Latinos. Early polling from Nevada shows that the Vice President makes up ground with Latino voters and does 'exceedingly well' with Latino voters who are skeptical of both Biden and Trump.\"\n\nThe latter assertion was based on one pollster's finding that Harris \"wins back some Latinos who had slipped away from Biden.\"\n\nThat idea is about to be put to the test.\n\nThe biggest of all the swing states, with 19 electoral votes up for grabs. Trump holds an edge of about 4 points on Harris, just as he had on Biden.\n\nHarris isn't doing much better than Biden anywhere, but her team will hope that changes after the intense, and mostly favorable, attention she has recently received.\n\nTeam Harris will also hope the vice president's strong support for reproductive rights could help with female voters in the suburbs around Philadelphia that have long been a key battleground within the state.\n\nHarris could boost Black turnout in Philadelphia and Pittsburgh too.\n\nImportantly, Pennsylvania also has a higher proportion of college graduates than any of the other five battlegrounds. There is some evidence that Harris does slightly better than Biden with those voters.\n\nHarris's first full-blown campaign event after Biden pulled out was in the Milwaukee area. The city will be crucial to her hopes of holding onto a state that Biden won by just six-tenths of a percentage point in 2020.\n\nOpinion polls have shown Wisconsin to be one of the tightest battlegrounds.\n\nThe Hill/DDHQ average has Trump leading Harris by less than 2 points in the state, essentially the same as his margin over Biden.\n\nThe optimistic view for Harris is one in which the age issue works in her favor with young voters in Wisconsin's college towns, while her barrier-breaking potential excites liberal-leaning and Black voters.\n\nThe danger for her, as in Pennsylvania and Michigan, is that conservative-inclined independents balk at backing her.\n\nCopyright 2024 Nexstar Media, Inc.

The poll carries a margin of error of 3.5%, which wouldn't have all that much effect on the Harris lead.\n\nHarris scored 60% against Trump's 40% when voters were given the option between the two today. Asked the same question about Biden and Trump and that gap lowers to just 6%, with Biden scoring 53% and Trump getting 47%. Biden already announced he's stepped down from his reelection campaign, and Harris has secured the needed delegates to move to the top of the ticket.\n\nThe youth poll is the latest good news for the Harris campaign, which has seen the passing of the torch from president to vice president spark a wave of donations and endorsements. This of course followed Biden facing growing concerns within his own party amid questions about his stamina and age.\n\nAnother solid statistic from the Axios poll for Harris is that 45% of young voters said they have an extremely or somewhat favorable view of the vice president. Both Biden and Trump scored lower in this area, with the former getting 33% and the latter earning 34%.\n\nOn the unfavorable side, 43% said they have a somewhat or extremely unfavorable view of Harris, while 61% said the same about Trump and Biden.\n\nThe poll also asked opinions about a vice presidential candidate for Harris. While most were unsure, Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer (D) and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg scored the highest with 14% and 13%, respectively.\n\nThe Axios survey was conducted nationwide among more than 800 voters between 18-34 between July 22-24.", "source": {"uri": "mediaite.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mediaite"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axios_(website)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Axios (website)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Buttigieg", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pete Buttigieg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gretchen_Whitmer", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gretchen Whitmer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_Transportation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Secretary of Transportation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 80}], "image": "https://www.mediaite.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Kamala-Harris-Tears-Into-Trump-Hinting-At-Violence-If-He-Gets-Sent-To-Prison-Over-Felony-Convictions.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9763361", "eventUri": "eng-9763361", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-22", "dateEnd": "2024-07-24", "textStart": 1818, "textEnd": 1828}], "sentiment": 0.1529411764705881, "wgt": 159, "relevance": 1}

And to this room of leaders, I say: Bring it on.\"\n\nA series of polls conducted since Biden ended his reelection bid on Sunday, including one by Reuters/Ipsos, show Harris and Trump beginning their head-to-head contest on roughly equal footing, setting the stage for a close-fought campaign over the next three-and-a-half months.\n\nA New York Times/Siena College national poll published on Thursday found Harris has narrowed what had been a sizable Trump lead. Trump was ahead of Harris 48 per cent to 46 per cent among registered voters, compared with a 49 per cent to 41 per cent in early July, following Biden's disastrous debate performance that led to a wave of Democratic calls for him to step aside as candidate.\n\nWhile nationwide surveys give important signals of American support for political candidates, a handful of competitive states typically tilt the balance in the US Electoral College, which ultimately decides who wins a presidential election.\n\nHarris also got good news on that front as Emerson College/The Hill published a poll finding that she had begun to close the gap with Trump in five critical battleground states: Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Trump still narrowly leads Harris in all but Wisconsin, which is tied, according to the poll of registered voters in those states.\n\nTogether, the polls suggest that while Trump, 78, retains a narrow advantage, he has not seen the sort of bump in support following last week's Republican National Convention that candidates hope to get out of the highly scripted, televised and expensive events.\n\nTrump on Wednesday night laid into Harris in his first rally since she replaced Biden atop the ticket. He continued his criticism online on Thursday.\n\n\"We're not ready for a Marxist President, and Lyin' Kamala Harris is a RADICAL LEFT MARXIST, AND WORSE!\" Trump posted on his social media platform.\n\nFormer DOJ officials back Harris\n\nMore than 40 former US Justice Department officials, primarily from Democratic administrations, signed a letter endorsing Harris and calling Trump a threat to the rule of law in the US.\n\n\"Former President Trump presents a grave risk to our country, our global alliances and the future of democracy. As President, he regularly ignored the rule of law,\" reads the letter, a copy of which was seen by Reuters and signed by former US Attorney General Loretta Lynch and other former officials. NBC News first reported the letter.\n\nFormer President Barack Obama has been in regular contact with Harris and plans to soon endorse her as the Democratic presidential candidate, a source familiar with his plans said on Thursday.\n\nFormer US House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who retains deep influence within the Democratic Party, endorsed Harris on Thursday alongside dozens of other female lawmakers.\n\nThe Harris campaign released its first video advertisement online on Thursday. Harris narrates the ad, framing the campaign as a battle to protect Americans' individual liberties to the sound of Beyonce's song Freedom.\n\nThe next highly anticipated development will be Harris' choice of a vice-presidential candidate to counter Trump's selection of US Senator JD Vance of Ohio.\n\nThe list of contenders amounts to a who's-who of rising Democrats, including US Senator Mark Kelly of Arizona, Governors Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania, Roy Cooper of North Carolina and Andy Beshear of Kentucky, as well as Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg.\n\nHarris' rise has largely pushed Trump out of the headlines, a week after the Republican National Convention and 12 days after he narrowly survived an assassination attempt that wounded his ear.\n\nFBI Director Christopher Wray told a House panel on Wednesday that investigators are not certain whether Trump's injury was caused by a bullet or by shrapnel. Trump has said a bullet hit his ear.\n\nA Trump campaign spokesperson, Jason Miller, called the idea that Trump was not hit by a bullet a \"conspiracy,\" adding an expletive.\n\nThe FBI in a Thursday statement said it \"has been consistent and clear that the shooting was an attempted assassination.\" The statement did not make clear whether Trump had been hit by a bullet or shrapnel.

On Sunday, Joe Biden dropped out of the presidential race and endorsed his vice president. In the ensuing days she's quickly locked up the Democratic nomination as every potential rival endorsed her. And while it's early yet, there's now enough polling data to indicate that it's a brand new race -- with Democrats obtaining some badly-needed momentum and perhaps some new avenues for victory.\n\nWhen Biden dropped out on July 21, he trailed Donald Trump by 3.2 percent in the FiveThirtyEight polling averages and by 3.1 percent in the RealClearPolitics averages. FiveThirtyEight hasn't posted averages with Harris, but RCP has her trailing Trump by 1.9 percent, and that's with two outlier-ish polls from Rasmussen and Forbes/HarrisX giving Trump big leads (seven percent and six percent, respectively).\n\nPerhaps more significant are the trend lines in major polls taken before and after the Biden-Harris switch.\n\nOn July 17, the Morning Consult tracking poll had Trump leading Biden by four points (46 - 42 percent). On July 24, the same poll had Harris leading Trump by a point (46 - 45 percent). On July 16, Reuters-Ipsos showed Trump ahead of Biden by two points (43 - 41 percent). On July 23 the same poll gave Harris a two-point lead (44 - 42 percent). On July 2, New York Times-Siena showed Trump leading by six points (49 - 43 percent). On July 24, that pollster showed Trump leading by one point (48 47 percent). The only counter-indicator to those polls was NPR-Marist, where Biden led by two points (50 - 48 percent) on July 11, while Trump led by one point (46 - 45 percent) in a one-day July 22 survey.\n\nAll of these polls show a close national race. Battleground-state data has been slower to arrive, but what we have shows Harris improving on Biden's performance. A battery of Emerson-The Hill polls taken on July 22-23 of five battleground states showed Wisconsin tied at 47 percent, and Trump leading Harris by five points (49 - 44 percent) in Arizona, two points (48 - 46 percent) in Georgia , one point (46 - 45 percent), and two points (48 - 46 percent) in Pennsylvania. What's more significant are the trend lines since the last polls from Emerson in mid-July, testing Biden against Trump:\n\nA separate poll of Georgia from Landmark Communications also showed a close race there, with Trump leading Harris by one point (48 - 47 percent). And a separate poll of Pennsylvania from NSOR-AmericanGreatness showed Trump up by two points in that state (47 - 45 percent).\n\nThere is growing evidence that (as Democrats hoped) Harris is doing significantly better than Biden among the young, Black, and Latino voting categories on which the Biden-Harris 2020 win depended. In the new Times-Siena poll, she leads Trump among under-30 likely voters by 59 - 38 percent; among Black likely voters by 72 - 19 percent, and among Latino likely voters by 60 - 36 percent. A new Axios-GenerationLab poll of 18-34 year-old voters showed Harris expanding a six-point Biden lead (53 - 47 percent) to 20 points (60 - 40 percent). All these trends could help Harris put SunBelt states (particularly Georgia) back into play after Trump held big leads for months.\n\nIn general, there's a sense of momentum for Harris that may not last, but it has lifted Democratic spirits -- and perhaps even re-engaged an electorate unhappy with a Biden-Trump rematch (the new Times-Siena poll showed the number of \"double haters\" declining by more than half). It would be wise to stay very tuned to this contest.", "source": {"uri": "nymag.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NYMag"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ed_kilgore@nymag.com", "name": "Ed Kilgore", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FiveThirtyEight", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "FiveThirtyEight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RealClearPolitics", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "RealClearPolitics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forbes", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Forbes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_state", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Swing state"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opinion_poll", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Opinion poll"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisconsin", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wisconsin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wisconsin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morning_Consult", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Morning Consult"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_and_ethnicity_in_the_United_States_census", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Race and ethnicity in the United States census"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cycling/Tandem", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cycling/Tandem", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/5f8/19d/893f2a43fd311d8598ab0d0551741b22db-trump-harris-polls.1x.rsocial.w1200.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9763361", "eventUri": "eng-9763361", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-22", "dateEnd": "2024-07-23", "textStart": 1870, "textEnd": 1880}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-21", "textStart": 467, "textEnd": 474}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-17", "textStart": 963, "textEnd": 970}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-24", "textStart": 1067, "textEnd": 1074, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-16", "textStart": 1148, "textEnd": 1155}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-23", "textStart": 1235, "textEnd": 1242}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-02", "textStart": 1308, "textEnd": 1314}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-11", "textStart": 1577, "textEnd": 1584}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-22", "textStart": 1646, "textEnd": 1653}], "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 158, "relevance": 1}

Mark Kelly (D-Ariz.), Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro (D) and Gov. Gretchen Whitmer (D) -- Shapiro saw the highest number of Democratic voters from within their respective state support him to be Harris's running mate (57 percent). A separate 42 percent of Arizona Democratic voters supported Kelly, while 36 percent of Michigan Democratic voters backed Whitmer.\n\nThe polling also offered good news for Senate Democrats: Sens. Bob Casey (D-Pa.) and Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.), in addition to Reps. Elissa Slotkin (D-Mich.) and Ruben Gallego (D-Ariz.), lead their respective Senate Republican competitors either 4 or 5 points.\n\nDemocrats have rallied around Harris after Biden announced over the weekend he would be withdrawing from the presidential race, instead backing his vice president. A number of high-profile Democrats quickly threw their support behind Harris, with just weeks to go before the Democratic National Convention.\n\nThe polling also illustrates how Senate Democratic candidates are continuing to outperform the Democratic presidential nominee.\n\nThe Emerson College Polling/The Hill survey surveyed respondents between July 22 and July 23. Eight hundred respondents were surveyed in Arizona, Georgia and Michigan each, with a margin of error of each at 3.4 percentage points. In Pennsylvania, 850 respondents were surveyed with a margin of error of 3.3 percentage points. In Wisconsin, 845 respondents were surveyed with a margin of error of 3.3 percentage points.\n\nCopyright 2024 Nexstar Media, Inc. All rights reserved.

The former president's 2-point lead is within the poll's margin of error, meaning that the candidates are in a virtual tie.\n\nThe survey was conducted in the 48 hours following Harris's campaign launch. The vice president has received a wave of support from Democrats after President Joe Biden suspended his reelection campaign on Sunday and subsequently endorsed Harris to take his place at the top of the party's ticket.\n\nThursday's poll is a good sign for Democrats, who for weeks were divided among themselves over if Biden should remain in the race. In a Times/Siena poll conducted in the days following the first presidential debate (June 28 to July 2), Biden was trailing Trump by 6 percentage points among likely voters.\n\nIn the days leading up to Biden's decision to drop out of the election, the former president had taken his biggest lead over Biden in national polling, according to analysis from FiveThirtyEight.\n\nThe Times' survey released on Thursday also found that 70 percent of respondents who indicated that they were a Democrat or Democratic-leaning voter said that the party should \"unite behind\" Harris quickly to make her the formal nominee. The Democratic National Convention will kick-off in Chicago on August 15, although the convention's rules committee passed a proposal on Wednesday that will allow delegates to begin virtually voting on a presidential nominee at the start of next, per a report from the Associated Press.\n\nWhile data is still relatively limited on how Harris could fare against Trump in November, several polls released this week have shown that the vice president is preferred by key demographics, including union members and women voters. Reuters and Ipsos also released a poll on Wednesday that found a majority of Americans think that Trump, who turned 78 last month, is too old to work in government, one of the major points of criticism that plagued Biden at 81 years old.\n\nTrump's campaign cautioned in a memo earlier this week about a potential \"Harris Honeymoon\" in polling in response to the vice president's entry into the presidential race. The note, written by Trump pollster Tony Fabrizio, said that while Democrats may experience a boost in polling over the next several weeks, the \"fundamentals of the race stay the same.\"\n\nNewsweek reached out to Trump's campaign via email on Thursday for additional comment.\n\nIn recent days, the former president has attacked Harris -- who he calls \"Lyin' Kamala\" -- for being \"more radical\" than Biden and has attempted to blame her for the White House policies along the U.S. southern boarder.\n\nHarris's campaign message has focused on her past experience as a local prosecutor and state attorney general in California, telling supporters at her first rally in Wisconsin on Tuesday that she \"knows Donald Trump's type.\" The former president was convicted on 34 counts of falsifying business records in May and was found liable of sexual assault and defamation in the spring of 2023.\n\nNewsweek is committed to challenging conventional wisdom and finding connections in the search

Swing state numbers, to be precise. Biden had trailed former president (and 2024 GOP nominee) Donald Trump for months in multiple critical battleground states which have determined the outcomes of the past two presidential races.\n\nThose states, combined, account for 77 electoral votes - and Biden won them all in 2020.\n\nHow is Harris faring in these key states?\n\nOn Thursday morning, Emerson College published the results of its first swing state survey since Biden was replaced by Harris.\n\nThe good news for Democrats? The race is much closer now.\n\nThe bad news for Democrats? Their candidate is still trailing.\n\nAccording to the survey, Trump leads Harris in Arizona (), Georgia (), Michigan () and Pennsylvania () - and is tied with her in Wisconsin. Results from Nevada were not included in this release.\n\n\"Harris has recovered a portion of the vote for the Democrats on the presidential ticket since the fallout after the June 27 debate,\" Emerson poll executive director Spencer Kimball said. \"Harris' numbers now reflect similar support levels to those of Biden back in March.\"\n\nKimball also pointed out Harris' dramatic improvement over Biden in a critical Democratic demographic: Young voters.\n\n\"Young voters have shifted toward Harris: her support compared to Biden increased by 16 points in Arizona, eight in Georgia, five in Michigan, 11 in Pennsylvania, and one in Wisconsin since earlier polling this month,\" he noted.\n\nEmerson's polling was conducted between July 22-23, 2024. A total of 800 registered voters were surveyed in Arizona, Georgia and Michigan while 845 were surveyed in Wisconsin and 850 in Pennsylvania. The margin of error for all states was plus or minus 3.3 percent.\n\nKeep it tuned to this outlet as we continue to parse the polls ahead of the November 5, 2024 election, now just 102 days away. Also, as you digest the newest numbers bear in mind Trump has a history of outperforming polls - having done so in both the 2016 and 2020 election cycles.\n\nWill Folks is the founding editor of the news outlet you are currently reading.

When third party candidates and Robert F. Kennedy Jr. are included, Harris draws 44 percent of likely voters to Trump's 43 percent, with Kennedy slumping to five percent.\n\nThe Times poll adds another data point to an emerging trend since Biden exited the race: Harris is showing early signs of closing the gap. And the poll found that both candidates benefit in different ways -- Harris from a rise in popularity and major gains among several demographic groups, and Trump from a combination of continued strength with his base and his highest favorability ratings of the election.\n\nBetween Biden's numbers in June and now, Harris has taken a 2 percentage-point lead over Trump among independent voters, flipping the former president's previous 10 percentage point advantage She's opened up a 14 percentage-point lead with women, a 21 percentage point lead with 18-29 year-old voters, a 24 percentage point lead with Hispanic voters, and 53 percentage point lead with Black voters -- all double-digit increases over Biden's numbers last month. Trump polls better than Harris among white, male and older voters.\n\nTrump, meanwhile, appears to be benefiting from a more conventional dynamic: the convention bump, when candidates sometimes perform better in the polls after they accept the nomination at their party's convention. Last week's RNC was particularly unifying for Republicans, with the party rallying around the former president after he survived an assassination attempt.\n\nForty-seven percent of likely voters now hold a \"somewhat\" or \"very\" favorable view of Trump, gaining 9 percentage points since June and a record high in Times/Siena polls. At the same time, 45 percent of likely voters hold a \"very unfavorable\" view of him, up 6 percentage points from last month.\n\nBy comparison, 46 percent of voters hold a favorable view of Harris, rising from 36 percent when this question was last asked by the Times in February and higher than Biden's. The president, who praised Harris and explained his decision to step aside in a somber Oval Office address on Wednesday, has seen an uptick in his favorability rating and job approval. Nearly 9 in 10 likely voters approve of Biden's withdrawal, and 81 percent of Democrats and Democrat-leaning voters think the party should nominate Harris as its candidate.\n\nThe New York Times/Siena College poll was conducted July 22-24, surveying 1,142 likely voters with a margin of error of plus or minus 3.3 percentage points.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage_point", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Percentage point"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_F._Kennedy_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Robert F.

Voters are partial to possible contenders who currently represent their states, the Emerson poll found. In Arizona, 42% of Democratic voters prefer their senator, Mark Kelly, 57% of Democrats in Pennsylvania prefer Gov. Josh Shapiro, and 36% of Michigan Democrats surveyed prefer Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, who has said she wouldn't accept an offer for the No. 2 spot.

Gavin Newsom, in addition to Kelly, Shapiro and Whitmer.\n\nBiden dropped out of the race Sunday, despite insisting he would continue his campaign amid an intraparty revolt in the wake of his June 27 debate performance. He immediately endorsed Harris and she announced plans to seek the nomination. By Monday, the majority of Biden's delegates had pledged to support her, making it all but certain she officially becomes the Democratic nominee when they vote during the first week of August to formalize the ticket.

Yet 2020 results show that Harris can still gain ground with these groups in her expected matchup with Donald Trump.\n\nTake a look at our recently released CNN/SSRS poll. Harris leads Trump among black voters, 78% to 15%. Among those same voters (the poll recontacted the same respondents), Biden led by a narrower margin of 70% to 23% in CNN's April and June polling data.\n\nThe same observation applies, to a lesser extent, to Hispanic voters. Harris received 47% of the vote to Trump's 45%, while the score was 50% for Trump to 41% for Biden among these same respondents in the April and June data.\n\nVoters under 35 are seeing a similar shift. Harris gets 47% of the vote, compared to 43% for Trump. In April and June, these same voters gave Trump 49% of the vote, compared to 42% for Biden.\n\nIn some ways, none of these changes are particularly surprising. Biden had the worst showing by a Democrat this century among all of these traditionally Democratic-leaning groups. In fact, his showing among Hispanic and black voters was the worst by a Democrat in more than 50 years.\n\nHarris probably had no choice but to reach out to these segments of the electorate.\n\nDespite this improvement, Harris's results leave something to be desired. She is at least 5 points behind Biden among these same groups in the latest 2020 polls.\n\nAmong black voters, Biden led Trump 84% to 9% at the end of the 2020 campaign. Even more remarkable, Biden led Hispanic voters by a margin of 58% to 32%.\n\nFinally, even though Harris has become a favorite meme among young voters, Biden's 60% to 31% advantage over Trump at the end of the 2020 campaign is much larger than Harris's right now.\n\n(I should note that the polls at this point in the 2020 campaign were similar to what the polls at the end of the campaign showed.)\n\nThis may sound like bad news for Harris' campaign, and in some ways it is. Without improvement among these groups, Harris likely can't win against the former president.\n\nThe good news for Harris, however, is that she is showing she can make up ground with this group compared to Biden's performance earlier this year.\n\nAs Harris continues to define herself separately from her role as Biden's vice president, there is a real chance she could carve out her own political identity that could appeal more to voters of color and younger voters.\n\nHarris's outperforming Biden with voters of color also gives her an opportunity to break new ground in the Electoral College.\n\nBiden's path to 270 electoral votes appears rather limited. He will likely have to make up the difference in the key northern states by winning Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, as well as Nebraska's 2nd Congressional District. His polling in the Sun Belt states of Arizona, Georgia, Nevada and North Carolina has been poor.\n\nIf he had won the key northern states and other Democratic-leaning states (except for the aforementioned Sun Belt states), Biden would have gotten exactly the 270 electoral votes he needed to win.\n\nOne of the main reasons Biden has struggled in these Sun Belt states is that each has a significant share of black or Hispanic voters. By doing better with these groups, Harris could open up new electoral avenues.\n\nIf, for example, Harris won all four Sun Belt battlegrounds mentioned above, she wouldn't need to win Michigan, Pennsylvania or Wisconsin.\n\nHarris may be more likely to win 270 electoral votes by winning a mix of northern and key Sun Belt states.\n\nUltimately, CNN's latest poll gives Harris' campaign some hope. It's not that Trump isn't the frontrunner or that Harris doesn't face an uphill climb.\n\nOn the contrary, Harris now has multiple paths to victory, while Biden's options appear to be narrowing fairly quickly.\n\nWhat Are The Main Benefits Of Comparing Car Insurance Quotes Online", "source": {"uri": "exbulletin.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ExBulletin"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_and_ethnicity_in_the_United_States_census", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Race and ethnicity in the United States census"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2020_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2020 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Electoral_College", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Electoral College"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Belt_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sun Belt Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_meme", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Internet meme"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nevada", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nevada"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nevada"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisconsin", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wisconsin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wisconsin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nebraska", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nebraska"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nebraska"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/General_Merchandise/O", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/General Merchandise/O", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://i.imgur.com/AoyxWyw.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9763361", "eventUri": "eng-9763361", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 156, "relevance": 1}

Trump, according to the latest New York Times/Siena College poll, as her fresh candidacy was quickly reuniting a Democratic Party that had been deeply fractured over President Biden.\n\nJust days after the president abandoned his campaign under pressure from party leaders, the poll showed Democrats rallying behind Ms. Harris as the presumptive nominee, with only 14 percent saying they would prefer another option. An overwhelming 70 percent of Democratic voters said they wanted the party to speedily consolidate behind her rather than engage in a more competitive and drawn-out process.\n\nHer swift reassembling of the Democratic coalition appeared to help narrow Mr. Trump's significant advantage over Mr. Biden of only a few weeks ago. Ms. Harris was receiving 93 percent support from Democrats, the same share that Mr. Trump was getting from Republicans.\n\nOverall, Mr. Trump leads Ms. Harris 48 percent to 47 percent among likely voters in a head-to-head match. That is a marked improvement for Democrats when compared to the Times/Siena poll in early July that showed Mr. Biden behind by six percentage points, in the aftermath of the poor debate performance that eventually drove him from the race.\n\nMr. Trump leads Ms. Harris 48 percent to 46 percent among registered voters. He had led among registered voters by nine percentage points over Mr. Biden in the post-debate poll.\n\nThe survey provides a snapshot of the presidential race in the middle of one of the most volatile and unpredictable periods in modern American history.

And to this room of leaders, I say: Bring it on.\"\n\nA series of polls conducted since Biden ended his reelection bid on Sunday, including one by Reuters/Ipsos, show Harris and Trump beginning their head-to-head contest on roughly equal footing, setting the stage for a close-fought campaign over the next three-and-a-half months.\n\nA New York Times/Siena College national poll published Thursday found Harris has narrowed what had been a sizable Trump lead. Trump was ahead of Harris 48% to 46% among registered voters, compared with a 49% to 41% in early July, following Biden's disastrous debate performance that led to a wave of Democratic calls for him to step aside as candidate.\n\nWhile nationwide surveys give important signals of American support for political candidates, a handful of competitive states typically tilt the balance in the U.S. Electoral College, which ultimately decides who wins a presidential election.\n\nHarris also got good news on that front as Emerson College/The Hill published a poll finding that she had begun to close the gap with Trump in five critical battleground states: Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Trump still narrowly leads Harris in all but Wisconsin, which is tied, according to the poll of registered voters in those states.\n\nTogether, the polls suggest that while Trump, 78, retains a narrow advantage, he has not seen the sort of bump in support following last week's Republican National Convention that candidates hope to get out of the highly scripted, televised and expensive events.\n\nTrump on Wednesday night laid into Harris in his first rally since she replaced Biden atop the ticket. He continued his criticism online on Thursday.\n\n\"We're not ready for a Marxist President, and Lyin' Kamala Harris is a RADICAL LEFT MARXIST, AND WORSE!\" Trump posted on his social media platform.\n\nFORMER DOJ OFFICIALS BACK HARRIS\n\nMore than 40 former U.S. Justice Department officials, primarily from Democratic administrations, signed a letter endorsing Harris and calling Trump a threat to the rule of law in the U.S.\n\n\"Former President Trump presents a grave risk to our country, our global alliances and the future of democracy. As President, he regularly ignored the rule of law,\" reads the letter, a copy of which was seen by Reuters and signed by former U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch and other former officials. NBC News first reported the letter.\n\nFormer President Barack Obama has been in regular contact with Harris and plans to soon endorse her as the Democratic presidential candidate, a source familiar with his plans said on Thursday.\n\nFormer U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who retains deep influence within the Democratic Party, endorsed Harris on Thursday alongside dozens of other female lawmakers.\n\nThe Harris campaign released its first video advertisement online on Thursday. Harris narrates the ad, framing the campaign as a battle to protect Americans' individual liberties to the sound of Beyonce's song \"Freedom.\"\n\nThe next highly anticipated development will be Harris' choice of a vice-presidential candidate to counter Trump's selection of U.S. Senator JD Vance of Ohio.\n\nThe list of contenders amounts to a who's-who of rising Democrats, including U.S. Senator Mark Kelly of Arizona, Governors Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania, Roy Cooper of North Carolina and Andy Beshear of Kentucky, as well as Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg.\n\nHarris' rise has largely pushed Trump out of the headlines, a week after the Republican National Convention and 12 days after he narrowly survived an assassination attempt that wounded his ear.\n\nFBI Director Christopher Wray told a House panel on Wednesday that investigators are not certain whether Trump's injury was caused by a bullet or by shrapnel. Trump has said a bullet hit his ear.\n\nA Trump campaign spokesperson, Jason Miller, called the idea that Trump was not hit by a bullet a \"conspiracy,\" adding an expletive.\n\nThe FBI in a Thursday statement said it \"has been consistent and clear that the shooting was an attempted assassination.\" The statement did not make clear whether Trump had been hit by a bullet or shrapnel.\n\n(Reporting

And to this room of leaders, I say: Bring it on.\"\n\nA series of polls conducted since Biden ended his reelection bid on Sunday, including one by Reuters/Ipsos, show Harris and Trump beginning their head-to-head contest on roughly equal footing, setting the stage for a close-fought campaign over the next three-and-a-half months.\n\nA New York Times/Siena College national poll published Thursday found Harris has narrowed what had been a sizable Trump lead. Trump was ahead of Harris 48% to 46% among registered voters, compared with a 49% to 41% in early July, following Biden's disastrous debate performance that led to a wave of Democratic calls for him to step aside as candidate.\n\nWhile nationwide surveys give important signals of American support for political candidates, a handful of competitive states typically tilt the balance in the U.S. Electoral College, which ultimately decides who wins a presidential election.\n\nHarris also got good news on that front as Emerson College/The Hill published a poll finding that she had begun to close the gap with Trump in five critical battleground states: Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Trump still narrowly leads Harris in all but Wisconsin, which is tied, according to the poll of registered voters in those states.\n\nTogether, the polls suggest that while Trump, 78, retains a narrow advantage, he has not seen the sort of bump in support following last week's Republican National Convention that candidates hope to get out of the highly scripted, televised and expensive events.\n\nTrump on Wednesday night laid into Harris in his first rally since she replaced Biden atop the ticket. He continued his criticism online on Thursday.\n\n\"We're not ready for a Marxist President, and Lyin' Kamala Harris is a RADICAL LEFT MARXIST, AND WORSE!\" Trump posted on his social media platform.\n\nOBAMA READIES ENDORSEMENT\n\nFormer President Barack Obama has been in regular contact with Harris and plans to soon endorse her as the Democratic presidential candidate, a source familiar with his plans said on Thursday.\n\nFormer U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who retains deep influence within the Democratic Party, endorsed Harris on Thursday alongside dozens of other female lawmakers.\n\nThe Harris campaign released its first video advertisement online on Thursday. Harris narrates the ad, framing the campaign as a battle to protect Americans' individual liberties to the sound of Beyonce's song \"Freedom.\"\n\nThe next highly anticipated development will be Harris' choice of a vice-presidential candidate to counter Trump's selection of U.S. Senator JD Vance of Ohio.\n\nThe list of contenders amounts to a who's-who of rising Democrats, including U.S. Senator Mark Kelly of Arizona, Governors Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania, Roy Cooper of North Carolina and Andy Beshear of Kentucky, as well as Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg.\n\nHarris' rise has largely pushed Trump out of the headlines, a week after the Republican National Convention and 12 days after he narrowly survived an assassination attempt that wounded his ear.\n\nFBI Director Christopher Wray told a House panel on Wednesday that investigators are not certain whether Trump's injury was caused by a bullet or by shrapnel. Trump has said a bullet hit his ear.\n\nA Trump campaign spokesperson, Jason Miller, called the idea that Trump was not hit by a bullet a \"conspiracy,\" adding an expletive.\n\nThe FBI in a Thursday statement said it \"has been consistent and clear that the shooting was an attempted assassination.\" The statement did not make clear whether Trump had been hit by a bullet or shrapnel.", "source":

Kennedy Jr. and other marginal candidates like Libertarian Chase Oliver, the Green Party's Jill Stein and independent Cornel West, the Siena survey is more sterling still for Harris.\n\nShe leads Trump 44% to 43% in that expanded field, with the support of 89% of Democrats, 70% of black voters, 52% of Hispanic voters, and 51% of women.\n\nWhile she doesn't have a majority of independents, with 41% backing her in the larger field many voters will see on their ballots this fall, she's 4 points ahead of Trump with that subgroup.\n\nThe poll evenly sampled Republicans and Democrats, at 33% each, with independents 29% of the participants.\n\nIn another poll of 1,170 registered voters, which YouGov and the Times of London conducted after Biden withdrew from the race but before his Wednesday night address from the Oval Office, the race is also too close to call.\n\nTrump leads Harris by just 2 points, 46% to 44%, with the marginal candidates shedding vote share as seems to happen every four years. Kennedy is at a lowly 4% in this sample, with Stein at 1% and the hapless Cornel West mired at 0%.\n\nAs poll watchers know, there are key differences between registered voter and likely voter models, but some things remain the same.\n\nEven those surveyed who don't claim to be fully committed to voting are loyal to their party's picks, with 92% of Republicans backing Trump and 91% of Democrats behind Harris.\n\nIndependents in this poll skew toward Trump, meanwhile, but not overwhelmingly: 45% to 37%, with Kennedy taking 8% of unaligned voters, Stein 2% and West 1%.\n\nGender splits take center stage here also, with 54% of men backing Trump and 51% of women supporting Harris. Democrats have been messaging heavily on reproductive rights since the 2022 Dobbs decision, which Harris and others blame Trump for, given that his three Supreme Court picks drove the reversal of Roe v. Wade. Expect messaging along these lines through Election Day from the Harris team.\n\nWhile Trump has 54% support among white voters, the YouGov/Times of London poll nonetheless suggests his won't be a rainbow coalition.\n\nOnly 12% of black voters back the former president, with 72% on side for Harris. Trump has spent some time this cycle trying to juice the African-American vote, but those efforts haven't paid off in this survey.\n\nHispanic voters are leaning Harris here also, 44% to 40%. Against Biden in many polls, Trump ran even or was actually ahead.\n\nBut this is a new presidential race.

The poll, which surveyed 1,142 registered voters from July 22-24, found that 41 percent of Americans either \"strongly\" or \"somewhat\" approve of Biden, while 56 percent disapprove.\n\nIt was his best result in the poll since September 6-14, when 38 percent approved of his performance, while 51 percent disapproved.\n\nBiden's polling numbers have been bogged down amid criticism of his handling of the U.S.-Mexico border, and many voters blame his policies for financial woes, despite inflation lowering in the years following the COVID-19 pandemic. Meanwhile, some progressive Democrats have been critical of his handling of the Israel-Hamas war, further hampering his approval numbers.\n\nEighty-seven percent of respondents said they approved of his decision to drop out of the presidential race. Only 9 percent said they disapproved.\n\nForty-eight percent said they view Trump favorably, while 51 percent view him unfavorably. Meanwhile, 46 percent said they view Harris favorably and 49 percent said they view her unfavorably.\n\nTrump holds a slight advantage in the national popular vote, according to the poll. Forty-eight percent of likely voters said they would vote for him, while 47 percent would vote for Harris, if the election were held today.\n\nHowever, when other candidates are on the ballot, Harris leads Trump by one point (44 percent to 43 percent), according to the poll.\n\nHarris' polling was similar to, if not behind, that of Biden before his withdrawal. But her supporters argue she will be more capable of running a robust presidential campaign that could win over swing voters and build voter enthusiasm among the Democratic base.\n\nThe Times poll found that Harris has gained ground on Trump. In an earlier poll, conducted among 1,532 likely voters from June 28 to July 2, Trump led Biden by 6 points (49 percent to 43 percent).\n\nOther polls have similarly found Harris winning over support in recent days.", "source": {"uri": "newsweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsweek"}, "authors": [{"uri": "andrew_stanton@newsweek.com", "name": "Andrew Stanton", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siena_College", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Siena College"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico\u2013United_States_border", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mexico\u2013United States border"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressivism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Progressivism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online_Issues_Polls", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online Issues Polls", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 87}], "image": "https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2436859/joe-biden-approval-rating-hits-two-year-high.webp?w=1600&h=900&q=88&f=a24e75579c8206a788112bbb7d19a7ac", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9763361", "eventUri": "eng-9763361", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-28", "dateEnd": "2024-07-02", "textStart": 2437, "textEnd": 2454}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-22", "dateEnd": "2024-07-24", "textStart": 720, "textEnd": 730}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-09-06", "dateEnd": "2024-09-14", "textStart": 888, "textEnd": 902}], "sentiment": 0.1607843137254903, "wgt": 151, "relevance": 1}

So this is no surprise to us. And it's consistent with our last Biden v Trump poll.

The president released a letter on X stating while his intention was to run for reelection, he believed it was best for the country and his party to focus on the remainder of his term.\n\nBiden notably endorsed Harris in a second post online, which triggered a wave of support for the vice president.\n\nThe move from Biden comes after he received a massive amount of backlash over his debate performance against Trump, in which he could be seen struggling to finish his statements and freezing mid-statement. Despite Republicans calling out the president's significant amount of gaffes over his term, Democrats and legacy media only began to call concerns for Biden's mental fitness after the debate.\n\nA post-debate CBS/YouGov poll showed 72% of Americans no longer believe Biden has the mental and cognitive health to serve in office, jumping seven points from a similar survey in early June.\n\nThe Harris campaign didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

If they could only vote for Harris or Trump, then 54 percent of likely Maine voters said they would back Harris while 45 percent would support Trump, the new poll found.\n\nDemocrats will take positives from the latest survey, as a separate poll conducted in April had Trump ahead of Biden in Maine until a ranked-choice count put Biden narrowly ahead of Trump. Former President George H.W. Bush was the last Republican to win Maine in 1988, though Trump earned one of its four electors in both 2016 and 2020 by carrying the rural 2nd District.\n\nThe new UNH survey had Trump leading Harris by 4 percentage points in the 2nd District, while Harris was up by 20 percentage points in the liberal 1st District covering southern Maine. The poll also showed independents are divided, with 33 percent backing Harris, 26 percent supporting Trump and 13 percent preferring Kennedy.\n\nAfter a shaky June debate put his party into a spiral over concerns about his fitness and ability to beat Trump again, Biden, 81, announced Sunday he would step aside and support Harris, 59, as his replacement. The switch has, for now, given Democrats energy and optimism, with Harris virtually tied with the 78-year-old Trump in national polls since the weekend.\n\nHarris, who is seeking to become the first woman to become president, quickly went to work to secure enough delegates to win the nomination at the party's convention that starts Aug. 19 in Chicago, and she raised $81 million within a day of Biden's bombshell announcement. The new poll found three-quarters of Maine Democrats back Harris.\n\nDoug Emhoff, the vice president's husband, made his first official campaign stop in Maine on Wednesday, visiting Planned Parenthood's Portland office for an abortion-focused roundtable before attending a rally and then a private fundraiser.\n\nThe next decision facing Harris is who to pick as her running mate. Among Maine voters supporting Harris, 21 percent mentioned Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg as their preferred choice, while 17 percent picked U.S. Sen.

And President Biden's stumbling June 27 debate performance appeared to move the needle only slightly against him -- often within polls' margin of error.\n\nWell, we've now got some real data on the race, post-Biden's exit from the presidential contest. And the short answer is: The switch to Vice President Harris appears to have improved Democrats' chances modestly. But it's still very early to draw too many conclusions.\n\nOn the plus side for Harris, she appears to be pulling in some key, Democratic-leaning voters groups that had soured on a Biden-led Democratic ticket, and her poor image seems to have improved. She's also gained at least somewhat in most polls. On the plus side for Trump, his image numbers appear as good as they've been in a long time, potentially narrowing Harris's opening.\n\nAll show the national race is now neck-and-neck -- between a three-point Trump lead and a two-point Harris lead.\n\nThe Marist poll was probably a bit of an outlier at the time -- it actually showed Biden ahead by two points earlier this month -- and it's worth noting that the pollster changed its methods for the quick-turnaround poll. So the results aren't strictly comparable. The other surveys, meanwhile, suggest some movement toward Harris.\n\nAnd those aren't the only encouraging signs for Harris and the Democrats.\n\nThe key groups\n\nOne of the big ones is young voters. The CNN poll showed the Democratic ticket gaining five points among voters under 30 since April and June. The Times/Siena poll showed it gaining 11 points since earlier this month. The Marist poll showed fewer young people ditching the ticket for third-party candidates in a crowded race.\n\nAnother is Black and Latino voters. The CNN poll showed Democrats gaining seven and six points with those groups, respectively. The Marist poll showed Trump's vote share among non-White voters dropping by eight points. (But the Times/Siena poll actually showed Trump gaining among Black voters.)\n\nThese are important numbers, because these were perhaps the three most troubling groups for a Biden-led Democratic ticket. The groups have favored Democrats by substantial margins for decades, but Biden was performing historically poorly among them. And notably, the Marist poll showed significant increases in enthusiasm among all three -- higher than most any other group.\n\nBeyond that, Harris appears to have gained some popularity. The Reuters/Ipsos poll showed her image going from 14 points underwater (39 percent favorable, 53 percent unfavorable) last week to just six points underwater (44 to 50). The Times/Siena poll showed her favorable rating rising 10 points since February. And the CNN poll showed her with her highest favorable rating since 2021.\n\nThe caveats\n\nBut even that latter number was far from sterling -- 39 percent favorable vs. 52 percent unfavorable. For all the Democratic talk about the game being changed, they still have a likely nominee who is more disliked than liked in all of these polls.\n\nThere are also conflicting findings on how older and White voters might have shifted, raising the possibility that Harris could lose ground with some voters while gaining with others.\n\nAnd in the meantime, Trump's own image appears to be improving. The CNN poll (43 percent favorable) and a recent ABC News/Ipsos poll (40 percent) showed more Americans had a favorable opinion of Trump than at any point since 2020. And a Quinnipiac University poll (46 percent) showed that number higher than at any point since Trump launched his first campaign in 2015.\n\nIt's possible that's temporary and owes to the recent assassination attempt and last week's Republican National Convention. (Conventions usually provide a boost.) But so too is it possible that Harris is benefiting from her own honeymoon period that might not hold up over time as scrutiny increases -- particularly of the left-wing policies she embraced in the 2020 Democratic presidential primaries.\n\nIf there's a plus side for Harris, it's that she's less defined and has more room for growth. For now, she's benefited from that and appears to have expanded the appeal of the Democratic ticket. Democrats have gone from fearing that 2024 is lost to at least having reason to believe.\n\nBut the 2024 script has proven difficult to rewrite before. And we're dealing with lots of significant factors converging all at once. That means it'll take some time to shake out.\n\nThere has been debate within the Democratic Party about just how much they should feature Trump's criminal conviction, which as noted doesn't appear to have impacted the race much thus far.\n\nThe early signs are that Harris intends to drive it home early and often:\n\nWhile Biden made reference to Trump's conviction at times, and the campaign even ran some advertising featuring it, it hasn't been a huge centerpiece of the campaign so far.\n\nHarris stepping forward could change the dynamic somewhat. She's more active on the campaign trail, for one. But more than that, it's arguably a better line of attack with a former prosecutor atop the ticket and given these issues were somewhat uneasy for Biden to talk about, possibly due to his son's own recent conviction.\n\n29 percent, 32 percent, 33 percent\n\nThose are the percentages of respondents who said Biden should resign from the presidency right now in the CNN, Marist and Reuters/Ipsos polls. In each, around twice as many or more said he should stay.\n\nThat's notable for a couple reasons.\n\nOne is that after Biden pulled out, Republicans set about arguing that he must resign, too. Another is that a huge majority of Americans have said for a long time that Biden is too old and not mentally sharp enough to serve as president.\n\nThe lesson: Americans seem to see a difference between Biden not being up to the job for four more years and being able to serve out the next six months.", "source": {"uri": "washingtonpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Post"}, "authors": [{"uri": "aaron_blake@washingtonpost.com", "name": "Aaron Blake", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marist_College", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Marist College"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siena", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Siena"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Siena"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2024 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_and_ethnicity_in_the_United_States_census", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Race and ethnicity in the United States census"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opinion_poll", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Opinion poll"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ipsos", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ipsos"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Democratic_Party_presidential_primaries", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quinnipiac_University_Polling_Institute", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Quinnipiac University Polling Institute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assassination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_National_Convention", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Republican National Convention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_News", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ABC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosecutor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prosecutor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left-wing_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Left-wing politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/LREIOIRVQVQED2UB4R7QINKPTY.JPG&w=1440", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9763361", "eventUri": "eng-9763361", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-27", "textStart": 260, "textEnd": 267}], "sentiment": 0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 147, "relevance": 1}

But the data suggest a strategic running-mate choice could help the Democrat in some of them.\n\nThat's the takeaway from five fresh Emerson College surveys taken July 22 and July 23, the two days immediately after President Biden withdrew from the race.\n\n\"In Arizona, 49% support Trump and 44% support Harris. In Georgia, 48% support Trump and 46% Harris. In Michigan, 46% support Trump and 45% Harris. In Pennsylvania, 48% support Trump and 46% Harris. In Wisconsin, 47% support Harris and Trump respectively,\" says the polling memo released Thursday.\n\nIn Arizona, Harris isn't helped by 57% of respondents disapproving of Biden's job performance.\n\nAn expanded field also hurts Harris. When Robert Kennedy Jr., Libertarian Chase Oliver, Green Party hopeful Jill Stein and Cornel West are factored in, Trump's lead stretches: 48% to Harris' 40%.\n\nHarris could be boosted in the state by selecting Sen. Mark Kelly, a favorite of Barack Obama, as her VP, however, as 36% of respondents said the former astronaut would be her best selection. Whether he could deliver the state is a more open question.\n\nTurning to the Peach State, Biden's 51% unfavorability is also a drag on the likely Democratic nominee, whose deficit increases to 3 points in the expanded field. And it's unclear any vice-presidential hopeful will help her: Sen. Bernie Sanders, an unlikely choice, tops the hypothetical field with 17%.\n\nMichigan presents some contrasts. Harris and Trump are tied at 44% in the expanded field, with the veep outperforming her two-way numbers. And the polling suggests she should make Gretch happen in the veep slot, with 27% of respondents picking Gov. Whitmer as their favorite running mate.\n\nPennsylvania is another battleground Harris may be helped in by picking the state's governor, as 40% of respondents want the popular Josh Shapiro to be her running mate. Shapiro is +18 when it comes to job-performance approval in the state, suggesting he could be a major boon.\n\nWithout Shapiro, Harris is down by 2 points to Trump whether in a two-way matchup or an expanded field, so a strategic pick may make the difference there.\n\nTurning to Wisconsin, it's notable the race is tied regardless of whether the matchup is polled as Harris-Trump or the expanded field.\n\nThough there are differences among the candidates in the polling, there are also prevalent trends, including a gender gap.\n\nIn all five states, Harris leads with women and Trump with men. And in most cases, the candidate who is behind isn't close. The Republican is up by double digits in all five battlegrounds with his own gender, and Harris leads by 9 or more points in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin -- the blue-wall states.\n\nThis polling also suggests the \"double hater\" phenomenon is in effect with Harris and Trump, regarded unfavorably along with President Biden by more than 50% of respondents in all five states.\n\nThese polls track with previous battleground-state surveys showing that swing states could go either way in November.\n\nA North Star Opinion survey conducted between July 20 and 23 shows Trump up by 2 points in the Keystone State in a head-to-head battle with Harris.\n\nA Landmark Communications poll conducted Monday in Georgia shows Trump with 45.8% support, just 1.5% above Harris in a six-way race.", "source": {"uri": "nypost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "New York Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emerson_College", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Emerson College"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Shapiro", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Josh Shapiro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_F._Kennedy_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Robert F.

Or contact tonight's author at [email protected] or on X (formerly known as Twitter) at @PoliticoCharlie.\n\n-- Appeals court timeline suggests months more of delay for Jack Smith's documents case against Trump: Special counsel Jack Smith's bid to revive the classified documents case against Donald Trump appears unlikely to be resolved or even argued in court before Election Day. Smith is appealing U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon's decision last week to dismiss the case, in which the former president is charged with hoarding national security secrets at Mar-a-Lago after he left office. The federal court that will hear his appeal -- the Atlanta-based 11th Circuit Court of Appeals -- laid out a schedule Thursday that requires Smith and Trump to file legal briefs through mid-October.\n\n-- Israel privately pressures Biden admin to fast-track more weapons during Netanyahu visit: Israel is privately ramping up pressure on the Biden administration and lawmakers on Capitol Hill to greenlight weapons it says it needs to protect itself from an increasingly aggressive Iran and its proxies. The delegation traveling with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to Washington this week is circulating a list among lawmakers and senior officials that lays out weapons systems it wants fast-tracked. Israeli representatives passed the list to members of Congress Wednesday following Netanyahu's speech, according to a person familiar with the list who said Jerusalem needs the weapons to bolster its stockpiles.\n\n-- Gavin Newsom issues order to clear homeless encampments on California state land: California Gov. Gavin Newsom directed state agencies today to dismantle homeless encampments on state land after the U.S. Supreme Court cleared the way for states and cities to move more aggressively. Newsom's order tells state agencies to identify sites where unhoused people have pitched tents and to make plans to relocate them. The Democratic governor is taking advantage of a high court ruling that overturned a ban on moving people off of public property unless there are sufficient shelter beds for them.\n\nTESTING GROUND -- Kamala Harris hinted today at the economic message she may lay out as the Democratic presidential frontrunner, weaving student debt forgiveness and affordable child care into a larger picture of optimism for the country.\n\nThe vice president sought to connect education with the economy at the American Federation of Teachers convention in Houston, even as she avoided policy specifics or big divergences from the administration.\n\n\"We see a future with affordable health care, affordable child care and paid leave, not for some but for all,\" Harris said to the throngs of teachers in the audience. \"We see a future where every student has the support and the resources they need to thrive, and a future where no teacher has to struggle with the burden of student loan debt.\"\n\nFALLING IN LINE -- Former President Barack Obama plans to endorse Vice President Kamala Harris' presidential bid, according to two people familiar with his plans. That endorsement could come as soon as this evening, according to one of the people granted anonymity to speak about an endorsement that is not yet public. Obama's backing could help activate and sustain energy -- and fundraising -- for Harris' campaign. And he's likely to get on the campaign trail for Harris once she is officially the presumptive nominee.\n\nLINKING ARMS -- Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin confirmed today that the Russian and Chinese bombers that came within 200 miles of the Alaskan coast this week marked the first time the two countries have jointly flown so close to U.S. territory.\n\nThe unprecedented exercise forced the U.S. and Canada to scramble F-35, F-16 and F-18 fighter planes to shadow the bombers.\n\nThe intercept marked \"the first time that we've seen these two countries fly together like that,\" Austin told reporters at the Pentagon. \"I think the closest point of approach was about 200 miles off of our coast.\"\n\nThe flight set off alarm bells in Washington and Ottawa that Beijing and Moscow had found a new way to work together so close to North America.\n\nAustin said that the bombers had been tracked during most of their flight and \"this was not a surprise to us.\"\n\nWhile it's not uncommon for Russian jets to skirt U.S. airspace around Alaska, the joint flight shows an increasingly assertive China and its expanding military relationship with Russia. The flight came just hours before President Joe Biden was slated to deliver a speech from the Oval Office explaining why he was dropping out of the presidential race.\n\nMoscow and Beijing have forged deeper military relations in recent years, particularly since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Last August, the two sent 11 warships close to the Aleutian Islands, leading to the deployment of four American guided missile destroyers to shadow and track the ships, which stayed in international waters.\n\nGETTING HOT IN HERE -- Las Vegas is experiencing its hottest summer on record, with temperatures climbing above 115 degrees Fahrenheit or higher over seven days in July. Clark County, where Las Vegas is located, is getting hotter more quickly than almost anywhere else in the United States. And its population is also exploding, as the city struggles to accommodate new residents and has zoned for the construction of a lot of new housing units in the midst of the population boom. That new housing, though, will bring more concrete and thus more heat in the middle of a desert with little respite. In a place where access to an air conditioner can mean the difference between life and death -- that also has a growing homelessness problem -- the contradictions abound. How is Vegas dealing with the heat wave, and what will come next as it continues to both get warmer and grow?

But it seems that the Democratic Party has stemmed the tide of Republican momentum with the ascension of Vice President Kamala Harris to the top of the presidential ticket.\n\nIn the previous five polls of Pennsylvanians compiled by PoliticsPA, Donald Trump had averaged a plus-3.4 percentage point advantage over President Joe Biden, including the last two which showed the former president approaching a 5-point lead in both.\n\nEmerson College/The Hill released its Swing State survey on Thursday and found that Trump has 48% among 850 registered Keystone State voters to 46% for the former California attorney general - well within the +/-3.3 percent margin of error.\n\nThe numbers for Harris are notable in the fact that they surpassed Biden's support from earlier in the month in all five states. In Pennsylvania, Harris' numbers came in three points better than the 46th president at 46-43%.\n\n\"Harris has recovered a portion of the vote for the Democrats on the presidential ticket since the fallout after the June 27 debate,\" Spencer Kimball, executive director of Emerson College Polling, said. \"Harris' numbers now reflect similar support levels to those of Biden back in March.\n\n\"Young voters have shifted toward Harris: her support compared to Biden increased by 16 points in Arizona, eight in Georgia, five in Michigan, 11 in Pennsylvania, and one in Wisconsin since earlier polling this month.\"\n\nIn a multiple-candidate contest for the land's highest office, Trump's advantage continues to hold at two points (46-44%), while independent candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s campaign seems to be slowing down at 3.0%. Nearly five percent (4.8%) indicated they were undecided.\n\nPresidential Numbers\n\nMore than half of respondents (51%) had an unfavorable opinion of the vice president, while 47% said they have a favorable view for a minus-4 rating. That number is two points better than the former president who is viewed (46-52) numbers for a minus-6 rating.\n\nTwo-thirds of those surveyed said that attempted assassination attempt on Trump two weeks ago did not change their mind about who to vote for. One-in five (21%0 said they would be more likely to vote for Trump, while nearly 12% said it made them less likely to cast their ballot for him.\n\nVice Presidential Selection\n\nProbably to no one's surprise, the hometown choice appears to be the favorite when it comes to Harris' selection of a running mate.\n\nForty percent of Pennsylvanians support Gov. Josh Shapiro, while Sen. Mark Kelly has 36% of Arizonans in his corner and 27% of Michiganders prefer Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, who has publicly stated that she does not want the job.\n\nAmong just Democrats surveyed, the numbers jump to 57% for Shapiro, 42% for Kelly and 36% for Whitmer. Georgia and Wisconsin Dems split their choices among the candidates with none receiving more than 20 percent.\n\nKeystone State voters showed more lover to Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders as a possible second choice for Harris, coming in at 10 percent, with U.S. Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg drawing 7.5 percent.\n\nU.S. Senate\n\nIn the closely-watched Pennsylvania contest, incumbent Sen. Bob Casey Jr. holds a 48-44% advantage over Republican challenger Dave McCormick. The former hedge fund CEO closed the deficit by two points since the last Emerson poll in the middle of June.\n\nGovernor\n\nShapiro continues to draw strong numbers from Pennsylvania's registered voters, as 49 percent approve of his job performance with 31 percent disapproving for a plus-18 rating. One-in-five were neutral or had no opinion on the governor who signed his second state budget on June 10.\n\nMost Important Issue\n\nAs it is in seemingly every presidential election, the economy is viewed as the most important issue in the Commonwealth. Half of those who responded selected \"jobs, inflation, taxes\" as their top choice with threats to democracy (9.2%) and immigration (7.4%) coming in second and third, respectively. Just 4.5 percent selected abortion access as their top issue.", "source": {"uri": "politicspa.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Politics PA"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emerson_College", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Emerson College"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attorney_General_of_California", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Attorney General of California"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hill_(newspaper)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Hill (newspaper)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PoliticsPA", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "PoliticsPA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gretchen_Whitmer", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gretchen Whitmer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Kelly", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mark Kelly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Shapiro", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Josh Shapiro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_John_F._Kennedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assassination of John F.

Trump ahead of Kamala Harris by one percentage point, 48 percent to 47 percent, among likely voters. Other than the name of the Democratic candidate, \"Trump +1\" is a result that could have been from any other Times/Siena poll before President Biden's disastrous debate.\n\nBut on question after question, there are major shifts from previous Times-Siena polls, which were all taken before Vice President Harris essentially locked up her party's nomination for president, before the Republican convention, and before the attempted assassination of Mr. Trump. Even the one-point Harris deficit represents a significant improvement for Democrats from Mr. Biden's six-point deficit in our last Times/Siena poll.\n\nAs I have written, these events make it hard to know what to make of the results of recent polls, including this one. The survey is a useful marker of where the race stands now, but there's no reason to be confident that this is where the race will stand once the dust settles.\n\nWhile the overall result between Ms. Harris and Mr. Trump may look familiar, the poll is full of signs that there's a lot of dust still in the political air.\n\nMr. Trump hits a high in popularity. Overall, 48 percent of registered voters say they have a favorable view of him, up from 42 percent in our last poll (taken after the debate but before the convention and assassination attempt). It's his highest favorable number in a Times/Siena poll, which previously always found his favorable ratings between 39 percent and 45 percent.\n\nMs. Harris is surging. In fact, her ratings have increased even more than Mr. Trump's. Overall, 46 percent of registered voters have a favorable view of her, up from 36 percent when we last asked about her in February. Only 49 percent have an unfavorable view, down from 54 percent in our last measure. As important, her favorable rating is higher than Mr. Biden's. In fact, it's higher than his standing in any Times/Siena poll since September 2022, which so happens to be the last time Mr. Biden led a Times/Siena national poll of registered voters.\n\nThe national political environment is a little brighter. The share of voters who say the country is on the \"right track\" is up to 27 percent -- hardly a bright and smiley public, but still the highest since the midterm elections in 2022. Mr. Biden's approval and favorable ratings are up as well. The ranks of the double haters have dwindled: With both Ms. Harris and Mr. Trump riding high, the number of voters who dislike both candidates has plunged to 8 percent, down from 20 percent in Times/Siena polls so far this year.\n\nWith all of these underlying changes in the attitudes about the candidates, there's no reason to assume that this familiar Trump +1 result means that the race has simply returned to where it stood before the debate. For now, these developments have mostly canceled out, but whether that will still be true in a few weeks is much harder to say.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "nate_cohn@nytimes.com", "name": "Nate Cohn", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siena", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Siena"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Siena"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beneath_the_Surface", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Beneath the Surface"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siena_College", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Siena College"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempted_assassination_of_Ronald_Reagan", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage_point", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Percentage point"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_United_States_elections", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2022 United States elections"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Supplies_and_Equipment", "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Supplies and Equipment", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online_Issues_Polls", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online Issues Polls", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Weddings/Reception", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Weddings/Reception", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/07/25/multimedia/25up-kamala1st-cgkm/25up-kamala1st-cgkm-videoSixteenByNine3000.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9763361", "eventUri": "eng-9763361", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1529411764705882, "wgt": 135, "relevance": 1}

She also leads Trump 40 percent to 38 percent among independent voters.\n\n\"Her level of support at the start of her campaign exceeds the highest level of support we gauged for Biden,\" the pollsters said.\n\nThe survey results are the first from Morning Consult since Biden announced Sunday that he would withdraw from the presidential race and endorse Harris as the Democratic nominee. The pollsters update their 2024 tracking page on a weekly basis.\n\nHarris has proven to be a unifying force for the Democratic Party. The percentage of Democrats has more than doubled since last month, with nearly 2 in 3 now saying they support Harris at the top of the ticket.\n\nRecent polls show that she's helped close the \"enthusiasm gap\" that has plagued Democrats this election cycle. Not only has excitement jumped among Democratic voters, but they are also now more likely than their Republican counterparts -- 27 percent to 24 percent -- to say they're \"much more motivated\" to participate in the political processes this year.\n\nHarris has also helped Democrats with their third-party problem. Biden's campaign had faced concerns that independent candidate Robert F. Kennedy could draw voters away from the president. But, fewer voters now indicate they'll back a third-party candidate.\n\nThroughout the tracking period, the percentage of voters who said they would pick someone else when faced with a Biden vs. Trump matchup hovered between 8 and 11 percent. On Thursday, only 5 percent said they'd select a third-party candidate if the ballot choice were between Harris and Trump.\n\nTrump remains more popular than Harris, with a favorability rating of 46 percent. The vice president has a favorability rating of 43 percent.\n\nTrump's VP pick, Senator JD Vance, also saw a boost in popularity. The share of Trump's 2020 voters with favorable opinions of Vance nearly doubled, from 38 percent to 66 percent, before and after Trump made his running mate announcement at the Republican National Convention.\n\nCongressional Democrats, however, are more popular than their Republican counterparts, with a 43 percent favorability rating compared to Republicans' 41 percent.\n\nThe economy remains the top voting issue, with 76 percent of Americans ranking it as \"very important,\" followed by national security at 68 percent. Sixty-six percent of voters also described jobs, health care, Social Security and Medicare as \"very important\" to their vote.\n\nThe national survey was conducted between July 22 and 24 among 11,297 registered voters.

Here is what these two polling surveys say", "body": "Two leading national surveys indicate that Kamala Harris is within the grasp of victory in the upcoming presidential poll. Donald Trump is facing a challenge after Joe Biden ended his election campaign. Donald Trump and the Republicans are on the backfoot after two leading national surveys indicate a surge in support for Kamala Harris who is also ahead of Trump, according to these surveys. The Trump campaign team has pointed out the results of another survey which indicated that the former president is ahead of his rival in key swing states.\n\nThe Republicans and Trump were upbeat about their electoral prospects during their national convention in Milwaukee. This has now changed rapidly after US President Joe Biden quit the race and endorsed Vice-President Kamala Harris. This decision has sent the Republicans into a tail spin.\n\nThe Reuters/Ipsos survey indicated that Kamala Harris has a marginal lead over Donald Trump. There is a two-point lead in favor of Harris. 44% of the respondents favored Harris in comparison to Trump who received 42% of the support from the respondents. This is within the 3% margin of error.\n\nThe numbers change when respondents were given the option of choosing Robert Kennedy Jr. The Vice-President increases her lead over Trump in this scenario. Her lead increases to 4%. 42% of the respondents supported Harris, 38% supported Trump and 8% supported Kennedy Jr.\n\nA survey which was conducted by the Landmark Communications revealed that Trump had a marginal lead over his opponent. 48% of the registered voters who were surveyed supported Trump and only 46.7% of the respondents supported Harris. When other candidates were included, Trump led with 45.8% of the respondents supporting him in comparison to only 44.3% supporting Harris.\n\nEven this means that Trump's lead is within the five percent margin of error. Trump cannot gain any sense of comfort looking at the findings of these two surveys.\n\nTrump's campaign team pointed out another survey conducted by the Public Policy Polling which showed that Trump was leading in the key swing states of Arizona, Michigan, North Carolina and Pennsylvania.\n\nThe details of the survey are the following: Trump leads 46% to Harris' 41% in Michigan, 45% to 43% in Pennsylvania, 46% to 40% in Arizona and 48% to 44% in the state of North Carolina. These results were when third party candidates were included.\n\nIs there a law on national polling surveys in the US?\n\nEvery state has different laws on this topic. In most of the states, it is regulated.\n\nWhat is the mood as far as the electoral surveys are concerned?\n\nThere are different findings giving leads to different candidates. However, the general mood is that the contest is too close to call and there is a neck to neck competition.", "source": {"uri": "economictimes.indiatimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Economic Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_state", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Swing state"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ipsos", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ipsos"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_F._Kennedy", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Robert F.

These states contain many voters belonging to the Black and Hispanic communities. She has to increase her lead against Trump and gain more support from these two communities and voters below 35. In a recent survey that has been conducted by CNN/SSRS poll, it has been found that Vice-President Kamala Harris who is also the presumptive presidential nominee of the Democratic party has gained more support among the marginal sections of the society when compared to Donald Trump. The survey assessed the mood of the Black and Hispanic communities. Is this a reason to celebrate?\n\nPerhaps it may be a little early as the findings indicate that the support from these two communities will have to increase in Harris' favor. Her support in some key states will also be critical in ensuring her victory in November. Despite support from these two communities, it is still less than the support enjoyed by Biden during his election campaign in 2020.\n\nThe Black community supported Harris by an overwhelming majority. 78% of the Black Voters supported Harris in comparison to only 15% who supported Trump. Biden had a smaller lead in the same survey data from April to June. Biden had a lead over Trump. 70% of the voters supported Biden with only 23% of them supporting Trump.\n\nHarris may not be doing well with respect to the Hispanic voters. 47% supported Harris and only 45% supported Trump. In the case of Biden, 50% of them supported Trump and only 41% of them supported Biden.\n\nThere is no respite for Harris when young voters were surveyed. Voters under the age of 35, supported Harris but only marginally. 47% of the respondents supported Harris and only 43% supported Trump. When Joe Biden was in the race, 49% of the respondents supported Trump with only 42% supporting Biden.\n\nThese findings provide little comfort to Harris. As compared to the support enjoyed by Joe Biden during the 2020 presidential election, she is enjoying lesser support. Further, the support enjoyed by Biden in 2024 is not indicate of any substantial finding. He has been performing poorly after the first presidential debate.\n\nBiden road to success in the US Presidential Election in 2024 was going to be tough. To secure 270 electoral college votes, he had to win the northern battleground states of Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin as well as Nebraska's 2nd Congressional District. Biden's polling in the Sun Belt states of Arizona, Georgia, Nevada and North Carolina have also been poor.\n\nBiden struggled in the Sun Belt states due to the low level of support among the Blacks and the Hispanic communities.\n\nHarris will need to win the northern battle grounds as well as the sun-belt states to secure 270 electoral college votes.\n\nWhat is the size of the US Electoral College?\n\nThere are totally 538 delegates who form a part of the US electoral college. They represent the states and the districts. A presidential candidate has to win 270 votes from the electoral college.\n\nDoes the US Congress certify the Electoral College vote?\n\nThe Electoral College votes in December. This will need to be certified by the US Congress in January before the new president designate takes the oath of office.", "source": {"uri": "economictimes.indiatimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Economic Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_and_ethnicity_in_the_United_States_census", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Race and ethnicity in the United States census"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_state", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Swing state"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2020 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Electoral_College", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Electoral College"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oath_of_office", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oath of office"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nevada", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nevada"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nevada"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisconsin", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wisconsin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wisconsin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nebraska", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nebraska"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nebraska"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online_Issues_Polls", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online Issues Polls", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 86}], "image": "https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-112023607,width-1200,height-630,imgsize-13146,overlay-economictimes/photo.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9763361", "eventUri": "eng-9763361", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.5215686274509803, "wgt": 133, "relevance": 1}

Gavin Newsom (D), 4 percent named former first lady Michelle Obama and 3 percent each named Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg and Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer (D). Half of Democrats didn't name anyone specific as an alternative to Biden.\n\nEarlier in July, the Economist and YouGov polled Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents on potential replacement candidates for Biden. Harris had the highest net approval rating out of the Democrats tested.\n\nOther potential candidates, like Whitmer and Newsom, had similarly low disapproval ratings, but a much larger share of Democrats did not know who they were.\n\nBeyond Biden, many other prominent Democrats have already rallied around Harris.

In the time-honored Washington way, once Biden relented and stepped aside, people who just hours earlier had their boot on his neck raced to express their heartfelt respect and admiration for his judgment, selflessness and patriotism.\n\nWhat was a surprise was the speed with which the party apparatus ran to embrace Vice President Kamala Harris as the new Democratic nominee for president. Before Biden's decision, there was a lot of talk about possible replacements at the top of the ticket - not just Harris but Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro and others. But once Biden withdrew, there was a stampede to Harris. By Monday, a majority of House Democrats, a majority of Senate Democrats, a majority of Democratic governors, all of the state party chairs and, most important, a majority of the nearly 4,000 delegates to the Democratic National Convention had committed to support Harris.\n\nGet the hottest, most important news stories on the internet - delivered FREE to your inbox as soon as they break! Take just 30 seconds and sign up for WND's Email News Alerts!\n\nThat is consistent with what this column has said all along - that it would be very unlikely that Democrats, obsessed with identity, and especially with race and gender, would dump the first woman vice president of color in favor of someone else who polls better. So, in that way, the move to Harris makes perfect sense. But viewed another way, the race to crown Harris makes less sense, because she is a provably terrible candidate, possibly the worst candidate Democrats could field in their current situation.\n\nIn case you've forgotten, Harris ran for president in the 2020 Democratic primaries. It started well and ended badly.\n\nHarris chose Martin Luther King Jr. Day, Jan. 21, 2019, to make her announcement. By early March, she had climbed to third place in the 20-plus-candidate field, with 12% support, behind only Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden, according to a CNN poll. By late April - using the CNN poll throughout - she had slipped to sixth place, with 5% support, behind Biden, Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, Pete Buttigieg and Beto O'Rourke, according to the same poll.\n\nBy late June, though, she had shot up to 17% support, behind only Biden. But by mid-August, she crashed, from 17% down to 5%. By November, she slipped further to 3%, well behind where she started 10 months earlier. By the time the next poll was taken, in December, she was out of money, out of support and out of the race. She announced her withdrawal on Dec. 3, 2019, two months before the Iowa caucuses.\n\nThere's a reason Harris rose in the race and a reason she fell. The short version is that, for Democratic voters, Harris seemed appealing when she first started her campaign, and then they liked her less and less as they got to know her. Familiarity with the candidate killed her hopes.\n\nHer high point led to her low point. In a June 27 debate, Harris attacked Biden for Biden's opposition of mandatory school busing nearly 50 years earlier, in the early 1970s. \"There was a little girl in California who was part of the second class to integrate her public schools, and she was bused to school every day,\" Harris said to Biden. \"That little girl was me.\"\n\nNationally, the debate shot Harris into the top ranks of the field in terms of the attention paid to her. What voters saw afterward, though, was a candidate who had few ideas, who rambled, sometimes semi-coherently, when speaking, and who was not the centrist many Democrats were seeking.\n\nFor example, at her peak, Harris, who was then a Democratic senator from California, and who earlier, as state attorney general, focused on \"environmental justice,\" announced that she would file a bill expanding the progressive idea of \"justice\" to virtually every aspect of American life. \"Environmental justice is interconnected with every aspect of our fight for justice,\" she said in a statement to the left-wing publication Grist. \"From racial justice and economic justice, to housing justice and educational justice, we cannot disentangle the environment people live in from the lives they live.\" Referring to the riots taking place across the country, she added, \"These crises we are experiencing have exposed injustices in our nation that many of us have known and fought our entire lives.\"\n\nIt's not entirely clear what that meant, but it is clear that to non-progressive ears, it didn't sound good. And on other issues, as an MSNBC commentator noted Monday, beyond attacking Donald Trump, Harris in 2020 \"struggled to affirmatively say what she stood for.\" She was, in short, a terrible candidate who improbably ended up as Biden's running mate and then vice president of the United States.\n\nNow that Biden's infirmities have finally caught up with him, Harris appears to have the inside track to the Democratic presidential nomination. The Trump campaign should take her seriously, not because she is a good candidate, but because she will automatically have the vote of the millions of Americans who would vote for anyone other than Trump. That alone means she could win. So her GOP rivals should see the Harris campaign as a formidable opponent. But at the same time, it should be noted - and Harris herself will likely make it clear soon enough - that she is perhaps the worst candidate Democrats could choose to run for president.\n\nContent created by the WND News Center is available for re-publication without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

JD Vance (R-Ohio), in the November election. Since then, she's racked up endorsements from Democratic members of Congress and progressive groups focused on issues including climate, labor, and reproductive rights.\n\nMarch for Our Lives, which was launched after the 2018 mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, honored Harris with the group's first-ever endorsement on Wednesday, calling her \"the right person to stand up for us and fight for the country we deserve.\"\n\n\"To defeat Trump, you must rebuild support and enthusiasm among young voters.\"\n\nThe gun violence prevention organization is part of the youth-led coalition behind the new letter, which also includes the climate-focused Sunrise Movement; Gen-Z for Change, which advocates on a range of issues; and the national immigrant network United We Dream Action.\n\n\"You have an urgent and important task. To defeat Trump, you must rebuild support and enthusiasm among young voters,\" the coalition told Harris on Thursday, noting that she sought the Democratic nomination during the last cycle. \"You should build on your 2020 campaign platform where you put forward a strong vision to make the economy work for everyday people and ensure a livable future for us all.\"\n\nThe groups urged Harris to support the Green New Deal, Medicare for All, and the Reverse Mass Incarceration Act. They pushed her to expand pathways to citizenship, keep families together, end fossil fuel subsidies, and create good, union jobs. They also called on her to prioritize gun violence prevention and investments in public health solutions and green, affordable housing.\n\n\"Democrats are at a critical crossroads with young people,\" the coalition wrote to Harris on Thursday. \"Polls showed Biden and Trump neck-and-neck among young voters.\"\n\nANew York Times/Siena College poll conducted July 22-24 shows Trump leading Harris 48% to 47% among likely voters and 48% to 46% among registered voters -- differences that fall within the margin of error.\n\nForbesnoted Thursday that \"Democrats are far more enthusiastic about Harris than they were Biden, the Times/Siena survey found, with nearly 80% of voters who lean Democrat saying they would like Harris to be the nominee, compared to 48% of Democrats who said the same about Biden three weeks ago.\"\n\nThe outlet also pointed to two other polls conducted by Morning Consult and Reuters/Ipsos since Biden dropped out, which both show Harris with a narrow lead over Trump.\n\n\"You have an opportunity to win the youth vote by turning the page and differentiating yourself from Biden policies that are deeply unpopular with us, such as approving new oil and gas projects, denying people their right to seek refuge and asylum, and funding the Israeli government's killing of civilians in Gaza,\" the youth coalition highlighted Thursday. \"You must speak to the economic pain young people are facing from crushing student debt and skyrocketing housing and food prices.\"\n\nLooking beyond November, the groups told Harris -- who could be the first Black woman and person of Asian descent elected to the country's highest office -- that \"you could be a historic president. Not just because of who you are, but what you can accomplish.\"\n\n\"Young people are energized and ready to organize against fascism and for the future we deserve,\" they concluded. \"This is your chance to energize young people and our communities to vote, mount one of the greatest political comebacks in decades, and deliver a resounding defeat to the far-right agenda of Trump and Vance.\"",

The polls, conducted after Biden's withdrawal but before his Wednesday speech to the country, showed a supermajority of Americans think Harris was involved in concealing Biden's declining cognitive and physical condition. (RELATED: 'What Is She Willing To Hide?': MSNBC Swing Voter Panel Questions If Kamala Covered Up Biden Health Issues)\n\nA poll by YouGov for The Times showed that 54% of respondents believed that Biden's health issues were covered up, with 68% of those respondents saying they felt Harris had \"a great deal\" to do with concealing the truth about Biden's health. Another poll conducted by The Democracy Institute and Daily Express US found that 62% of Americans felt Harris \"lied\" to the American public about the president's health.\n\nThe YouGov poll was conducted between July 22-23, surveyed 1,170 registered voters and has a margin of error of 3.2%. The Democracy Institute/Daily Express US poll was done of July 24, surveyed 1,200 likely voters and has a 3% margin of error.\n\nDemocrats began calling for Biden to step aside following a poor performance in a June 27 CNN debate with former President Donald Trump, where he froze and lost his train of thought. Actor George Clooney noted in a July 10 New York Times op-ed that the Biden, at a June fundraiser prior to the debate, \"wasn't even the Joe Biden of 2020,\" but \"the same man we all witnessed at the debate.\" (RELATED: 'Kamala Was In On It': Trump-Aligned PAC Drops Anti-Kamala Harris Ad Less Than Two Hours After Biden Quit)\n\nTrump leads Harris by 1.9% in a national head-to-head matchup, according to the Real Clear Polling average of polls from July 5 to 24.

The candidates tied at 47% in the fifth state, Wisconsin.\n\nWhile the likely Democratic nominee is a long way from pole position, the numbers are a marked improvement over those posted by President Joe Biden in Emerson's final poll before he dropped out of the race.\n\nShe trims Trump's polling lead by four percentage points in Arizona, five in Georgia, and three in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Harris' favorability also exceeded Biden's by seven to 10 percentage points in each state.\n\n\"Harris has recovered a portion of the vote for the Democrats on the presidential ticket since the fallout after the June 27 debate,\" said Spencer Kimball, executive director of Emerson College polling. \"Harris' numbers now reflect similar support levels to those of Biden back in March.\"\n\nWhile some voters would prefer a different Democratic candidate, such as 36% of Arizona voters preferring U.S. Sen. Mark Kelly, support for Harris among Democratic voters exceeds 75% in each swing state.\n\nAs for Trump's favorability, he outpaces Harris in Arizona, Georgia, and Michigan by one to two percentage point gaps. Harris is seen more favorably in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin by just as slim a margin.\n\nTrump outperforms Harris with men in all five states by at least a 13-point margin. Harris has the advantage among women in every state, but she's far from dominant - her edge ranges from one point in Arizona to 12 points in Michigan and Wisconsin.\n\nThe poll also broke down the issues driving swing state voters to the polls. Economic issues top the list in all but Arizona, where it ranked second behind immigration. Immigration was the No. 2 in Georgia and Pennsylvania while threats to Democracy were No. 2 in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Housing affordability came third in all five states.\n\nThis and other recent polls indicate Harris has a little more oomph than the 81-year-old incumbent, though given his foundering support over the past few months, that's not an exceptionally high bar to clear. Still, Harris's name at the top of the ticket will make the presidential race more competitive than it's seemed since the Biden-Trump debate.\n\n-\"Democratic convention planners are working to pull off a dramatic Joe Biden-Kamala Harris role reversal\" via Will Weissert of The Associated Press\n\n-\"The 57 must-see lines from Trump's Charlotte speech\" via Chris Cillizza of So What\n\n-\"Harris narrows gap against Trump, Times/Siena poll finds\" via Shane Goldmacher, Ruth Igielnik and Camille Baker of The New York Times\n\n-\"A JD Vance-aligned think tank is stirring the pot with conservatives\" via Zachary Warmbrodt of POLITICO Magazine\n\n-\"Why almost everyone assumes Harris has to pick a White man as VP\" via Ashley Parker and Dylan Wells of The Washington Post\n\n-\"Dem women in state Legislature say outpouring of support for Harris is also coming from Florida\" via Jackie Llanos of the Florida Phoenix\n\n-\"Family, friend and longtime aides dominate Harris's inner circle\" via Tarini Parti of The Wall Street Journal\n\n-\"Harris tells teachers union she's ready to fight for country's future - 'bring it on'\" via Josh Boak of The Associated Press\n\n-\"Faith and politics: Catholic groups spend to defeat Florida's abortion rights amendment\" via Skyler Swisher of the Orlando Sentinel\n\n-\"Florida Republicans applaud California's banning of homeless camps\" via Ana Gon\u0303i-Lessan of the Tallahassee Democrat\n\n\"We saw the debate; we saw the speech last night.

After a six-kilometer trek, the final stages of the ceremony will take place at the Trocad\u00e9ro, across the Seine from the Eiffel Tower.\n\nA unique aspect of the ceremony is that it is open to all spectators without regard to a ticket. Organizers expect it to be the most attended opening ceremony in Olympic history.\n\nFor the United States Olympic team, basketball great LeBron James and tennis star Coco Gauff will serve as flag bearers. James becomes the first basketball player to carry the flag for the U.S. in an Olympic opening ceremony. Gauff was scheduled to compete in the 2020 Games in Tokyo but pulled out after testing positive for COVID-19.\n\nSome sports began competition before the opening ceremony, but this weekend the first medals will be awarded in sports as varied as shooting, diving, and cycling. The first medals will be awarded in swimming with the men's and women's 400-meter freestyle finals. That could include Katie Ledecky, now an assistant coach at the University of Florida, who could earn her 11th Olympic medal. Ledecky is also scheduled to compete in the 1500-meter freestyle, 4\u00d7200 freestyle relay, and the 800-meter freestyle.", "source": {"uri": "floridapolitics.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Florida Politics - Campaigns & Elections.

Biden stepped aside amid concerns over his ability to defeat former President Donald Trump after a disastrous debate performance in June.\n\nBiden endorsed Harris immediately after announcing he would not run for reelection, helping to pave the way for Harris to line up delegate votes from the Democratic Party.\n\nOther voters such as Donald Smart, an independent voter and attorney in Stratford, say the country is ready to elect a woman for president. Smart cited former President Barack Obama's groundbreaking election in 2008 as the nation's first Black president.\n\n\"Here we are in 2024 I would say that again, the country is never ready for something new until it happens, and then it's ready.

Another nine percent remain undecided. This coincides with the survey's findings that 68 percent do not believe Biden is \"mentally and physically capable of performing his duties as president for another four years.\"\n\nThe survey also showed a plurality, 38 percent, of Pennsylvania respondents saying that Bidenomics does not work \"at all\" for most middle class families in the state, compared to 15 percent who believe it works \"very well.\" The survey also found that most, 51 percent, said they were better off financially under Trump's term:\n\n\ud83d\udcca Pennsylvania GE: @NorthStarOpin\n\nDonald Trump: 47%\n\nKamala Harris: 45%\n\n\u2b1c Undecided: 9%\n\n--\n\nSenate\n\nBob Casey (inc): 49%\n\nDavid McCormick: 41%\n\n\u2b1c Undecided: 10%\n\n--\n\n* @theamgreatness | 7/20-23 | 600 LV\n\n* D44/R42 | 538 Rank: #228 (1.2/3.0)https://t.co/w37EWzue2i pic.twitter.com/PWhtT7aOOO\n\n-- InteractivePolls (@IAPolls2022) July 24, 2024\n\nFurther, the survey found that one in five, 21 percent, said the assassination attempt on Trump, which occurred in Butler, Pennsylvania, on July 13, makes them \"more likely\" to support Trump, although 68 percent said it has no real effect on their voting intentions. Additionally, over a quarter, 28 percent, said the assassination attempt has increased their support for Trump's leadership.

That fact, however, has not stopped the likes of Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-NY), who emphatically threw his support behind Harris this week, despite a clear lack of enthusiasm from his audience.\n\n\"In quick order, Vice President Harris has done a truly impressive job securing the majority of delegates needed to win the Democratic Party's nomination to be our next President to the United States. The vast majority of my senators quickly and enthusiastically endorsed her,\" he said, once again ignoring the fact that actual Democrat voters did not make this decision at all. Despite that startling fact, Schumer claimed that the process has \"played out from the grassroots bottom up.\"\n\n\"...we are here today to throw our support behind Vice President Kamala Harris,\" Schumer excitedly announced, clapping his hands. No one clapped, so Schumer said, \"I'm clapping. You don't have to\":\n\n\"Vice President Harris secured a majority of delegates. Today in Wisconsin and across America, we begin our next chapter, and it will be our best yet. Vice President Harris will beat Donald Trump and become the next President of the United States of America,\" Schumer said later in the press conference before pointing to the audience, wagging his finger, asking, \"Applause?\" Still, no one clapped:\n\nOne thing that conservatives predict will hurt Harris, particularly in Pennsylvania, is her opposition to fracking, as she stated in a 2020 CNN town hall: \"There's no question I'm in favor of banning fracking\":\n\n\"Starting with what we can do on day one around public lands and then there has to be legislation, but yes.

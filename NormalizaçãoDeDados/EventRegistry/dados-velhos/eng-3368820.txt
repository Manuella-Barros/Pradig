The answer, obviously, is a resounding yes -- there are many, many people who do not like the Rose of Tralee. There are many reasons why this is so -- it is seen as an anachronism, a throwback to the 1950s era that spawned it, when Church and State worked hand in hand to create an atmosphere akin to The Handmaid's Tale.

One or two would be trying out a few jokes. I'd tell them to do what comes naturally.\"\n\nAs for his own performance: \"Things will come out of my mouth. But what they are, I don't know.\"\n\nRT\u00c9 was criticised last year for staging a \"brutal\" on-camera cull of half of the original pool of contestants in order to gin up its fly-on-the-wall coverage, which won't happen again this year. However, the 65 hopefuls will still be cut back to 32 for the TV show, with the first 16 to make the cut announced at a new \"Celebration of Roses\" event at the Dome in Tralee on Thursday, and the second batch revealed at a private breakfast on Saturday morning, which will be attended by all 64 Roses (including the unfortunates who got the chop on Thursday night).\n\nAround 200 men aged between 21 and 30 applied to become Rose escorts at this year's festival. One of the successful applicants is 22-year-old Jackie Healy-Rae Jnr, son of poll-topping Kerry TD Michael Healy-Rae. \"Jackie was one of 120 called for interview, then we drilled it down to 70 who went through an endurance boot camp,\" said the festival's communications manager John Drummey. \"He came through it all. He's a perfect gentleman.\"\n\nThe current bookies' favourites are Sydney Rose Aisling Walsh and the Dublin Rose Maria Coughlan. This year's San Francisco Rose, Amanda Donohoe, is the sister and cousin of two of the young people who died two years ago in the Berkeley balcony tragedy.\n\nFollowing their unveiling in Malahide, the Roses travelled to Kerry, where their first official social engagement of an arduous week was the evening's greyhound races in Tralee.", "date": "2017-08-15", "categories": [{"uri":

The answer, obviously, is a resounding yes -- there are many, many people who do not like the Rose of Tralee. There are many reasons why this is so -- it is seen as an anachronism, a throwback to the 1950s era that spawned it, when Church and State worked hand in hand to create an atmosphere akin to The Handmaid's Tale. Fr Ted may have thoroughly skewered the festival via the 'Lovely Girls' contest, but perhaps we have come out the other side of it and can now appreciate the Rose festival for what it is -- slightly awkward, relatively harmless fun.\n\nThe Rose of Tralee is a many splendored thing -- here are just some of its wonders.\n\nFrom the outset it has never been a beauty pageant, because that might suggest humans feel desire, and that wouldn't have gone over well back in the 1950s when we reproduced via pollination. The Rose of Tralee is meant to be more about the kind of beauty that doesn't actually matter in the real world -- inner beauty. The qualities they seek are those reflected in the song of the same name -- that she be lovely and fair, like the first rose of summer. Or beautiful, as it is also known.\n\nEscorts\n\nLike a fringe festival of Lovely Boys, the escorts play a pivotal role by looking like they are going to a dress dance in Templemore training college, whilst making sure their Rose is assisted when alighting from buses or getting back onto buses, or that overseas Roses are taught about important aspects of Irish culture like why we hate the British, what a spicebag is, or how to sledge someone effectively at a puck-out.\n\nEven though it's best known as a brief TV spectacle, the Roses actually have to endure a long tour of duty around the country for some awkward photo shoots. Nowhere is safe -- shopping centres, wildlife parks, filling station forecourts, public amenity sites, no space is too insignificant or bleak for the Roses to be herded off a bus, only to get assaulted by a llama while someone else takes 300 photos.\n\nEven though it's best known as a brief TV spectacle, the Roses actually have to endure a long tour of duty around the country for some awkward photo shoots. Nowhere is safe -- shopping centres, wildlife parks, filling station forecourts, public amenity sites, no space is too insignificant or bleak for the Roses to be herded off a bus, only to get assaulted by a llama while someone else takes 300 photos.\n\nThe host\n\nFrom Gaybo, to Raybo, from Tubbs, to D\u00e1ith\u00ed, the key element to being the host is to be as awkward as humanly possible. This helps the Rose feel more normal, despite being trapped in an actual episode of Fr Ted. The secret is to be asexually bland, and not steal the limelight from the poor Rose -- Ray D'Arcy caused consternation the year that he did a cartwheel across the stage as it was deemed much better than most of the Roses' performances and almost saw him win the title.\n\nSome Roses are clearly destined for greatness -- look at a pre-stardom Gabby Logan's professional performance back in 1991. Then there are the Roses who look like they just found out they were expected to do a little party piece, and rattle out a bawdy Limerick or show how they can turn their eyelids inside out. Of course few can compare with the 2011 Dublin Rose, Siobheal Nic Eochaidh, whose wildly thrashing hip-hop dance routine looked like one of the scenes cut from The Exorcist.\n\nThe controversies\n\nSomehow you would expect that this gentlest of events would avoid becoming a scene of controversies, but sadly it seems even the Rose Dome has become a sort of analog Twitter in recent years. There was the fathers rights activist who dressed as a priest and stormed the stage with an illegible sign that made everyone think it said Farmers For Justice (which no doubt got a few cheers from the Macra escorts), to last year's Down Rose, who said the Roses were treated like animals in a circus, which was very upsetting as she had clearly never been to a circus. Those places are awful.\n\nThe Rose festival even had its very own Inception moment, when in 2013 a shot on Monday night's show included cutlery with the crest of the eventual winner printed on them, suggesting that -- shock, horror -- the winner might be decided before D\u00e1ith\u00ed opens the envelope on the Tuesday night. Although it seems fitting, given that the winner is meant to have the rose-like qualities espoused in the song, and thus would need to be a plant. The Rose Of Tralee may have its detractors -- and many awkward photo ops on actual tractors -- but it is still a very Irish affair. Until the organisers try to modernise it and turn it into some sort of reality TV Battle Royale, perhaps we should just appreciate it for what it is -- slightly quaint, gentle fun, that is definitely not a beauty pageant.", "date": "2017-08-16", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Concerts_and_Events", "wgt": 100, "id": 117, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Concerts and Events"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Agriculture_and_Forestry/Horticulture", "wgt": 100, "id": 476, "label": "dmoz/Business/Agriculture and Forestry/Horticulture"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Beauty", "wgt": 100, "id": 1142, "label": "dmoz/Health/Beauty"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "loc", "id": "76"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Republic of Ireland"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tralee"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tralee", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tralee"}, "type": "loc", "id": "112541"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Republic of Ireland"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Templemore"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Templemore", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Templemore"}, "type": "loc", "id": "112558"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Republic of Ireland"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Luimneach"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limerick", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Luimneach"}, "type": "loc", "id": "112803"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Republic of Ireland"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dublin"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dublin", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dublin"}, "type": "loc", "id": "113087"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 2, "id": "302546", "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildlife", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "304108", "label": {"eng": "Wildlife"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coming_out", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "308019", "label": {"eng": "Coming out"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "309111", "label": {"eng": "Irish people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filling_station", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "309722", "label": {"eng": "Filling station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Llama", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "313736", "label": {"eng": "Llama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beauty", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "314123", "label": {"eng": "Beauty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horror_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "316296", "label": {"eng": "Horror film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beauty_pageant", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "317103", "label": {"eng": "Beauty pageant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture_of_Ireland", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "326327", "label": {"eng": "Culture of Ireland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inception", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "355617", "label": {"eng": "Inception"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Exorcist_(film)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "356565", "label": {"eng": "The Exorcist (film)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anachronism", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "359163", "label": {"eng": "Anachronism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip-hop_dance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "375402", "label": {"eng": "Hip-hop dance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rose_of_Tralee_(festival)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "380792", "label": {"eng": "Rose of Tralee (festival)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabby_Logan", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "434031", "label": {"eng": "Gabby Logan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gay_Byrne", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "451526", "label": {"eng": "Gay Byrne"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_D'Arcy", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "454872", "label": {"eng": "Ray D'Arcy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forecourt", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "467644", "label": {"eng": "Forecourt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Handmaid's_Tale", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "596932", "label": {"eng": "The Handmaid's Tale"}}]}

Originally from Roscommon town, Laoise is in the final year of her Masters in Pharmacy at the University of Sunderland and said she wasn't one bit nervous about the selection either: \"I'm really just enjoying the whole experience and I'm not at all nervous, just excited for everyone.\"\n\nThe 2012 Rose, Nicola McEvoy, is back in Tralee again but this time as a judge. The secondary school teacher, who represented Luxemburg four years ago, has just moved back to her native Cork to take up a teaching post at a new Educate Together School in the city.\n\n\"It's nice to be on the other side and get the whole experience,\" she said.\n\nFellow judge, Orla Tobin, who represented Dublin and was the 2003 Rose of Tralee, is also back in Kerry as a judge this year.\n\nIt's been 14 years since Orla wore the crown and since then she's had four children ranging in ages from eight to one -- three future Roses and one future Escort, she jokes.\n\nReliving her Rose experience was Louise Thompson, a native of D\u00fan Chaoin, who represented South Australia in 2013. Louise brought daughters, Si\u00fan, 2, and Ellie, six months, to meet the Roses at the Blasket Centre, their first port of call on their West Kerry tour that also included a visit to Louis Mulcahy Pottery, Oceanworld Aquarium and of course, Fungie.\n\nAlso back again this year is Mary Hickey from Rathmore, who was the Kerry Rose in 2014 and remains close friends with her sister Roses. \"I'm privileged to be part of the chaperone team again this year,\" Mary said.", "date": "2017-08-18", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Social_Sciences/Archaeology", "wgt": 100, "id": 430, "label": "dmoz/Science/Social Sciences/Archaeology"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Agriculture_and_Forestry/Horticulture", "wgt": 100, "id": 476, "label": "dmoz/Business/Agriculture and Forestry/Horticulture"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "State of South Australia"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "State of South Australia"}, "type": "loc", "id": "67967"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Republic of Ireland"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tralee"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tralee", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tralee"}, "type": "loc", "id": "112541"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Republic of Ireland"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Roscommon"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roscommon", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Roscommon"}, "type": "loc", "id": "112631"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Republic of Ireland"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cill Airne"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killarney", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cill Airne"}, "type": "loc", "id": "112882"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Republic of Ireland"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kenmare"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenmare", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kenmare"}, "type": "loc", "id": "112921"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Republic of Ireland"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Great Blasket Island"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Blasket_Island", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Great Blasket Island"}, "type": "loc", "id": "112981"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Republic of Ireland"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dunquin"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunquin", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dunquin"}, "type": "loc", "id": "113065"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Republic of Ireland"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dublin"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dublin", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dublin"}, "type": "loc", "id": "113087"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Republic of Ireland"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dingle"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dingle", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dingle"}, "type": "loc", "id": "113125"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Republic of Ireland"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cork"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cork_(city)", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cork"}, "type": "loc", "id": "113162"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raidi\u00f3_Teilif\u00eds_\u00c9ireann", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "303390", "label": {"eng": "Raidi\u00f3 Teilif\u00eds \u00c9ireann"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "305227", "label": {"eng": "Pharmacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilkenny_GAA", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "309207", "label": {"eng": "Kilkenny GAA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerry_GAA", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "309329", "label": {"eng": "Kerry GAA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veterinary_medicine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "315729", "label": {"eng": "Veterinary medicine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_school", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "321280", "label": {"eng": "Secondary school"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rose_of_Tralee_(festival)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "380792", "label": {"eng": "Rose of Tralee (festival)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marty_Morrissey", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "384033", "label": {"eng": "Marty Morrissey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Educate_Together", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "518487", "label": {"eng": "Educate Together"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Sunderland", "type": "org", "score": 2, "id": "565642", "label": {"eng": "University of Sunderland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Kerry_GAA", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "748890", "label": {"eng": "West Kerry GAA"}}]}

It took so long to sink in. I had no idea. There was no indication that it would be me.\n\nAll of the girls were amazing. So I was shocked when I got it,\" a thrilled Laura tells the Longford Leader.\n\nNow she's down in Kerry for the Rose of Tralee International Festival, which is taking place from August 16 to 22, and will see Laura join 63 other Roses from all over the world, hoping to be crowned this year's Rose of Tralee.\n\nLaura would be over the moon if she were to win the prestigious title.\n\n\"I think shock would be the first emotion and then I would just be inexpressibly grateful,\" says Laura.\n\n\"The experiences it brings are truly outstanding and I feel it would ultimately enable me to better understand and help people.\n\n\"I'm feeling all types of emotions at the moment. I still have lots to do but I know once everything is packed and I'm on the road I can just relax, take everything in and enjoy every minute,\" she says ahead of the big festival.\n\n\"I think I'm most looking forward to meeting all 63 other roses.\n\n\"The whole experience will be incredible, but it's the people we get to meet that make it so special.\"\n\nSince becoming the Longford Rose, Laura has attended various events, including Ladies Day at the Galway Races, the opening of the Killoe Men's Shed, and the County Longford Show, to name a few.\n\n\"(Being the Longford Rose) has been so much fun! I've loved meeting so many new people and I really hope I can do the whole county proud... fingers crossed!\"\n\nOf course, Laura is quick to praise the level of support she has received over the past few months. As the Longford Rose, she's certainly received a lot of attention, but she hasn't let it go to her head.\n\n\"I am so grateful for the people and businesses of Longford's support. The whole experience is quite pricey and they have really helped me out,\" she says gratefully.\n\n\"Just some are Moments Caf\u00e9, Duffy's Supervalu Edgeworthstown, Keenan's of Tarmonbarry, Luigi's, Longford Credit Union, O'Hanlon's Pharmacy, Ward's Pharmacy, McNally Motors, Providers, Fabiani, Peter Reilly, John Joe Brennan - Painter and Decorater, Noel Murphy Fitness Factory, Torc Caf\u00e9.\n\n\"My family, boyfriend and friends have also been so good to me and helped me enormously since I was selected. I don't know what I'd do without them.\n\n\"Any attention I've gotten has been support, which is really nice. I've also been working full time all summer so there are days when I'll have an event in the afternoon and have to go straight to work then so it doesn't take me long to get back down to earth,\" she laughs.\n\nA Psychology student in Dublin, the Edgeworthstown lady works part time as a waitress in Keenan's of Tarmonbarry.\n\n\"The staff there are wonderful and have been so supportive of my journey as Longford Rose,\" she says.\n\nRose of Tralee aside, Laura is a highly intelligent woman with a keen interest in her studies and has big plans for the future.\n\nShe hopes to further her education in Psychology and run her own business, helping people to better themselves.\n\n\"I love reading books on positive psychology, self-improvement and the connection between the mind and the body,\" she explains.\n\n\"Eventually I would love to have my own business where I could help people improve their lives.\n\n\"I haven't quite figured out exactly what the idea is yet but I'm only 20 so I have lots of time to figure it out.\"\n\nLaura is one of the beautiful voices of the local girl band, Celtic Chique, and recently took part in the X Factor fundraising event ahead of the Longford Summer Festival, so it seemed logical to ask her if she sees music in her future.\n\n\"I love performing with the girls and I do love music but I don't think it will ever be a career path for me,\" she admits.\n\n\"I would love to get involved in more productions around Longford though!\"\n\nSo not even her passion for music and performance will drag her away from her studies.\n\nIn fact, Laura's interest in psychology and self-improvement is so keen that she actually lists attendance at a big seminar as one of her achievements in life.\n\n\"I recently attended a Tony Robbins seminar in New York City,\" she explains.\n\n\"He is an American life coach, author and philanthropist. His seminars are just incredible.\n\n\"I won't go into it too much but I say it's one of my achievements because I worked really hard to get the money to attend and I also travelled to it by myself.\n\n\"Everyone should listen to some of Tony Robbins material at some point, he's amazing!\"\n\nWith a drive and a passion like that, it would be no surprise when Laura does achieve her goals.\n\nAnd, if being crowned the Rose of Tralee is one of those goals, she's certainly in with as good a chance as any of the other girls at the Dome this week.\n\nBut for Laura, who was pleasantly surprised to even be crowned the Longford Rose, it's all about the experience, meeting new people, and enjoying the journey while she represents Longford.\n\n\"Being chosen to represent my home of County Longford and its remarkable people is an honour I truly cherish and I cannot wait for Tralee and all that it will bring,\" she says.\n\nOf course, while Laura is certainly the Belle of the ball as far as Longford is concerned, you can't have Roses without their escorts, and Longford will certainly be well-represented on that front, with Killoe man Daniel Keogh all set to suit up for the festival.\n\n\"There are 64 lads.

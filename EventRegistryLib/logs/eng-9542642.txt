Coen, the Chief Accounting Officer of Ginkgo Bioworks Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:DNA), sold shares of the company's stock, resulting in a total sale value exceeding $111,000. The transaction, which took place on May 2, 2024, involved the sale of 131,928 shares at a price of $0.845 each.\n\nThis sale follows a series of transactions that occurred at the beginning of the month, where Coen acquired a significant number of shares through the vesting of restricted stock units (RSUs). On May 1, 2024, Coen acquired 281,955 shares and an additional 12,500 shares, totaling 294,455 shares of Class A Common Stock. These transactions were related to the company's equity incentive plans and were not open market purchases, as they were acquired at no cost to the officer.\n\nThe sale on May 2 was conducted to cover tax withholding obligations associated with the vesting of the RSUs. Ginkgo Bioworks' equity incentive plans allow for tax withholding obligations to be funded through a \"sell to cover\" transaction, a common practice among companies to facilitate the payment of taxes due on vested shares.\n\nFollowing the sale, Coen's ownership in the company decreased, but he still retains a significant stake with 162,527 shares of Class A Common Stock.\n\nInvestors and market watchers often scrutinize insider transactions as they can provide insights into an executive's view on the company's current valuation and future prospects. However, it should be noted that transactions related to tax obligations are typically planned in advance and may not necessarily reflect the executive's outlook on the company's performance.\n\nGinkgo Bioworks Holdings specializes in biological engineering and is known for its platform that enables the growth of cell programming capabilities. The company operates in a dynamic and rapidly evolving industry, and insider transactions are closely watched for indications of confidence and strategic planning by its leadership.\n\nAs Ginkgo Bioworks Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:DNA) navigates through the complexities of the biological engineering sector, recent insider transactions have raised questions about the company's stock valuation and financial health. To provide investors with a clearer picture, insights from InvestingPro reveal several key metrics and tips that can help in assessing the company's current standing.\n\nAn important InvestingPro Tip to consider is that Ginkgo Bioworks holds more cash than debt on its balance sheet, indicating a sound financial position that could weather potential market uncertainties. This tip is particularly relevant as it contrasts with the company's current profitability challenges, as analysts do not anticipate Ginkgo Bioworks to be profitable this year. This insight is crucial for investors who are weighing the company's growth potential against its earnings outlook.\n\nExamining the InvestingPro Data, Ginkgo Bioworks has a market capitalization of $2.18 billion USD. Despite the company's high gross profit margin of 78.52% for the last twelve months as of Q4 2023, it has experienced a significant revenue decline of 47.36% during the same period. Additionally, the stock price has witnessed a sharp decline, with a 3-month price total return of -25.97%, which aligns with the InvestingPro Tip that the price has fallen considerably over the last three months. These figures could influence investor sentiment and decision-making, especially in light of the recent insider sales.\n\nFor those interested in a deeper analysis, there are 6 additional InvestingPro Tips available, which could further inform investment strategies.

(NYSE:DNA) institutional owners after losing 25% over the past year", "body": "If you want to know who really controls Ginkgo Bioworks Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:DNA), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 49% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.\n\nInstitutional investors would probably welcome last week's 11% increase in the share price after a year of 25% losses as a sign that returns may to begin trending higher.\n\nLet's delve deeper into each type of owner of Ginkgo Bioworks Holdings, beginning with the chart below.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Ginkgo Bioworks Holdings\n\nMany institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market.

Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Ginkgo Bioworks Holdings, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.\n\nIt would appear that 6.5% of Ginkgo Bioworks Holdings shares are controlled by hedge funds. That worth noting, since hedge funds are often quite active investors, who may try to influence management.

Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is Baillie Gifford & Co. with 11% of shares outstanding. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 8.6% and 6.9%, of the shares outstanding, respectively. In addition, we found that Jason Kelly, the CEO has 3.9% of the shares allocated to their name.\n\nOn further inspection, we found that more than half the company's shares are owned by the top 8 shareholders, suggesting that the interests of the larger shareholders are balanced out to an extent by the smaller ones.\n\nWhile it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.\n\nThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.\n\nMost consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.\n\nIt seems insiders own a significant proportion of Ginkgo Bioworks Holdings, Inc.. Insiders own US$392m worth of shares in the US$2.1b company. That's quite meaningful. It is good to see this level of investment.

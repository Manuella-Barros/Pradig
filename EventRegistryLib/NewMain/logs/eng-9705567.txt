San Antonio Spurs fans may find themselves backing another contender, France, led by their 7-foot-3 star Victor Wembanyama. The French national team recently faced Turkey in an exhibition game on Wednesday as part of their preparations for the upcoming Paris Summer Olympics.\n\nFrance came out with guns blazing with a convincing 96-46 victory over Turkey. Wembanyama showed his NBA-season form with an impressive performance.\n\nThe Spurs prodigy was everywhere scoring 24 points, grabbing 6 rebounds, snatching 2 steals, blocking 3 shots, and dishing out 4 assists, shooting 10-14 from the field in only 20 minutes of play. Wembanyama led the game with a remarkable +44 plus-minus while on the court.\n\nFrance demonstrated excellent team cohesion, recording 18 assists and surged to a 22-point halftime lead.\n\nFrance's twin towers\n\nLes Bleus deployed a twin tower combination featuring Wembanyama and Rudy Gobert. Initial concerns about how they would mesh offensively were swiftly dispelled.\n\nThe high-low game between Wembanyama and Gobert proved to be highly effective and difficult for opponents to defend against. Both players showcased their abilities as finishers and passers. With their blend of size and skill, France is poised to excel with them on the court.\n\nFrance's defensive duo of Gobert and Wembanyama was insurmountable for Turkey. Gobert, last season's Defensive Player of the Year, and Wembanyama, the runner-up, anchored the paint effectively, allowing France's guards to apply aggressive pressure on defense.\n\nThe French national team limited Turkey to just 11 made field goals throughout the game. France's defense also forced Turkey into committing 19 turnovers.\n\nTurkey struggled immensely when Victor Wembanyama was on the floor, managing just one made field goal out of 24 attempts. Wemby's defensive presence significantly disrupted Turkey's momentum.\n\nWembanyama showing promise with international competition\n\nWembanyama showcased his defensive prowess with a blocked three-pointer and contributed offensively with several impressive lobs and a solid 50% shooting accuracy from beyond the arc (2-4). He demonstrated versatility by accelerating transitions with adept ball handling, applying full-court defensive pressure on guards, and executing smooth post plays.\n\nFrance's offensive strategy centers on getting the ball to their 7-footers in the paint and relying on ball movement. The guards frequently targeted Victor Wembanyama, connecting with him for several lob passes during the game.\n\nTurkey did not feature any NBA players this offseason, as Houston Rockets center Alperen Seng\u00fcn is still recovering from an ankle sprain that sidelined him for much of last season.\n\nThe evening also saw Bilal Coulibaly make his debut, with Isa\u00efa Cordinier in the shooting guard position and Matthew Strazel handling point guard duties.\n\nWith France's recent performance, it seems like they are one of the teams that could give Team USA a run for their money. The United States Men's Basketball team features big-time superstars like LeBron James, Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant and Anthony Davis to name a few.\n\nFrance has four more exhibition games scheduled before the Olympics begin in late July. Their next game is against Germany on July 8 at 2 p.m. CT, with all matches available for streaming on NBA.com.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"},

He looked slick as he scored a game-high 24 points and grabbed six rebounds in front of a sold-out crowd of around 5,500 in Rouen.\n\nIt was the first of six warmup matches for France, heading into the July 26-Aug. 11 Games.\n\n\"Victor played a 'Wemby game.\u00b4 He was imposing in defense and varied things in attack. It's something we've never really known before in the France team,\" captain Nicolas Batum said. \"It's a great asset for us, one we will be able to use in many situations.\"\n\nThe 20-year-old San Antonio Spurs star also combined well with veteran Minnesota Timberwolves center Rudy Gobert in their first outing together for France. The 32-year-old Gobert was named the NBA\u00b4s Defensive Player of the Year for a record-tying fourth time, with Wembanyama second in the voting.\n\n\"There's still work to be done,\" Batum said, looking ahead to the Olympics. \"But when you have two greats (Wembanyama and Gobert), it helps a lot.\"\n\nFILE - San Antonio Spurs center Victor Wembanyama (1) shoots ahead of Memphis Grizzlies forward GG Jackson (45) in the first half of an NBA basketball game April 9, 2024, in Memphis, Tenn.

(AP Photo/Brandon Dill, File)\n\nThere were also some impressive defense from Washington Wizards rookie guard Bilal Coulibaly.\n\nFrance lost 87-82 to the United States in the gold-medal game at the Tokyo Olympics but hopes are high that coach Vincent Collet's side can win gold at home. France is considered among the strongest teams alongside the U.S, Canada, Serbia and world champion Germany.\n\nLast week, Wembanyama was asked about the prospect of another France-USA final, against the likes of LeBron James and Stephen Curry.\n\n\" I can\u00b4t wait to face them, it will be a very interesting matchup,\" he said in Paris. \"As a basketball player, it\u00b4s also a dream to play against Team USA and even against all those players, all those legends.\"\n\nFrance's first Group B opponent at the Olympics will be the winner of the last qualifying tournament later this week. It then plays Japan and Germany in the 12-team field, held in the northern city of Lille.\n\nFrench basketball is enjoying immense popularity on the back of Wembanyama's meteoric rise and the emergence of new talents.\n\nThis year's top two NBA draft picks are French - Zaccharie Risacher (Atlanta Hawks) and Alexandre Sarr (Washington Wizards) - with Tidjane Sala\u00fcn drafted No. 6 by the Charlotte Hornets.\n\nFrance joined the United States as the only countries with three players drafted in the top 10 picks of an NBA draft. Pacome Dadiet (New York Knicks) and Melvin Ajinca (Dallas Mavericks) made it five Frenchmen selected overall.\n\nAP Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/2024-paris-olympic-games", "source": {"uri":

In the moment, that was enough, as Wembanyama put his arms down and trotted back toward his team's sideline to prepare for the matchup ahead.\n\nThen, he went on to score more than half of Turkey's entire point total. Les Bleus emerged victorious, 96-56, behind the 20-year-old's stellar performance as he finished with 24 points, six rebounds, four assists, two steals and three blocks. He didn't do it alone, however.\n\nAlongside him was Minnesota Timberwolves center Rudy Gobert. The French big who beat him out in the Defensive Player of the Year rankings.\n\nNow, his teammate.\n\nWith both of the two best defenders in the NBA, France was able to hold Turkey to under 50 points, and in the 20 minutes that Wembanyama was on the floor, the team as a whole shot 1-24. Wembanyama's presence on defense clearly disrupted any momentum that Turkey hoped to build, not to mention the chemistry that was born from a month's worth of preparation.\n\nIf the odds needed to fall in the favor of France anymore, Turkey didn't field any NBA players this offseason as Houston Rockets center Alperen Seng\u00c3\u00bcn continues to recover from an ankle sprain that made him miss ample playing time last season. As such, the win isn't as telling as it could have been \u00e2\u20ac\" in fact, it might have been moreso if the game had been close or fallen the other way.\n\nThat doesn't mean it wasn't a good boost of momentum for France, however, which will attempt to give the United States some competition for gold this summer.

In the 20 minutes that Wemby was on the floor, he forced the Turkish players into 9 turnovers, kept them to just 1-24 from the field, 1-10 inside the arc, and 0-14 from the three-point line. He limited them to a meager 10 points during his time on the court\n\nWembanyama was sensational not just defensively, but offensively as well. He put up 24 points, 6 rebounds, and 4 assists. He went 71% from the field, and 50% from the three-point line. Defensively, Wemby secured 3 blocks and 1 steal as he helped the French team win by 50 points over Turkey.\n\nThe 96-46 victory for France didn't come just because of Wembanyama alone, but his partnership with Rudy Gobert. The two frontrunners for the NBA Defensive Player of the Year award last season combined very well, dispelling a lot of fears over their fit together.\n\nGobert put up 10 points, 5 rebounds, 2 assists, and 1 block. The true power of both players' defensive prowess will be unlocked in international games, as neither will be restricted by the stringent defensive rules of the NBA, such as the three-second rule for example.\n\nFrance looks like it can pose a genuine threat to the dominance of the United States at this year's Olympics. Not only do they have some of the best players in the NBA, including the reigning Defensive Player of the Year and Rookie of the Year, but they are also going to have the support of the home crowd since the games are being held in Paris.\n\nFrench Basketball On The Rise In The NBA\n\nThe success of Victor Wembanyama and Rudy Gobert has indicated the rise of France as a basketball powerhouse in the NBA. Not only are the reigning Rookie of the Year and Defensive Player of the Year from France, but the first two picks in the 2024 NBA Draft, Zaccharie Risacher and Alex Sarr are both from France as well.\n\nWhile the NBA has had French stars in the past, like Tony Parker, they have never had such a wealth of superstar-caliber players in the league from France. It really speaks to the incredible line of athletes that the country has produced that they are doing so well.\n\nPrior to Joel Embiid declaring to compete for the United States, France expected to have Embiid represent them and was going to start him alongside Wembanyama and Gobert. While losing a player the caliber of Embiid can be difficult, it speaks to the talent of the French team that they are still looking incredibly dominant without him.\n\nThe French National Team will be one to watch at the 2024 Olympic Games in Paris. Despite his youth, Wembanyama looks to be one of the best young players in recent memory, and he has shown that the spotlight is not too bright for him at all. It will be interesting to see how they do in the summer tournament.\n\nRelated: Alex Sarr Believes Bam Adebayo Is Better Than Victor Wembanyama\n\nThank you for being a valued reader of Fadeaway World.

We'll call it an improved workout.\"\n\nBut this meeting will show a first sample of the tandem of the two interiors Rudy Gobert (32 years old) and Victor Wembanyama (20 years old), immense in size (2.16 m for the first, 2.24 m for the second) and in potential, both offensive and defensive.\n\nThe excitement is as high as this duo.\"It's something I've never seen before\", slips Wembanyama, when Gobert estimates that\"there are really no limits to the things they'll try to accomplish together\".\n\nThe team should revolve around the two interiors since the Blues management has decided to base its identity on defense. Gobert, voted best defender in the NBA for the fourth time this season, and Wembanyama, with extraordinary mobility for his size and wingspan, are among the best in the world in this area.\n\n\"The goal is really that we are able to defend against all teams, says Gobert. Maybe I can defend further outside knowing that there is another wall behind me, and vice versa.\"\n\nThe success of the Blues will also depend on the ability of both players to be able to be aligned at the same time on the floor in attack. \"I think we will have more responsibilities in defense, but the bulk of the work will be in attack\", believes \"Wemby\".\n\nFrom this point of view, two reasons for hope: Wembanyama demonstrated this season at Spurs that he could play far from the basket, notably thanks to his outside shot, and Gobert can build on his very successful season in Minnesota alongside Karl-Anthony Towns, which peaks at 2.13m.\n\nAlso read: Paris 2024 Olympic Games: the Lille Olympic Village, which will host basketball and handball, has been inaugurated\n\nThe French team only has one month to manage to play these two greats who have never played together, and whose association goes against the grain of basketball of the last ten years.", "source": {"uri":

Led by Wembanyama, the French basketball team gets its preparations for the Games off to a perfect start against Turkey - The Bobr Times", "body": "Victor Wembanyama a port\u00e9 la France face \u00e0 la Turquie. FFBB - armand lenoir\n\nL'\u00e9quipe de France de basket a parfaitement commenc\u00e9 sa pr\u00e9paration lors de son premier match face \u00e0 la Turquie, mercredi 3 juillet \u00e0 Rouen.\n\nThe French basketball team began its preparation for the Olympic Games with a demonstration against Turkey (96-46) on Wednesday in Rouen, led by Victor Wembanyama, already sparkling. In attack and defense, \"Wemby\" dominated (24 points, 6 rebounds, 4 assists), meeting the expectations of the Blues and Kindarena management, packed for the occasion (5,467 spectators), and establishing himself as THE star of the team.\n\nOf course, this individual performance, like the fine collective performance delivered by France, must be put into perspective to the extent that the Turks played this meeting without their three best players: Alperen Sengun, Cedi Osman and Furkan Korkmaz.\n\nBut this performance brings hope. Firstly because the Blues responded, overall, to the main expectation of their coach Vincent Collet, by defending the lead. The Norman intends to make his team the best defense in the Olympic tournament, relying on the exceptional qualities in this area of his two interiors Rudy Gobert (elected best defender in the NBA four times) and Wembanyama.\n\nVincent Collet was delighted with this first defensive try, but also with the speed driven by his players: \"This evening, c& rsquo;was a first step. In our identity, there is also the recovery, we scored 43 points in this sector.\"\n\nMain flat: \"Our setups are sometimes too slow, and against teams that are harder to play, that's a real problem\", he noted. The two giants, 2.16 m for Gobert, 2.24 m for Wembanyama, started this first preparation match together, forming a racket which peaked at 2.20 m on average. Above all, they managed to play together, \"Wemby\" finding \"Rudy\" on several occasions for easy points, like the one that opened the Blues festival.\n\nThis match served as a laboratory of experiments for Vincent Collet, who lined up several different fives, starting with Matthew Strazel, Isa\u00efa Cordinier, Bilal Coulibaly (who was playing his first match with the selection) and the two interiors. Very dominant in the racket and stifling in defense, especially on the outside lines, this five gave way to Th\u00e9o Maledon, Nadir Hifi, Evan Fournier, Guerschon Yabusele and Mathias Lessort.\n\nAfter a first quarter dominated by the French (26-14), a third major five was tested: Frank Ntilikina, Nando de Colo, \u00c9lie Okobo, captain Nicolas Batum and Wembanyama , this time at the pivot position. It was in this suit that the twenty-year-old scored, showcasing his unique combination of size, mobility and technical palette. His teammates have searched for him a lot in the air, where he is a threat to every defense in the world, often finding him above Turks with no solution.\n\nFrom 46-26 at halftime, the score swelled further in the second half. Despite some messy passages understandable for a first match, this meeting allowed several players to show themselves: the leader Matthew Strazel undoubtedly scored points in his ability to defend with enormous intensity and rsquo; organize the attack, just like Frank Ntilikina in this position and Coulibaly on the wing, sometimes blocker, sometimes finisher. Adversity will rise several notches on Saturday in Cologne, where the French team will face Germany, the world champion.", "source": {"uri": "bobrtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "bobrtimes.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victor_Wembanyama", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Victor Wembanyama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rouen", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rouen"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rouen"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudy_Gobert", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rudy Gobert"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vincent_Collet", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Vincent Collet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Turkey"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Turkey"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alperen_\u015eeng\u00fcn", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alperen \u015eeng\u00fcn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France_men's_national_basketball_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "France men's national basketball team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Federation_of_Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "French Federation of Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Furkan_Korkmaz", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Furkan Korkmaz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cedi_Osman", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cedi Osman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball_at_the_Summer_Olympics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Basketball at the Summer Olympics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Strazel", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Matthew Strazel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/\u00c9lie_Okobo", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "\u00c9lie Okobo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isa\u00efa_Cordinier", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Isa\u00efa Cordinier"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Th\u00e9o_Maledon", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Th\u00e9o Maledon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathias_Lessort", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mathias Lessort"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evan_Fournier", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Evan Fournier"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolas_Batum", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nicolas Batum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nando_de_Colo", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nando de Colo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Captain (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Ntilikina", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Frank Ntilikina"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guerschon_Yabusele", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Guerschon Yabusele"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Flying_Discs/Ultimate_Frisbee", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Flying Discs/Ultimate Frisbee", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show_Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 52}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9705567", "eventUri": "eng-9705567", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 165, "relevance": 1}

Perhaps Wemby was a little too locked-in because he didn't notice his teammates pulling a prank on him.\n\nWembanyama came out onto the court first. He soon realized that his teammates didn't follow.\n\nNewly signed Los Angeles Clippers forward Nicolas Batum seemed to be the mastermind of the tomfoolery, as he was seen grabbing fellow NBA veteran Evan Fournier behind Wemby.\n\nTeam France put an end to their playful mood once the game began. They completely crushed Turkey in a 96-46 blowout.\n\nWembanyama took his frustrations out on the court. In just 20 minutes of action, the Spurs star tallied 24 points on 10-of-14 shooting to go along with six rebounds, four assists, two steals, and three blocks. He led the team with a +44 point differential during his limited time on the floor.\n\nWatching the action on the court proved to be just as terrifying as the final score suggests. The French team fielded a lineup that used both Rudy Gobert and Wembanyama, the 2024 NBA Defensive Player of the Year and runner-up, respectively.\n\nThe Turks did not have a pleasant time dealing with the Eiffel Twin Towers.\n\nA potential Team USA vs. Team France clash at the Paris Olympics will be an interesting matchup to say the least.", "source": {"uri": "postandcourier.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Post and Courier"}, "authors": [{"uri": "r_p_salao@postandcourier.com", "name": "R.P.

Overlooking the structure, two immense towers raise the deck high above the waters of the Seine. But on Wednesday, July 3, just a stone's throw from the bridge, two other towers were attracting attention: Victor Wembanyama (\"Wemby\") and Rudy Gobert, teamed up for the first time in the blue jersey of the French men's basketball team.\n\nFor several years now, the French Basketball Federation (FFBB) has been keen to organize its summer matches in France, in order to \"show off the jersey,\" and connect its stars playing in the NBA - the North American professional league - with the French territory. And they weren't going to change their traditions with the Olympic summer in France. Except for a trip to Cologne, Germany, the French men's team will be playing all its warm-up games at home, from Lyon to Montpellier, via Orleans and Rouen.\n\nLes Bleus kicked off their pre-Paris 2024 campaign against Turkey on Wednesday in the Seine-Maritime prefecture. And it was a big win (96-46), aided by their \"twin towers,\" in the words of Vincent Collet. \"There's inevitably a question mark over this pairing, and we talk about it a lot with my assistants,\" admitted the French coach on June 27, during Les Bleus' media day. Because [in basketball] it's often considered very difficult to get two players over 2.15 meters to play together.\" Gobert is 2.16 meters tall, while Wembanyama peaks at 2.24 meters.\n\n\"But Victor has a mobility that is not usual with a player [of his size],\" added Collet, smiling, seduced by the potential of the combination between the NBA's best defender of the year and his runner-up, himself crowned best rookie of the season and a new phenomenon in world basketball.\n\nIn this first outing for Les Bleus on the road to the Paris Olympics, their double act started with the very first action. Served behind the three-point line, Wemby sent the ball dipping out of reach of the opposing team and to his teammate Gobert, who served up and scored the first French points. A few minutes later, it was the same story. Served on the move, Wembanyama drew two defenders to him, and found his partner with a ground pass, the conclusion of an ideal start to the game (11-0). \"It's obvious that their defensive partnership is not a problem. In attack, Victor showed his ability to pass, and Rudy benefited from that,\" enthused Collet after the match.\" But in terms of covering space in defense, with both of them, I've never seen anything like it.\"", "source": {"uri": "lemonde.fr", "dataType": "news", "title": "Le Monde.fr"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Seine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Federation_of_Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "French Federation of Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rouen", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rouen"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rouen"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victor_Wembanyama", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Victor Wembanyama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudy_Gobert", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rudy Gobert"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normandy", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Normandy"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Normandy"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "France national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overseas_France", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Overseas France"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vincent_Collet", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vincent Collet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prefectures_in_France", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prefectures in France"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyon", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lyon"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Lyon"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montpellier", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Montpellier"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Montpellier"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seine-Maritime", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Seine-Maritime"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Seine-Maritime"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cologne", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cologne"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cologne"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Turkey"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Turkey"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show_Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 79}], "image": "https://img.lemde.fr/2024/06/27/115/0/4465/2232/1440/720/60/0/330b154_5912207-01-06.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9705567", "eventUri": "eng-9705567", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-03", "textStart": 218, "textEnd": 224}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-27", "textStart": 1284, "textEnd": 1291}], "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 161, "relevance": 1}

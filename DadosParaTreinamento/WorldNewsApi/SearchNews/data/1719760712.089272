The company states that the government\u2019s termination of their agreement on May 27 2024, coupled with the absence of a handover period, has caused significant uncertainty for staff. Employees of Larnaca\u2019s port and marina were laid off by Kition Ocean Holdings Ltd on Wednesday evening, following the project\u2019s collapse. In its statement, the company put the blame on the government. It said: \u201cThe Government chose not to have a handover period, that would allow for a smooth transition of the operations. Instead, it showed up with Police escort but without a real plan or direction especially regarding the employees.\u201d The company added that \u201cthis brutal takeover has caused great disturbance among the employees, who are rightly worried about their future.\u201d According to Kition, the situation is clearly governed by the Law Providing for the Preservation and Safeguard of the Rights of Employees on the Transfer of Undertakings, Businesses, or Sections of Business of 2000 (TUPE), which stipulates the automatic transfer of employees, along with their existing rights, in the event of a business takeover. \u201cThis law is there to protect employees from being terminated when there is a transfer of business. This law also applies when the Government takes over according to Cyprus and European court cases\u2026 Kition has communicated the transfer to the employees, explaining the TUPE legislation, and that their terms and conditions of employment will remain unchanged as they move to the new employer,\u201d the company said. Despite assurances from the government that employees will not be victimised, Kition Ocean Holdings seeks reassurance that the TUPE legislation will be adhered to, ensuring the protection of employees\u2019 rights. \u201cIn official statements\u2026 the Government is giving assurances that the employees will not be victimized, and a formula will be found for them to continue their employment\u2019. TUPE law mandates that the transfer of employment is automatic and must include all employees, therefore it is not clear to us what formulas are to be found,\u201d the company stated. Kition noted it also engaged an independent lawyer to advise employees of their rights, demonstrating its commitment to ensuring employees\u2019 rights are fully upheld during this transition.

But he\u2019s also a great teammate, and he\u2019s a great professional, and we\u2019re happy to have him as a member of the organization. \u201cSometimes, all teams will have periods where they go through these types of situations but it does not change our affinity for Amari. You know, we\u2019ll navigate, call it the business considerations and the business aspects as it goes. But he is a big part of our team, and just as importantly, he\u2019s a big part of our culture.\u201d Heading into the final year of his contract with a cap number of $23.776 million, Cooper, the Browns No. 1 receiver and a five-time Pro Bowler, is seeking an extension and some guaranteed money, of which he has none left in the deal. Cooper, who turned 30 on Monday, held out all three days of mandatory minicamp last week, and also skipped all 10 days of voluntary organized team activities. The three-day holdout cost Cooper a total of $101, 716, with Day 1 costing $16,953, Day 2 $33,908 and Day 3 -- $50,855. If it extends into training camp, he\u2019ll lose $40,000 a day. Cooper, who\u2019s tied for 20th in the NFL with an average of $20 million a year, has fallen significantly behind the top of the receiver market, which has exploded this offseason and has climbed north of $30 million a year. The most recent extension was signed by the Vikings\u2019 Justin Jefferson, who tops the market at $35 million The good thing for Cooper is that his close friend Deshaun Watson went to bat hard for him on the first day of minicamp. \u201cAmari is our brother, our teammate,\u201d Watson said. \u201cWe support him, and the decisions that he\u2019s got to make for himself is on Amari. But everyone in this locker room respects him and knows exactly what he\u2019s about, and whenever he gets back, he\u2019s going to be ready to go.\u201d Because he talks to Cooper all the time, he likely knew he wasn\u2019t showing up. They connected during David Njoku\u2019s celebrity softball on June 8th, and have been in close contact all offseason. \u201cLike I said before, we all respect Coop, and he\u2019s got to handle what he\u2019s got to handle, and nobody\u2019s looking any different on him,\u201d he said. \u201cWe all support him, and he was here this weekend with us and we had a good time seeing him.\u201d In fact, Watson believes Cooper is better than Jefferson, Tyreek Hill and the others in the $30 million-a-year club. \u201cHe\u2019s the best in the game, and I believe that,\u201d Watson said. \u201cHe shows it each and every year. He\u2019s shown it the last two years with different quarterbacks, so I think you\u2019ve got to put him up there, if not the best.\u201d Last season, Cooper led the Browns with 72 receptions and finished 10th in the NFL with 1,250 yards. He also caught five TD passes despite working with four different starting quarterbacks. Imagine what he can do with a full season with Watson. \u201cThere\u2019s no limit (for the two of us),\u201d Watson said. \u201cThere\u2019s no sky for us. We can be as good as we want to be, and that\u2019s going to start with the work. It\u2019s going to start with the attention to details and going out there and executing each and every game.\u201d At the NFL Annual meetings in March, Berry indicated that he\u2019d be open to extending Cooper, who\u2019s the 20th highest paid receiver in the NFL. Jerry Jeudy is 24th. \u201cLook, Coop\u2019s a Pro Bowl-caliber receiver,\u201d Berry said. \u201cHe\u2019s played really well for us the past two years. He\u2019s a strong presence in the locker room. We love him. So players like that, you want to make sure that you can retain as long as possible and we\u2019ll work through all of that at the appropriate times.\u201d He echoed those sentiments on Monday.", "summary": "Browns GM Andrew Berry joined the Insiders on NFL Network.", "url": "https://www.cleveland.com/browns/2024/06/browns-gm-andrew-berry-on-amari-cooper-hes-a-big-part-of-our-team-and-a-big-part-of-our-culture.html", "image": "https://www.cleveland.com/resizer/v2/YPLQHBUPORCHDJMYR6KM5CCT6U.JPG?auth=840e2993d79fb64e8eef2bbe3206659dc5a03d806e68aa97ea4ba2847abd1d50&width=1280&quality=90", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-18 00:15:54", "author": "Mary Kay Cabot,Mary Kay Cabot, Cleveland.com", "authors": ["Mary Kay Cabot", "Mary Kay Cabot, Cleveland.com"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": 0.08}

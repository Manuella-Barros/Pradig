Long before he was preparing to play in Sunday\u2019s final in Paris against Alexander Zverev, Alcaraz watched a lot of matches involving Rafael Nadal, of course, as his countryman was accumulating a record 14 titles at Roland Garros. \u201cI wanted to put my name on that list of the Spanish players who won this tournament. Not only Rafa,\u201d said Alcaraz, who then rattled off champions such as Juan Carlos Ferrero (who happens to be his coach), Carlos Moya and Albert Costa, calling them \u201clegends from our sport that won this tournament.\u201d He just might join them. Alcaraz has triumphed on the U.S. Open\u2019s hard courts in 2022, and Wimbledon\u2019s grass courts in 2023, and now he is one victory away from holding a trophy on the red clay of Court Philippe Chatrier in southwest Paris. He would be the youngest man to own a major championship on all three surfaces; as it is, he\u2019s the youngest to make it to finals on every surface. Zverev, who is from Germany, is trying to claim his first Grand Slam title. He was the runner-up to Dominic Thiem at the 2020 U.S. Open after blowing a two-set lead and losing in five. \u201cI\u2019ve said it before and I\u2019m going to say it now again: I was not ready. I was not ready to win my first Grand Slam final. I was not mature enough. I was maybe too much of a kid still. I didn\u2019t know what the occasion means. And that\u2019s why I lost,\u201d Zverev said, thinking back to what happened in a nearly empty Arthur Ashe Stadium during the COVID-19 pandemic. \u201cI\u2019m 27 years old now. So definitely not a kid anymore. Already getting older. If not now, then when?\u201d No. 3 seed Alcaraz vs. No. 4 seed Zverev marks the first French Open final since 2004 without at least one of (and occasionally two of) Nadal, Novak Djokovic or Roger Federer participating. Alcaraz looks up to those guys \u2014 collectively known as the Big Three of men\u2019s tennis, each completed a career Grand Slam and they own a combined total of 66 major titles \u2014 and wants to emulate them. \u201cI always wanted to be one of the best players in the world. If I want to be one of the best players in the world, I have to be a good player in every surface, like Roger did, Novak, Rafa, (Andy) Murray. The best players in the world had success in every surface,\u201d Alcaraz said. \u201cSo I consider myself a player who adapts, very well, his style in every surface,\u201d he continued. \u201cI grew up playing on clay, but I feel more comfortable playing on a hard court, for example.\u201d Alcaraz, who got past No. 2 Jannik Sinner in five sets in the semifinals Friday, and Zverev, a four-set winner against No. 7 Casper Ruud, are both adept on clay. Zverev enters Sunday on a 12-match winning streak on the surface, including a title last month at the Italian Open and a first-round victory against Nadal in Paris. He\u2019s also the only man to reach at least the semifinals at Roland Garros each of the past four years. Alcaraz was the first man to beat Nadal and Djokovic at the same clay-court event, eliminating them in consecutive matches en route to the title at the 2022 Madrid Open. Alcaraz is third, and Zverev fourth, on the list of most match wins on clay since 2020. \u201cIf you\u2019re in a Grand Slam final, you deserve to be there,\u201d Zverev said. \u201cThat goes for both of us.\u201d ___ AP tennis: https://apnews.com/hub/tennis", "summary": "<a href=\"https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vYXBuZXdzLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL2ZyZW5jaC1vcGVuLXByZXZpZXctbWVuLWZpbmFsLWFsY2FyYXotenZlcmV2LWVlNjdiZmFlZmQ1NGIzMmU4ODRkYTk3NjM4NTQzMTNm0gEA?oc=5\" target=\"_blank\">French Open men's final: Carlos Alcaraz seeks a third Grand Slam title and Alexander Zverev a first</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color=\"#6f6f6f\">The Associated Press</font>", "url": "https://apnews.com/article/french-open-preview-men-final-alcaraz-zverev-ee67bfaefd54b32e884da9763854313f", "image": "https://dims.apnews.com/dims4/default/bfa3fbc/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1688+0+156/resize/1440x810!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.apnews.com%2Fd7%2F84%2F414eb87fd8ac5a8cc1ae36653c7a%2F4e7ed136dace41ad9f231de82662f83f", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 12:41:00", "author": "Howard Fendrich", "authors": ["Howard Fendrich"], "language": "en", "catgory": "sports", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": 0.118}

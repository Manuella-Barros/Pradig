The Scottish Government announced on Tuesday that due to the pre-General Election period, John Swinney\u2019s legislative agenda \u2013 which he had planned to bring forward to June \u2013 as well as his tax and medium term financial strategy will have to be pushed back. The country\u2019s most senior civil servant, John-Paul Marks, said there is a \u201cclear case for deferral of strategic policies due to be published in the pre-election period, given this could influence the General Election\u201d. Speaking to the PA news agency as he opened the Levenmouth rail link on Wednesday, Mr Swinney voiced his irritation at the delay \u2013 which could see him have to wait until Holyrood comes back from summer recess in September before laying out his plans for the country. \u201cYou bet I\u2019m frustrated by this,\u201d he said aboard a train travelling between Edinburgh and Leven, Fife. \u201cI have to accept the advice that I get from the civil service on this particular matter, it\u2019s part of the advice for the election that has come from the United Kingdom Government. \u201cBut I am immensely frustrated by it because I want to get on with delivering for the people Scotland, like I\u2019m doing today by delivering this rail line for Levenmouth.\u201d The First Minister would not be drawn on potentially seeking to recall Holyrood during recess to lay out his plans after the July 4 election. The final decision on a recall would be made by Presiding Officer Alison Johnstone. Mr Swinney\u2019s deputy Kate Forbes also expressed her frustration at the delay, telling the Economy and Fair Work Committee at Holyrood \u201croll on\u201d early July when election day has passed. She told MSPs the Programme for Government will contain \u201creal substantive policies and implementation of policy that businesses and the economy are looking for\u201d. While limited in what she could say, the Deputy First Minister said she \u201cdidn\u2019t want officials\u2019 time, or my time, to be consumed with writing things, I want it to be consumed with delivery\u201d. Her comments echo that of the First Minister, who said in his first speech in the top job that he will \u201cdemand from Government more concrete actions and fewer strategy documents\u201d.", "summary": "A number of key policy announcements have had to be shelved by the Scottish Government in the run-up to July 4.", "url": "https://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/first-minister-scottish-government-kate-forbes-holyrood-government-b1160830.html", "image": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2024/05/29/13/b615b6e70fc0e25da2f15164b64bbc46Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNzE3MDcwMTk1-2.76282678.jpg?width=1200", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 12:08:08", "author": "Neil Pooran", "authors": ["Neil Pooran"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": 0.072}

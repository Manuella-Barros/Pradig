While speaking to E! News, the reality star, 53, revealed she'd been diagnosed with invasive carcinoma grade 3 after finding a lump in her breast in late March. \"I booked myself a mammogram,\" Hyland shared. \"I had just had one done eight months prior and the results came back clean. However, this new mammogram and sonogram did not, it came back showing a mass.\" \"I went from clean results to a malignant mass in eight months,\" Hyland told the outlet. \"I was shocked that it had grown that quickly and scared of the battle I knew I was about to face.\" The reality star said the \"first red flag\" ahead of the diagnosis was her \"significant weight loss.\" \"I lost enough that others noticed and would ask for my dieting hacks, but there was nothing I had changed in my day-to-day to cause the loss,\" she said in the interview. Hyland knew it was going to be a \"very hard conversation\" when the time came to tell her and Randy Hyland's kids Brooke, 26, and Paige, 23, and Josh, 24, about the diagnosis. Hyland had to break the news from Florida while her kids were in Pittsburgh. \"I would've liked to have told them in person, but a phone call was the best I could do given the circumstances. I did a four-way call with all of my kids because I wanted to tell them at the same time and make sure they were all given the same information.\" Despite her kids remaining hopeful, they know the family has a \"long road\" ahead of them after they lost their grandmother to cancer in 2019, Paige told the outlet. Hyland is currently undergoing chemotherapy and is on the second of six rounds of treatments, which will be followed by surgery, radiation and then 11 more treatments, the outlet confirmed. \"I have a long journey ahead,\" she said, adding of attending the approximately 10-hour sessions with family members, \"They are very long appointments. So I don't want to put that responsibility on just one person.\" As well as having the support of family members, Hyland \u2014 who is currently living with her older sister Carrie Matarazzo and her husband Dom while receiving treatments in Pittsburgh \u2014 her \"extremely supportive\" fellow Dance Mom stars have also rallied around to offer their help. She is continuing to film her Dear Dance Mom... and Back to the Barre podcasts in a bid to keep her life \"as normal as possible.\" Never miss a story \u2014 sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from juicy celebrity news to compelling human interest stories. \"The toughest part for me has been accepting help from the people around me,\" Hyland told the outlet. \"I am a very independent person and, as a mom, I'm used to being the one taking care of people, not the one being taken care of.\" \"I hate feeling like I am inconveniencing anyone or being a burden in anyway,\" she continued. \"However, I am quickly learning I am on a very long and tough road, so I am going to need to learn to accept people's help because I am very lucky to have people that want to take care of me during this time.\"", "summary": "Hyland is undergoing chemotherapy after finding a lump in her breast in late March", "url": "https://people.com/dance-moms-star-kelly-hyland-reveals-breast-cancer-diagnosis-8655068", "image": "https://people.com/thmb/F5N3kransc-YYbFRex5RaD7Owe4=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(706x327:708x329)/kelly-hyland-pitch-perfect-premiere-052924-1-2833d69062954e54845782f12f17f3db.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 14:19:08", "author": "Becca Longmire", "authors": ["Becca Longmire"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": -0.344}

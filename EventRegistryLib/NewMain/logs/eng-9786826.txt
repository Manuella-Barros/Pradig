Hicks and Sonny Styles Are \"Neck-and-Neck\" to Start at Will Linebacker, But Both Will Have Roles in Buckeyes' Defense", "body": "Early returns on Ohio State's Will linebacker competition are positive, even if a favorite hasn't emerged yet in Jim Knowles' eyes.\n\nThe Buckeyes' defensive coordinator sees the race between 2022 five-star prospects C.J. Hicks and Sonny Styles as a dead heat with both men commanding playing time. Ohio State's base 4-2-5 defense only has room for one of them to play alongside Mike linebacker Cody Simon, but their talents and concerns about the team's nickel depth behind Jordan Hancock have Knowles thinking about more 4-3 looks in 2024.\n\n\"In 4-2 scheme I think they're both neck-and-neck right now,\" Knowles said. \"We've got to continue to look at and create more ways to get all three of them on the field, take the nickel out. I think our depth at nickel concerns me.\"\n\nFor a star-saturated defense that only has that Will linebacker spot to fill in its starting lineup, such a close competition between two players Knowles wants to get on the field as much as possible can only bode well.\n\nStyles and Hicks took different paths to get here, even if both arrived on campus the same year after the former reclassified from the recruiting class of 2023 to 2022. Styles played meaningful snaps in the 2022 College Football Playoff semifinals against Georgia as a freshman safety, then began last season as the Buckeyes' starting nickel safety. He moved back to deep safety in the back half of last year following an injury to Lathan Ransom, but his best play came near the line of scrimmage, prompting the move to Will linebacker this offseason.\n\n\"Sonny has proven to be a guy you can count on in the big moments,\" Knowles said. \"He's gained weight, strength, he's well-respected by everybody. So he makes that move to Will and you just see a lot of production. You see a guy who understands football.\n\n\"I've had a lot of success with bringing safeties down to the linebacker (position) because they have an idea of the bigger picture and everything that's going on from sideline to sideline. So Sonny shows that.\"\n\nStyles finished 2023 with 53 tackles, 4.5 tackles for loss and two sacks with no interceptions and just one pass breakup. Pro Football Focus gave him a pass coverage grade of 68.9 on the season, eighth among Ohio State's defensive backs and linebackers who saw significant run. Targeted 20 times by opposing quarterbacks, Styles allowed 12 catches for 117 yards, a catch rate of 60% that was the worst among the team's DBs who started a game.\n\nHis high school career and two seasons at Ohio State playing safety should take what was a bit of a weakness last year and make it a strength. He transitions to a position where he'll mainly be covering tight ends and running backs rather than shifty slot receivers and vertical threats downfield.\n\nStyles has been acclimating quickly.\n\n\"You always expect some initial dropoff or a learning curve, but I think Sonny has been at the top of the learning curve from the time he started and getting better all the time,\" Knowles said.\n\n\"He's gained weight, strength, he's well respected by everybody. So he makes that move to Will and you just see a lot of production. You see a guy who understands football.\"- Jim Knowles on Sonny Styles\n\nHicks is a player that Knowles said would be \"unleashed\" at some point last season in the leadup to the season, but it never happened. He got on the field for a few snaps in the Cotton Bowl but didn't look like the five-star talent he's supposed to be.\n\nHicks has always had amazing athletic gifts, but Ohio State's coaches have wanted to see him drill down on the finer points of playing linebacker. He made progress this spring by all accounts and stood out as a disruptor during practices open to the media.\n\n\"I think C.J. Hicks has done a phenomenal job,\" linebacker coach James Laurinaitis said in April. \"You gotta keep pressing him and making sure that he's really tapping into everything that he can offer. I think C.J. sees the opportunity, and he's certainly making a case to get on the field this fall. So I think it's been a really good spring for C.J.\"\n\nWhile still battling with Styles to start at Will, Knowles has started coming up with ways to use Hicks as a chess piece, including playing him off the edge on the line of scrimmage to disrupt the run game more, rush the quarterback and cover tight ends man-to-man.\n\n\"C.J. has some demonstrated talent - we saw it in spring - of making plays when he's on the attack,\" Knowles said. \"And I think Sonny can do that, too. So we're developing more of those opportunities for that Will position because we think we have the guys to do it.\"\n\nThat role is not to be confused with the hybrid defensive end/linebacker Jack position Knowles deployed at previous stops and in his first year at Ohio State in 2022. With Jack Sawyer and JT Tuimoloau starring at defensive end and plenty of depth behind them in Kenyatta Jackson Jr., Caden Curry and Mitchell Melton, Knowles plans to have at least two defensive ends on the field almost exclusively this year.\n\n\"(The Jack) is always there, but I don't think that right now with what we have that it's the answer,\" Knowles said.\n\n\"C.J. has some demonstrated talent - we saw it in spring - of making plays when he's on the attack. And I think Sonny can do that, too.\"- Jim Knowles on playing C.J. Hicks off the edge on the line of scrimmage\n\nThere's a clear plan to get both Hicks and Styles on the field at the same time in certain situations through those 4-3 looks with Styles in a Sam linebacker role against heavier fronts. The versatility in his and Hicks' skillset could even make it viable against three-receiver formations.\n\n\"Lorenzo (Styles Jr., the Buckeyes' projected backup nickel) has been hurt. He's coming back, but hopefully he'll fill that (depth at nickel),\" Knowles said. \"But right now behind Jordan, everybody's kind of taking shots. Jermaine (Mathews Jr.)'s taking some shots. Denzel (Burke)'s taking some shots. Everybody (at cornerback) is learning the position. But Sonny, if you remember the plan initially last year, he was playing that nickel/Sam until Lathan got hurt, (then) we had to move him back. So I feel like we can get all three of them (Hicks, Styles and Simon) in the game a significant amount.\"\n\nSo yes, Styles and Hicks are deadlocked in a battle to start in the Buckeyes' base defense, but both are projected to have a part to play in Ohio State's defense regardless of who wins out at Will.\n\n\"Once game time comes, everybody will see it and we (the coaches) will see it and we'll keep creating opportunities for them to do what they do best,\" Knowles said. \"You try to learn what they do best and then when they're in the game, you call those things. But I think it's going good right now because they're both showing up.\"", "source": {"uri": "elevenwarriors.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Eleven Warriors"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Knowles_(American_football)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jim Knowles (American football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio_State_Buckeyes_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ohio State Buckeyes football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linebacker", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Linebacker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nickel", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nickel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tackle_(football_move)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tackle (football move)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nickel_defense", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nickel defense"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_Football_Playoff", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "College Football Playoff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starting_lineup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Starting lineup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_of_scrimmage", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Line of scrimmage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_coordinator", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Defensive coordinator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freshman", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Freshman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety_(gridiron_football_position)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Safety (gridiron football position)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reception_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Reception (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pass_deflected", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pass deflected"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cotton_Bowl_(stadium)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cotton Bowl (stadium)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_Football_Focus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pro Football Focus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_school_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "High school football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_back", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Defensive back"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_end", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Defensive end"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Laurinaitis", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "James Laurinaitis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackson,_Mississippi", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jackson, Mississippi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jackson, Mississippi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.elevenwarriors.com/sites/default/files/c/2024/08/148145_h.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9786826", "eventUri": "eng-9786826", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2784313725490195, "wgt": 219, "relevance": 1}

Hicks and Sonny Styles remains close.\n\nKnowles described the juniors as \"neck and neck\" through two practices of preseason training camp, continuing the most prominent position battle on the defensive side of the ball.\n\nThe spot on the depth chart opened as a result of the departure of Steele Chambers, who left for the NFL after last season.\n\nWhile Cody Simon is in line to replace Tommy Eichenberg as the starting middle linebacker, there is less experience on the weak side.\n\nHicks saw limited snaps as a backup the last two years, and while Styles started 12 games for the Buckeyes last fall he did so in the secondary before switching from safety during spring practice in order to use his 6-foot-4, 235-pound size closer to the line of scrimmage.\n\nBut Knowles has remained impressed with Styles' adjustment to linebacker.\n\n\"You expect kind of an initial drop-off or learning curve,\" Knowles said, \"but Sonny has been at the top of the learning curve the entire time. He's been getting better the entire time.\"\n\nIn practices open to reporters this week, Styles appeared to line up alongside Simon for most of the team periods, though Hicks has logged some reps with the middle linebacker as well.\n\nBoth Hicks and Styles were five-star recruits coming out of high school, the highest-ranked prospects the Buckeyes signed as part of their 2022 recruiting class.\n\nStyles has, in particular, been ahead of schedule, though. He had graduated a year early from Pickerington Central in order to enroll at Ohio State and broke into the rotation as a 17-year-old freshman.\n\n\"Sonny has proven to be a guy you can count on in the big moments,\" Knowles said. \"He's gained weight, strength.

Even while using three linebackers, the drop-off in pass coverage might not be so steep.\n\nKnowles noted that Styles began last year as the starting nickel safety before he moved to the role as the strong safety to replace Lathan Ransom, who suffered a season-ending foot injury in October.\n\n\"I feel like we can get all three of them in the game a significant amount,\" Knowles said.\n\nJoey Kaufman covers Ohio State football for The Columbus Dispatch.

The Silver Bullets ranked second in the country in points allowed per game and third in yards allowed per game last season, and the surprise return of a host of key contributors suggests even more is in store for the defense as it enters a third year in Knowles' scheme.\n\nFollowing the second practice of camp on Friday, Knowles spoke to the media about what he expects this season, how he's evolved in his time in Columbus, and who is challenging to fill out the two-deep depth chart when Ohio State kicks off the season against Akron on Aug. 31.\n\n\"We want to emphasize those things that we can get better at,\" Knowles said of where the focus lies for a defense full of experience. \"Being a Silver Bullet defense means being a top-five defense. We had some significant top-fives (last season), but not all of them. So then we look at those things that can make a difference, like the presentation of our defense. That's a big deal. Now you can get into the details. Are we showing what we're playing? Are we disguising?\n\n\"And then blitzing. We need to be more aggressive in terms of the calls and getting more blitzes ran and more pressures ran, getting our defensive linemen in more one-on-one matchups. When you call a blitz, I tell them it's like running an offensive play; everyone has an assignment. It's not even really about making plays right now. It's just a matter of if everyone is doing the right things, and then we track that because I can't call it if we're not all on the right track. When you look at areas we can get better at, those are two that come to mind.\"\n\nHeading into his third year, Knowles hopes to strike a balance between the overly aggressive defense that was often torched for big plays in 2022 and last year's unit that, while achieving the ultimate goal of preventing yards and points, never could generate a consistent presence in the backfield.\n\nTo find that balance, Knowles again noted much will ride on Ohio State's presentation of its defense before the snap.\n\n\"A lot of that happens with disguise,\" Knowles said. \"But more calls out of the base look, I would say. More attack defenses out of the base look. It's a constant adjustment and always learning and always studying because you're at year one when we were aggressive and gave up some big plays. Year two, we were top-five in not giving up explosive plays but not as good in sacks and lost-yardage plays. It's just a constant balance and tinkering with it.\"\n\nIf there is one position Knowles still needs to identify a starter at, it is the Will linebacker position, where juniors C.J. Hicks and Sonny Styles have been sharing time early in camp. Knowles said in packages that feature two linebackers on the field, Hicks and Styles are currently \"neck and neck,\" but he's also looking for ways to get all three linebackers on the field with the addition of Cody Simon.\n\nHicks has also been seen lining up on the line of scrimmage at times during practice, and Knowles said he's seen Hicks' capabilities when he's on the attack while also noting Styles can do similar things.\n\n\"We're developing even more opportunities for that Will position because we think we have the guys to do it,\" he said.\n\nKnowles noted the depth at the nickelback position concerns him, especially with Lorenzo Styles currently banged up, which has emphasized the need to explore more three-linebacker sets while taking the nickel off the field.\n\n\"Right now, behind Jordan (Hancock), everybody is kind of taking shots at it,\" Knowles said of the nickel position. \"Jermaine (Mathews Jr.) is taking some shots, Denzel (Burke) is taking some shots. Everybody is learning the position. With Sonny, the plan last year was playing that nickel-sam until Lathan (Ransom) got hurt and we had to move him back (to safety). So I feel like we can get all three (linebackers) in the game a significant amount.\"\n\nOne area where depth likely won't be a concern is along the interior defensive line, where Ohio State boasts a host of big, capable bodies led by Tyleik Williams and Ty Hamilton. Behind them, Hero Kanu, Jason Moore, and Kayden McDonalds are continuing their push for playing time while getting Knowles near the six-player rotation he hopes to have at tackle.\n\nKnowles was especially praiseful of McDonald, who is quickly making a name for himself in year two at Ohio State.\n\n\"You gotta keep an eye on Kayden McDonald,\" Knowles said. \"He can be a real force. That's another guy who I think will be ready to play.\"\n\nAnother player who has inserted his name into the discussion for playing time is senior Tywone Malone, who may have been lost in the shuffle last season after transferring to Ohio State from Ole Miss. Through two practices, Malone has been in the second-team rotation behind Hamilton and Williams, and Knowles believes he can stay there with a strong camp.\n\n\"Absolutely,\" Knowles said when asked if Malone could play this season. \"I've seen improvement. I've definitely seen improvement. He's competing. We'll see more when the pads get on. That is a very physical position, and we've become accustomed to our defensive tackles making tackles and not just using up blocks ... I think he's going to be in that mix battling for playing time.\"\n\nOf course, few if any players come into the season with higher expectations than Downs, who was the SEC Freshman of the Year last season before transferring to Ohio State in January. By all accounts, Downs has been as advertised on the field through spring and summer workouts, but Knowles pointed out Downs' impact extends beyond his physical capabilities.\n\n\"He's a coach's dream,\" Knowles said of Downs. \"He understands everything. He picks everything up. He takes the meeting room to the field. He's locked in in meetings. He takes great notes. He's a pro, so I think aside from what he does on the field with making all the adjustments and knowing where to go, he really has a great effect on the guys in the meeting room, too.\"\n\nOhio State is back on the practice field Saturday and Sunday before being off Monday.\n\nReach Dillon Davis at 740-413-0904.

Knowles wants to do more out of the base defense.\n\nThat can be partially accomplished simply by disguising what they are doing better via alignment, but Knowles acknowledged he wants to call more different plays than he did last year.\n\nHis top desire is to avoid being predictable, something he acknowledged might have happened late in Ohio State's Cotton Bowl loss to Missouri.\n\n2. Sonny Styles and C.J. Hicks are \"neck and neck\" in the competition for playing time.\n\nStyles has trotted out first with the No. 1 defense at Will linebacker the first two days, but Hicks, who appeared to be the starter for most of the spring, got a few snaps with the top unit during seven on seven drills late in the morning.\n\nKnowles said he hasn't picked a starter there yet and continues to plan on playing both at the same time along with middle linebacker Cody Simon.\n\nHicks, a junior from Alter High School, has shown a knack for attacking from the edge while Styles is a former safety, so they could have complementary skills.\n\n3. Knowles is concerned about the depth at Nickel.\n\nHis safety-driven defense includes a fifth defensive back who can do a little bit of everything, a role Jordan Hancock thrived in late last season. He is back, but who backs him up remains to be seen.\n\nJermaine Mathews Jr., a natural cornerback, was there the first two days. Lorenzo Styles Jr. is also a candidate, but he has been battling an injury.\n\n4. Caleb Downs is \"a coach's dream.\"\n\nThe Alabama transfer is Knowles' new \"Adjuster\" safety. He figures to start in the deep middle of the defense but could go anywhere, a Swiss army knife for a defensive coordinator who likes to be able to attack offenses from different angles.\n\nKnowles praised his ability to absorb the scheme and put knowledge to use quickly on the field.\n\n5. The \"Jack\" may not be back, at least not this season.\n\nKnowles' defenses at Oklahoma State frequently featured a hybrid defensive end who would move all over the formation as more of a linebacker, but that look was not seen much at Ohio State the first two seasons.\n\nWhile it remains in the playbook, Knowles said he is more focused on getting the most out of the more traditional front four look preferred by Larry Johnson. He could also see using a five-man look to get more pressure on passing downs.", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorenzo_Styles", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lorenzo Styles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Knowles_(American_football)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jim Knowles (American football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio_State_Buckeyes_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ohio State Buckeyes football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_coordinator", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Defensive coordinator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linebacker", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Linebacker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbus,_Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Columbus, Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Columbus, Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cotton_Bowl_(stadium)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cotton Bowl (stadium)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_back", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Defensive back"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missouri", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Missouri"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Missouri"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma_State_Cowboys_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma State Cowboys football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_end", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Defensive end"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornerback", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cornerback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alabama", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alabama"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Alabama"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Johnson_(running_back)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Larry Johnson (running back)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo-1200x1200.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9786826", "eventUri": "eng-9786826", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Columbus, Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-02", "textStart": 0, "textEnd": 6}], "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 206, "relevance": 1}

Although it's not the biggest storyline this summer, it's one of the most important, because the Buckeyes have a tight battle going on between Styles and former five-star linebacker C.J. Hicks. Both players were the diamonds of the 2022 class, Styles was No. 12 player in the country and Hicks was the No. 7 player.\n\nIt's been Styles, though, who has gotten the most snaps next to Simon, although Hicks has rotated in for a few drills, as well.\n\nDespite the snap count looking one-sided, defensive coordinator Jim Knowles said the battle is tight between the two standout athletes.\n\nWhen Knowles spoke to the media on Friday, he talked about being more aggressive on defense and making sure the Buckeyes are disguising their coverages well this season.\n\nA veteran secondary will help there, but so will versatility at linebacker. That's what the trio of Simon, Styles and Hicks brings. Although Knowles bases out of a 4-2-5 defense, he knows that utilizing all three is important. That isn't something that Ohio State is going to show this early in camp, but Knowles is thinking about it.\n\n\"They're both neck-and-neck right now,\" Knowles said of Styles and Hicks. \"We have to continue to look at and create more ways to get all three of them on the field and take the nickel out. Our depth at nickel concerns me behind Jordan (Hancock), hopefully Lorenzo (Styles), who has been hurt, is coming back and will fill that. ... I feel like we can get all three of them in the game a significant amount.\"\n\nThere would be a smooth transition for all three, too, because Hicks already knows the will linebacker assignments and last year Ohio State was training Styles to play the nickel spot. If the Buckeyes want to move Styles to the will, Knowles also knows he can move Hicks around in various positions.\n\n\"C.J. has some demonstrated talent -- we saw it in the spring -- of making plays when he's on the attack,\" Knowles said. \"I think Sonny can do that too so we're developing more of those opportunities for the will position because we think we have the guys to do it.\"\n\nOften the talk going into camp is about position battles and in the first week there's a panic about who is getting reps with the starters vs who isn't. In this case, Ohio State knows it's going to play Hicks, Styles and Simon this season and while it's still figuring out how that will look when it's just two linebackers on the field, all three of them will see playing time and sometimes together, as Knowles looks to find the balance between his aggressive nature and being conservative, as well.\n\nHere's a few other observations from Day 2 of Ohio State's fall camp.\n\nThere wasn't a lot of new information gained about the quarterbacks on the second day, but it was more about consistency.\n\nWill Howard had a slow start, he missed a throw on the run to tight end Jelani Thurman and he also had a pass deep down the left sideline that should've been intercepted, instead Jaylen McClain volleyball swatted it out of bounds.\n\nThat was early in the 7-on-7 period, but from there Howard had a pretty clean day. He stood tall in the pocket, threw on time and made some nice throws in coverage.\n\nHe had a tremendous throw to TreVeyon Henderson for a touchdown, on a wheel route. Then he let go of a picture-perfect throw to David Adolph deep down the left sideline. The ball was placed right over the safety and into Adolph's hands, but he dropped it when hit by the safety.\n\nI thought that would end as the best throw of the day, but Devin Brown showed him up. On the last play of practice, Brown threw deep down the middle of the field, splitting the safeties, to Bryson Rodgers and hit him perfectly in stride. The problem with Brown, though, is his inconsistency at times. That was the best throw of the day, by far, but just before that rep he threw the ball at a receiver's foot instead of his hands.\n\nThrough two days we've seen good moments and bad from both quarterbacks. The one who is more consistent will win the job.\n\nOhio State's defense is making it hard on the quarterbacks.\n\nThe first two days of camp have seen a lot of checkdowns in 7-on-7 periods because of how good the defensive backs are, which is what many expected.\n\nOhio State may have the best secondary in the country with Denzel Burke, Davison Igbinosun, Jordan Hancock, Lathan Ransom and Caleb Downs, leading the starting group. That's five potential NFL Draft picks, four of which should come in April.\n\nThe defensive coaching staff isn't getting creative by mixing up the reps, either. The starters have largely played together when the team periods begin and it's led to some exciting moments.\n\nJeremiah Smith and Burke went one-on-one a few times on Friday, with one jump ball coming in the end zone but Brown put the ball a bit too high for Smith to bring it down while covered.\n\nBurke had a pass breakup on Friday, but he wasn't the only one. Hancock had a physical play against Bryson Rodgers right at the start of the seven-on-seven period. Throughout the day there weren't many people just running around open.\n\nEven the backups have performed well. On Friday, the second-team corners were Aaron Scott, Calvin Simpson-Hunt and Jermaine Mathews Jr., in the nickel spot. Again, they all played well, although Scott got beat deep on a one-on-one ball against Smith.\n\nIt's early and there are no pads, but Ohio State's secondary looks as good as the expectations say it should be.\n\nOhio State has a wealth of talent at defensive end right now led by J.T. Tuimoloau and Jack Sawyer, but it also includes Caden Curry and Kenyatta Jackson Jr. Those are the four defensive ends that many expect to get the most snaps, but Melton looks ready to break out finally.\n\nOn Friday, he made an impressive play swatting a pass at the line of scrimmage while being blocked, showing off his strength and athleticism.\n\nMelton has gone through a plethora of injuries in his career, playing just eight games since arriving on campus in 2021. Now healthy, Melton should be one of the rotating defensive ends.\n\nKnowles acknowledged that rotating up front will be important this year and is excited to see what Melton can do when he's healthy.\n\nDrafting a defensive line two-deep from practice is nearly impossible because of how much they rotate. The amount of time that Sawyer has played alongside Tuimoloau in the first two practices has been minimal.\n\nBut you can see the talent with Mitchell no matter who he's on the field with.\n\nHinzman missed the first day of practice with an illness, but was back on the field on Friday.\n\nThe third-year offensive lineman is expected to battle for a starting spot at right guard. That's still the case, but he split time on Friday by taking some snaps at center as well.\n\nWhen Hinzman wasn't at guard, Luke Montgomery took snaps at right guard, along with Tegra Tshabola on the other field.\n\nIt's likely that Ohio State is training Hinzman for both positions and setting him up to play all three interior line spots if asked. That would be a positive for Ohio State, especially if the competition can push Montgomery to rise up the depth chart.\n\nI continue to believe that Tshabola will win the right guard battle, but the key for Ohio State's fall camp is about more than just one starter, it's also about depth.\n\nOhio State wants to find its starting right guard, but Hinzman cross training at center and guard will give them the chance to go into the season with seven linemen capable of earning reps.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Jermaine Mathews Jr., a natural corner who is blocked from that position by the return of starters Denzel Burke and Davison Igbinosun, was there the first two days of preseason.\n\n\"Hopefully he'll fill that, but right now behind Jordan everybody's kind of taking shots. Jermaine's taking some shots. Denzel's taking some shots. Everybody's learning the position,\" Knowles said.\n\nBefore coming to Ohio State, Knowles frequently used a 3-3-5 look that called for one of the defensive ends to be replaced by a \"Jack\" or \"Leo\" hybrid player.\n\nKnowles indicated he doesn't anticipate that being a big part of the scheme this fall, but he could alter the role of the Will linebacker to allow Hicks to carry out some of the same duties, such as blitzing up the middle.\n\n\"CJ has some demonstrated talent,\" Knowles said. \"We saw it in the spring, you know, of making plays when he's when he's on the attack. So I think Sonny can do that, too. So we're developing more of those opportunities for that Will position because we think we have the guys to do it.\n\n\"I think Sonny and CJ are both kind of bracketed right now, but Sonny has proven to be a guy you can count on in the big moments. He's gained weight, strength. He's well-respected by everybody, so he makes that move to Will, and you just see a lot of production. You see a guy who understands football. I've had a lot of success with bringing safeties down to be linebackers because they have an idea of the bigger picture and everything that's going on from sideline to sideline. Sonny shows that.\"", "source": {"uri": "daytondailynews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Dayton Daily News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "marcus_hartman@daytondailynews.com", "name": "Marcus Hartman", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorenzo_Styles", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lorenzo Styles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Knowles_(American_football)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jim Knowles (American football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nickel_defense", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Nickel defense"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_back", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Defensive back"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Davison_Igbinosun", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Davison Igbinosun"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denzel_Burke", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Denzel Burke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety_(gridiron_football_position)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Safety (gridiron football position)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3\u20133\u20135_defense", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "3\u20133\u20135 defense"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blitz_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Blitz (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio_State_Buckeyes_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ohio State Buckeyes football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linebacker", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Linebacker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 70}], "image": "https://www.daytondailynews.com/resizer/rEwzMbJs89lMkbcBQbueMdkRE5o=/1200x630/d1xee2ssey3x9d.cloudfront.net/08-02-2024/t_d023b6250cdc4b2bafcc655ae27bb986_name_t_9a3538dc68774002b1fbf3034d56af32_name_knowles_.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9786826", "eventUri": "eng-9786826", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-02-05", "dateEnd": "-04-03", "textStart": 559, "textEnd": 570}], "sentiment": 0.1058823529411765, "wgt": 187, "relevance": 1}

As for who will be starting next to him at Will, that is hard to tell at the moment. The job is up for grabs and two players are locked in for a difficult battle throughout fall camp.\n\nSonny Styles has been an impact player for the Ohio State Buckeyes since arriving on campus. He was a big safety for a few years, often playing closer to the box and popping up all over the field. Since converting to linebacker, Styles now finds himself competing with C.J. Hicks for the starting Will linebacker job. To this point, it is a close competition and one that defensive coordinator Jim Knowles is not yet able to give a firm answer on.\n\nAccording to Dan Hope of Eleven Warriors, Knowles stated that he sees Sonny Styles and C.J. Hicks as \"neck and neck\" at the Will linebacker spot. There was also mention of looking to do more with three-linebacker packages this season.\n\nThis should be music to the ears of Ohio State fans. Fans have been clamoring for Hicks to be involved since the highly-coveted linebacker recruit first joined the Buckeyes a few years back. It sounds like his time to shine is right around the corner - not without competition though. Clearly the transition from safety to linebacker has been going well for Styles based on what Knowles is saying.\n\nWhat both of these players brings is athleticism and a rangy feature in pursuit. Simon is athletic in his own right and will bring some physicality and leadership to the room. Having a Will that can fly around the field will be so helpful when the team is primarily in two-linebacker sets. If Hicks wins the job, then Styles still needs to see the field due to his talent and versatility. If Styles wins the job, then Hicks needs to get opportunities to see the field as well. If more three-linebacker packages are utilized, that is another added dimension to throw at an opposing offense.\n\nIn those situations will Simon and Hicks align at the Mike and Will, while Styles plays a more traditional Sam role? Could Knowles use Styles like Clemson used Isaiah Simmons in 2018 and 2019 as a nickel linebacker?\n\nThere are so many things that can really be done, but that may all come after one of these two players has locked up the starting Will job first. With an excellent defensive line and secondary, lots of athleticism and versatility in the linebacker unit should be a welcome sight.\n\nThis will be a good competition in camp and something to follow along with as Knowles sorts out the rotation with lots of quality players.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio_State_Buckeyes_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ohio State Buckeyes football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linebacker", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Linebacker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Knowles_(American_football)", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jim Knowles (American football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_coordinator", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Defensive coordinator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_State_Warriors", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Golden State Warriors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaiah_Simmons", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Isaiah Simmons"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clemson_Tigers_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Clemson Tigers football"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Free_Services", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Free Services", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_4356,h_2450,x_0,y_0/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/buckeyes_now/01j4a65hp4q3wtmm6ymq.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9786826", "eventUri": "eng-9786826", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 182, "relevance": 1}

Credit: Samuel Cipriani | Asst. Sports Editor\n\nAfter a long summer break, the Buckeyes have officially kicked off their football season.\n\nOhio State held its first two days of fall football camp Thursday and Friday morning, opening with two-hour practices that were followed by press conferences with head coach Ryan Day and defensive coordinator Jim Knowles.\n\nDay said even though only two days have passed at fall camp, the Buckeyes coaching staff knows every training session counts, as they all add up to better prepare Ohio State for late-season challenges.\n\n\"Every year you have to rebuild,\" Day said. \"There's bricks in the foundation, and you won't know how strong that foundation is until the storms come and the big games come down the road. We may even have four top-ten matchups back-to-back-to-back.\"\n\nOne of the biggest, lingering questions for this Buckeye squad is how the offensive line will perform. Day said the group still has room to grow as a unit, though multiple returning starters such as offensive tackle Josh Simmons have impressed with their efforts in the offseason.\n\n\"Josh Simmons can do some things that most can't,\" Day said. \"He's very skilled and talented, and we feel like the offseason was a difference maker for him. Time will tell, but I think he's positioned himself with a good summer to be the best version of himself, and to think about where he was a year from now, we're light-years away from that.\"\n\nTransfer graduate quarterback Will Howard and junior quarterback Devin Brown appear to be the top candidates to take reins of the offense, with freshmen quarterbacks Julian Sayin and Air Noland showing promise as well.\n\nDay said the quarterbacks have appeared much more physically fit in the opening days of fall camp, with communication between the gunslingers and offensive linemen improving drastically over the summer.\n\n\"I thought [the quarterback room] looked more fit, I think they look stronger and I think they moved better than in the spring,\" Day said. \"They just look like they've had three or four months of work on their bodies. The ball had more pace today, and I thought they had a better understanding of the offense being out there for the first day.\"\n\nFreshman Jeremiah Smith continued to impress through the first two days of fall camp, earning high praise from Knowles, who said the wide receiver has not only practiced well against one of the best secondaries in the country, but also displays maturity off the field.\n\n\"He's shown right away that he can handle anything you throw at him,\" Knowles said. \"If you put him in a one on one situation and even against our best, you kinda hold your breath, but he makes [defensive] guys better.\"\n\nGraduate linebacker Cody Simon is a safe bet to start at Mike linebacker after getting significant time backing up former Buckeye linebacker Tommy Eichenberg last season. The Will linebacker spot is still up for grabs, with juniors Sonny Styles and C.J. Hicks being frontrunners to occupy the position. Knowles complimented both backers and highlighted their potential.\n\n\"C.J. has some demonstrated talent; we saw it in the spring making plays when he's on the attack,\" Knowles said. \"I think Sonny can do that too, so we're developing more of those opportunities for that position because we think we have the guys to do it.\"\n\nKnowles said he hopes to have a deep rotation within the defensive tackle position. The group will be led by senior defensive tackles Ty Hamilton and Tyeik Williams, both of whom are expected to retain their starting positions from last season.\n\nKnowles also mentioned sophomore defensive tackle Kayden McDonald as a player who could see significant time on the field in 2024.\n\n\"You gotta keep an eye on Kayden McDonald, he's a real force and that's another guy I think would be ready to play,\" Knowles said. \"I feel like we have at least the pair and the spare right now and we'll see what comes in.\"\n\nKnowles said throughout the first few days of fall camp, Ohio State's coaches have been preaching the basics while simultaneously communicating the team's high expectations.\n\n\"The important point to get across to our guys is, like Vince Lombardi once said, 'We have to chase perfection,'\" Knowles said. \"It's impossible, but you catch excellence in the process and you can never be satisfied with just being good.\"\n\nWednesday afternoon, graduate linebacker Kourt Williams II announced his retirement from the game of football via Instagram, stating that he had four knee surgeries and three shoulder surgeries throughout his football career.\n\nNotably, Day spoke on the retirement of Williams II for the first time since the linebacker's announcement Wednesday.", "source": {"uri": "thelantern.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Lantern"}, "authors": [{"uri": "samuel_cipriani@thelantern.com", "name": "Samuel Cipriani", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lineman_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lineman (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Knowles_(American_football)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jim Knowles (American football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio_State_Buckeyes_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ohio State Buckeyes football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Day_(American_football)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ryan Day (American football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tackle_(gridiron_football_position)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tackle (gridiron football position)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio_State_Buckeyes", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ohio State Buckeyes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_coordinator", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Defensive coordinator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linebacker", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Linebacker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huddle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Huddle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freshman", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Freshman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_University", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brown University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tommy_Eichenberg", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tommy Eichenberg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_tackle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Defensive tackle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vince_Lombardi", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vince Lombardi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophomore", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sophomore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tackle_(football_move)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tackle (football move)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.thelantern.com/files/2024/08/LinemanhuddleFallPractice_9396-1152x759.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9786826", "eventUri": "eng-9786826", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.04313725490196074, "wgt": 177, "relevance": 1}

Last year, Knowles was optimistic that the Buckeyes' defense would improve in the second year in his scheme. It did, though it wilted at key moments in the losses to Michigan and Missouri in the Cotton Bowl.\n\nNow Knowles enters Year 3 with a loaded defense. The Buckeyes lost linebackers Tommy Eichenberg and Steele Chambers and tackle Mike Hall Jr. But the rest of the defense returns, and OSU added safety Caleb Downs, a freshman All-American last year at Alabama.\n\nHere's what Knowles had to say about his players and expectations for this season, which are sky high? This has been edited for clarity and brevity. For the full interview, click on the podcast version of our talk.\n\nQ: How different will it be in Year 3 in your defense?\n\nA: I know the players and the players know me. I think that's critical in building relationships and helping them achieve their peak performance because ultimately when they're out there on the field, I want them to think like me and play like them. You want to somehow impart everything that I've learned and pour it into them. You want them to see the game the way I see it. We're getting there. In Year 3, a lot of guys coming back could have moved on, which is humbling, but it also is a good sign that we're doing things right because guys want to come back. They believe that we can still help them get better.\n\nMore: Ohio State football is opening training camp up to fans. Everything you need to know\n\nQ: Just how good could this defense be?\n\nA: There's no limits to how good we can be. We can do anything. Last year in Year 2, we moved into what I would say would be considered a top-five defense. Not in all categories, but in a significant number of categories. That's what we say means to be a Silver Bullet defense, to be a top-five defense. Ultimately, you'd like to be top five in every single category. That's not impossible. It's really not.\n\nQ: In your first year, your defense made significant statistical improvement but gave up too many big plays. Last year, you cut down on those. But you weren't creating a lot of havoc. Not a lot of turnovers, not a lot of sacks. You were middle the pack nationally. Is that the next step, to combine that?\n\nA: Yeah, that had been probably more of what I was known for in my career and that's not what we needed in the maturation of this defense and becoming a defense that everyone can count on and ultimately winning every single game we play. That's the goal, right? It's not stats. But you are right, as I see it, we made those changes, we were able to win some games on defense. We did change the explosive plays. There's no doubt about that. Statistically, we were top five in explosive plays. Now we do want to create more havoc. We do want to create more loss-yardage plays, turnovers. take more chances. We have the guys to do that.\n\nMore: 10 intriguing Ohio State football players to watch at the Buckeyes' preseason training camp\n\nQ: You look at this defense and what's the weakness? What's even the major question? The obvious caveat is that injuries cause could change things. But when you look at the defense, to me, you have really 12 starters because we have nickel cornerback Jordan Hancock and Sonny Styles, who's now moved to linebacker with Cody Simon and C.J. Hicks. I'm sure you'll mix and match. But when you look at the defense, do you see a major question in your mind?\n\nA: No. I think depth at safety - it's going to be a long season - and development of those linebackers that have not played a lot of that position (is an issue). Sonny is making the transition. C.J. has been developing for two years and has to be the guy this year along with Sonny, so we need to get those guys on the field and going. Then who's next at linebacker - Gabe Powers, Arvell Reese - already capable guys. And then the depth of safety. We've got Caleb Downs, who's a great player with a great football mind and football intelligence. And Lathan (Ransom) is back. Who's going to step up behind them? Malik Hartford, (Jayden) Bonsu, Keenan (Nelson Jr.) our transfer from South Carolina. So the depth at safety and linebacker (is a concern) because it's a long season.\n\nQ: You didn't mention fifth-year senior Cody Simon, which I know is just an oversight.\n\nA: I consider Cody a multiyear starter, and he's going to run the show. When you talk to (strength coach) Mick (Marotti), Cody Simon's one of the best to come through here in leadership and work ethic and all those things. Cody is going to be great.\n\nWe love Tommy, but with Cody there's no dropoff.\n\nQ: What's the effect of you not having an assigned position group this year with James Laurinaitis officially taking over as linebackers coach?\n\nA: It's an advantage. I get to sit in on other position meetings and move around more and spend more time in different areas of the defense. I've done it before, and it really allows me to be at my best in terms of big-picture thinking and building relationships with all the positions.\n\nQ: How has James settled in to this semi-new role?\n\nA: James is great. He came right in and built those relationships with the linebackers. Does a great job in recruiting. Obviously, you know, he's Mr. Ohio State. I don't think you could ask for a better (preparation to be a linebackers coach) with his NFL experience. He checks all the boxes.\n\nQ: And you added Matt Guerrieri as safeties coach. You have a history with him, and now you have somebody coaching the back end who can think like you do. What does he bring?\n\nA: Matt and I go way back. I kind of feel like I raised him in the profession from finding him at a summer camp GA and promoting him. He understands everything about the system, and he certainly is a guy who can solve problems very quickly. You can count on him to always understand how I'm thinking.\n\nQ: This is not really related to your position necessarily, but I'm curious. Ryan Day now has Chip Kelly to run the offense, just like he has the confidence in you to run the defense. Do you notice a change in Ryan this year, just being able to step back from the minutia of the offense?\n\nA: Coach Day is a great football guy, so he's always going to be involved in football whether it's special teams, offense or defense. You can really talk ball with him. What I see is just him having more time to deal with all the other issues that he has to deal with -- NIL and everything that's (related to) revenue-sharing. Everything is changing so rapidly. I think he has more time to do that.\n\nQ: Let's talk a little more in depth about some of your players. Sonny Styles is now a linebacker, though it's somewhat semantics because he was a bit of a hybrid safety/linebacker last year.\n\nA: Sonny's the same way as our defense: The sky's the limit. I think from the time I arrived here, everybody's been talking, 'Oh, he's going to be a linebacker.' I wanted to see, first of all, how he could function as a safety. That's what he wanted to do. That's what Sonny wanted. I've had experience moving safeties to linebackers, and I think the perspective that they gain going that way really helps them in their career. And Sonny's got an amazing attitude. He's taken to the position very well.\n\nQ: Caleb Downs was a freshman All-American for Alabama, and it was a coup to get him. How does he transform the defense?\n\nA: He's always going to be in the right place, and if he's not he immediately corrects it. He brings confidence, but he also brings study habits and how he handles meetings and how he operates as a major-college, nationally recognized player. I think that's even more than what you see on the field. He brings that professionalism to the meeting room and to our building.\n\nWhen we went to talk to Caleb after he entered the portal, I like to say my interview with Caleb Downs was harder than my interview with coach Day. He was extremely intricate and detailed about the defense, and fortunately for us, I was able to have all the answers that he needed.\n\nQ: Defensive end Jack Sawyer was at Big Ten media days. He's always been a happy-go-lucky, confident guy, but he seems to have a different confidence now. Agree?\n\nA: Jack has been doing all the right things since I got here, particularly last year where we settled him (at defensive end and not the hybrid Jack position). He was doing really well in the in the run game and the things that people don't see in the first half (of the season) and then you're right, he really kind of broke out, which I think is great for him. We have high expectations for Jack.\n\nQ: On the other side is J.T. Tuimolau. We saw what he did at Penn State two years ago. What are your expectations?\n\nA: We've all seen it. That Penn State game two years ago was arguably the best I've ever seen by a defensive lineman. I think what people don't know is J.T. and Jack and really all the guys - I'm not just giving the party line - they're good people. A guy like J.T. could easily be a prima donna, and he's not. He's a hard-working guy. He's coachable. Everyone can be proud of them in the community. I'm a guy that worked my way up, so this is truly my first venture into what I call the top five. You don't know what to expect in terms of how the players operate on a daily basis. You've got guys, five-star recruits, who everybody's telling them how great they are their whole life. That's hard for a guy to stay humble. But (helped by) Ohio State, coach Day, the culture, Mick, these are good kids. J.T. could be a me guy, a prima donna and he's the farthest thing from that. He's really a great team guy.\n\nSo what do we want? What does he want? We all want to produce more sacks, more TFLs, more big plays. I think that a lot of that relies on me to create those matchups. But you also (realize we were) the No. 1 pass defense in the country. When I got here, we were 59th or something like that. In two years, we were the No. 1 pass defense. We're not No. 1 in sacks. When you look at how fast the ball is getting out, and you look at those numbers, we were really high in those. I don't have that exact number, but I did look it up. People are getting the ball out fast against us.\n\nQ: Do you know how many times opposing quarterbacks took seven-step drops?\n\nA: I don't. I don't think it's that many.\n\nQ: On the interior of the line, you have Tyleik Williams and Ty Hamilton. Tyleik had a breakthrough last year. What have you seen from him?\n\nA: Incredibly athletic. Great kid. We want him to improve his sack numbers. But he did a great job in the run game.\n\nQ: Jack Sawyer said Ty might be the most underrated guy on the defense. Agree?\n\nA: Yeah, he is. He's quiet, but he's tough. We had Mike Hall, who would flash and flash. Ty Hamilton is as good as anybody on the defense at what he does, and he'll be dominant this year. One of the reasons we continued to improve last year and make a job or jump into the top five was because of our defensive tackles. If your defensive tackles are actually making tackles inside of just using up (blockers), you have a chance to be a really good defense.\n\nQ: How do you feel about the depth behind them?\n\nA: Guys have to play. They have to play early. They have to play well because you've got people who need to prove it. Hero (Kanu) has done a great job when he's gotten the chance. Jason Moore is a younger guy who's ready to really break out. Kayden McDonald is a force in practice. Our offense does not want to go against. him. I think he's ready. Then you have Will Smith. You're going to need those guys. It's a long schedule and that depth has to get a lot of time early and show that they'll be able to be counted on in the matchup games.\n\nQ: We've talked about C.J. Hicks a little bit. Has something been holding him back for a couple of years, or was it just a matter that he was behind really good veteran players?\n\nA: Nothing's been holding him back. He's just learned and grew behind some good guys who are older and were producing and doing well. But C.J. has everything he needs to be great. He's studied. He's learned. Yeah, you talk about a guy that's a five-star and lauded and everybody expects you ... it's a lot of pressure. He's a great kid. Despite all the pressure, he always has a smile on his face. A great team guy.\n\nIsn't this the way you want it? You want to come in and get some learning in Year 1. Play a little more in Year 2, and now you're the guy. Ideally, if you have a great program, that is what you expect. People talk about freshmen coming in and playing right away. You're not as good as you think you are if you're counting on freshmen to come in and play right away.\n\nYou look at C.J. Hicks and say he's learned. He was under a lot of pressure that he should play right away. He's got the physical tools. He has continued to learn the game and defense, and now you can really cut it loose. With him and Sonny, I think that now the onus comes on me, too, to create more pressures for those guys. Maybe we didn't do that with Steele (Chambers). These guys have little different skills.\n\nQ: We talked to Denzel Burke at Big Ten media days and he seems primed for another big year.\n\nA: Denzel doesn't have any weaknesses, and he's shown the ability in the run game to come up and hit you. I think that's just a level of maturity with coach (Tim) Walton, who has coached the top corners in the world, so he's just in a good spot mentally, physically and experience-wise. He is right where you want a guy to be who's coming into his senior year.\n\nQ: I don't know that I've heard players gush about their position coach the way that do about Tim Walton. What is different about him? Obviously, he played here and has NFL experience.\n\nA: All of those things. You said it. He played here. He has NFL experience. He can tell guys, 'This is what it's like. This is what is going to be expected of you.' He can shoot straight, and they accept it because he has credibility. You go from recruiting these guys to 'Let me tell you a little bit about reality.' It's just being straight with people and guys accepting it and being real. He relates to our players on that level. Everyone on the team has tremendous respect for his career and him coming back to his alma mater.\n\nQ: Cornerback Davison Igbinosun was obviously a huge addition last year. He's a confident player, a physical player, maybe too physical at times with his hands. Do you want him to strike a balance with that or are you fine with it?\n\nA: Yeah, I'm fine (with it). Keep being physical. Maybe we'll get a penalty every now and then. That's the cost of doing business. But Davison is a guy who's really changed things. I've said it before about him. He brought an attitude. He raised Denzel's play. He raised Jordan's play. He knows he's got areas to get better at. I think red-zone coverage is a big deal for Davison this year. But you couldn't ask for a better corner in terms of his size, length and attitude.\n\nQ: Jordan Hancock sometimes gets lost in the shuffle a little bit. I know not by you guys, I'm sure, but how valuable was he at that nickel corner and could he do other things?\n\nA: He can do other things, too. But you're right, the nickel, he kind of got thrust into that role and I think will now make a career out of it. They're always looking for those guys in the NFL. Call it most improved or whatever, but he put himself in position last year to be a nationally recognized player. He gets better all the time, so he's critical for us.\n\nQ: You were high on Lathan Ransom from the start of your time here because of his instinctiveness. He's also had obviously an injury history. How is he right now? Full go into camp?\n\nA: Yeah, Lathan's full go. Lathan is locked in. Lathan understands where he needs to get better. Sometimes, people can use his aggressiveness against him. He has a lot of a lot of goals. He's a guy that believes in our team. But he's also coachable. These guys say, 'I'm coming back.' You may say I've got a second-round grade, but I'm going back because I love my teammates and we've got unfinished business. And that's nice. But your parents may look at you and say, 'Well, OK, that's nice, but there's a job waiting for you out there (in the NFL).' Then families get together and they say, well, not only do we have that personal, emotional, team, brotherhood, unfinished business, but we have coaching and mentorship and the defensive system here that we're going to get better, like we're going to go from the second round to the first round. People have to believe in you. You have shown them that you're capable of that. Like you said, I noticed Lathan from the beginning. Now, how are we going to get better? How do you play half-field technique better? How do you not bite on the play fake as much? Those are all areas that he's into.\n\nQ: Were you surprised that all these guys came back?\n\nA: I don't know if I was surprised. I felt humbled is more the word. You're talking about money and families. They're not just going to say I'm coming back because they feel good. There has to be real teaching, real improvement, real signs of being part of a defense that's going to be one of the best in the country.\n\nQ: Let's not be na\u00efve. Some of the reason was NIL.\n\nA: Yeah, that's part of it. Yeah. I think that's great for them. It certainly makes it easier.\n\nQ: What would your NIL value have been as a young stud at Cornell?\n\nA: How much was this cup of coffee at Starbucks?\n\nQ: There's so much excitement about this team, and so much pressure on this team as well. At Ohio State, you embrace the pressure as part of the gig. Does it feel different this year?\n\nA: No, it doesn't. I think when you come here, you expect to win every game. You are chasing perfection all the time. That's the way I've been my whole career, but at Ohio State there's the process, and then there's the expectation. The expectations are a little different. People ask me about the season and I say it'll be great as long as we don't lose a game or give up a point. Be careful what you wish for. As a young coach, you say, 'I want to climb. I want to be at the best.' Well, with that comes expectations.\n\nQ: Do you buy into the 'Natty or bust' thing?\n\nA: I don't. This is not a cliche. I think about, 'What am I doing today?' and 'How am I improving?' I'm always like looking down the road in terms of the season plan, but that's my job. My job is to get the defense ready every day and also to have a long-range plan for the season in the matchup games. But my job is not to really have an opinion on that.\n\nYou have the architect, coach Day. You have the people who judge or look at the house when it's built. That's you (media) guys or the fans. And then you have the actual builders. I'm just the builder. What's my section of the house? What do I have to build right now? You can judge it later.\n\nQ: I know you're not game-planning against Chip Kelly, because you're on the same team. But do you get a sense of his X's and O's and interpersonal acumen? What's kind of struck you about your counterpart on offense?\n\nA: He's just got a great demeanor. Obviously, the guy has succeeded at the highest level. He's got a confidence that's not arrogant. He loves his job. He's smart. I think in the run game right away (you could see), 'Oh, that's cool. Yeah, that's interesting.' I'm excited to work with him and see how the offense is going to be.\n\nQ: You both have that Northeastern sense of humor, right? Kind of a dry wit.\n\nA: We sit next to each other in staff meetings and throw some barbs back and forth.\n\nQ: I haven't asked you about Larry Johnson, who's still going strong into his 70s. What's it like coaching with him?\n\nA: Arguably the greatest defensive line coach in the history of college football. I think that's the truth. If you're around him, you don't know his age. He's a great coach, the best. He shows no signs of slowing down. He really doesn't. He's in great shape and we're lucky to have him.\n\nQ: Let's start to wrap this up. As this season gets ready to get going, do you feel like you've got everything in place?\n\nA: I never feel like I have everything in place. You've got the tools. I can remember at Duke - we had a lot of great future doctors and lawyers - but if you ever commented on a player, coach (David) Cutcliffe would say that a good carpenter doesn't complain about his tools. Now I have the best tools.\n\nLast year, I probably did less schematically than I've ever done because it was like, OK, this is what we need. This year we have to bring some of that back.\n\nGet more Ohio State football news by listening to our podcasts.", "source": {"uri": "lancastereaglegazette.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

C.J. has been developing for two years and has to be the guy this year along with Sonny, so we need to get those guys on the field and going. Then who's next at linebacker - Gabe Powers, Arvell Reese - already capable guys. And then the depth of safety. We've got Caleb Downs, who's a great player with a great football mind and football intelligence. And Lathan (Ransom) is back. Who's going to step up behind them? Malik Hartford, (Jayden) Bonsu, Keenan (Nelson Jr.) our transfer from South Carolina.

So when you get different things that happen or formations that happen in the course of the game, you can expect that those guys will be able to fix it on the field.\"\n\nGetting out of defenses that could be vulnerable to a certain offensive look is one thing, but Knowles' stated goal has always been to do more than that.\n\nHe wants to be an attacking defense, to take the fight to the offense rather than be forced to react all game.\n\nThat requires a certain balancing act, though, to avoid taking too many chances while also not dying by 1,000 cuts.\n\n\"Sometimes you reach those points where I don't want to be the one to mess them up,\" Knowles said. \"It's not about what I know or being creative. When we're going good, I think that's the balance. Let's just keep it going, but if you stay in anything too long or become predictable, it really doesn't matter who you're playing. They're going to take some kind of (advantage) like Missouri did running this guy all the way across the other hash if they really can predict what kind of coverage you're in.\n\n\"Even when things are going good, we still need to take some chances.\"", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Knowles_(American_football)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jim Knowles (American football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio_State_Buckeyes_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ohio State Buckeyes football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan_Wolverines_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Michigan Wolverines football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "College football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_coordinator", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Defensive coordinator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbus,_Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Columbus, Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Columbus, Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_goal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Field goal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cotton_Bowl_(stadium)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cotton Bowl (stadium)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_football_national_championships_in_NCAA_Division_I_FBS", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "College football national championships in NCAA Division I FBS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punt_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Punt (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missouri", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Missouri"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Missouri"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brady_Cook", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brady Cook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Craps", "label": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Craps", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Paper_and_Pencil/Tic-Tac-Toe", "label": "dmoz/Games/Paper and Pencil/Tic-Tac-Toe", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo-1200x1200.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9786826", "eventUri": "eng-9786826", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Columbus, Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-03", "textStart": 0, "textEnd": 6}], "sentiment": -0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 159, "relevance": 1}

Check out all of our \"Player to Watch\" articles to get ready for the season opener against Akron.\n\nGrowing up in Pickerington and being the son of a former Buckeye, Sonny Styles was on the radar of Ohio State fans for quite some time before committing to the school, choosing the Buckeyes over schools like Clemson, Florida, and Notre Dame. Not only was Styles a five-star football recruit in high school, but he was also an outstanding basketball player, leading to some dreaming of Styles playing for the Ohio State basketball team after football season ended.\n\nOriginally Styles was a part of Ohio State's 2023 recruiting class, but he reclassified and graduated after his junior season, allowing him to move into the 2022 recruiting class of the Buckeyes. Not only did Styles enroll in classes at Ohio State in June 2022, he played most of his freshman season as a 17-year-old since he didn't turn 18 until November. Styles appeared in 12 games as a freshman, recording nine tackles, with one of those stops being behind the line of scrimmage.\n\nHeading into the 2023 season, Styles was the nickel safety in Jim Knowles' defense but was forced to strong safety when starter Lathan Ransom was injured. While Styles finished with 53 tackles, including career-high games of seven tackles against Rutgers and Michigan, the writing has been on the wall for a while that the future for Styles is at linebacker because of his size. The move likely would have happened earlier but with Tommy Eichenberg and Steele Chambers at linebacker over the last few years, Knowles had to find any way he could to get Styles on the field because of his tremendous physical abilities.\n\nNow with Eichenberg and Chambers having graduated, this is the perfect time for Styles to move to linebacker ahead of his junior season. Returning starter Cody Simon is slated to occupy one of the linebacker spots in Knowles' 4-2-5 defense, while Styles and C.J. Hicks are \"neck-and-neck\" for the other starting spot according to Knowles. Styles does have a bit of an edge because he has been on the field a lot more in his career than Hicks, who has struggled to live up to the hype that surrounded him coming out of high school.\n\nStyles should be able to flourish at linebacker because he gets better the closer he gets to the line of scrimmage. At safety, Styles had a lot of responsibilities covering shifty slot receivers and downfield threats. Even though Styles did all he could to make sure they didn't get the ball when targeted, his size put him at a disadvantage against some of those quicker wide receivers. At linebacker, Styles will be covering more tight ends and running backs, which will provide him with better matchups. Plus, from all the time he spent at safety Styles has a better perspective of the defense.\n\nWhat will also be a huge benefit to Styles as he moves to linebacker is he has one of the best linebackers to ever wear the scarlet and gray coaching him. After spending last season as a graduate assistant on the coaching staff, James Laurinaitis was named Ohio State's linebackers coach during the offseason. Not only will the knowledge Laurinaitis has for playing linebacker be immeasurable for Styles' transition to the position, but the infectious energy and heart Laurinaitis played with, and now coaches with will drive Styles to reach his full potential and beyond.\n\nNow comes the question of which Styles will have the better career at Ohio State. Lorenzo Styles Sr. set the bar pretty high by being named first-team All-Big Ten in 1993 and 1994 before being selected in the third round of the 1995 NFL Draft following his junior season. Sonny Styles certainly has the tools to be even better than his father, and this season could be a breakout season for Sonny if he is able to adapt to life at linebacker quickly. Also on the roster is Lorenzo Styles Jr., who started his career at wide receiver at Notre Dame before transferring to Ohio State to play defensive back.\n\nOhio State really does have an embarrassment of riches at safety. Along with Ransom returning to Columbus with a sour taste in his mouth after he was injured last season, the Buckeyes were able to take advantage of Nick Saban's retirement by bringing in Alabama safety Caleb Downs, who was phenomenal as a freshman last season. The surplus of talent at the position moves Styles to a position that is actually a better fit for him. Even though there is a massive amount of returning talent throughout the defense, Styles could end up being the x-factor of the unit because of how good he can be. The rest of the Big Ten and college football should be on notice.", "source": {"uri": "landgrantholyland.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Land-Grant Holy Land"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Tuimoloau.\n\nAll three players are projected to be early-round draft picks in 2025 and almost certainly would have flown off the board fairly quickly had they entered the draft this past spring.\n\nTaking the Buckeyes' talent and experience into consideration, it's no surprise that many feel Ohio State will lay claim to one of the country's most dominant defenses this year, and defensive coordinator Jim Knowles can already see the potential brewing.\n\n\"There's no limits to how good we can be,\" Knowles said, via Bill Rabinowitz of The Columbus Dispatch. \"We can do anything. Last year in Year 2, we moved into what I would say would be considered a top-five defense. Not in all categories, but in a significant number of categories.

Football will always be our focus, but every day we'll cover news, notes and analysis from across Buckeyes sports. Join us each morning to get caught up on everything you missed in the world of Buckeyes football, recruiting, basketball and more in Scarlet Sunrise.\n\nOhio State ranked second nationally in scoring defense (11.2 points per game allowed). The Buckeyes were at the top of the country in passing yards per game allowed (145.9). They were second in pass defense efficiency (99.21) and fifth in the FBS in opponent third down conversion rate (28.57%). Ohio State also gave up the fewest plays of 40-plus yards from scrimmage in college football last season.\n\nThe Buckeyes were top five in several defensive categories in 2023. But they weren't in others, namely sacks per game (2.15, tied for 66th) and takeaways (11, tied for 124th).\n\nNow in his third year as defensive coordinator, Jim Knowles is striving for more. His first year, he was too aggressive. His second year, he was a bit too conservative. This year, he's trying to strike the balance because, in his words, \"being a Silver Bullet defense means being a top-five defense\" in all significant categories.\n\n\"The important point to get across to our guys is that, Vince Lombardi said it, 'We have to chase perfection.' We have to,\" Knowles said, referencing the legendary Green Bay Packers head coach.\n\n\"We have to chase perfection. It's impossible, but you catch excellence in the process. We can never be satisfied with just being good. I mean, we have the guys to really reach for perfection, and we just got to keep pushing for that. So seeing good things -- [like], seeing cover guys fit the right gaps -- and, now, we got to keep pushing them, we got to keep pushing them.\n\nKnowles reiterated: \"Just always chase to be best in the country.\"\n\nIt's hard to make the jump from great to elite. But it's the one Knowles is focused on this preseason.\n\nThe Buckeyes returned 11 draft-eligible and starter-level players this offseason, including most of its vaunted defense from last year. That's a luxury for Knowles, not only because of the talent that remained in the fold but also because of their familiarity with his system.\n\nKnowles agreed, in Year 3 of his scheme at Ohio State, he's basically teaching an \"upper-level course\" of his defense.\n\n\"Yes, it's definitely an upper-level course,\" he said. \"And I think there's just more confidence that guys are going to be able to make the adjustments themselves [on the fly on the field].\"\n\nFor the full story, head on over here.\n\nOhio State threw on the shoulder pads Saturday morning for the third practice of training camp, a long but productive session on the outdoor fields of the Woody Hayes Athletic Center.\n\nQuarterback Will Howard impressed, at one point rushing for an 80 yard touchdown. Fellow signal caller Devin Brown continued to flash his deep ball. And the Buckeyes' offensive line stacked another good day.\n\nLettermen Row was on site and filled out a notebook of observations.

Four practices into August, Howard looks to be much more comfortable in Ohio State's offense and seems to be closing in on securing the starting job.\n\nAfter splitting reps with Devin Brown, Julian Sayin and the rest of Ohio State's scholarship quarterbacks all spring, Howard has steadily seen his share of the first-team reps increase through Ohio State's first four practices, to the point where he took all but one rep behind the first-team offensive line during full-team 11-on-11 drills in Sunday's fourth practice.\n\nHoward has stood out compared to Ohio State's other quarterbacks with his pocket presence, making the correct reads and going through his progressions to find open receivers. He still hasn't looked spectacular as a deep passer - Brown and Sayin have outshined him in that regard - but he's been the most efficient quarterback on short and intermediate passes while also showing plenty of ability as a runner, highlighted by a long run up the left sideline in Saturday's third practice that might have been an 80-yard touchdown if it wasn't whistled dead.\n\nRyan Day said after Ohio State's first practice that he hoped a starting quarterback would emerge within the first week to 10 days of camp. If Howard can build off of his start to camp with a strong second week of practice, he could bring Ohio State's starting quarterback competition to an end.\n\nAlthough Sonny Styles started every game but one for Ohio State in 2023, he has to earn a starting job all over again after moving from safety to linebacker this offseason. Based on his usage and performance in Ohio State's first four practices of preseason camp, however, it's looking like Styles can be penciled in as the Buckeyes' likely starter at Will linebacker.\n\nWhile C.J. Hicks took many of the reps with the first-team defense at Will linebacker in the spring, Styles has seen the lion's share of first-team plays at that position thus far in camp. The converted safety has looked plenty comfortable in that role, putting himself in position to make plays often as a tackler and in coverage.\n\nHicks has seen some work with the top unit, too, and he hasn't looked out of place when he's been in. The expectation remains that Hicks will have a role in the defense this year even if he doesn't win the starting job, as Jim Knowles said Friday that he plans to use more three-linebacker packages this year to get them both on the field.\n\nKnowles described the competition between Styles and Hicks as \"neck-and-neck\" as of Friday, but the on-field action through the first four days of camp painted the picture that Styles is the frontrunner to fill out the Buckeyes' defensive starting eleven.\n\nIt's become clear through the first four days of camp that the right guard competition is a two-man race between Carson Hinzman and Tegra Tshabola, as they're the only linemen who have seen consistent first-team work at that position. It hasn't yet become clear whether there's a leader to start between them.\n\nTshabola took most of the first-team reps at right guard on Sunday, but Hinzman got the first look with the top offensive line at RG on Saturday. Hinzman has also been in the mix at center, where he started last season, though Seth McLaughlin looks like the heavy favorite to start there as he's taken the vast majority of first-team center reps during full-team 11-on-11 drills.\n\nLuke Montgomery, who looked like a potential frontrunner to start at right guard early in the spring, no longer appears to be a serious contender in the starting competition as he's worked primarily with the second-team offensive line - where he's taken many of his reps at center as the Buckeyes look to build his versatility to provide depth across the entire interior offensive line.\n\nForced to predict who the starting right guard will be after four days of camp, I'd lean slightly toward Tshabola, who has held his own nicely during one-on-ones and shown explosiveness and power as a run blocker. But Day said Thursday that consistency throughout the preseason would be key for Tshabola to earn a starting job, so the Buckeyes will likely allow this position battle to continue playing out for at least another week or two before picking one starter over another.\n\nThree of Ohio State's first four August practices have included punting periods, with the Buckeyes splitting reps evenly in all of them between new scholarship punter Nick McLarty, Buffalo transfer Anthony Venneri and returning walk-on Joe McGuire. As of yet, it's too early to call anyone a real frontrunner in that competition.\n\nMcLarty certainly stands out physically among the punters at 6-foot-7 and 255 pounds, and he noticeably has the strongest leg of the three. He's shown the potential to be an elite punter on his best punts, including a coffin-corner punt that traveled approximately 80 yards through the air during a warmup period in Friday's second practice and a pair of pooch punts downed at the 1-yard line in Sunday's fourth practice.\n\nThe problem for McLarty so far has been an issue he pointed out himself in an interview with Eleven Warriors in March. While his size allows him to generate the power to uncork long punts, it can also make his mishits \"very large,\" and he's had too many mishits during his first practices as a Buckeye that have resulted in shanks. So while it's clear he has the upside to be a field-flipping weapon for the Buckeyes, he hasn't yet shown he can be consistently reliable to avoid mistakes, which is the most important attribute for a punter.\n\nVenneri has looked the steadiest of the three punters in Ohio State's early practices, and that paired with his two years of experience as the starting punter at Buffalo would likely make him Ohio State's top punter if it had to play a game today.

Fans who paid $50 were allowed to watch.\n\nThe Buckeyes aren't yet wearing full guard and therefore aren't tackling, but certain trends are starting to emerge.\n\nHere are Sunday's observations:\n\nWill Howard be the favorite for the QB position for the Buckeyes?\n\nOhio State coach Ryan Day is unlikely to make any announcements, but it appears Kansas State transfer Will Howard is ahead of Devin Brown in the race for the starting quarterback position.\n\nHoward took the first few reps with the starters in 11-on-11 drills. He wasn't spectacular against the stingy OSU defense, but he avoided fouls. Howard completed a nice pass from the sideline to Carnell Tate and another to the sophomore center for about 20 yards, one of the longest completions of the day.\n\nMeanwhile, Brown's pass was intercepted by cornerback Calvin Simpson-Hunt and he was generally more inconsistent. Freshman Julian Sayin capped the day with a beautiful long touchdown pass to an open Brandon Inniss on one of the few defensive breakdowns of the day.\n\nMore:Q&A with Ohio State Football's Jim Knowles: 'There's no limit to how good we can be.'\n\nBut Sayin struggled, making five incomplete passes and a pick-six against Jermaine Mathews.\n\nAt this point, the pecking order appears to be Howard and Brown, with Lincoln Kienholz and Sayin battling for third. Freshman Air Noland is a clear fifth.\n\nMore:Finally reunited, Ryan Day and Chip Kelly hope for Ohio State football glory together\n\nUpdate attack line\n\nThe Buckeyes continue to mix and match at center and right guard, but some clarity is starting to emerge. Alabama transfer Seth McLaughlin got the bulk of the first-team reps at center. Tegra Tshabola got the first reps at right guard, but Carson Hinzman, who was the starting center last year, also got plenty of time with the starters.\n\nLuke Montgomery, who played primarily right guard in the spring, took snaps at center. He could be a swingman at either position.\n\nOhio State's JT Tuimolaou OK After Injury Scare\n\nThe Buckeyes have appeared unscathed by injuries so far in camp, but they suffered a scare when star defenseman JT Tuimoloau went down and lay low for several minutes during team drills. Medical personnel examined Tuimoloau's upper body.\n\nBut Tuimoloau eventually got up and jogged lightly to the sideline. He didn't play in team reps after that, but looked fine after training.\n\nLorenzo Styles Jr. practices\n\nStyles, now a cornerback after playing wide receiver at Notre Dame, saw his first action of camp in 7-on-7 drills. Defensive coordinator Jim Knowles said Friday that Styles was injured. Styles wore a green no-contact jersey Sunday.\n\nOther facts\n\nSonny Styles has made more first-team starts at linebacker, along with Cody Simon, than C.J. Hicks. Running back Quinshon Judkins had a nice stiff-arm on safety Jaylen McClain on a long run down the sideline. Defensive end Jack Sawyer had a two-hand-touch sack on Noland. Freshman wide receiver Jeremiah Smith continues to impress. He made a couple of leaping catches. Sophomore Carnell Tate also made a couple of nice catches. ,.. Cornerback Denzel Burke had a nice pass breakup on a slant from Brown to Kojo Antwi, as did Davison Igbinosun on a pass to Tate from Howard.\n\nListen to our podcasts for more Ohio State football

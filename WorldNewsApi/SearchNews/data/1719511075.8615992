{"id": 223730016, "title": "Dublin dump Galway out of Championship to set up Leinster final meeting with Kilkenny", "text": "Dublin booked their Leinster SHC final place and sent 14-man Galway packing from the championship in the process with a powerful display in Pearse Stadium this afternoon. Much of the game hinged on David Burke's dismissal in the 16th minute after a high challenge on Fergal Whitely but Miche\u00e1l Donoghue's Dubs were full value for the victory against his native county. Donal Burke (1-5 from play) and Chris Crummey (0-4) led the way for the Dubs while Galway were toothless at times with Henry Shefflin's reign in the west now coming into serious question after an early championship exit. in his third season in charge This game started in a blaze of glory with Gavin Lee firing over after just seven seconds and that set the tone for a frenetic half with Se\u00e1n Currie firing to the Galway net, at the second attempt, less than 30 seconds later. Conor Cooney had a goal chance at the other end soon after but blazed wide before Se\u00e1n Linnane and Fergal Whitely traded scores, 1-1 to 0-2. Galway took over for the next few minutes, though, with Cooney eventually finding his range as the Tribesmen fired over the next seven points and looked set to surge further clear with the breeze at their backs, 0-9 to 1-1. The game changed significantly, however, when Galway veteran Burke was shown a straight red card by referee Colm Lyons after a dangerous tackle on Whitely. Lyons quickly conferred with linesman Niall Malone before issuing the red and Galway were forced to play the remainder of the game with 14 men as Conor Donohoe slipped into the sweeper role to good effect. Dublin were level eight minutes later, 1-8 to 0-11, with Crummey having a big say on proceedings from his half-back berth while Donal Burke started to catch fire and was at his elusive best. Burke fired their second goal in the 32nd minute, after a brilliant pass by Dara Purcell, to level affairs again at 2-10 to 0-16 but it was the home side that closed out the half better to go in two ahead at the break, 0-19 to 2-11, after a crazy half of hurling. Dublin reeled off the first six points of the new half and threatened to pull away with Galway relying on frees from Evan Niland to keep them in touch against the breeze, 2-17 to 0-21. Crummey was having a massive say on the game and surged forward to fire over three-second half points as the Dubs opened up a five-point lead by the 55th minute, 2-20 to 0-21. Declan McLoughlin's 62nd minute goal gave Galway some hope but they could never get within touching distance as Darragh Power fired 0-3 off the bench to deservedly see Dublin home by six points. The Dubs will meet the five-in-a-row chasing Kilkenny in the Leinster decider in a fortnight's time at Croke Park.

The 35-year-old was looking for love in 2018 and became embroiled in drama with Wes Nelson and Megan Barton-Hanson. Laura has spoken about her time in the villa and said that the Hideaway, which was the domain of couples who wanted some special time together, was the place where sex was almost inevitable. Speaking to The Sun, Laura said \"a lot goes on\" away from the cameras and predicts that this will happen even more now that the Hideaway is open 24/7, there will be much more sex and with it, a lot more drama between couples. Laura said about her time on the ITV2 dating reality show: \"I think there always is sex, you just don't see it. I think there's definitely a lot that goes on.\" Laura continued: \u201cI've heard even recent islanders say there was a lot of it in their series but they just don't show it. I suspect we'll probably just see the fun flirty bits. I don't really want to see the sex anyway - I know it's on after 9, but there's a lot of young people that watch this!\u201d With more access to the Hideaway, Laura believes there is only one thing that is going to happen and that is \"carnage\". With the space traditionally the exclusive domain of committed couples and supposed to be romantic but now there will be confrontations and arguments as Islanders take each other into the space. Laura said: \"Before it was so exclusive and it was supposed to be romantic and just for couples. It literally just causes drama by watching two people go in there, almost like the terrace does, as everyone associates the terrace with having a kiss.\" While the former Love Islander admits that people could be going in there for an \"innocent chat\", it will more than likely be construed that they have gone in there for extra-curricular activity. Laura has also recently spoken about becoming a mother and revealed how her relationship with daughter Bonnie has developed and what has made her feel guilty. She said: \"People told me that if I had a wee girl she would become my best friend, and I sort of didn't believe them. It's 100% true though. My life revolves around Bonnie. The mum guilt from juggling work is tough though.\" Follow Mirror Celebs on TikTok , Snapchat , Instagram , Twitter , Facebook , YouTube and Threads .", "summary": "Former Love Island star Laura Anderson has said that the opening of the Hideaway 24/7 is going to see more sex and much more drama", "url": "https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/laura-anderson-reveals-what-viewers-32992855", "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article32992631.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_LAURA-MAIN.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 15:11:34", "author": "James Brinsford,James.brinsford", "authors": ["James Brinsford", "James.brinsford"], "language": "en", "catgory": "entertainment", "source_country": "GB", "sentiment": -0.007}

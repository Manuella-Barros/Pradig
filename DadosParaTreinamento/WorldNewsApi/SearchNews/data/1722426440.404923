{"id": 243352840, "title": "Major retailer axing loyalty scheme today and shoppers have hours left to spend rewards", "text": "The Works is scrapping its rewards scheme for good today - and shoppers only have a few hours to spend their loyalty vouchers. The high street retailer announced the move earlier this year and stopped shoppers from collecting points through its Together Rewards scheme, which was launched 10 years ago, from March 30. Before this date, Works shoppers could get five points for every \u00a31 spent at the retailer - with every point worth 1p in return. Shoppers could then turn their points into vouchers which they could spend in store. The minimum points you needed to make a voucher was 50 which gave you a 50p voucher. As well as earning points, Together Rewards members would also receive exclusive offers, gifts and bonus points during promotions. If you had vouchers, the Works set a later deadline for you to spend them with this deadline being today (Saturday, June 29). This means if you do not spend your Works vouchers by midnight tonight, then you will lose them forever. The Works has 525 stores nationwide and the opening and closing times do vary between its stores. You can find your local Works store on its store locator tool on its website. The retailer also has an online store and offers free next day delivery for orders over \u00a330 - with free click and collect for orders over \u00a310. In an email to customers at the time, the Work's chief executive officer Gavin Peck, said the decision to scrap the scheme came after \"careful consideration\". He said: \"This was not an easy decision and we understand this will be disappointing news to our customers that use the scheme, but we have done so in order to maintain fantastic value across our ranges.\u201d \"We remain committed to providing you with excellent value, which is why we are maintaining prices on hundreds of our key lines and will continue to offer great deals such as our 3 for \u00a36 on adult fiction books, 10 for \u00a310 on kid's picture books and 2 for \u00a312 & 3 for \u00a315 on toys, games, art and craft. As a valued customer I would like to thank you for your loyalty to The Works over the years. We will continue to provide you with a fantastic range of affordable products and offers - now and in the future.\u201d", "summary": "If you have loyalty scheme vouchers for the Works then you will need to spend them before midnight tonight, if you don't then you will lose them forever", "url": "https://www.mirror.co.uk/money/major-retailer-axing-loyalty-scheme-33103544", "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article32001151.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_rbp_mai111122cardiff8845JPG.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 06:18:25", "author": "Ruby Flanagan,Ruby-Flanagan", "authors": ["Ruby Flanagan", "Ruby-Flanagan"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": 0.039}
